Currently, many cities have released crime-related data as part of an open data initiative. Using this as input, we can apply analytics to be able to predict and hopefully prevent crime in the future. In this work, we applied big data analytics to the San Francisco crime dataset, as collected by the San Francisco Police Department and available through the Open Data initiative. The main focus is to perform an in-depth analysis of the major types of crimes that occurred in the city, observe the trend over the years, and determine how various attributes contribute to specific crimes. Furthermore, we leverage the results of the exploratory data analysis to inform the data preprocessing process, prior to training various machine learning models for crime type prediction. More specifically, the model predicts the type of crime that will occur in each district of the city. We observe that the provided dataset is highly imbalanced, thus metrics used in previous research focus mainly on the majority class, disregarding the performance of the classifiers in minority classes, and propose a methodology to improve this issue. The proposed model finds applications in resource allocation of law enforcement in a Smart City.",crime prediction model; predictive analytics; smart city; multiclass classification

Cyber-Phys. Syst.,acm,"The expansion of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) market is visible in homes, factories, public places, and smart cities. While the massive deployment of connected devices offers opportunities to improve quality of life and to develop new services, the impact of such devices on the security of the users in a context where the level of malicious threat continues to increase is a major concern. One of the challenges is the heterogeneity and constant evolution of wireless technologies and protocols used. To overcome this problem, we propose RIDS, a Radio Intrusion Detection System that is based on the monitoring and profiling of radio communications at the physical layer level using autoencoder neural networks. RIDS is independent of the wireless protocols and modulation technologies used. Besides, it is designed to provide a threefold diagnosis of the detected anomalies: temporal (start and end date of the detected anomaly), frequential (main frequency of the anomaly), and spatial (location of the origin of the anomaly). To demonstrate the relevance and the efficiency of our approach, we collected a large dataset of radio-communications recorded with three different probes deployed in an experimental room. Multiple real-world attacks involving a wide variety of communication technologies are also injected to assess the detection and diagnosis efficiency. The results demonstrate the efficiency of RIDS in detecting and diagnosing anomalies that occurred in the 400–500&nbsp;Mhz and 800–900&nbsp;Mhz frequency bands. It is noteworthy that compromised devices and attacks using these communication bands are generally not easily covered by traditional solutions.",IoT; software-defined radio; deep learning; wireless security; IDS

Recently, many deep neural network models have been proposed to make accurate prediction. However, manually designing neural networks requires amount of expert efforts and ST domain knowledge. How to automatically construct a general neural network for diverse spatio-temporal predication tasks in cities? In this paper, we study Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for spatio-temporal prediction and propose an efficient spatio-temporal neural architecture search method, entitled AutoST. To our best knowledge, the search space is an important human prior to the success of NAS in different applications while current NAS models concentrated on optimizing search strategy in the fixed search space. Thus, we design a novel search space tailored for ST-domain which consists of two categories of components: (i) optional convolution operations at each layer to automatically extract multi-range spatio-temporal dependencies; (ii) learnable skip connections among layers to dynamically fuse low- and high-level ST-features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-word spatio-temporal prediction tasks, including taxi flow and crowd flow, showing that the learned network architectures can significantly improve the performance of representative ST neural network models. Furthermore, our proposed efficient NAS approach searches 8-10x faster than state-of-the-art NAS approaches, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of AutoST.",neural architecture search; spatio-temporal prediction; AutoML

IoT sensors can monitor a wide range of environmental features such as the energy consumption inside a building at fine-grained level (e.g., for a specific wall-socket). Some smart buildings already deploy energy monitoring in order to optimize the energy use for good purposes (e.g., to save money, to reduce pollution). Unfortunately, such measurements raise a significant amount of privacy concerns.In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of recognizing the pair laptop-user (i.e., a user using her own laptop) from the energy traces produced by her laptop. We design MTPlug, a framework that achieves this goal relying on supervised machine learning techniques as pattern recognition in multivariate time series. We present a comprehensive implementation of this system and run a thorough set of experiments. In particular, we collected data by monitoring the energy consumption of two groups of laptop users, some office employees and some intruders, for a total of 27 people. We show that our system is able to build an energy profile for a laptop user with accuracy above 80%, in less than 3.5 hours of laptop usage.

However, their wired/wireless connections with the Internet make such platforms vulnerable to attacks compromising the embedded software. We find that in the prior works, the issue of regular runtime integrity assessment of the deployed software with negligible EdgeML performance degradation is still unresolved. In this paper, we present PracAttest, a practical runtime attestation framework for embedded devices running compute-heavy EdgeML applications. Unlike the conventional remote attestation schemes that check the entire software in each attestation event, PracAttest segments the software and randomizes the integrity check of these segments over short random attestation intervals. The segmentation coupled with the randomization leads to a novel performance-vs-security trade-off that can be tuned per the EdgeML application’s performance requirements. Additionally, we implement three realistic EdgeML benchmarks for pollution measurement, traffic intersection control, and face identification, using state-of-the-art neural network and computer vision algorithms. We specify and verify security properties for these benchmarks and evaluate the efficacy of PracAttest in attesting the verified software. PracAttest provides 50x-80x speedup over the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of mean attestation time, with negligible impact on application performance. We believe that the novel performance-vs-security trade-off facilitated by PracAttest will expedite the adoption of runtime attestation on edge platforms.",edge devices; Internet of things (IoT); attestation.; EdgeML; security; machine learning (ML)

This task is challenging because of many essential factors, such as cooperation among neighboring intersections and dynamic traffic scenarios. First, to facilitate the cooperation of traffic signals, existing work adopts graph neural networks to incorporate the temporal and spatial influences of the surrounding intersections into the target intersection, where spatial-temporal information is used separately. However, one drawback of these methods is that the spatial-temporal correlations are not adequately exploited to obtain a better control scheme. Second, in a dynamic traffic environment, the historical state of the intersection is also critical for predicting future signal switching. Previous work mainly solves this problem using the current intersection's state, neglecting the fact that traffic flow is continuously changing both spatially and temporally and does not handle the historical state.In this paper, we propose a novel neural network framework named DynSTGAT, which integrates dynamic historical state into a new spatial-temporal graph attention network to address the above two problems. More specifically, our DynSTGAT model employs a novel multi-head graph attention mechanism, which aims to adequately exploit the joint relations of spatial-temporal information. Then, to efficiently utilize the historical state information of the intersection, we design a sequence model with the temporal convolutional network (TCN) to capture the historical information and further merge it with the spatial information to improve its performance. Extensive experiments conducted in the multi-intersection scenario on synthetic data and real-world data confirm that our method can achieve superior performance in travel time and throughput against the state-of-the-art methods.",

Using an operations research based market clearing mechanism and attention based time series forecaster as sub-modules, we build a holistic interactive system. Through this system, we discover better bidding strategies for a market participant using reinforcement learning (RL). We relax several assumptions made in existing literature in order to make the problem setting more relevant to real life. Our Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation enables us to tackle action space explosion and also compute optimal actions across time-steps in parallel. Our RL framework is generic enough to be used by either a generator or a consumer participating in the electricity market.We study the efficacy of the proposed RL based bidding framework from the perspective of a generator as well as a buyer on real world day-ahead electricity market data obtained from the European Power Exchange (EPEX). We compare the performance of our RL based bidding framework against three baselines: (a) an ideal but un-realizable bidding strategy; (b) a realizable approximate version of the ideal strategy; and (c) historical performance as found from the logs. Under both perspectives, we find that our RL based framework is more closer to the ideal strategy than other baselines. Further, the RL based framework improves the average daily revenue of the generator by nearly €7,200 (€2.64 M per year) and €9,000 (€3.28 M per year) over the realizable ideal and historical strategies respectively. When used on behalf of a buyer, it reduces average daily procurement cost by nearly €2,700 (€0.97 M per year) and €57,200 (€52.63 M per year) over the realizable ideal and historical strategies respectively.

Rapid urbanization, increasing electrification, the integration of renewable energy resources, and the potential shift towards electric vehicles create new challenges for the planning and control of energy systems in smart cities. Energy storage resources can help better align peaks of renewable energy generation with peaks of electricity consumption and flatten the curve of electricity demand. Model-based controllers, such as MPC, require developing models of the systems controlled, which is often not cost-effective or scalable. Model-free controllers, such as RL, have the potential to provide good control policies cost-effectively and leverage the use of historical data for training. However, it is unclear how RL algorithms can control a multitude of energy systems in a scalable coordinated way. In this paper, we introduce MARLISA, a controller that combines multi-agent RL with our proposed iterative sequential action selection algorithm for load shaping in urban energy systems. This approach uses a reward function with individual and collective goals, and the agents predict their own future electricity consumption and share this information with each other following a leader-follower schema. The RL agents are tested in four groups of nine simulated buildings, with each group located in a different climate. The buildings have diverse load and domestic hot water profiles, PV panels, thermal storage devices, heat pumps, and electric heaters. The agents are evaluated on the average of five normalized metrics: annual net electric consumption, 1 -- load factor, average daily peak demand, annual peak demand, and ramping. MARLISA achieves superior results over multiple independent/uncooperative RL agents using the same reward function. Our results outperformed a manually optimized rule-based controller (RBC) benchmark by reducing the average daily peak load by 15%, ramping by 35%, and increasing the load factor by 10%. A multi-year case study on real weather data shows that MARLISA significantly outperforms the RBC in within a year and converges in less than 2 years. Combining MARLISA and the RBC for the first year improves overall initial performance by learning from the RBC rather than random exploration.",demand response; Reinforcement learning; microgrid; multi-agent coordination

Internet Technol.,acm,"As a key use case of Industry 4.0 and the Smart City, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) provides an efficient way for city managers to regulate the traffic flow, improve the commuting performance, reduce the transportation facility cost, alleviate the traffic jam, and so on. In fact, the significant development of Internet of Vehicles has boosted the emergence of a variety of Industry 4.0 applications, e.g., smart logistics, intelligent transforation, and autonomous driving. The prerequisite of deploying these applications is the design of efficient data dissemination schemes by which the interactive information could be effectively exchanged. However, in Internet of Vehicles, an efficient data scheme should adapt to the high node movement and frequent network changing. To achieve the objective, the ability to predict short-term traffic is crucial for making optimal policy in advance. In this article, we propose a novel data dissemination scheme by exploring short-term traffic prediction for Industry 4.0 applications enabled in Internet of Vehicles. First, we present a three-tier network architecture with the aim to simply network management and reduce communication overheads. To capture dynamic network changing, a deep learning network is employed by the controller in this architecture to predict short-term traffic with the availability of enormous traffic data. Based on the traffic prediction, each road segment can be assigned a weight through the built two-dimensional delay model, enabling the controller to make routing decisions in advance. With the global weight information, the controller leverages the ant colony optimization algorithm to find the optimal routing path with minimum delay.

This paper proposes an automatic and intelligent bus stop recognition system built on computer vision techniques, deployed on a low-cost single-board computing platform with minimal human supervision. The on-device recognition engine aims to extract the features of a bus stop and its surrounding environment, which eliminates the need for a conventional Global Positioning System (GPS) look-up, thereby alleviating network latency and accuracy issues. The dataset proposed in this paper consists of images of 11 different bus stops taken at different locations in Chennai, India during day and night. The core engine consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) of size ~260 kB that is computationally lightweight for training and inference. In order to automatically scale and adapt to the dynamic landscape of bus stops over time, incremental learning (model updation) techniques were explored on-device from real-time incoming data points. Real-time incoming streams of images are unlabeled, hence suitable ground truthing strategies (like Active Learning), should help establish labels on-the-fly. Light-weight Bayesian Active Learning strategies using Bayesian Neural Networks using dropout (capable of representing model uncertainties) enable selection of the most informative images to query from an oracle. Intelligent rendering of the inference module by iteratively looking for better images on either sides of the bus stop environment propels the system towards human-like behavior.

We use Flow, a library for deep reinforcement learning in microsimulators, to train two policies, (1) a policy with noise injected into the state and action space and (2) a policy without any injected noise. In simulation, the autonomous vehicles learn an emergent metering behavior for both policies which allows smooth merging. We then directly transfer this policy without any tuning to the University of Delaware's Scaled Smart City (UDSSC), a 1:25 scale testbed for connected and automated vehicles. We characterize the performance of the transferred policy based on how thoroughly the ramp metering behavior is captured in UDSSC. We show that the noise-free policy results in severe slowdowns and only, occasionally, it exhibits acceptable metering behavior. On the other hand, the noise-injected policy consistently performs an acceptable metering behavior, implying that the noise eventually aids with the zero-shot policy transfer. Finally, the transferred, noise-injected policy leads to a 5% reduction of average travel time and a reduction of 22% in maximum travel time in the UDSSC.

One approach is to engineer “self-aware” sensors that can proactively change their component composition in response to changes in work load when critical devices fail. By extension, these devices could anticipate their own termination, such as battery depletion, and offload current tasks onto connected devices. These neighboring devices can then reconfigure themselves to process these tasks, thus avoiding catastrophic network failure. In this article, we compare and contrast two types of self-aware sensors. One set uses Q-learning to develop a policy that guides device reaction to various environmental stimuli, whereas the others use a set of shallow neural networks to select an appropriate reaction. The novelty lies in the use of field programmable gate arrays embedded on the sensors that take into account internal system state, configuration, and learned state-action pairs, which guide device decisions to meet system demands.

Traditional approaches of user authentication either require specialized device installation or inconvenient wearable sensor attachment.

Particularly, we extract representative features from channel state information (CSI) measurements of WiFi signals, and develop a deep-learning-based user authentication scheme to accurately identify each individual user. To mitigate the signal distortion caused by surrounding people’s movements, our deep learning model exploits a CNN-based architecture that constructively combines features from multiple receiving antennas and derives more reliable feature abstractions. Furthermore, a transfer-learning-based mechanism is developed to reduce the training cost for new users and environments.

Their constant monitoring and maintenance is thus essential. Traditional monitoring mechanisms are heavy-weight, and hence have insufficient coverage. In this paper, we explore the use of crowd-sourced intelligent measurements from commuters' smart-phone sensors. Specifically, we propose a deep-learning based approach to road surface quality monitoring, using accelerometer and GPS sensor readings. Through extensive data collection of over 36 hours on different kinds of roads, and subsequent evaluation based on this, we show that the approach can achieve high accuracy (98.5%) in a three-way classification of road surface quality. We also show how the classification can be extended to a finer grained 11-point scale of road quality. The model is also efficient: it can be implemented on today's smart-phones, thus making it practical. Our approach, called RoadCare, enables several useful smart-city applications such as spatio-temporal monitoring of the city's roads, early warning of bad road conditions, as well as choosing the ""smoothest"" road route to a destination.",

Traditional approaches of user authentication either require specialized device installation or inconvenient wearable sensor attachment. This paper supports the extended concept of user authentication with a device-free approach by leveraging the prevalent WiFi signals made available by IoT devices, such as smart refrigerator, smart TV and thermostat, etc. The proposed system utilizes the WiFi signals to capture unique human physiological and behavioral characteristics inherited from their daily activities, including both walking and stationary ones. Particularly, we extract representative features from channel state information (CSI) measurements of WiFi signals, and develop a deep learning based user authentication scheme to accurately identify each individual user. Extensive experiments in two typical indoor environments, a university office and an apartment, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed authentication system.

Lacking transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation providers publish anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the first large-scale measurement of the disparate impact of price discrimination algorithms used by ridehailing applications.The application of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature combines the city-level effects of AI bias on fare pricing from census tract attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey. An analysis of 100 million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from ridehailing utilization patterns associated with demographic attributes. Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations, higher poverty levels, younger residents, and high education levels are significantly associated with higher fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32, -0.28, 0.69, and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively.

Because base stations (BSes) consume more than 70% of overall cellular network infrastructure energy, saving the power consumption of BSes is the key task to build a green cellular network. Except for low power design of the BS hardware and software, the traffic-driven BS sleeping operation is an economical way to improve existing cellular networks, which can reduce the BS power consumption at low traffic load. However, prior BS sleeping strategies establish on the static temporal characteristics of traffic load, which ignore the fact that network traffic is influenced by many factors such as time, human mobility, holiday, weather, etc. Hence, prior traffic estimation is coarse, and the BS sleeping strategies cannot apply to the changing network traffic. In this paper, we exploit a machine learning method to estimate the BS traffic and propose a BS sleeping strategy based on predicted traffic for power saving in the cellular network. We analyze network traffic in multi-views: temporal influence, spatial influence, and event influence. Then, we propose a multi-view ensemble learning model to predict network traffic load, which learns the traffic in multi-views and combine the results with ensemble. Furthermore, we formulate a BS sleeping strategy based on the predicted traffic load. Finally, we evaluate our traffic prediction algorithm on real cellular network data.

The ESC is however more difficult than other sounds because there are too many parameters that generate background noise in the ESC, which makes the sound more difficult to model and classify. The main aim of this study is therefore to develop more robust convolution neural networks architecture (CNN). For this purpose, 150 different CNN-based models were designed by changing the number of layers and values of their tuning parameters used in the layers. In order to test the accuracy of the models, the Urbansound8k environmental sound database was used. The sounds in this data set were first converted into an image format of 32x32x3. The proposed CNN model has yielded an accuracy of as much as 82.5% being higher than its classical counterpart. As there was not that much fine-tuning, the obtained accuracy has been found to be better and satisfactory compared to other studies on the Urbansound8k when both accuracy and computational complexity are considered.

In general, the devices or sensors used in the IoT have very limited computational power, storage capacity, and communication capabilities, but they help to collect a large amount of data as well as maintain communication with the other devices in the network. Since most of the IoT devices have no physical security, and often are open to everyone via radio communication and via the internet, they are highly vulnerable to existing and emerging novel security attacks. Further, the IoT devices are usually integrated with the corporate networks; in this case, the impact of attacks will be much more significant than operating in isolation. Due to the constraints of the IoT devices, and the nature of their operation, existing security mechanisms are less effective for countering the attacks that are specific to the IoT-based systems. This article presents a new insider attack, named loophole attack, that exploits the vulnerabilities present in a widely used IPv6 routing protocol in IoT-based systems, called RPL (Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks). To protect the IoT system from this insider attack, a machine learning based security mechanism is presented. The proposed attack has been implemented using a Contiki IoT operating system that runs on the Cooja simulator, and the impacts of the attack are analyzed. Evaluation on the collected network traffic data demonstrates that the machine learning based approaches, along with the proposed features, help to accurately detect the insider attack from the network traffic data.",RPL security; insider attack; RPL; IoT; Contiki; machine learning

However, most of the existing studies not only ignore the constraint of the limited computing resources available at isolated intersections but also the matching degree between the signal timing and the traffic demand, leading to high complexity and reduced learning efficiency. In this article, we propose a traffic signal control method based on reinforcement learning with state reduction. First, a reinforcement learning model is established based on historical traffic flow data, and we propose a dual-objective reward function that can reduce vehicle delay and improve the matching degree between signal time allocation and traffic demand, allowing the agent to learn the optimal signal timing strategy quickly. Second, the state and action spaces of the model are preliminarily reduced by selecting a proper control phase combination; then, the state space is further reduced by eliminating rare or nonexistent states based on the historical traffic flow. Finally, a simplified Q-table is generated and used to optimize the complexity of the control algorithm. The results of simulation experiments show that our proposed control algorithm effectively improves the capacity of isolated intersections while reducing the time and space costs of the signal control algorithm.",Traffic signal control; Q-learning

Such systems use data gathered from smartphone sensors or crowd-sourcing to pinpoint the location of the barriers as well as the facilities, such as crosswalks with traffic signals or access ramps to curbs. Though the previous works have identified the type of surface and incline to be important features to determine accessibility, no extensive empirical research exists on how these parameters affect navigation. In order to address this problem, we propose to build a novel system called WheelShare, which uses machine learning to classify surfaces into accessible or otherwise and uses that knowledge to generate accessible routes for wheelchair users. We have trained our system with accelerometer and gyroscope data obtained from 26 different surfaces found frequently in indoor and outdoor environments across Europe and USA. More data is collected by the system through crowd-sourcing based contribution from interested users. Our evaluation shows that WheelShare can achieve an accuracy of up to 96% in identifying surfaces in one of the 5 different accessibility classes. Overall, WheelShare is a novel, scalable and data-centric approach to objectively identify the accessible features of a surface and can generate end-to-end routes for wheelchair users using frequently updated crowd-sourced information.",smart cities; machine learning; accessible routing; accessibility

Deploying deep-learning-based intelligence near the end-user enhances privacy protection, responsiveness, and reliability. Resource-constrained end-devices must be carefully managed in order to meet the latency and energy requirements of computationally-intensive deep learning services. Collaborative end-edge-cloud computing for deep learning provides a range of performance and efficiency that can address application requirements through computation offloading. The decision to offload computation is a communication-computation co-optimization problem that varies with both system parameters (e.g., network condition) and workload characteristics (e.g., inputs). On the other hand, deep learning model optimization provides another source of tradeoff between latency and model accuracy. An end-to-end decision-making solution that considers such computation-communication problem is required to synergistically find the optimal offloading policy and model for deep learning services. To this end, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based computation offloading solution that learns optimal offloading policy considering deep learning model selection techniques to minimize response time while providing sufficient accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for edge devices in an end-edge-cloud system and evaluate with a real-setup implementation using multiple AWS and ARM core configurations.

The results show that REBEB, a new backoff algorithm, is similar to the binary exponential backoff algorithm in terms of throughput performance. REBEB focuses more on fairness, which is up to 0.985, and to a certain extent, its security is significantly improved. The fairness of REBEB algorithm is more than 0.4 in different nodes and competing windows, and the fairness of the system is better when the number of nodes is small.

It has been described as too technology-led and business-oriented, diminishing citizens' agency and causing digital divides. As the agenda keeps spreading, there is an urgent need to develop more participatory, inclusive and bottom-up approaches to balance interests of those currently in strong power positions, such as large corporations. Participatory design (PD) and participatory approaches in general have been suggested as a remedy, but they often tend to be local, small-scale and short-term. Therefore, their impacts are often modest as well. We suggest that we need to start thinking about ways to create scalable approaches that would grow the temporal and spatial impact of actions and practices that intend to increase citizens' understanding and control over new technologies, i.e. their technological agency. Without making sure that more people have adequate knowledge and sufficient control and mastery of technologies, societal discussion and ultimately, political decisions, are left to few experts.

This will give raise to the city management problems like traffic congestion, parking queues, capacity planning and continuous depreciation in energy. Hence there is a need to understand the upcoming issues and find an efficient way to resolve them by resource planning.The evolution of city to Smart City demand information and communications technology (ICT) to gather data. The data is collected based on city infrastructure and conduct of people in the city. This big data is analyzed to make knowledgeable decisions to give quality of life to the citizens. It is referred as the evolution of intelligent city to the next generation city of information technology. ICT provides real time processing of data to gather useful information. Based on this information visual applications can be developed to have a more farsighted view of the Smart City. Online banking, online shopping and remote video communication are some of the applications of Smart City.As one of the concepts to improve city structure and its facilities, Smart City is vital in city management and development and uses information and communication technology (ICT) for city evolution and fast growth. These cities are planned to enhance more business and industrial growth thus increasing in economic development and raising living standard of the inhabitants [1]. It offers various facilities to the city like better transportation in the city, more job opportunities, less travelling time, healthy environment, better healthcare, less crime etc.Smart City is a concept which works with sensors and data analytics to enhance the standard and quality of life in the cities. Smart City deals with the challenges like traffic, parking, capacity planning, energy etc. and resolves them to provide better city facilities to their citizens [2]. ICT is becoming widespread in the cities and is being used as a tool to deal with Smart City application domains. Smart City is using big data to generate intelligent information systems which support decision making capabilities. With effective data sources and data analytics tool we can design high end services for the citizens in urban cities. Big data has changed the way we store data and process the data efficiently. Now this crucial data is not only used to get the historic trends information but also used to predict the future. It is significant in planning the future of the cities. Data is analyzed to develop action plans from the predicted results.In this paper, various datasets for traffic management and parking garage management have been tested and evaluated by using data analytics techniques in order to find a pattern in a historical information.

The large volume of complex traffic and the uncertainty of market supplies/demands have made it essential for many MOD service providers to proactively dispatch vehicles towards ride-seekers. To meet this need effectively, we propose STRide, an MOD coordination-learning mechanism reinforced spatio-temporally with capsules. We formalize the adaptive coordination of vehicles into a reinforcement learning framework. STRide incorporates spatial and temporal distributions of supplies (vehicles) and demands (ride requests), customers' preferences and other external factors. A novel spatio-temporal capsule neural network is designed to predict the provider's rewards based on MOD network states, vehicles and their dispatch actions. This way, the MOD platform adapts itself to the supply-demand dynamics with the best potential rewards. We have conducted extensive data analytics and experimental evaluation with three large-scale datasets (~ 21 million rides from Uber, Yellow Taxis and Didi). STRide is shown to outperform state-of-the-arts, substantially reducing request-rejection rate and passenger waiting time, and also increasing the service provider's profits, often making 30% improvement over state-of-the-arts.",capsule network; ride-sharing platform; smart city.; smart transportation coordination; Mobility-on-demand; reinforcement learning

Unlike the traditional license plate recognition technology applied to smart parking lots to identify a single license plate in a single lane, license plate recognition applied to intersection monitors must detect multiple license plates on multiple lanes. In addition, license plate recognition applied to intersection monitors faces many challenges, including too small license plates in the picture, unstable light sources, different shooting angles, blurred license plate characters in moving vehicles, and complex road conditions, advertising signs, traffic signs and road name indicator. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new two-stage methodology based on deep learning technology which first detects all the license plates in a picture and extracts the license plate images, and then performs character recognition on the license plate images using Convolutional Neural Networks. Through the two-stage approach, this method increases the proportion of characters in the picture, which in turn improves the character recognition accuracy. Experimental results show that the methodology achieves 98.23% of license plate detection rate and 97.38% of character recognition rate.

Therefore, towards securing smart cities from reply attacks, intrusion detection systems and frameworks based on deep learning have been proposed in the recent literature. However, the absence of the time dimension of these proposals is a major limitation. Therefore, we have developed a deep learning-based model for replay attack detection in smart cities.

To effectively sustain, manage and protect smart cities from failures due to energy overload, the awareness of energy consumption by deep learning computation is unavoidably necessary. Most recent research in smart cities focuses on using deep learning to perform certain tasks but does not address energy issues. This paper presents a formal approach to estimating energy consumption of deep learning and illustrates its use in smart cities. In particular, we develop a fine-grained mathematical model that extends an existing model to include the quantification of MAC (multiply-and-accumulate) operations as well as data access from a memory hierarchy. This paper focuses on deep and convolutional neural networks. We describe the proposed approach and validate the results obtained from our model by comparing them against those of existing work. The proposed approach is applied to three (deep) neural systems in smart cities, namely smart drainage, smart transportation and smart parking systems, all of which yield promising results.",Deep learning;Energy consumption;Smart cities;Scientific computing;Lighting;Real-time systems;Smart transportation;energy consumption;deep learning;smart city

The widespread installation of closed-circuit television cameras and continuously generated video streams are a strategic data source that can contribute toward safety and sustainability through efficient surveillance of smart city assets and resources. Recent advances in deep learning methods are able to detect and localize salient objects in a video stream. However, a number of practical issues remain unaddressed, such as suboptimality, latency, predictive accuracy, and most importantly the contextualization of all detected salient objects for informed decisions that aligns with ethical surveillance. In this article, we propose a Generative Latent Space (GenLS) approach that overcomes these challenges, specifically in road surveillance. We demonstrate an adaptation of this approach for a prominent use-case in road surveillance, License Plate Detection. GenLS was evaluated for accuracy, robustness, computational cost, and cogency, using a state-of-the-art benchmark dataset on road traffic.

Simulation-based experiments indicate that the alteration detection accuracy matches those recorded in advanced methods with superior performance in terms of detecting central rotation alteration to fingerprints. This makes the proposed system a veritable solution for different biometric authentication applications in secure smart cities.",Biometrics (access control);Feature extraction;Authentication;Iris recognition;Fingerprint recognition;Smart cities;Veins;Deep learning;cyber threats;biometric alteration detection;cybersecurity;5G network;smart city;authentication

We implemented two methods in this research in order to classify the soil quality, namely; Curve fitting and Pattern classification. Curve-fitting method use the approach of representing an attempt for the neural network to identify and approximate an arbitrary input-output relation and once the relation has been modeled the necessary accuracy by the network, it can be used for a variety of tasks, such as series prediction, function approximation, and function optimization. Curve-fitting method has the objective of selection parameter values which minimizes the total error over the set of data points being considered, hence, the reason for its implementation in this research. Pattern classification involves building a function that maps the input feature space to an output space of two or more classes or more. The goal of pattern classification is to assign input patterns to one of a finite number of classes.

AVs are envisaged to evolve to a service rather than a product in the future. To provide best user experience of such services, three primary factors, namely, waiting time, travel time, and supply of AV services, are taken into consideration in a multiobjective optimization. Conventional optimization of services relies on traffic flow analysis over a queuing network model. However, due to the mobility of vehicles and the transfer uncertainty of road networks, the queuing network analysis is too complicated and practically intractable. For accuracy and convenient processing, network calculus (NC) is extended to model the queueing problem in this paper. The optimal number of available AVs can be identified by guaranteeing the waiting time of customers. The satisfaction of AV services can be viewed as a supply and demand problem, and optimized by bipartite graph matching. In order to reduce the average travel time, especially for rush hours with heavy traffic, we further propose a new online AVs fleet management scheme with congestion control for smart cities. It is shown that the intelligent management of AV fleet can be efficiently achieved, outperforming the cases of traditional vehicles.

This system makes drivers to find parking spots easier than before. Nevertheless, there is a controversy over quality and quantity of availability information. Because of update interval and network delay, provided information is different from the real-time status (quality issues).

Therefore, this article proposes two novel approaches to control arterial traffic coordination with the help of artificial intelligence: DDPG-BAND and ES-BAND. DDPG-BAND has two stages: a coarse-tuning stage reduces the blocking coefficient, and a fine-tuning stage optimizes the traffic evaluation index. ES-BAND introduces the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES), a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning, into signal timing. Different traffic variables are adopted as parameters to search for the optimal value by the CMA-ES.

Recently, with the rapid development in urbanization, massive video surveillance data are produced at an unprecedented speed. A traditional solution to deal with the big data would require a large amount of computing and storage resources. With the advances in Internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and communication technologies, edge computing offers a new solution to the problem by processing all or part of the data locally at the edge of a surveillance system. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using edge computing for smart parking surveillance tasks, specifically, parking occupancy detection using the real-time video feed. The system processing pipeline is carefully designed with the consideration of flexibility, online surveillance, data transmission, detection accuracy, and system reliability. It enables artificial intelligence at the edge by implementing an enhanced single shot multibox detector (SSD). A few more algorithms are developed either locally at the edge of the system or on the centralized data server targeting optimal system efficiency and accuracy. Thorough field tests were conducted in the Angle Lake parking garage for three months. The experimental results are promising that the final detection method achieves over 95% accuracy in real-world scenarios with high efficiency and reliability.

The rapid advances in artificial intelligence can empower UAVs with autonomous capabilities allowing them to learn from their surrounding environment and act accordingly without human intervention.

The framework enables UAVs to autonomously determine their schedules to cover the maximum of pre-scheduled events spatially and temporally distributed in a given geographical area and over a pre-determined time horizon. The designed framework has the ability to update the planned schedules in case of unexpected emergency events. The UAVs are trained using the Q-learning (QL) algorithm to find effective scheduling plan. A customized reward function is developed to consider several constraints especially the limited battery capacity of the flying units, the time windows of events, and the delays caused by the UAV navigation between events. Numerical simulations show the behavior of the autonomous UAVs for various scenarios and corroborate the ability of QL to handle complex vehicle routing problems with several constraints.

By employing effective air pollution monitoring systems, the pollution could be closely monitored, but this is not enough to make a significant impact in decreasing the pollution.

The model learns the attention factors, allowing it to learn the optimal amount that previous timesteps affect the current prediction. Using this approach we could better learn the patterns and dependencies in the data and in turn build better prediction models.

One of the key challenges, however, is the strain on power grid infrastructure that comes with large-scale EV deployment. The solution to this lies in utilization of smart scheduling algorithms to manage the growing public charging demand. Using data-driven tools and machine learning algorithms to learn the EV charging behavior can improve scheduling algorithms. Researchers have focused on using historical charging data for predictions of behavior such as departure time and energy needs. However, variables such as weather, traffic, and nearby events, which have been neglected to a large extent, can perhaps add meaningful representations, and provide better predictions. Therefore, in this paper we propose the usage of historical charging data in conjunction with weather, traffic, and events data to predict EV session duration and energy consumption using popular machine learning algorithms including random forest, SVM, XGBoost and deep neural networks. The best predictive performance is achieved by an ensemble learning model, with SMAPE scores of 9.9% and 11.6% for session duration and energy consumptions, respectively, which improves upon the existing works in the literature.

One of the smart city solutions is to establish an efficient fleet management relating to the use of a fleet of vehicles (e.g., ambulances and police vehicles). The most basic function in a fleet management system is the real time vehicle tracking component. This component is usually the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) or the integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). To predict the position, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is generally applied using the sensor's measures and the GPS position as a helper. However, the DGPS high cost solution still suffers from GPS satellite signals loss due to multipath errors and the INS require more complex computing. Furthermore, the EKF performance depends on the vehicle dynamic variations and may quickly diverge because of environment changes (i.e, GPS failures by obstructions from building and trees). In this paper, we present a robust low cost approach using EKF and neural networks (NN) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reliably estimate the real time vehicle position using GPS enhanced with low cost Dead Reckoning (DR) sensors. While GPS signals are available, we train the NN with GA on different dynamics and outage times to learn the position errors so we can correct the future EKF predictions during GPS signal outages.

With the limited bandwidth of mobile networks, understanding the user perception of the quality (i.e., Quality of Experience or QoE) of video streaming services is thus paramount for content providers and content-delivery network providers to flexibly configure network bandwidth, video servers, routing devices, and other network resources to save energy in smart cities. Although various video QoE assessment approaches have been proposed using different key performance indicators (KPIs), they all essentially relate to a common parameter: bitrate. However, because YouTube has adopted hyper text transfer protocol over secure socket layer (HTTPS) as its adaptive video streaming method to better protect user privacy and network security, bitrate can no longer be obtained from encrypted video traffic via typical deep packet inspection. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a machine-learning-based bitrate estimation (MBE) approach to parse bitrate information from IP packet level measurements. First, we filter HTTPS YouTube traffic based on the previously established video server IP according to the data packet googlevideo field. Then, we identify the transmission mode according to the traffic characteristics of several previous packets. Next, we identify the bitrates and resolutions of HTTP Live Streaming and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP modes according to the characteristics of video chunks. Finally, for evaluating the effectiveness of MBE, we have chosen the video Mean Opinion Score (vMOS) proposed by a leading telecom vendor as the QoE assessment framework, and have conducted comprehensive experiments to study the impact of bitrate estimation accuracy on its KPIs for the HTTPS YouTube video streaming service. Experimental results show that MBE is a feasible and highly effective QoE evaluation approach to flexibly configure network resources in smart cities.",Streaming media;Quality of experience;YouTube;Bit rate;Cryptography;Adaptive systems;Smart cities;Hyper text transfer protocol over secure socket layer (HTTPS) YouTube;QoE assessment;adaptive streaming;machine learning;smart city

Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data. This article also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.",Smart cities;Big Data;Hidden Markov models;Cloud computing;Data mining;Learning (artificial intelligence);Analytical models

In this study, a deep learning and cloud-based new mobile smart parking application was developed to minimize the problem of searching for parking spaces. Within the application, a service has been developed based on deep learning with Long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the parking space.

Although training CNNs for radar-image classification is challenging due to poor generalization performance caused by the lack of labeled training data, the modified architecture takes into account the properties of the radar image in order to introduce prior information into the model and improve performance. A MIMO-FMCW radar is utilized to render a slant-range image of a parking scenario, and the image patches corresponding to each parking location are classified independently in the CNN. Since the radiation pattern of a MIMO array varies as a function of the scanning angle, the corresponding spatial coordinate of each patch is included as an additional feature in the upper layers of the network. This allows the model to combine local features from each patch with global scenario information in order to learn robust features that generalize properly to new scenarios. Several models are trained end to end with data from four different parking scenarios and evaluated in a 4-fold cross-validation scheme, and performance is improved when spatial prior information is included.",Radar imaging;Feature extraction;Sensors;Data models;Monitoring;Machine learning;Convolutional neural networks;MIMO radar;parking monitoring;smart cities

Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams.

We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem.

Specifically, we develop a system that comprises multiple machine learning (ML) based classifiers built by us using three classification methods -- Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes Multinomial (NBM)- and five preprocessing and feature extraction methods. The system is built to allow its execution in cloud, fog or edge layers, and is evaluated using 15 datasets built by 4 widely-used public SMS datasets. The system detects spam SMSs and gives recommendations on the spam filters and classifiers to be used based on user preferences including classification accuracy, True Negatives (TN), and computational resource requirements.",Feature extraction;Machine learning;Servers;Mobile handsets;Edge computing;Support vector machines;Training;smart cities;SMS spam;classifiers;machine learning;fog computing;edge computing;cloud computing

The impact of COVID-19 has been fallen on almost all sectors of development. The healthcare system is going through a crisis. Many precautionary measures have been taken to reduce the spread of this disease where wearing a mask is one of them. In this paper, we propose a system that restrict the growth of COVID-19 by finding out people who are not wearing any facial mask in a smart city network where all the public places are monitored with Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras. While a person without a mask is detected, the corresponding authority is informed through the city network. A deep learning architecture is trained on a dataset that consists of images of people with and without masks collected from various sources. The trained architecture achieved 98.7% accuracy on distinguishing people with and without a facial mask for previously unseen test data. It is hoped that our study would be a useful tool to reduce the spread of this communicable disease for many countries in the world.",Smart cities;Training;Faces;Machine learning;Testing;Cameras;Facial Mask Detection;COVID-19;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Network;Smart City

Key information is then synthesized in the cloud from them to create a real-time city-wide traffic palette. Real-time or offline processing both at the edge and the cloud will then be leveraged to optimize intersection operations, manage network traffic, identify near-collisions between various units of traffic, provide street parking information, and a host of other applications. Additional information such as weather and environment will also be leveraged. The use of edge-based real-time machine learning (ML) techniques and videostream processing has several significant advantages. (1) Because there is no need to store copious amounts of video (few minutes typically suffice for edge-based processing), it automatically addresses concerns of public agencies who do not want person-identifiable information to be stored for reasons of citizen privacy and legality. (2) The processing of the video stream at the edge will allow for the use of low bandwidth communication using wireline and wireless networks to a central system such as a cloud, resulting in a compressed and holistic picture of the entire city.

The former approach is used to control traffic congestion for a smaller congested area and latter one provides the solution for the whole city. Both the approaches utilize real-time traffic data, generated from a vehicular traffic simulator, to solve the congestion problem in real-time. The ETLC approach identifies the most congested area through K-Means clustering and applies fuzzy logic for congestion removal. The GTLC approach identifies multiple congested areas using an occupancy threshold and reduces congestion. Our model is flexible to run each approach individually or integrate both the approaches to run sequentially. Comparison of the two approaches shows that the ETLC approach works better than GTLC approach for small areas. However, GTLC gives good results in peak congestions spanning larger areas.",smart city; big data; smart traffic; Spark; TraCI; ETLC; GTLC; Hybrid; machine learning; cluster; intersection

Several applications in these systems, such as energy management through home appliance identification or activity recognition, adopt Machine Learning (ML) as a practical tool for extracting useful knowledge from raw data. These applications are usually characterized by a sequential stream of data, unlike the classical ML scenario in which the entire data is available during training. For such applications, Stream-based Active Learning (SAL) has been designed as a type of supervised ML in which an expert is asked to label the most informative instances as they arrive. Previous SAL techniques assume that the expert is always available and always labels the data correctly. However, in several applications, such as those mentioned above, the SAL activity interweaves with the everyday life of regular residents, who are often not experts, and may also not always be willing to participate in the labeling process. In this paper, we discuss the importance of user-centered ML, and show how taking into account realistic models of user behavior significantly improves the accuracy and reduces the training period of smart environment applications based on SAL.

Second, for crime prediction, Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is exploited in each dense crime region to predict the number of crime incidents in the future with spatial and temporal information. The proposed HDBSCAN and SARIMA based crime prediction model is evaluated on ten years of crime data (2008-2017) for New York City (NYC). The accuracy of the model is measured by considering different time scenarios such as the year-wise, (i.e., for each year), and for the total considered duration of ten years using an 80:20 ratio.

This is a scientifically challenging proposition, as it requires new methods to fuse objective (heterogeneous) data (e.g. people location trails and sensors data) with subjective (perceptual) data (e.g. the citizens’ quality of experience collected through feedback forms). When it comes to vast urban areas, collecting statistically significant data is a daunting task; thus new data-collection methods are required too. In this work, we turn to artificial intelligence (AI) to address these challenges, introducing a method whereby the objective, sensor data is analyzed in real-time to scope down the test matrix of the subjective questionnaires. In turn, subjective responses are parsed through AI models to extract further objective information. The outcome is an interactive data analysis framework for urban environments, which we put to test in the context of a citizens’ well-being project. In our pilot study, each new entry (objective or subjective) is parsed through the AI engine to determine which action maximizes the information gain. This translates into a particular question being fired at a specific moment and place, to a specific person. With our AI data collection method, we can reach statistical significance much faster, achieving (in our city-wide pilot study) a 41% acceleration factor and a 75% reduction in intrusiveness.

We believe RL is an ideal approach since this task falls under the control-optimization problem where RL has yielded optimal results in previous work. The magnitude and scale of a DH system complexity incurs the curse of dimensionalities and model, hereby making RL a good choice since it provides a solution for the problem. To assist RL even further with the curse of dimensionalities, we intend to investigate the use of SL to reduce the state space. To achieve this, we shall use historical data to generate a heat load sub-model for each home. We believe using the output of these sub-models as feedback to the RL algorithm could significantly reduce the complexity of the learning task. Also, it could reduce convergence time for the RL algorithm. The desired goal is to achieve a realtime application, which takes operational actions when it receives new direct feedback.

Although earlier works have improved a variety of predictive models of air pollution, the ability to accurately predict air pollution indices remains elusive. Time series prediction plays an important role in many fields. Some predecessors have experimented with artificial neural networks (NNs), combining linear autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models with nonlinear NN models. The typical assumption is that time series has a long signal with no white noise. However, a real-time short signal with white noise is common. The methods in the literature also do not guarantee that the prediction error of an NN model is minimized. Therefore, we propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to predict future PM2.5 values. First, we use the Q-learning algorithm in RL based on its state characteristics on the NN model. Second, we select the input with different input dimensions and values of time delay, calculate the best strategy, and evaluate the computational complexity of our RL algorithm.

To meet this need effectively, we propose STRide, an MOD coordination learning mechanism reinforced spatio-temporally with capsules. We formalize the adaptive coordination of vehicles into a reinforcement learning framework. STRide incorporates spatial and temporal distributions of supplies (vehicles) and demands (ride requests), customers’ preferences and other external factors. A novel spatio-temporal capsule neural network is designed to predict the provider’s rewards based on MOD network states, vehicles and their dispatch actions. This way, the MOD platform adapts itself to the supply-demand dynamics with the best potential rewards. We have conducted extensive data analytics and experimental evaluation with five large-scale datasets ($\sim$∼27 million rides from Uber, NYC/Chicago Taxis, Didi and Car2Go).

Since an important component of smart cities is developing an efficient urban mobility system, the authors have developed a method which helps in detection of areas prone to waterlogging and prediction of severity of waterlogging in these areas in the future. The areas susceptible to waterlogging are detected with the help of elevation of the area and the past travel time data. Elevation of an area is an indicator of the level or height of an area, so the low-lying areas are more prone to accumulation of water when it rains. Similarly, the past travel time data of an area also serves as a measure to find out the intensity of water logging as the larger the accumulation of water in an area, the more is the travel time. The past data pertaining to waterlogging severity in an area with respect to parameters such as the amount of rainfall and day of the week is used to train a neural network, which is then used to predict the possibility of waterlogging and its intensity in that area in the future.",Roads;Rain;Smart cities;Neural networks;Correlation;Traffic congestion;Smart Cities; Urban Transport; Waterlogging; Waterlogging Severity Prediction; Neural Networks

In that vein, a visibility range estimation algorithm for real-time adaptive speed limits control in intelligent transportation systems is proposed in this paper. The information required to specify the speed limit is captured via a road side unit that collects environmental data and captures road images, which are then analyzed locally or on the cloud. The proposed analysis is performed using two image processing algorithms, namely, the improved dark channel prior (DCP) and weighted image entropy (WIE), and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to produce a visibility indicator in real-time. Results obtained from the analysis of various parts of highways in Canada, provided by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, show that the proposed technique can generate credible visibility indicators to motorists.

The external factors and internal factors influencing the heat load in substations are parameters used as our model's input. Short-term forecast models are generated using four supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Regression Tree, Feed Forwards Neural Network (FFNN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Performance comparison among these ML methods was carried out. The effects of combining the internal and external factors influencing heat load at substations was studied. The models are evaluated with varying horizon up to 24-hours ahead.

At the center of many cities plans to address sustainability issues, are plans for urban canopy development (i.e. increases the number of trees in cities). In this paper, we propose an approach to educate residents about the environmental and socio-economic benefits of trees in urban settings and incentivize tree growth in cities. In addition to environmental benefits, trees have been shown to have many significant socio-economic benefits (e.g. real estate values, pedestrian traffic, motor traffic, and many other aspects of urban life) [1], [2], [3]. Our approach can also be leveraged to encourage resident participation in city tree development programs, such as Free Tree Programs [4]. By quantifying and displaying tree environmental and economic benefits at the selected locations on an interactive map, citizens and policymakers can determine the best locations to plant trees in the city. The system aggregates data from the distributed city sensors to model tree benefits and provide an overall score which quantifies the benefit of planting a tree(s) at a given location(s). The system models tree benefits by taking historical data from the pedestrian, environmental, and traffic sensors to predict the potential impacts (e.g. carbon reduction, evapotranspiration, average pedestrian traffic, and average vehicular traffic, property values, ) of a tree(s) at a given location(s) [1], [2], [3], [5]. By using the system, citizens learn about the positive effects of having trees in their neighborhood and policy makers may also better conduct city planning and develop urban policies/strategies to maximize the impact of trees in their communities.

In particular, the system consists of Wi-SUN beacons, Wi-SUN base-stations and vehicular devices. A beacon, attached to the one to be positioned, broadcasts wireless signal periodically so that its location can be estimated using machine learning algorithms from the RSSIs measured at multiple base-stations that are densely deployed over a city to construct an ad hoc network.

Various approaches on the subject have been proposed in recent years, but the methods and outcomes are in their infancy.

Wellbeing solutions within this sector are moving towards identifying how the needs of people in vulnerable situations can be improved or monitored by means of existing supply networks and public institutions. Therefore, the focus of this research is towards wellbeing monitoring solution, through the analysis of gas smart meter data. Gas smart meters replace the traditional analogue electro-mechanical and diaphragm-based meters that required regular reading. They have received widespread popularity over the last 10 years. This is primarily due to the fact that by using this technology, customers are able to adapt their consumption behaviours based on real-time information provided by In-Home Devices. Yet, the granular nature of the datasets generated has also meant that this technology is ideal for further scalable wellbeing monitoring applications. For example, the autonomous detection of households at risk of energy poverty is possible and of growing importance in order to face up to the impacts of fuel poverty, quality of life and wellbeing of low-income housing. However, despite their popularity (smart meters), the analysis of gas smart meter data has been neglected. In this paper, an ensemble model is proposed to achieve autonomous detection, supported by four key measures from gas usage patterns, consisting of i) a tariff detection, ii) a temporally-aware tariff detection, iii) a routine consumption detection and iv) an age-group detection. Using a cloud-based machine learning platform, the proposed approach yielded promising classification results of up to 84.1% Area Under Curve (AUC), when the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was utilised.",Smart meters;Tariffs;Monitoring;Smart cities;Data models;Meters;Fuels;Energy and fuel poverty;gas;machine learning;smart meter;smart cities;wellbeing

Such a classifier estimates crowd levels in a metro-station (and metro trains in an indirect sense), thereby adding towards the vision of efficient metro travel. However, building such a classification-model is challenging due to non-trivial decision boundaries among the classes of interest. Our experiments revealed that the best accuracy that a traditional multi-class classifier could obtain was 0.58, for a four-class classifier.

Various factors, such as daily commuting patterns or topographical conditions, can lead to an unbalanced state where the numbers of rented and returned bicycles differ significantly among the stations. This can cause spatial imbalance of the bicycle inventory which becomes critical when stations run completely empty or full, and thus prevent users from renting or returning bicycles. To prevent such service disruptions, we propose to forecast user demand in terms of expected number of bicycle rentals and returns and accordingly to estimate number of bicycles that need to be manually redistributed among the stations by maintenance vehicles. As opposed to traditional solutions to this problem, which rely on short-term demand forecasts, we aim to maximise the time within which the stations remain balanced by forecasting user demand multiple steps ahead of time. We propose a multi-input multi-output deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory networks to forecast user demand over long future horizons.

In this article, we aim at sensing the commercial spaces in cities. In order to achieve this ultimate goal, deep learning is applied to process the raw data of Street View image. We disassemble the goal into three tasks: firstly, obtaining all the Street View images in a specific area; then classifying the Street View images according to the commercial facilities in it; and finally creating a visualization of the detected data into a map. For the first task, we get the road network coordinate information from the openstreetmap (OSM) website, set the sampling point on the road, and then download the Street View images of the sampling points' coordinate through the API provided by Baidumap. For the second task, we adopt a two-level learning strategy rather than directly using Deep Convolutional Neural Network for classification. For the final task, we choose the heat map as the expression of the results and draw the map by the existing GIS software.

For urban dwellers, few things are more irritating than anxiously searching for a parking space. Research results show that as much as 30% of traffic is caused by drivers driving around looking for parking spaces in congested city areas. There has been considerable activity among researchers to develop smart technologies that can help drivers find a parking spot with greater ease, not only reducing traffic congestion but also the subsequent air pollution. Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device. Through the intelligent algorithm, we can significantly reduce the cost of existing systems, while achieving a more adaptable solution. For example, our system can automatically detect when a car enters the parking space, the location of the parking spot, and precisely charge the parking fee and associate this with the license plate number.",Cameras;Licenses;Sensors;Laser radar;Automobiles;Feature extraction;Databases;Deep learning;edge devices;smart cities;smart parking

Therefore, we propose in this paper an efficient framework for improving the security of CC-IoT based ITSs. The proposed framework allows extracting particular vehicle information without revealing any sensitive information. Towards this goal, a convolutional neural network is used to classify encrypted images, based on the vehicle type in real-time, obtained by cameras integrated into road-side units that are part of an ITS leaving sensitive information in all images hidden. Within the proposed framework, we develop a new image classification architecture that never fully decrypts the captured images, thus protecting drivers' personal information, such as location, license plate, and vehicle contents. In addition, the system does not require a fully decrypted image, which increases the system computational efficiency as compared to conventional systems. The obtained results show that the proposed partial decryption classification technique presents up to 18% reduction in average computational complexity when compared with a fully decrypted system.",Encryption;Intelligent transportation systems;Cloud computing;Classification algorithms;Image segmentation;Convolutional neural network;encryption;intelligent transportation systems;Internet of Things;machine learning;security;smart city

As thermal comfort is determined by multiple comfort factors, a fine-grained architecture is proposed, where an exclusive model is trained for each factor and accordingly the corresponding thermal comfort can be evaluated. The experimental results show that the proposed fine-grained DNN outperforms its coarse-grained counterpart by 3.5× and is 1.7×, 2.5×, 2.4×, and 1.9× more accurate compared to four popular machine learning algorithms.

In addition to polluting the environment, TWV easily causes injury to sanitation workers responsible for cleaning roads by passing vehicles. However, manual inspection is still the commonest way to recognize such uncivilized behavior in videos with very high time and labor-consuming. In answer to these challenges, we design a novel 20-layer residual network (Nov-ResNet-20) for training the vehicle-thrown-waste identification model (VTWIM). Then, incorporating Nov-ResNet-20, Selective Search, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), we propose the deep-residual-network-leveraged vehicle-thrown-waste identification method (DRN-VTWI). Our method first splits one video frame into several regions matching suspected objects marked with location boxes via Selective Search. Then, in terms of the VTWIM trained by Nov-ResNet-20 our method identifies the regions containing TWV. Last, our method removes the redundant location boxes for each recognized, vehicle-thrown waste and only keeps the best one. The significance of our work is four-fold: 1) Nov-ResNet-20 has a moderate depth: 6 convolutional layers, 7 residual layers, and in total 20 weight layers. Due to the joint contribution of the residual, batch normalization, dropout, and cross-entropy loss, it is eligible to identify TWV using a small quantity of manually-annotated training samples. 2) Selective Search diversely marks all possible, suspected objects in video frames, whereas NMS keeps the best location box for each recognized vehicle-thrown waste, removing all redundancies. In this way, DRN-VTWI finds potential violations of TWV as many as possible and optimally annotates vehicle-thrown wastes in frames as well. 3) Combining the power of Nov-ResNet-20, Selective Search, and NMS, DRN-VTWI well solves the challenging, intelligent identification of vehicle-thrown wastes for real-time traffic surveillance.

Thus, establishing a land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) prediction and simulation model is of great significance for understanding the process of urban change and assessing its ecological impact. In previous studies, LUCC prediction models have been mainly based on cellular automata structures that calculate a future state pixel by pixel through transition rules. Because these transition rules are usually based on the global state and each pixel is calculated according to these fixed rules, the results of these methods have room for improvement in terms of generating details and heterogeneity.

Because smart cities could involve thousands of autonomous systems operating in concert in densely populated areas, safety assurances are required. Challenges abound to consistently manage the safety of such autonomous systems due to their disparate developers, manufacturers, operators and users. A novel network and a sample of associated network functions for autonomous systems is proposed that aims to provide a baseline of safety for autonomous systems in a smart city ecosystem. A proposed network called the Assured Autonomous Cyber-Physical Ecosystem (AACE) would be separate from the Internet, and enforces certain functions that enable safety through active networking. Each smart city could dictate the functions for their own AACE, providing a means for enforcing safety policies across disparate autonomous systems operating in the city's jurisdiction. Such a network design sits at the margins of the end-to-end principle, which is warranted considering the safety of autonomous systems is at stake as is argued in this paper.

The broad reliance upon IoT in smart cities significantly increases the attack surface of the already large, complex, and heterogeneous smart city system by making each and every IoT device and its communications a potential entry point into the system. Our proposed framework utilizes Black Network protocols and key management to secure the most vulnerable, and typically unsecured, IoT communications. The framework utilizes a hierarchical, distributed architecture with pooled resources to prevent single points of failure and to sandbox attack impacts. This hierarchy allows AI enabled management tools to be placed both near the IoT edge using localized data and in the Big Data collections.

These contributions and effects are seen from many different angles, not from a single angle. At the same time, these effects support both each other and development at the same time. It can be said that smart cities and intelligent city systems can help to evolve in many different ways. Smart cities will be able to plan and reduce current consumption with the regulation of old systems, electricity consumption forecasting, instant monitoring, smart meters and intelligent lighting systems. Besides, planned reconstruction, ecological buildings, safe and uninterrupted energy can provide prosperity. In this way, the cities become more economical, safe, livable and comfortable and at the same time they can contribute to development. In general, the economic development of intelligent cities is in the forefront. In fact, most of the intelligent urban planning work on Earth has been made because of economic concerns, and therefore the intelligent city system has been introduced. As a result of these passages, good results have been obtained from the examples. When old systems are organized and intelligent, electricity costs will decrease, instant follow-up will be possible and the user will be able to pre-purchase the required energy with electricity consumption estimation. At the same time, these systems can also facilitate management. Planned construction will result in a more modern city image that will reduce excavation, infrastructure work and similar costs.

Active management will be enabled by processing large amounts of real-time data, by machine learning to deliver timely insights and by large-scale simulation to create effective interventions. To realise active management of Smart Cities requires processing systems that can take in data at large volume and variety, and perform complex processing on these data, all in real-time. Digital twins are used to create a continuous, consistent view of the current state of the city, and simulation of the evolution of digitals twins is used to detect problems arising in the near future and to optimise the impact of interventions.

On the one hand, the convolution neural network is utilized to extract deep and abstract features for initial images. On the other hand, the CML-based techniques are employed to reduce dimensions for extracted features and construct a strong classifier that output recognition results. A real dataset about pathologic myopia is selected to establish simulative scenario, in order to assess the proposed recognition framework.

Data will have to be collected and processed in order to extract knowledge out of it, to feed users' and smart city applications. A typical approach to process such big amounts of data is to i) gather all the collected data on the cloud through wireless pervasive networks, and ii) perform data analysis operations exploiting machine learning techniques. However, according to many studies, this centralised cloud-based approach may not be sustainable from a networking point of view. The joint effect of data-intensive users' multimedia applications and smart cities monitoring and control applications may result in severe network congestions making applications hardly usable. To cope with this problem, in this paper we propose a distributed machine learning approach that does not require to move data in a centralised cloud platform, but processes it directly where it is collected. Specifically, we exploit Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL) to build a distributed machine learning framework. In our framework we train a series of partial models, each ''residing'' in a location where a subset of the dataset is generated. We then refine the partial models by exchanging them between locations, thus obtaining a unique complete model. Using an activity classification task on a reference dataset as a concrete example, we show that the classification accuracy of the HTL model is comparable with that of a model built out of the complete dataset, but the cost in term of network overhead is dramatically reduced. We then perform a sensitiveness analysis to characterise how the overhead depends on key parameters. It is also worth noticing that the HTL approach is suitable for applications dealing with privacy sensitive data, as data can stay where they are generated, and do not need to be transferred to third parties, i.e., to a cloud provider, to extract knowledge out of it.",Training;Data mining;Smart cities;Data models;Support vector machines;Cloud computing;Mobile communication

The existing proposals in the literature fail to observe the hidden patterns in the load profile of these users.

The consumption data from smart homes (SHs) is gathered and taken as an input to the deep learning model, convolution neural network (CNN). The CNN model learns the hidden patterns in the data and outputs different load curves. These load curves are then used to train a support vector regression (SVR) model, which predicts the overall load consumption of all SHs in the smart city. This prediction is then compared with the power generation from the grid and consequently the demand response (DR) of the connected SHs is managed so as to minimize the gap between predicted demand and supply.

Predicting the energy to be obtained from waste and planning the energy supply accordingly depend on estimating the amount of waste and knowing its content. However, energy prediction from solid waste suffers from weak forecasting models, which lead to misguided management strategies in smart cities. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies like low-power, wide-area networking protocol (LoRaWAN) offer new opportunities to collect, monitor, and analyze data in smart cities, including waste management. In this study, we propose the LoRaWAN-aided Waste-to-Energy Concept Model to build the waste-to-energy prediction model with the provided smart city use case using LoRa network as an underlying data collection step. Consequently, we benefit from the pre-trained Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) model whose process details are provided in our previous study, to predict municipal solid waste using daily data along with other relevant variables such as temperature.",Temperature sensors;Waste materials;Solid modeling;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Data collection;Waste-To-Energy;Smart City;Waste Management;MSW

In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), the fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.",Network slicing;Smart cities;Cloud computing;Resource management;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Deep reinforcement learning (DRL);edge computing;fog RAN;intelligent vehicular systems;network slicing

Thanks to them, we can now analyse data and obtain unimaginable solutions to today’s problems. Nevertheless, our success is not entirely based on algorithms, it also comes from our ability to follow our “gut” when choosing the best combination of algorithms for an intelligent artefact. It’s about approaching engineering with a lot of knowledge and tact. This involves the use of both connectionist and symbolic systems, and of having a full understanding of the algorithms used. Moreover, to address today’s problems we must work with both historical and real-time data. We must fully comprehend the problem, its time evolution, as well as the relevance and implications of each piece of data, etc. It is also important to consider development time, costs and the ability to create systems that will interact with their environment, will connect with the objects that surround them and will manage the data they obtain in a reliable manner. In this keynote, the evolution of intelligent computer systems will be examined. The need for human capital will be emphasised, as well as the need to follow one’s “gut instinct” in problem-solving.

The multiobjective supply chain configuration (MOSCC) in SCM is to set the optimal configurations for supply chain members to minimize both the cost of goods sold (CoGS) and the lead time (LT). Although some algorithms have been proposed for the MOSCC, they do not make the best use of the problem-related knowledge and cannot perform well on the large scale instances with many members and configuration options. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-population ant colony system with knowledge-based local searches (MPACS-KLS). Firstly, the multiobjective algorithm is based on the multiple populations for multiple objectives framework. Two ant colonies are used to separately minimize CoGS and LT, which helps to search in the bi-objective space sufficiently. Secondly, with the considerations of the problem-related knowledge, a priority-based solution construction method, a rank-based heuristic strategy, and an objective-oriented global pheromone updating strategy are proposed. Thirdly, to speed up the convergence, especially for large scale MOSCC instances, two knowledge-based local searches are designed to minimize CoGS and LT of solutions respectively. Exhaustive experiments are conducted on both the instances from the real life and the randomly generated instances with different problem scales. The results show that MPACS-KLS is superior to the contestant algorithms, especially on the large scale MOSCC instances, which significantly extends the AI and optimization techniques in practical applications of smart city.",Supply chains;Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Search problems;Knowledge based systems;Smart cities;Multiobjective optimization;multiple populations for multiple objectives;supply chain configuration;ant colony system;knowledge-based local searches;smart city.

However, they only consider a single metric such as distance, time, or other costs, while ignoring a critical criterion: safety. In a smart city, people may prefer to find a safe walking route to avoid the potential crime risk as well as obtain a short distance. This problem can be specified as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). Many methods were proposed in the past to solve the multi-objective route planning, the multi-objective evolutionary approach (MOEA) is considered as the most popular one. However, MOEA is non-optimized when used in a large-scale road network and becomes computationally expensive when handling a large population size. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective hyper-heuristic (MOHH) framework for walking route planning in a smart city. In the search framework, we design a set of low level heuristics to generate new routes. Moreover, we adopt reinforcement learning mechanism to select good low-level heuristics to accelerate searching speed.

Motivated by the above, in this paper, we introduce UAVs cell-free network for providing coverage to vehicles entering a highway that is not covered by other infrastructure. However, UAVs have limited energy resources and cannot serve the entire highway all the time. Furthermore, the deployed UAVs have insufficient knowledge about the environment (e.g., the vehicles' instantaneous location).

Also, experts should use highly accurate models to predict these factors such as weather prediction Therefore, when they are combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Neural Networks (NN), they will be more efficient. However, in the smart grids of future Smart Sustainable Cities (SSCs) that the gathered big data has enormous amount, the classical AI, and ANN models will inefficient.

Research on deep learning algorithms has become a hot direction in computer vision. Deep learning techniques have been widely used in face recognition, intelligent transport system, smart city, etc. At present, smart unmanned vending machines (UVMs) are of one of the representative carriers of unmanned retail business models. Compared with traditional vending machines, they have greatly improved user experience and saved implementation costs. One core issue of smart UVMs is how to quickly and accurately identify which and what kind of items a user is taking. In this paper, deep learning is used to solve the problem of object recognition in smart UVMs. To accurately obtain the information of products that a user may take from a UVM, an object detection-based method is used. Specifically, an object detection model, namely DrtNet, is proposed and designed under the smart UVM scenario. The backbone network of DrtNet adopts deformable convolution and group normalization layers. The used loss function contains focal loss function and balance Ll loss function, which can largely improve the recall rate of beverage detection. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the deep learning model to smart UVMs.",Object detection;Containers;Deep learning;Feature extraction;Convolution;Training;Object recognition

Short-term electric load forecasting for individual residential customers plays a progressively crucial role in the operation and planning of future grids. Compared to the aggregated electrical load at the community level, the prediction of individual household electric loads is legitimately challenging because of the high uncertainty and volatility involved. Results from previous studies show that prediction using machine learning and deep learning models is far from accurate, and there is still room for improvement. We herein propose a deep learning framework based on a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model uses CNN layers for feature extraction from the input data with LSTM layers for sequence learning. The performance of our developed framework is comprehensively compared to state-of-the-art systems currently in use for short-term individual household electric load forecasting. The proposed model achieved significantly better results compared to other competing techniques. We evaluated our proposed model with the recently explored LSTM-based deep learning model on a publicly available electrical load data of individual household customers from the Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) project. We obtained an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 40.38% for individual household electric load forecasts in comparison with the LSTM-based model that obtained an average MAPE of 44.06%. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed model on different time horizons (up to 3 h ahead). Compared to the recently developed LSTM-based model tested on the same dataset, we obtained 4.01%, 4.76%, and 5.98% improvement for one, two, and six look-forward time steps, respectively (with 2 lookback time steps). Additionally, we have performed clustering analysis based on the power consumption behavior of the energy users, which indicate that prediction accuracy could be improved by grouping and training the representative model using large amount of data. The results indicated that the proposed model outperforms the LSTM-based model for both 1 h ahead and 3 h ahead in forecasting individual household electric loads.",Load modeling;Predictive models;Load forecasting;Forecasting;Machine learning;Data models;Energy consumption;CNN;deep learning framework;energy consumption;energy consumption forecasting;individual household;LSTM

This is particularly true for Hamburg, a Hanseatic city in the north of Germany. Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap.

Through collaborative content sharing, the storage limitation of a single edge server (ES) can be broken. However, when mobile users need to download the whole content through multiple regions, independently deciding the caching content for ESs in different regions may result in redundant caching. Furthermore, frequent switching of communication connection during user movement also causes retransmission delay. As a revolutionary approach in the artificial intelligence field, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has earned great success in solving high-dimensional and network resource management related problems. Therefore, we integrate collaborative caching and DRL to build an intelligent edge caching framework, so as to realize collaborative caching between cloud and ESs. In this caching framework, a fed-erated-machine-learning-based user behavior prediction model is first designed to characterize the content preference and movement trajectory of mobile users. Next, to achieve efficient resource aggregation of ESs, a user-behavior-aware dynamic collaborative caching domain (DCCD) construction and management mechanism is devised to divide ESs into clusters, select cluster heads, and set the re-clustering rules. Then a DRL-based content caching and delivery algorithm is presented to decide the caching content of ESs in a DCCD from a global perspective and plan the transmission path for users, which reduces redundant content and transmission delay. Especially when a user request cannot be satisfied by the current DCCD, a cross-domain content delivery strategy is presented to allow ESs in other DCCDs to provide and forward content to the user, avoiding the traffic pressure and delay caused by requesting services from cloud. The simulation results show that the proposed collaborative caching framework can improve user satisfaction in terms of content hit rate and service delay.",Smart cities;Simulation;Web and internet services;Collaboration;Reinforcement learning;Switches;Predictive models

Smart transportation is one of the subsystems in a Smart city which consist of roads, vehicles, intersections, roadside units, traffic control systems, and so on. Many of these components needs to be connected to provide a smooth safe traffic in a smart city. The performance of these components largely depends on the computational latency of algorithms running on local or central processors. Hence, providing an optimized solution to minimize this delay is much needed. In this work, we propose a way to properly manage the flow of self-driving vehicle traffic at road junctions, taking into account pedestrian traffic. Self-driving vehicles are able to communicate with each other and smart devices along the road. However, surveillance cameras are needed to observe pedestrians” traffic at the intersection. Therefore, we use cameras, smart sensors, processors, and communication equipment embedded in self-driving vehicles and roadside smart devices to collect data, process it, and generate proper instructions to manage self-driving vehicles traffic flow at intersections. In this research we have used Simulation of Urban Mobility software to simulate traffic behaviors resulting from the use of the proposed solution. Although the simulation shows a smooth flow of traffic in a simple junction, a deep reinforcement learning approach is then proposed to manage traffic flow in multiple lane junctions.

UAV-assisted vehicular networking research typically adopts throughput and latency as the main performance metrics. These conventional metrics, however, are not adequate to reflect the freshness of the information, an attribute that has been recently identified as a critical requirement to enable services such as autonomous driving and accident prevention. In this paper, we consider a UAV-assisted single-hop vehicular network, wherein sensors (e.g., LiDARs and cameras) on vehicles generate time sensitive data streams, and UAVs are used to collect and process this data while maintaining a minimum age of information (AoI). We aim to jointly optimize the trajectories of UAVs and find scheduling policies to keep the information fresh under minimum throughput constraints.

In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Based on several experiments of performance evaluation, our fusion approach for activity recognition has achieved the accuracy over 96.0% on three public benchmark data sets, including Daily and Sport Activities, Daily Life Activities, and RealWorld.

Currently, a series of problems with transportation resources such as unbalanced distribution and road congestion disrupt the scheduling discipline. Therefore, it is significant to predict travel demand for urban resource dispatching. Previously, the traditional time series models were used to forecast travel demand, such as AR, ARIMA and so on. However, the prediction efficiency of these methods is poor and the training time is too long. In order to improve the performance, deep learning is used to assist prediction. But most of the deep learning methods only utilize temporal dependence or spatial dependence of data in the forecasting process. To address these limitations, a novel deep learning traffic demand forecasting framework which based on Deep Spatio-Temporal ConvLSTM is proposed in this paper.

In this article, an edge analytics architecture for ITSs is introduced in which data is processed at the vehicle or roadside smart sensor level to overcome the ITS's latency and reliability challenges. With a higher capability of passengers' mobile devices and intravehicle processors, such a distributed edge computing architecture leverages deep-learning techniques for reliable mobile sensing in ITSs.

However, classic data analysis or machine learning tools ignore some unique characteristics of the multistream measurement data, in particular, the coexistence of strong temporal correlation and interstream relatedness. To this end, in this paper we discuss the problem of novelty detection with multiple coevolving time series data. To capture both the temporal dependence and the interseries relatedness, a multitask nonparametric model is proposed, which can be extended to family of data distributions by adopting the notion of Bregman divergence.

Mobile computing takes full advantage of the computing power and communication capabilities of various sensing devices and uses these devices to form a computing cluster. When using such clusters for training of distributed machine learning models, the load imbalance and network transmission delay result in low efficiency of model training. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed machine learning parameter communication consistency model based on the parameter server idea, which is called the limited synchronous parallel model. The model is based on the fault-tolerant characteristics of the machine learning algorithm, and it dynamically limits the size of the synchronization barrier of the parameter server, reduces the synchronization communication overhead, and ensures the accuracy of the model training; thus, the model realizes finite asynchronous calculation between the worker nodes and gives full play to the overall performance of the cluster. The implementation of cluster dynamic load balancing experiments shows that the model can fully utilize the cluster performance during the training of distributed machine learning models to ensure the accuracy of the model and improve the training speed.",Machine learning;Computational modeling;Servers;Training;Load modeling;Synchronization;Security;Mobile computing;security monitoring;distributed machine learning;limited synchronous parallel model;parameter server

The emergence of mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems enables many smart city applications. In an MCS system, sensing tasks are allocated to a number of mobile users. As a result, the sensing related context of each mobile user plays a significant role on service quality. However, some important sensing context is ignored in the literature. This motivates us to propose a context-aware multiarmed bandit (C-MAB) incentive mechanism to facilitate quality-based worker selection in an MCS system. We evaluate a worker's service quality by its context (i.e., extrinsic ability and intrinsic ability) and cost. Based on our proposed C-MAB incentive mechanism and quality evaluation design, we develop a modified Thompson sampling worker selection (MTS-WS) algorithm to select workers in a reinforcement learning manner. MTS-WS is able to choose effective workers because it can maintain accurate worker quality information by updating evaluation parameters according to the status of task accomplishment. We theoretically prove that our C-MAB incentive mechanism is selection efficient, computationally efficient, individually rational, and truthful. Finally, we evaluate our MTS-WS algorithm on simulated and real-world datasets in comparison with some other classic algorithms.

However, the traditional Internet only can obtain the local network view, which belongs to the offline awareness mode and cannot adapt to the dynamical network environment.

This paper proposes resource management schemes of the limited number of channels and spreading factors (SFs) with the objective of improving the LoRa gateway energy efficiency. First, the problem of grid power consumption minimization while satisfying the system’s quality of service demands is formulated. Specifically, both scenarios the uncorrelated and time-correlated channels are investigated. The optimal resource management problem is solved by decoupling the formulated problem into two sub-problems: channel and SF assignment problem and energy management problem. Since the optimal solution is obtained with high complexity, online resource management heuristic algorithms that minimize the grid energy consumption are proposed. Finally, taking into account the channel and energy correlation, adaptable resource management schemes based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), are developed.

Previous work mainly focused on selecting a proper subset of humans for contributing sensing data. However, there often exist situations where humans are not able to reach the target areas, such as traffic jams or accidents. One solution is to complement manual data collection with autonomous data collection using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors. In this paper, we focus on the scenarios of UAV-assisted MCS and propose a highly efficient task allocation method, called UMA (UAV-assisted Multi-task Allocation method) to jointly optimize the sensing coverage and data quality. The method incentivizes and guides human participants to contribute high-quality sensing data. Meanwhile, the UAVs are employed to sense data from rarely sensed points of interest, and calibrate data contributed by human participants. The method leverages emerging deep reinforcement learning techniques for directing UAVs sensing and movement actions based on the human participants locations and tasks achievement.

This interaction of different layers in the smart building with the help of a communication channel leads to exposure of layers to vulnerabilities (cyber attacks) which may lead to anomalies condition. This kind of anomalies can be avoided by proper prediction of data and coordination among different layers of the building operation. However, to develop the model for prediction of data is quite time consuming and hence, the paper proposes the concept of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for predicting data with help of past available data even in absence of system model. In this paper temperature profile of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in BMS is predicted with the help of available past data. Once the prediction of the temperature profile is achieved the machine learning algorithm is used to classify and identify the data as normal or anomalies condition.

To solve this challenge, we attempt to reduce the tremendous video data using deep learning models in the computational Fog node and optimize the transmission function for high efficiency. To reduce data, we extract video feature and keep salient zones with high resolution meanwhile leave the unavoidable distortion in less important areas. To obtain the least transmission delay under the dynamic bandwidth in Fog computing, we model the transmission delay function and solve it by Lagrangian dual decomposition.

In a smart city environment, tasks may have varying priorities in terms of when and how to serve them; thus, priorities of the tasks have to be considered when making resource management decisions. In this paper, we focus on finding optimal offloading decisions in a three-tier user-edge-cloud architecture while considering different priority classes for the DL-based services and making a trade-off between a task’s completion time and the provided accuracy by the DL-based service.

To reduce the time spent in finding parking spaces, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions, and to effectively improve overall driving efficiency, the systemization of urban roadside or off-street parking has become a key issue that needs attention and demonstration in so-called “smart” cities. In this paper, we have designed and applied an mm-Wave Radar to detect the presence or absence of available parking spaces, and the parking space data can be quickly uploaded to the cloud.

The input data of this model includes parking space location, parking space status, and parking time factors.

With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications. Therefore, this work proposed an optimal and light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical complex text-based CAPTCHAs simultaneously. The accuracy of the proposed CNN model has been accelerated based on Cyclical Learning Rates (CLRs) policy. The proposed CLR-CNN model achieved a high accuracy to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical text-based CAPTCHAs of 99.87% and 99.66%, respectively. In real-time, we observed that the speed of the model has increased, the model is lightweight, stable, and flexible as compared to other CAPTCHA solving techniques. The result of this current work will increase awareness and will assist multimedia security Researchers to continue and develop more robust text-based CAPTCHAs with their security mechanisms capable of protecting the private information of citizens in Smart Cities.",Performance evaluation;Deep learning;Smart cities;Sensor systems;Numerical models;Convolutional neural networks;Internet of Things;multimedia iot;privacy;deep learning;convolutional neural network;captcha;smartphones;cyclical learning policy;performance evaluation;artificial intelligence

However, how to smartly schedule the packet transmission in CIoT systems is still a key challenge, that is, how to design a smart agent to realize the intelligent decision making and effective interoperability. In this paper, we model the system state transformation as a Markov decision process, and an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on a fuzzy normalized radial basis function neural network (called AC-FNRBF) is proposed to efficiently solve the intelligent transmission scheduling problem in CIoT systems under high-dimensional variables. The proposed AC-FNRBF algorithm can better approximate both the action function of the actor and the state-action value function of the critic without requiring the system prior knowledge, and a new reward function is established to maximize the system benefit, which jointly takes the transmission packet rate, the system throughput, the power consumption, and the transmission delay into account. Moreover, the AC-FNRBF has the ability to adjust its learning structure and parameters in dynamic environments. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves higher transmission packet rate and system throughput with lower power consumption and transmission delay, compared with other existing reinforcement learning algorithms.",Power demand;Internet of Things;Decision making;Resource management;Scheduling;Reinforcement learning;Signal to noise ratio;Actor-critic (AC);adaptive fuzzy neural network;cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT);deep reinforcement learning (DRL);transmission scheduling

Smart cities can benefit from offloading to edge points in the framework of the so-called cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS), as for example in traffic violation tracking cameras. We assume that there are mobile edge computing networks (MECNs) in more than one region, and they consist of multiple access points, multi-edge servers, and N MDs, where each MD has M independent real-time massive tasks. The MDs can connect to a MECN through the access points or the mobile network. Each task be can processed locally by the MD itself or remotely. There are three offloading options: nearest edge server, adjacent edge server, and remote cloud. We propose a reinforcement-learning-based state-action-reward-state-action (RL-SARSA) algorithm to resolve the resource management problem in the edge server, and make the optimal offloading decision for minimizing system cost, including energy consumption and computing time delay. We call this method OD-SARSA (offloading decision-based SARSA).

The diffusion of information to citizens in a smart city will rely on social trends and smart advertisement. Online social networks (OSNs) are prominent and increasingly important platforms to spread information, observe social trends, and advertise new products. To maximize the benefits of such platforms in sharing information, many groups invest in finding ways to maximize the expected number of clicks as a proxy of these platform's performance. As such, the study of click-through rate (CTR) prediction of advertisements, in environments like online social media, is of much interest. Prior works build machine learning (ML) using user-specific data to classify whether a user will click on an advertisement or not. For our work, we consider a large set of Facebook advertisement data (with no user data) and categorize targeted interests into thematic groups we call conceptual nodes. ML models are trained using the advertisement data to perform CTR prediction with conceptual node combinations. We then cast the problem of finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes as an optimization problem. Given a certain budget $k$, we are interested in finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes that maximize the CTR. We discuss the hardness and possible NP-hardness of the optimization problem. Then, we propose a greedy algorithm and a genetic algorithm to find near-optimal combinations of conceptual nodes in polynomial time, with the genetic algorithm nearly matching the optimal solution. We observe that simple ML models can exhibit the high Pearson correlation coefficients w.r.t. click predictions and real click values. Additionally, we find that the conceptual nodes of “politics”, “celebrity”, and “organization” are notably more influential than other considered conceptual nodes.",Social networking (online);Smart cities;Organizations;Predictive models;Market research;Optimization;Genetic algorithms;smart advertisement;click prediction;online social networks;optimization;machine learning

To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation.

Existing models especially deep learning based approaches require a large volume of training data, whose performance may degrade remarkably when the data is scarce. Recent works try to transfer knowledge from the intra-city or cross-city multi-modal spatio-temporal data. However, the careful design of what to transfer and how between the multi-modal spatio-temporal data needs to be determined in advance. There still lacks an end-to-end solution that can automatically capture the common cross-domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Deep Attentive Adaptation Network model named ST-DAAN to transfer cross-domain Spatio-Temporal knowledge for urban crowd flow prediction. ST-DAAN first maps the raw spatio-temporal data of source domain and target domain to a common embedding space. Then domain adaptation is adopted on several domain-specific layers through adding a domain discrepancy penalty to explicitly match the mean embeddings of the two domain distributions. Considering the complex spatial correlation in many urban spatio-temporal data, a global attention mechanism is also designed to enable the model to capture broader spatial dependencies. Using urban crowd flow prediction as a demonstration, we conduct experiments on five real-world large datasets over both intra- and cross-city transfer learning. The results demonstrate that ST-DAAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",Urban areas;Predictive models;Transfer learning;Data models;Deep learning;Task analysis;Adaptation models;Spatio-temporal data;transfer learning;urban computing;crowd flow prediction.

Achieving high accuracy while reading license plates in the real world videos is cumbersome due to complexities like multiple vehicles, high-density traffic in spatial and temporal domains, varying camera angles and illumination, occlusions and multiple resolutions. We present a modular framework for OCR corrections in the chaotic Indian traffic videos that especially involve complex license plate patterns. Such patterns are obtained from a state-of-the-art deep learning model trained on video frames. Since such a model reads the text from videos (instead of images), we incorporate multi-frame consensus for generating suggestions in our framework. To ease the correction process, our human-interactive framework first breaks down the multi-vehicle videos into multiple clips, each containing a single vehicle from the video using an object detector and a tracker. Our framework then provides suggestions for an individual vehicle using multi-frame consensus. Our framework then selectively presents these extracted clips to the user to verify/correct the predictions with minimal human efforts via interactive suggestions. Such high-quality output can be used to continuously update a large database for surveillance and can be further used to improve the accuracy of deep models in the complex real-world scenarios.",Videos;Licenses;Optical character recognition software;Databases;Text recognition;Tools;Text analysis;OCR Corrections;deep learning;Video Scene Text;license plate recognition;human interactive framework

Energy management is among the most challenging problems in such metropolitan areas due to the difficulty and key role of energy systems.

This paper explores the method of a deep extreme learning machine to create a predictive model that can predict a combined cycle power plant's hourly full-load electrical output. An intelligent energy management solution can be achieved by properly monitoring and controlling these resources through the internet of things (IoT).

Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit.

Image based IoT applications serve a wide variety of fields such as medical application and smart cities. Steganography is a great threat to these applications where adversaries can use the images in these applications to hide malicious messages. Therefore, this paper presents an image steganalysis technique that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect the infamous JPEG steganography technique: JPEG universal wavelet relative distortion (J-UNIWARD). Several experiments were conducted to determine the breaking point of J-UNIWARD, whether the hiding technique relies on correlation of the images, and the effect of utilizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) on the performance of the CNN. The results of the CNN display that the breaking point of J-UNIWARD is 1.5 (bpnzAC), the correlation of the database affects the detection accuracy, and DCT increases the detection accuracy by 13%.",Wavelet transforms;Steganography;Correlation;Databases;Smart cities;Transform coding;Convolutional neural networks;Steganography;Steganalysis;DCT;JPEG;CNN

One of the major research focuses of 6G is to enable massive Internet of Things (mIoT) applications. Like Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax), forthcoming wireless communication networks are likely to meet massively deployed devices and extremely new smart applications such as smart cities for mIoT. However, channel scarcity is still present due to a massive number of connected devices accessing the common spectrum resources. With this expectation, next-generation Wi-Fi 6 and beyond for mIoT are anticipated to have inherent machine intelligence capabilities to access the optimum channel resources for their performance optimization. Unfortunately, current wireless communication network standards do not support the ensuing needs of machine learning (ML)-aware frameworks in terms of resource allocation optimization.

10.1109/RE.2019.00009,,"Nuseibeh, Bashar",2019,Requirements We Live By,inproceedings,2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE),ieee,"Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.",Requirements engineering;Conferences;requirements-engineering;software-engineering;;security-and-privacy

Existing machine learning-based methods for monitoring and securing IoT networks are fragile, expensive, and inflexible, and hence unable to cost-effectively cope with the dynamic and complex nature of attacks. For my PhD thesis, the aim is to develop a robust, accurate, scalable, and cost-effective network monitoring solution for securing large IoT systems. To do so, we would require to dynamically measure and analyze certain portions of network traffic. Therefore, we employ programmable networking techniques to dynamically and selectively acquire necessary telemetry data (packets and/or flows of connected devices) fed to a collection of learning-based models (each specialized in certain protocols with specific granularity) to classify devices, monitor their activity, and detect malicious behaviors. Our preliminary results show that the signature analysis of selected signaling packets from 26 real IoT devices yields a reasonably accurate inference by progressively collecting telemetry data at manageable processing costs.",Learning systems;Protocols;Smart cities;Telecommunication traffic;Smart homes;Machine learning;Performance analysis;IoT;traffic analysis;programmable networks;machine learning

The boon in things being smart is that it involves automation and interactive technologies, something that we as humans prefer over introvert and monotonous characteristic of machines. However, most present systems have a physical entity like a remote or a personal device assistant (PDA) which is used to control our homes. When the access to these physical devices is lost, you can no longer control them. This paper addresses this very issue and proposes a solution which eliminates the need for any physical device.

The short term power load forecasting of individual as well as group of similar energy customers is critical for effective operation and management of SG. Forecasting power load of individual as well as group of similar energy customers is challenging compared to aggregate load forecasting of a residential community. The main reason is the high volatility and uncertainty involved for the case of individual and group of similar energy customers. Several machine/deep learning models have been developed in the recent past for forecasting load of individual energy customers, but such explorations are ineffective due to the requirement of one trained model for every energy customer, which is practically not feasible. We plan to build a deep learning model using convolutional neural network (CNN) layers in pyramidal architecture for effective load forecasting for a group of similar energy-profile customers. Initially, we grouped a subset of energy customers from database of Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) into clusters using DBSCAN approach. The CNN layers are used for extracting feature from historical load of each cluster. The extracted feature of similar energy-profile customers (grouped based on clustering) is combined to make training-databases for each cluster. We have used the power load data from SGSC project, which contain thousands of individual household energy customers data. The developed Pyramid-CNN model is trained based on these sets of databases. The trained model is evaluated on randomly selected customers from few clusters. We obtained significantly improved forecasting results for randomly selected user from different clusters. Our adapted strategy of clustering based model training resulted in upto 10 percent MAPE improvement for the energy customers. The essence of our work is that energy customers can be grouped into clusters and then representative model could be developed/trained, which can accurately forecast power load for individual energy-customer. This approach is highly feasible, as we do not need to train a model per energy customer and still achieve competitive forecasting results.",Load modeling;Predictive models;Forecasting;Load forecasting;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Adaptation models;Smart homes;smart grids;power load forecasting;CNN;low energy consumers;high energy consumers;clusters

With the emergence of smart cities, it would be beneficial to leverage the processing power of deep learning to assist in the planning and testing of different policies to address this issue. When examining a population of homeless individuals, one can view them as being distributed, at any one point in time, among several possible states: for example, the street or an emergency shelter. Our work aims to provide a means of simulating across these states, including no longer homeless, over time. The probability that an individual will transition from one state to another is called a transition probability. Thus, by creating a matrix of transition probabilities between all of the states, we have a transition probability matrix. If we simply approached this problem by using a mathematical model such as a Markov decision process, we run into the issue of how to accurately adjust the probabilities to produce realistic results. Ideally, we would have a model that can reasonably modify them based on real-life data. To do this, we introduce two modified deep learning algorithms; modified deep q-learning (MDQL) and modified neural fitted q-iteration (MNFQ). These algorithms dynamically produce a set of transition probability matrices for each week of the year. We discuss the modifications we made to these algorithms to adapt to the homelessness problem and create our simulation. After training our model on high resolution, weekly data, we will show that when running it on a low resolution data set that spans 3 years, our model is able to achieve a relative percent difference from the final population of 12.5%.

Furthermore, they mostly focus just on precision and not on other meaningful features, such as flexibility and robustness. With the current energy production trends, where many solar panels are distributed across city rooftops, there is a need to manage all this information simultaneously and to be able to add and remove sensors as needed. Likewise, robust models need to be able to cope with (inevitable) sensor failure and continue producing reliable predictions. Due to all of this, solar forecasting models need to be as decoupled as possible from the number of data sources that feed them and their geographical distribution, enabling also the reusability of the models. This article contributes with a family of Deep Learning models for solar irradiance forecasting complying with the aforementioned features, i.e. flexibility and robustness. In the first stage, several Artificial Neural Networks are trained as a basis for predicting solar irradiance on several locations at the same time. Thereupon, a family of models that work with irradiance maps thanks to Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory layers is presented, obtaining forecast skills between 7.4% and 41% (depending on the location and horizon) compared to the baseline. The latter family comes with flexibility and robustness features, which are required in large-scale Intelligent Environments, such as Smart Cities. Working with irradiance maps means that new sensors can be added (or removed) as needed, without requiring rebuilding the model. Experiments carried out show that sensor failures have a mild impact on the prediction error for several forecast horizons.",Forecasting;Sensors;Predictive models;Robustness;Task analysis;Data models;Solar panels;Convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM);deep learning;irradiance map;solar irradiance;time series forecasting

In this context, various threats have been presented, including black-box attacks, where a malicious participant can accurately recover an arbitrary input fed into his device. In this paper, we introduce a methodology aiming to secure the sensitive data through re-thinking the distribution strategy, without adding any computation overhead. First, we examine the characteristics of the model structure that make it susceptible to privacy threats. We found that the more we divide the model feature maps into a high number of devices, the better we hide proprieties of the original image.

Traditional traffic forecasting methods mostly rely on time series prediction techniques, which fail to capture the complicated dynamic nature and spatial relations of mobile traffic demand. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, graph attention spatial-temporal network (GASTN), for accurate citywide mobile traffic forecasting, which can capture not only local geographical dependency but also distant inter-region relationship when considering spatial factor. Specifically, GASTN considers spatial correlation through our constructed spatial relation graph and utilizes structural recurrent neural networks to model the global near-far spatial relationships as well as the temporal dependencies. In the framework of GASTN, two attention mechanisms are designed to integrate different effects in a holistic way. Besides, in order to further enhance the prediction performance, we propose a collaborative global-local learning strategy for the training of GASTN, which takes full advantage of the knowledge from both the global model and local models for individual regions and enhance the effectiveness of our model.

A more compact multileveled features are then obtained by sample-based discretization techniques and Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) is applied to select features iteratively. These features are finally integrated with MCMTTP to achieve an accurate voice-based features detection.

Such applications have been proposed in several domains including health care, smart cities and agriculture. However, despite their increased adoption, deploying these applications in specific settings has been very challenging because of the complex static and dynamic variability of the physical devices such as sensors and actuators, the software application behavior and the environment in which the application is embedded. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for IoT analytics based on learning embodied agents (i.e. situated agents). The approach involves: (i) a variability model of IoT embodied agents; (ii) feedback evaluative machine learning; and (iii) reconfiguration of a group of agents in accordance with environmental context.

The LCS features integrate machine learning based calibration models and virtual sensors. LCS performances are analyzed and some LCS variables with low performance are improved through intelligent field-calibrations. Meteorological variables are calibrated using linear dynamic models.While, due to the non-linear relationship to reference instruments, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are calibrated using non-linear machine learning models. However, due to sensor drifts or faults, carbon dioxide (CO2) does not present correlation to reference instrument. As a result, the LCS for CO2 is not feasible to be calibrated. Hence, to estimate the CO2 concentration,mathematical models are developed to be integrated in the calibrated LCS, known as a virtual sensor. In addition, another virtual sensor is developed to demonstrate the capability of estimating air pollutant concentrations, e.g. black carbon, when the physical sensor devices are not available. In our paper, calibration models and virtual sensors are established using corresponding reference instruments that are installed on two reference stations. This strategy generalizes the models of calibration and virtual sensing which then allows LCS to be deployed in field independently with a high accuracy.

However, built environments attenuate GPS signals by reflecting or blocking them resulting in some cases multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception. These effects cause range errors that degrade GPS positioning accuracy. Enhancements in the design of antennae and receivers deliver a level of reduction of multipath. However, NLOS signal reception and residual effects of multipath are still to be mitigated sufficiently for improvements in range errors and positioning accuracy. Recent machine learning-based methods have shown promise in improving pseudorange-based position solutions by considering multiple variables from raw GPS measurements. However, positioning accuracy is limited by low accuracy signal reception classification. Unlike the existing methods, which use machine learning to directly predict the signal reception classification, we use a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based method to predict the pseudorange errors by considering the signal strength, satellite elevation angle and pseudorange residuals. With the predicted pseudorange errors, two variations of the algorithm are proposed to improve positioning accuracy. The first corrects pseudorange errors and the other either corrects or excludes the signals determined to contain the effects of multipath and NLOS signals. The results for a challenging urban environment characterized by high-rise buildings on one side, show that the 3-D positioning accuracy of the pseudorange error correction-based positioning measured in terms of the root mean square error is 23.3 m, an improvement of more than 70% over the conventional methods.",Satellites;Urban areas;Global Positioning System;Position measurement;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Predictive models;Global positioning system (GPS);gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT);multipath;non-line-of-sight (NLOS);urban positioning

Initially, a reinforcement learning approach is adopted in order for the citizens to select the business to visit, exploiting both social and physical characteristics of all involved entities. Subsequently, following the principles of behavioral economics, the problem of the citizens’ incentivization by the businesses to provide their health data via offering personalized rewards is studied. The solution of the corresponding optimization problem concludes to a contract between the business and each citizen associated with this business, containing the optimal reward and optimal portion of reported data. The process is completed by introducing an optimization framework, where the healthcare operator incentivizes the businesses to provide the collected health data to it, by providing them tailored rewards. This is founded on the principles of Contract Theory, where the healthcare operator aims at maximizing its benefit from the data acquisition process, while guaranteeing that the optimal determined contracts are acceptable by the respective businesses.

Accurate and efficient congested link identification has become a foundational issue to IoT applications like self-driving cars, digital health, smart city, and so on. However, directly monitoring the massive number of interior links often introduces high operation cost or even is infeasible in practice, giving rise to indirect monitoring techniques like network Boolean tomography. Nevertheless, in many networks, the number of their interior links is larger than their end-to-end paths, making it very challenging for network Boolean tomography to find a determined solution. To resolve this issue, most of current methods try to utilize some prerequisites, such as the link congestion probabilities. While these probabilities might be hard or even unable to be obtained accurately in dynamical networks, limiting the practical deployment. In this paper, we are motivated to design a framework of congested link identification without any prerequisite or assumption.

Third, when both classes of agents co-learn, these learning tasks are of different nature (from the point of view of MARL). Finally, a microscopic modeling and simulation of the this problem is not trivial. Therefore, this paper not only proposes a co-learning approach in which agents act in a shared environment, but also argues that this task needs to be formulated asynchronously. Besides, driver agents are able to update the value of the available actions by receiving information from other drivers. Results show that the co-learning approach outperforms other policies in terms of average travel time of all vehicles. Moreover, when co-learning is used, a better distribution of the trips within the network is observed.",Vehicles;Task analysis;Microscopy;Learning (artificial intelligence);Adaptation models;Games

In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for radio resource slicing in 5G. We model each slice as an intelligent agent that competes for limited radio resources, and the correlated Q-learning is applied for inter-slice resource block (RB) allocation. The proposed correlated Q-learning based inter-slice RB allocation (COQRA) scheme is compared with Nash Q-learning (NQL), Latency-Reliability-Throughput Q-learning (LRTQ) methods, and the priority proportional fairness (PPF) algorithm.

Often, these IoT applications fall in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), e.g., autonomous robot navigation in smart factories and traffic signal control in smart cities. However, RL-based applications require a long learning time. To overcome this limitation and scale with the number of agents, parallel RL (PRL) algorithms run multiple RL agents in parallel and on distributed environments. However, deploying PRL algorithms in such environments entails a communication overhead that increases the (actual) execution time. The state-of-the-art PRL algorithms are designed for reducing the learning time while assuming no (or limited) communication overhead. In this article, we present a novel partitioning algorithm that minimizes the communication overhead in PRL running on IoT environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on solving the communication overhead of distributing PRL algorithms without requiring any a priori knowledge about the structure of the problem. The proposed algorithm intelligently combines a dynamic state partitioning strategy, which exploits the agent's exploration capabilities to build partition knowledge while learning, with an efficient mapping of agents to partitions, which reduces the communication among agents. Performance evaluations show that the proposed algorithm can achieve almost no communication among PRL agents at the converged state.",Internet of Things;Reinforcement learning;Partitioning algorithms;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Mathematical model;Task analysis;Internet of Things (IoT);large state–action space partitioning;machine learning (ML);parallel reinforcement learning (PRL)

Additionally, the alignment and gap may change with external positioning, which affects the coupling coefficient of the transmitter and receiver coils. Thus, a data-driven control scheme is desired to tackle these environmental uncertainties. This paper adopts the control scheme of embedding a Buck converter at the receiver side.

Consequently, collecting personal semantic location by mining these tracklogs would be the application direction and research focus of location-based services. Personal semantic location is a practical significant location that users will visit frequently, stay for a long time such as a home address, workplace, etc.). The acquisition of personal semantic location involves two steps, which are acquiring location and matching semantics. Currently, most of the relevant research use density clustering-based algorithms to collect location data.

In this paper, we present a secure protocol in which a TEE acts as a proxy to the IoT devices and creates the necessary transactions for the blockchain. We use an authenticated encryption method on the data transmission between the IoT device and TEE to authenticate the device and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data generated by the IoT devices.",Servers;Protocols;Relays;Encryption;Digital signatures;blockchain;IoT;trusted execution environment

The framework leverages the immense potential at the intersection of IoT, Big Data, Human Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence and their interrelated disciplines. Leg cramps are known to be associated with all age groups but studies [1], [2] have shown that cramps are more frequent in older adults and have a multitude of risks and associated impacts, both temporary and permanent, which affect their quality of life and their abilities to perform ADL – which are essential for one’s sustenance. The challenge in this field is to predict cramps to minimize their effects on the performance of older adults during ADL, with an aim to improve their quality of life in the future of living environments. Addressing this challenge through development of a framework for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) of elderly in Smart Homes serves as the main motivation for this work. To evaluate the efficacy of this proposed approach it has been tested on a dataset of ADL and the performance characteristics are discussed. A case study has also been performed where performance characteristics of various learning models are compared to deduce the best learning model for development of this framework. The results presented uphold the relevance and immense potential of this work for contributing towards AAL of the elderly population in Smart Homes through accurate prediction of cramps during ADL.",Big Data;Artificial intelligence;Internet of Things;Human computer interaction;Handheld computers;Activities of Daily Living;Big Data;Internet of Things;Artificial Intelligence;Human Computer Interaction

The existing works just focus on cloud- edge or edge-device cooperative AI which suffers low learning efficiency of AI, while edge-to-edge cooperative AI is still an unresolved issue. Moreover, the existing researches concentrate on the computation offloading of the AI-based task, ignoring that it is a brain-like task performing sophisticated processing to raw data, which leads to the high latency and low quality of the learning services. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an on-demand learning offloading mechanism for edge-to-edge cooperative AI. Firstly, the principle of the learning capability and its offloading are proposed for the formal description of the learning resources migration. Secondly, the proposed mechanism realizes the bilateral learning offloading utilizing edge-to-edge and cloud-edge collaborations to handle AI-based tasks with high learning efficiency and resource utilization rate. Moreover, we model the edge-to-edge learning offloading allocation based on the concatenation of deep neural network (DNN) subtasks and their heterogeneous requirement of learning resources.

Unlike previous network generations, 5G utilizes complex digital technologies such as massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and runs over higher radio frequencies. The introduction of new technologies and advanced features in the 5G network raises new challenges for network operators, and merging Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the effective solutions to address these complexities. However, AI-enabled 5G network engenders security concerns and requires improvement to meet the standardization and qualification of the new network generation. To mitigate these dilemmas, Blockchain must be integrated. Blockchain, as a decentralized methodology provides a secure sharing of information and resources among various nodes of 5G environments.

Currently, the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud technologies are used in the course of projects such as the Horizon 2020 EU-Korea DECENTER project in order to implement four smart applications in the domains of Smart Homes, Smart Cities, Smart Construction and Robot Logistics. In these smart applications the Big Data pipeline starts from various sensor and video streams to which AI and feature extraction methods are applied. The resulting information is stored in database containers, which have to be placed on Edge, Fog or Cloud infrastructures. The placement decision depends on complex application requirements, including Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Information that must be considered when making placement decisions includes the expected workload, the list of candidate infrastructures, geolocation, connectivity and similar. Software engineers currently perform such decisions manually, which usually leads to QoS threshold violations. This paper aims to automate the process of making such decisions. Therefore, the goals of this paper are to: (1) develop a decision making method for database container placement; (2) formally verify each placement decision and provide probability assurances to the software engineer for high QoS; and (3) design and implement a new architecture that automates the whole process. A new optimisation method is introduced, which is based on the theory and practice of stochastic Markov Decision Processes (MDP). It uses as input monitoring data from the container runtime, the expected workload and user-related metrics in order to automatically construct a probabilistic finite automaton. The generated automaton is used for both automated decision making and placement success verification. The method is implemented in Java. It also uses the PRISM model-checking tool. Kubernetes is used in order to automate the whole process when orchestrating database containers across Edge, Fog and Cloud infrastructures. Experiments are performed for NoSQL Cassandra database containers for three representative workloads of 50000 (workload 1), 200000 (workload 2) and 500000 (workload 3) CRUD database operations. Five computing infrastructures serve as candidates for database container placement. The new MDP-based method is compared with the widely used Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The obtained results are used to analyse container placement decisions. When using the new MDP based method there were no QoS violations in any of the placement cases, while when using the AHP based method the placement results in some QoS threshold violations in all workload cases. Due to its properties, the new MDP method is particularly suitable for implementation. The paper also describes a multi-tier distributed computing system that uses multi-level (infrastructure, container, application) monitoring metrics and Kubernetes in order to orchestrate database containers across Edge, Fog and Cloud nodes. This architecture demonstrates fully automated decision making and high QoS container operation.",Containers;Quality of service;Databases;Software;Cloud computing;Decision making;Probabilistic logic;Cloud;Fog;Edge;storage;probabilistic decision making;containers

The adoption of an on-the-edge artificial intelligence architecture brings a set of advantages: safety, reliability, promptness and low power consumption. The embedded intelligence is trained from a purpose-built dataset enclosing environmental car engine sound data. A pre trained ANN classifies sound events and counts cars approaching and leaving the microphone by sensing the Doppler Effects in the sound emitted by the moving vehicles.

Such wide deployment of HAR systems often faces the annotation-scarcity challenge; that is, most of the HAR techniques, especially the deep learning techniques, require a large number of training data while annotating sensor data is very time- and effort-consuming. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been successfully applied to tackle this challenge, where the activity knowledge from a well-annotated domain can be transferred to a new, unlabelled domain. However, these existing techniques do not perform well on highly heterogeneous domains. This article proposes shift-GAN that integrate bidirectional generative adversarial networks (Bi-GAN) and kernel mean matching (KMM) in an innovative way to learn intrinsic, robust feature transfer between two heterogeneous domains. Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data.",Robot sensing systems;Accelerometers;Adaptation models;Kernel;Generative adversarial networks;Training data;Task analysis;Human activity recognition;domain adaptation;ensemble learning;generative adversarial networks;covariate shift;kernel mean matching

Re-identification is the problem of matching appearances of objects across different cameras. With the proliferation of surveillance cameras enabling smart and safer cities, there is an ever-increasing need to re-identify vehicles across cameras. Typical challenges arising in smart city scenarios include variations of viewpoints, illumination and self occlusions. Most successful approaches for re-identification involve (deep) learning an embedding space such that the vehicles of same identities are projected closer to one another, compared to the vehicles representing different identities. Popular loss functions for learning an embedding (space) include contrastive or triplet loss. In this paper we provide an extensive evaluation of these losses applied to vehicle re-identification and demonstrate that using the best practices for learning embeddings outperform most of the previous approaches proposed in the vehicle re-identification literature.

However, the limitations of cache capacity make it difficult to develop an effective common caching framework that satisfies diverse user preferences. In this article, we propose a new content caching strategy that maximizes the cache hit ratio through flexible prediction in dynamically changing network and user environments. It is based on a hierarchical deep learning architecture: long short-term memory (LSTM)-based local learning and ensemble-based meta-learning. First, as a local learning model, we employ an LSTM method with seasonal-trend decomposition using loess (STL)-based preprocessing. It identifies the attributes for demand prediction on the contents in various demographic user groups. Second, as a metalearning model, we employ a regression-based ensemble learning method, which uses an online convex optimization framework and exhibits sublinear “regret” performance. It orchestrates the obtained multiple demographic user preferences into a unified caching strategy in real time. Extensive experiments were conducted on the popular MovieLens data sets. It was shown that the proposed control provides up to a 30% higher cache hit ratio than conventional representative algorithms and a near-optimal cache hit ratio within approximately 9% of the optimal caching scheme with perfect prior knowledge of content popularity.

The conventional solution is to deliver data collected from IoT devices to remote cloud for computation, while this may not only rely heavily on networking resources but also cause security risks. The rising concept of edge computing gives us another solution. Tasks can be decomposed by different scales. Model-level decomposition is to inference the models in the task pipeline on different computing devices, while layer-level decomposition is to inference the layers in the single DL model on different computing devices. Both scales of decomposition can be inferenced on edge-cloud framework or simply device-edge framework based on different considerations.

In this paper, a novel fingerprinting system is proposed to achieve indoor localization via learning spatiotemporal features from channel state information (CSI) of multiple-input multiple-output wireless channels (CSI-MIMO) by a dual-stream three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (DS-3DCNN). In the proposed system, the gathered raw CSI-MIMO data are firstly preprocessed through amplitude outliers elimination and phase sanitization for constructing a pair of 3D CSI-MIMO matrices including a 3D amplitude matrix and a 3D phase matrix. Next, the 3D matrices will be input to the DS-3DCNN deep neural network which consists of two parallel subnetworks with specific architecture of several convolution, batch normalization, max-pooling, and fully connected layers. Through this DS-3DCNN network, learning spatiotemporal features of CSI-MIMO is carried out simultaneously from 3D amplitude and phase matrices. And then, probabilistic classification results of two subnetworks are fused in the final output layer of the proposed DS-3DCNN based on Bayes' theorem. Moreover, in the offline training stage, a dual-stream joint optimization method is presented for efficiently optimizing network parameters. After offline training of the DS-3DCNN, in the online locating stage, current CSI-MIMO data are firstly collected from the mobile device to be located. Then probabilistic classification results are obtained from the output layer of the DS-3DCNN, and further used to approximate the posterior distribution of the mobile device's location with a Gaussian mixture model. Finally, a novel location estimation algorithm is deduced based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Since unique features of wireless MIMO channels are jointly learnt in spatial, temporal, and frequency domains, the proposed DS-3DCNN based fingerprinting system is reasonable to provide accurate localization results in indoor environments, which is verified in corresponding experiments.",Three-dimensional displays;Wireless communication;MIMO communication;Mobile handsets;Wireless fidelity;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Probabilistic logic;Indoor localization;deep learning;convolutional neural network (CNN);channel state information (CSI)

We propose a single-server version of somewhat homomorphic encryption cryptosystem based on confused modulo projection theorem named CMP-SWHE, which allows the server to complete blind data processing without seeing the effective information of user data. On the client side, the original data is encrypted by amplification, randomization, and setting confusing redundancy. Operating on the encrypted data on the server side is equivalent to operating on the original data. As an extension, we designed and implemented a blind computing scheme of accelerated version based on batch processing technology to improve efficiency. To make this algorithm easy to use, we also designed and implemented an efficient general blind computing library based on CMP-SWHE. We have applied this library to foreground extraction, optical flow tracking, and object detection with satisfactory results, which are helpful for building smart cities. We also discuss how to extend the algorithm to deep learning applications. Compared with other homomorphic encryption cryptosystems and libraries, the results show that our method has obvious advantages in computing efficiency. Although our algorithm has some tiny errors ( $10^{-6}$ ) when the data is too large, it is very efficient and practical, especially suitable for blind image and video processing.",Encryption;Cloud computing;Privacy;Servers;Libraries;Visualization;Blind computing;blind vision;cloud services;confused modulo projection;privacy preserving;security and privacy;smart cities;somewhat homomorphic encryption (SWHE)

However, considering the large numbers of connectivity demands, it is vital to improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) of the IoT with an affordable power consumption. To improve the SE, the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is newly proposed through accommodating multiple users in the same spectrums. As a result, in this paper, an energy efficient resource allocation (RA) problem is introduced for the NOMA-based heterogeneous IoT. At first, we assume the successive interference cancellation (SIC) is imperfect for practical implementations. Then, based on the analyzing method for cognitive radio networks, we present a stepwise RA scheme for the mobile users and the IoT users with the mutual interference management. Third, we propose a deep recurrent neural network-based algorithm to solve the problem optimally and rapidly. Moreover, a priorities and rate demands-based user scheduling method is supplemented, to coordinate the access of the heterogeneous users with the limited radio resource. At last, the simulation results verify that the deep learning-based scheme is able to provide optimal RA results for the NOMA heterogeneous IoT with fast convergence and low computational complexity.

Therefore, travel time prediction of urban areas has become a key research direction in the field of smart cities. At present, several studies on travel time prediction are only conducted on a single mode, where the prediction process only treats a certain vehicle as an isolated traffic state on the route. However, the factors affecting traffic are extremely complex, thus making it very difficult to produce a comprehensive forecast. Based on this situation, the mixed existing model and mutual influence of multiple modes of transportation in the city are fully considered, and a multimodal deep learning model namely MC-GRU (Multimodal Convoluted Gated Recurrent Unit Network) is proposed. At the same time, to solve the problem of some objective factors, such as departure time and travel distance, we propose an attribute module to deal with these implicit factors. In addition, to explore the interaction between different modes of vehicles, a feature fusion module for obtaining the interaction effect between different modes of vehicles is proposed. Finally, we use GRU to learn the long-term dependence. MC-GRU can realize the accurate prediction of travel time in multimodal traffic state, as well as implement travel time prediction for three types of travel modes.

However, there are many barriers to provide an efficient solution for the IoT service deployment underlying innovation SDN/NFV-based technologies. First, though an IoT service can flexibly deploy via virtual network functions (VNFs), a deployment scheme needs to solve the joint routing and resource allocation problem, which becomes more difficult than the traditional centralized cloud/datacenter solution due to distributed resources in the edge-cloud network. In addition, due to uncertain workloads in IoT services, static optimization solutions may not deal with uncompleted knowledge of the entire input, which is often given by assumptions, but unrealistic in current provisioning approaches.

Meanwhile, we can now able to collect, store, and analyze a large amount of sharing bike data. How to effectively use these massive data to provide better services is an emerging task. However, due to the skewed and imbalanced bike usages for stations located at different places, it is of great significance yet very challenging to predict the potential destinations of each individual trip beforehand so that the service providers can better schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an attention-based deep learning framework for trip destination prediction (AFTER). AFTER first learns the low-dimension representations of users and sharing bike stations via negative sampling strategies. Then, a convolution neural network with an attention mechanism is utilized to predict the future trip destination.

When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing.

To meet increasing security and privacy requirements, physiological signalbased biometric human identification is gaining tremendous attention. This paper focuses on two major impediments: the signal processing technique is usually both complicated and data-dependent and the feature engineering is time-consuming and can fit only specific datasets . To enable a data-independent and highly generalizable signal processing and feature learning process, a novel wavelet domain multiresolution convolutional neural network is proposed. Specifically, it allows for blindly selecting a physiological signal segment for identification purpose, avoiding the complicated signal fiducial characteristics extraction process. To enrich the data representation, the random chosen signal segment is then transformed to the wavelet domain, where multiresolution time-frequency representation is achieved. An auto-correlation operation is applied to the transformed data to remove the phase difference as the result of the blind segmentation operation. Afterward, a multiresolution 1-D-convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) is introduced to automatically learn the intrinsic hierarchical features from the wavelet domain raw data without datadependent and heavy feature engineering, and perform the user identification task. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is thoroughly evaluated on eight electrocardiogram datasets with diverse behaviors, such as with or without severe heart diseases, and with different sensor placement methods. Our evaluation is much more extensive than the state-of-the-art works, and an average identification rate of 93.5% is achieved. The proposed multiresolution 1-D-CNN algorithm can effectively identify human subjects, even from randomly selected signal segments and without heavy feature engineering. This paper is expected to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the blind signal processing and deep learning techniques to biometric human identification, to enable a low algorithm engineering effort and also a high generalization ability.",Electrocardiography;Signal resolution;Feature extraction;Heart rate variability;Convolution;Wavelet domain;Wavelet transforms;ECG;wavelet transformation;convolutional neural network;deep learning;machine learning;feature learning;blind signal processing;data representation

However, conventional attention-based methods always analyzed images directly and aggressively. It is difficult for them to well understand complicated scenes. In this paper, we propose a global/local attention method that can recognize an image from coarse to fine by mimicking how human-beings observe images. Specifically, our global/local attention method first concentrates on the whole image, and then focuses on local specific objects in the image. We also propose a joint max-margin objective function, which enforces that the minimum score of positive labels should be larger than the maximum score of negative labels horizontally and vertically.

Accurate indoor localization plays a vital role in LBS. The ability to localize various subjects in the area of interest facilitates further ubiquitous environments. Specifically, device free localization using wireless signals is getting increased attention as human location is estimated using its impact on the surrounding wireless signals without any active device tagged with subject. In this paper, we propose MuDLoc, the first multi-view discriminant learning approach for device free indoor localization using both amplitude and phase features of Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple Access Points (APs). The same location oriented CSI data can be observed by different APs, thus generating multiple distinct even heterogeneous samples. Multi-view learning is an emerging technique in machine learning which improve performance by utilizing diversity from different view data. In MuDLoc, the localization is modeled as a pattern matching problem, where the target location is predicted based on similarity measure of CSI features of an unknown location with those of the training locations. MuDLoc implements Generalized Inter-view and Intra-view Discriminant Correlation Analysis (GI2DCA), a discriminative feature extraction approach that incorporates inter-view and intra-view class associations while maximizing pairwise correlations across multi-view data sets.

The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity.

Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area.

This concept defines the tasks associated with the organization of various infrastructure objects' continuous monitoring to optimally divide resources and ensure security. One of these tasks is to ensure road safety involving autonomous vehicles. The solution to this problem involves various technologies, including computer vision technologies. One of the approaches in this area is based on machine learning methods. These methods consider objects models in images represented as attribute vectors. Boundary attributes are often used here. The formation of these attribute comes down to two steps the boundaries detection and their description in the form of descriptors. This paper describes an approach to the objects' boundaries detection in images in intelligent systems of autonomous vehicles, which is based on the use of wavelet transform. The method is based on determining the significance of the brightness change magnitude at some point at a certain level of the wavelet decomposition. For that, it is necessary to evaluate the contribution to the total image energy of the detailed coefficients corresponding to this point. The method determines the sequential refinement of boundaries, which is as follows: as the brightnesses of the original image's copies at different levels are interconnected, we assume that the boundary points at different levels correspond to each other.

As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party.

Moreover, unattended sensors may suffer of several issues that progressively make their measures unreliable and consequently useless. For this reason, several automatically techniques have been studied and implemented for the detection and correction of measurements from sensors which are affected by errors caused by aging and/or drift.

Then, it transforms the video data into useful information, providing services to IoT or smart city applications. However, collecting raw video data directly to the cloud server is merely possible due to network bandwidth limitations and data privacy concerns. One possible solution is to adopt federated learning, which enables edge devices to collaboratively train a shared model without sending the raw data to the cloud. Unfortunately, this scheme cannot directly be applied to the targeted scenario since it assumes labeled data for training, and only at the cloud, we have the human power and time to label the video data. Thus, to tackle those issues, we propose an edge learning system based on semisupervised learning and federated learning technologies. The system trains AI models at edge devices using an improved semisupervised learning scheme and periodically uploads the training results to the cloud server to form a single model by adapting the federated learning technology. Then, we observe that in the real world, the data on the end devices are nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) such that it may cause weight divergence during training and result in a considerable decrease in the model performance. Therefore, we propose a new operation called federated swapping (FedSwap) to replace partial federated learning operations based on a few shared data during federated training to alleviate the adverse impact of weight divergence. We evaluate our system on both image classification using the state-of-the-art benchmark data and object detection using real-world video data. The experimental results show that the proposed system can have up to 5.9% higher accuracy of object detection for the video analysis applications by fully utilizing unlabeled data, compared with the situation that only labeled data are used.

The importance of traffic congestion prediction has grown in tandem with the rapid development of Smart Transportation Networks for convenient transportation. This paper illustrates a smart traffic management infrastructure based on Internet of Things (IoT), traffic is predicted using KNN algorithm and information is projected to smart devices through Android application. The outcome is smart predictive system with suggested alternates.

One of the main challenges for successful and efficient training and inference on edge devices is the careful selection of parameters to build local Machine Learning (ML) models. To this aim, we propose a Particle Swarm optimization (PSO)-based technique to optimize the hyperparameter settings for the local ML models in an FL environment. We evaluate the performance of our proposed technique using two case studies. First, we consider smart city services, and use an experimental transportation dataset for traffic prediction as a proxy for this setting. Second, we consider Industrial IoT(IIoT) services, and use the real-time telemetry dataset to predict the probability that a machine will fail shortly due to component failures. Our experiments indicate that PSO provides an efficient approach for tuning the hyperparameters of deep Long short-term memory (LSTM) models when compared to the grid search method. Our experiments illustrate that the number of client-server communication rounds to explore the landscape of configurations to find the near-optimal parameters are greatly reduced (roughly by two orders of magnitude needing only 2%-4% of the rounds compared to state of the art non-PSO-based approaches). We also demonstrate that utilizing the proposed PSO-based technique to find the near-optimal configurations for FL and centralized learning models does not adversely affect the accuracy of the models.",Optimization;Training;Neurons;Performance evaluation;Particle swarm optimization;Data privacy;Data models;Federated Learning;Deep Learning;Particle Swarm Optimization;Parameter Optimization;IoT;Smart Services

Most existing unattended parking lots suffer from a lack of seamless automation, instead deploying ticketing and payment at ingress and egress points or other systems with heavy user involvement that often form bottlenecks. Similarly, many lots use per-space sensing with expensive networking and power requirements simply to determine space occupancy. Parking solutions that are free from the delay caused by this user burden and infrastructure could experience faster occupancy turnover with lower cost. An ongoing challenge in developing seamless parking experiences is the detection and identification of vehicles in parking spaces without the need for complex and expensive per-space occupancy detection technology. We develop a smart parking solution that uses a single low-power wireless radio technology to seamlessly perform parked vehicle localization and transport of sensor data for use by a central management system. Our solution uses a sparse, self-forming network of dual-mode Bluetooth sensors within a parking area to observe the presence of customized authenticated Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacons placed in vehicles parked in the lot. Our localization technique is based on radio fingerprinting using Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values from the beacon, and a random forest machine learning classifier that predicts where the vehicle is parked based on its fingerprint. We implemented our solution in Python on commodity Internet of Things (IoT) hardware and deployed it to a 105 space outdoor parking lot. There, we conducted fingerprinting and prediction experiments. Our results show that our exact-space prediction model evaluates with a high accuracy using radio training data (90.7% correctly identified), and our in-vehicle tests show a promising result (69.17% accurate up to and including 3 spaces away), even without employing tuning and data filtering techniques. This encouraging result shows that localization using Bluetooth is a viable means of managing parked vehicles, with great promise for a variety of future parking management applications.",Bluetooth;Feature extraction;Space vehicles;Cryptography;Authentication;Mesh networks;Advertising

One of the key technology is to cluster vehicle trajectory. However, existing methods mainly rely on manually designed metrics which may lead to biased results. Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space. To address these challenges, we propose to employ network representation learning to achieve accurate vehicle trajectory clustering. Specifically, we first construct the k-nearest neighbor-based internet of vehicles in a dynamic manner. Then we learn the low-dimensional representations of vehicles by performing dynamic network representation learning on the constructed network.

Using “SCmules” such as taxis, to opportunistically communicate with intelligent devices and collect data from the sparse networks formed by them in the process of moving is an economical and effective way to achieve this goal. In this paper, the social welfare data collection paradigm SWDCP-SCmules data collection framework is proposed to collect data generated by intelligent devices and forward them to data centers, in which “SCmules” are data transmitters picking up data from nearby intelligent devices and then store-carry-forwarding them to nearby data centers via short-range wireless connections in the process of moving. Because of the storage limitations, “SCmules” need to weigh the value of data and select some less valuable data to discard when necessary. To quantify the value of data and find a well-performed selection strategy, the concept of priority is introduced to the SWDCP-SCmules scheme, and then, the simulated annealing for priority assignment SA-PA algorithm is proposed to guide the priority assignment. The SA-PA algorithm is a universal algorithm that can improve the performance of SWDCP-SCmules scheme by finding better priority assignment with respect to various optimization targets, such as maximizing collection rate or minimizing redundancy rate, in which priority assignment problem is converted into an optimization problem and simulated annealing is used to optimize the priority assignment. From the perspective of machine learning, the process of optimization is equal to automatically learn social-aware patterns from past GPS trajectory data. Experiments based on real GPS trajectory data of taxis in Beijing are conducted to show the effectiveness and efficiency of SWDCP-SCmules scheme and SA-PA algorithm.",Optimization;Public transportation;Global Positioning System;Trajectory;Smart cities;Data collection;Transmitters;Vehicular mobile networks;social welfare;data collection;opportunistic communication;oblivious data mules;simulated annealing;machine learning

Higher nocturnal air temperature (Tair) is associated with adverse effects on human health, higher mortality rates, and higher energy consumption. Prediction of the spatial distribution of Tair is a step toward the “Smart City” concept, providing an early warning system for vulnerable populations. The study of the spatial distribution of urban Tair was thus far limited by the low spatial resolution of traditional data sources. Volunteered geographic information provides alternative data with higher spatial density, with citizen weather stations monitoring Tair continuously in hundreds or thousands of locations within a single city. In this article, the aim was to predict the spatial distribution of nocturnal Tair in Berlin, Germany, one day in advance at a 30-m resolution using open-source remote sensing and geodata from Landsat and Urban Atlas, crowdsourced Tair data, and machine learning (ML) methods.

Deep Siamese convolutional neural networks have been applied to visual tracking recently because of their advantageous abilities to learn a matching function between the template and the target candidate. Unlike traditional Siamese networks, which separately treat the two branches, we propose deep Siamese cross-residual learning to entangle the two branches from the beginning to the end of the Siamese network. This strategy can make the two branches exchange instance-specific information at different nodes of the network and learn a more compact representation of the target. In addition, we propose a combined loss function, which consists of two complementary tasks. One task is to learn a matching function directly and the other one is to learn a classification function.

Existing indoor localization approaches mostly rely on fingerprint techniques, leveraging either spatially discrete fingerprints or temporally consecutive ones for localization. However, these approaches often suffer from large errors or high time overhead in practice due to signal ambiguities or long input sequences. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a framework utilizing multiple adaptive representations of signal sequences for localization, where each representation indicates a corresponding signal structure with underlying location clues. As an example, the proposed approach takes geomagnetic signal sequences as input and infers location features from two intuitive representations, e.g., spatial and temporal ones. With adaptive signal representations, the proposed approach takes specifically optimized neural networks to extract corresponding location clues respectively and fuses them to generate more distinguishing features for more accurate localization. Furthermore, the ensemble learning mechanism is adopted in the approach and a weighted k-NN based location estimation algorithm is devised to enhance the robustness. Extensive experiments in three different trial sites demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art competing schemes by a wide margin, reducing mean localization error by more than 46%.",Location awareness;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Indoor environment;Geomagnetism;Wireless fidelity;Signal representation;indoor localization;geomagnetism;signal representations;neural networks;ensemble learning

Most attacks on SVN occur due to wireless communications and information sharing between vehicles. Also, due to the communication among vehicles, failures can spread from the victim device to the entire network and cause widespread damages. SVN features include mobility, decentralization, resource constraints that make traditional security solutions unsuitable for it.

ANNs have not been used to explore relationships between variables, especially for road accidents which have small datasets. Analysis of road traffic accidents is often hampered due to insufficient datasets. Especially, for the cases when specific highway facilities are considered. This issue is also gaining importance for analyzing traveler behavior with the advent of new technologies and implementation of concepts of smart cities. The accident sites selected for this study comprise of unsignalized intersections in Penang State of Malaysia. Accidents in Malaysia have become a major concern for the authorities. However, the data collection is a major issue hindering its analysis because of limited datasets. The safe operation of traffic on unsignalized intersections mainly depends on drivers' judgement and decision making. Hence, the safety considerations on such locations are peculiar in comparison to other facilities. These facts led to carrying out the study for these sites. Two types of ANNs were used i.e. Multilayer Feedforward (MLFF) and linear. In addition, regression model and Mann-Whitney test were also used to compare the results from ANNs.

On the other hand, ANNs were able to approximate the relationship in conformity to the previous studies. It was found that major road width and near-to-far-volume ratio increases the accidents while near-to-far-gap ratio reduces the accidents.

However, cellular networks were originally designed for human-centric services with high-cost devices and ever-increasing rate requirements. In contrast, MTC services need to support low-cost, low-energy, massive number of devices. This poses a number of challenges toward the adaptation of current cellular networks to accommodate MTC. This article gives an overview of the conventional random access (RA) scheme of cellular networks and its variants in the literature. However, without discounting the efforts of optimizing the RA scheme, we show that due to the increased collisions and prohibitive overhead, it falls short to support MTC with reduced latency and guaranteed reliability.

With the rapid increasing of railway mileage, the energy consumption of train becomes a major concern. The uniqueness of train operations is that the geographic characteristics of each route is known a priori. On the other hand, the parameters (e.g., loads) of a train varies from trip to trip. Such a specialty determines that an energy-optimal driving profile for each train operation has to be pursued by considering both the geographic information and the inherent train conditions. The solution of the optimization problem, however, is hard due to its high dimension, nonlinearity, complex constraints and time-varying characteristics of a control sequence.

However, it is complex and long-term decision to find optimal location for a business. Therefore; we propose a smart business application that uses machine learning techniques to estimate the location of a business. The proposed system collects key feature values for a specific business and learns a prediction model for future data. It estimates features and suggests clusters of districts that have optimal locations for that specific business. The proposed system is evaluated on a use case that estimates the best possible locations of a restaurant according to main characteristics taken as inputs from entrepreneurs via a Web based application. These characteristics are Meal Price per customer, HouseHold Type, Gender, and Age. The first phase of decision process is estimating mentioned features such as House Price per district and local population belonging to different HouseHold type, Gender, and Age with less error rates for the consecutive years. Here; we determine an optimal regression model choosing from SMORegression (SMOReg), MultiLayerPerceptron (MLP), and multivariate Linear Regression (Linear) according to Relative Absolute Error (RAE %) parameter, for each feature. The second phase clusters districts according to these estimated features by using hierarchical tree.

In addition, unsupervised machine learning requires a clustering parameter value in advance, and may affect clustering performance according to prior information such as the number and size of clusters. In this case, the fuzzifier value m to be applied is the most important factor in improving the accuracy of data. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to perform clustering to automatically acquire the determination of m1 and m2 values that depended on existing repeated experiments. To this end, in order to increase efficiency on deriving appropriate fuzzifier value, we used the Interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy C-means (IT2PFCM), clustering method to classify a given pattern. In Efficient IT2PFCM method, used for clustering, we propose an algorithm that derives suitable fuzzifier values for each data. These values also extract information from each data point through the histogram approach and Gaussian Curve Fitting method. Using the extracted information, two adaptive fuzzifier value m1 and m2 are determined. Obtained values apply the new lowest and highest membership values. In addition, it is possible to form an appropriate fuzzy area on each cluster by only taking advantage of the characteristics of IT2PFCM, which reduces uncertainty. This doesn't only improve the accuracy of clustering of measured sensor data, but can also be used without additional procedures such as data labeling or the provision of prior information. It is also efficient at monitoring numerous sensors, managing and verifying sensor data collected in real time such as smart cities. Eventually, in this study, the proposed method is to improve IT2PFCM performance on accurate and quick clustering of large amount of complex data such as Internet of Things (IoT).",Clustering algorithms;Fuzzy sets;Phase change materials;Clustering methods;Uncertainty;Mathematical model;Sensitivity;Fuzzifier value determining;sensor data clustering;fuzzy C-means;histogram approach;interval type-2 PFCM

In a highly dynamic network environment like vehicular network, software-defined networking (SDN) promises to be an ideal solution. However, it also opens doors for various distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. An attacker can easily flood short-lived spoofed flows and exhaust network resources. This motivates us to find a solution to detect the attacks in a V2I communication under SDN. In this paper, we propose a machine learning (ML) based DDoS attack detection.

The services composition problem aims to find a set of services among functionally equivalent services with different Quality of Service (QoS) concerning users' constraints. To this aim, previous studies calculate QoS values through service logs without considering the presence of anomalies in the existing QoS values; however, the dynamicity of distributed service environments and communication networks in CloudIoT environments causes anomalies in the QoS values. Therefore, existing approaches fail to model QoS values accurately that leads to service-level agreement (SLA) violation and penalties for service broker.

In this paper, we propose a new machine learning based strategy to detect spoofing attacks in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Based on detailed analytical models for the mobile radio channel, the proposed algorithm combines two classifiers to process and analyze the instant samples of received signal strength to detect attacks. The algorithm is optimized for scenarios where the legitimate node and the attacking node are at the same distance or at a very close distance from each other in relation to the landmark, what is the worst case scenario.

The ability to perform analytics on these data, however, is highly limited by the difficulties of collecting labels. Indeed, the machine learning techniques used to perform analytics rely upon data labels to learn and to validate results. Historically, crowdsourcing platforms have been used to gather labels, yet they cannot be directly used in the IoT because of poor human readability of sensor data. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a framework for sensor data analytics which leverages the power of crowdsourcing through gamification to acquire sensor data labels. The framework uses gamification as a socially engaging vehicle and as a way to motivate users to participate in various labelling tasks. To demonstrate the framework proposed, a case study is also presented.

In other words, IoT is the driving force behind home automation, smart cities, modern health systems, and advanced manufacturing. This also increases the likelihood of cyber threats against IoT devices and services. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in application protocols, including Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) that interact directly with backend database systems and client-server applications to store data of IoT services. Successful exploitation of one or more of these protocols can result in data leakage and security breaches. In this paper, an ensemble intrusion detection technique is proposed to mitigate malicious events, in particular botnet attacks against DNS, HTTP, and MQTT protocols utilized in IoT networks. New statistical flow features are generated from the protocols based on an analysis of their potential properties. Then, an AdaBoost ensemble learning method is developed using three machine learning techniques, namely decision tree, Naive Bayes (NB), and artificial neural network, to evaluate the effect of these features and detect malicious events effectively. The UNSW-NB15 and NIMS botnet datasets with simulated IoT sensors' data are used to extract the proposed features and evaluate the ensemble technique. The experimental results show that the proposed features have the potential characteristics of normal and malicious activity using the correntropy and correlation coefficient measures. Moreover, the proposed ensemble technique provides a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate compared with each classification technique included in the framework and three other state-of-the-art techniques.",Protocols;Feature extraction;Internet of Things;Botnet;Temperature sensors;TCPIP;Botnet;ensemble learning;Internet of Things (IoT);network intrusion detection system (NIDS);statistical flow features

10.1109/MDAT.2020.2971201,,"Theocharides, Theocharis and Shafique, Muhammad and Choi, Jungwook and Mutlu, Onur",2020,Guest Editorial: Robust Resource-Constrained Systems for Machine Learning,article,IEEE Design Test,ieee,"Machine learning (ML) is nowadays embedded in several computing devices, consumer electronics, and cyber-physical systems. Smart sensors are deployed everywhere, in applications such as wearables and perceptual computing devices, and intelligent algorithms power our connected world. These devices collect and aggregate volumes of data, and in doing so, they augment our society in multiple ways; from healthcare, to social networks, to consumer electronics, and many more. To process these immense volumes of data, ML is emerging as the de facto analysis tool that powers several aspects of our Big Data society. Applications spanning from infrastructure (smart cities, intelligent transportation systems, smart grids, and to name a few), to social networks and content delivery, to e-commerce and smart factories, and emerging concepts such as self-driving cars and autonomous robots, are powered by ML technologies. These emerging systems require real-time inference and decision support; such scenarios, therefore, may use customized hardware accelerators, are typically bound by limited resources, and are restricted to limited connectivity and bandwidth. Thus, near-sensor computation and near-sensor intelligence have started emerging as necessities to continue supporting the paradigm shift of our connected world. The need for real-time intelligent data analytics (especially in the era of Big Data) for decision support near the data acquisition points emphasizes the need for revolutionizing the way we design, build, test, and verify processors, accelerators, and systems that facilitate ML (and deep learning, in particular) implemented in resource-constrained environments for use at the edge and the fog. As such, traditional von Neumann architectures are no longer sufficient and suitable, primarily because of limitations in both performance and energy efficiency caused especially by large amounts of data movement. Furthermore, due to the connected nature of such systems, security and reliability are also critically important. Robustness, therefore, in the form of reliability and operational capability in the presence of faults, whether malicious or accidental, is a critical need for such systems. Moreover, the operating nature of these systems relies on input data that is characterized by the four “V’s”: velocity (speed of data generation), variability (variable forms and types), veracity (unreliable and unpredictable), and volume (i.e., large amounts of data). Thus, the robustness of such systems needs to consider this issue as well. Furthermore, robustness in terms of security, and in terms of reliability to hardware and software faults, in particular, besides their importance when it comes to safety-critical applications, is also a positive factor in building trustworthiness toward these disrupting technologies from our society. To achieve this envisioned robustness, we need to refocus on problems such as design, verification, architecture, scheduling and allocation policies, optimization, and many more, for determining the most efficient, secure, and reliable way of implementing these novel applications within a robust, resource-constrained system, which may or may not be connected. This special issue, therefore, addresses a key aspect of fog and edge-based ML algorithms; robustness (as defined above) under resource-constraint scenarios. The special issue presents emerging works in how we design robust systems, both in terms of reliability as well as fault tolerance and security, while operating with a limited number of resources, and possibly in the presence of harsh environments that may eliminate connectivity and pollute the input data.",Special issues and sections;Machine learning;Resource management;Training data;Artificial intelligence

IoT systems are also creating a significant amount of new data which can now be processed to analyze and learn from using novel machine-learning techniques. However, the requirements for communications can vary significantly depending on the target applications, and they can range from ultra-low power for enabling a vast deployment of sensors with multi-year battery life to ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) for smart factories and remote robot control. 5G, as an example, is expected to deliver a number of enhancements to support massive IoT deployments as well as URLLC capabilities for new verticals such as Smart Cities, Industrial IoT, E-Health, Public Safety, and Autonomous Vehicles (V2V, V2X).

A lot of attention has been devoted to the tsunami of data produced by IoT, and the related means of extracting useful actionable information from it, spawning efforts in Big Data processing and machine learning. Yet, all of this does little to address the need for IoT to capture, interpret, and act on this wall of (noisy) information at the right time, at the right place, and in the right form. Conventional computing systems are a poor match to the needs of this emerging massively distributed real-time system. Hence, alternative computing techniques present an attractive alternative, trading off computational resolution for significant gains in quality-of-service energy efficiency and robustness. This observation is based on the conjecture that most applications related to IoT have an inherent error resilience and are evolutionary (that is, learning-based). Alternative computing strategies may be conceived at every level of the design hierarchy, starting from the device level with novel 3-D nonvolatile memory/logic combinations, or at the architectural level by shifting away from the traditional von Neumann architecture to different computing paradigms such as neuromorphic and/or stochastic computation all the way up to the algorithmic and data representation levels.",Special issues and sections;Internet of Things;Big Data;Machine learning;Energy efficiency;Neural networks

However, the costs for deployment and maintenance of mobile edge computing (MEC) are still high. Human-driven edge computing (HEC) is a novel model which integrates the elements of human, devices, internet and information, and combines the power of MEC architecture and the large-scale sensing ability of mobile crowd-sensing (MCS). Realizing better data spreading and environmental coverage in smart cities based on HEC has aroused a great deal of research interest from academia and industry.

In parallel, there has been a strong growth in integrating intelligence, often in the form of machine/deep learning, into applications, which also leads to vastly increasing computational requirements.

Most of the exiting methods of urban route planning are either graph based search algorithms or optimization methods, however they show many weaknesses in real-world applications due to their high computational complexities and needs for global information of urban environments. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based default logic for route planning. The proposed method is composed of three parts. The first part is the default theory of route planning, forcing no loops in the generated routes. The second part is the RNN based default reasoning to recommend default rules. The RNN outputs the probability distribution of the defaults used next, so the proposed method is a probabilistic method. The third part is the update algorithm of map models to improve the accuracy of default reasoning in dynamic environments. Training the proposed RNN is simple because no statistic computation is required for training. The time complexity of the proposed method during testing is just O(ρ2), where ρ is the length of the optimal route for two given nodes. To evaluate the proposed method, we build a new map model named BJ simulating the complex urban environments of the Beijing city, China.

The number of factors that influence the identification easily runs into a few hundreds (including floor space area, crime in the locality and so on). Existing literature predominantly focuses on the analysis of price trends in a given location. This paper aims to develop a set of tools to compute an optimal location for investment, a problem which has received little attention in the literature (analysis of house price trends has received more attention). In previous work the authors proposed a machine learning approach for computing optimal locations. There are two main issues with the previous work. All real estate factors were assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables. To address this, in the current paper we propose a network structure to derive the relational inferences between the factors. However, solving the location identification problem using only a network incurs computational burden. Hence, the machine learning layers from the previous work is combined with a network layer for computing an optimal location with proven lower computational cost. A second issue is that the computations are performed on an online database which has inherent privacy risks. The online data, user information and the algorithms can be tampered through privacy breaches. We present a privacy preservation technique to protect the algorithms, and use blockchains to secure the identity of the user. This paper presents solutions to two interesting problems in the analysis of real estate networks: a) to design tools that can identify an optimal location for investment and b) to preserve the privacy of the entire process using privacy preserving techniques and block chains.",Time complexity; Complex network science; Machine learning; Real estate investment; Data privacy; Blockchains

To improve the accuracy of object segmentation and to solve the problem of inadequate edge recognition, a joint-learning segmentation scheme was designed that combines the conditional random field (CRF) model with an improved U-net model. It employs the improved U-net model as the front-end model of the joint-learning framework for feature fusion and the CRF model as the back-end of the joint-learning framework for transforming to gradient optimization-based recurrent neural networks. The joint-learning framework enables the front and back parts to interact with each other to obtain the location of the target and its classification information accurately. The joint-learning framework was realized on open datasets and compared with state-of-the-art remote-sensing image segmentation algorithms.

The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based image demosaicking and denoising methods has been very successful. However, still there is a room for improvement in the network performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The main challenge that remains to be addressed is to guarantee the visual quality of reconstructed images, particularly in the presence of noise. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel demosaicking and denoising conjunct strategy using deep adaptive residual learning. The proposed framework has three stages. Initially, zero padding is performed to increase processing speed and preserve the edges of the image. In the second phase, we perform demosaicking using interpolation in order to find missing values using information about neighboring pixels. Finally, the reconstructed image is created using the original image. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, we used Pytorch and Google Colab with 400 images for training and 100 images for validation The outcomes show that the proposed scheme beats cutting edge joint demosaicking and denoising schemes regarding both structural similarity index metrics (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and basic similitude record measurements (SSIM).",Smart cities; Low power energy; Demosaicking; Cnn; Noise; Surveillance

However, the performance of a WSN is highly vulnerable to various types of security threats. Any intrusion may reduce the performance of the WSN and result in fatal problems. Hence, fast intrusion detection and prevention is of great use. This paper aims towards fast detection and prevention of any intrusion using a machine learning approach based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model. We have proposed three methods (S-GPR, C-GPR and GPR) based on feature scaling for accurate prediction of k-barrier coverage probability. We have selected the number of nodes, sensing range, Sensor to Intruder Velocity Ratio (SIVR), Mobile to Static Node Ratio (MSNR), angle of the intrusion path, and required k as the potential features. These features are extracted using an analytical approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method III accurately predicts the k-barrier coverage probability and outperforms the other two methods (I and II) with a correlation coefficient (R = 0.85) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.095).

These datasets constitute a rich source of information that can be used to extract knowledge useful for municipalities and citizens. In this paper we are interested in exploiting such data to estimate future speed in traffic sensor networks, as accurate predictions have the potential to enhance decision making capabilities of traffic management systems. Building effective speed prediction models in large cities poses important challenges that stem from the complexity of traffic patterns, the number of traffic sensors typically deployed, and the evolving nature of sensor networks. Indeed, sensors are frequently added to monitor new road segments or replaced/removed due to different reasons (e.g., maintenance). Exploiting a large number of sensors for effective speed prediction thus requires smart solutions to collect vast volumes of data and train effective prediction models. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of real-world sensor networks calls for solutions that are resilient not only to changes in traffic behavior, but also to changes in the network structure, where the cold start problem represents an important challenge. We study three different approaches in the context of large and dynamic sensor networks: local, global, and cluster-based. The local approach builds a specific prediction model for each sensor of the network. Conversely, the global approach builds a single prediction model for the whole sensor network. Finally, the cluster-based approach groups sensors into homogeneous clusters and generates a model for each cluster. We provide a large dataset, generated from ∼1.3 billion records collected by up to 272 sensors deployed in Fortaleza, Brazil, and use it to experimentally assess the effectiveness and resilience of prediction models built according to the three aforementioned approaches.

Understanding the driver behavior is an essential component in Intelligent Driver Assistance Systems. One of potential cause of traffic fatalities is aggressive driving behavior. However, drivers are not fully aware of their aggressive actions. So, in order to increase awareness and to promote driver safety, a novel system has been proposed. In this work, we focus on DTW based event detection technique, which have not been researched in motion sensors based time series data to a great extent. Our motivation is to improve the classification accuracy to detect sudden braking and aggressive driving behaviors using sensory data collected from smartphone. A very significant feature of DTW is to be able to automatically cope with time deformations and different speeds associated with time-dependent data which makes it suitable for our chosen application where data might get affected due to factors such as: high variability in road and vehicle conditions, heterogeneous smartphone sensors, etc. Our technique is novel as it uses fusion of sensors to enhance detection accuracy.

The estimation takes into account appliances, electrical heating, cooling, lighting, cooking and EC by m2 on a building level. The results are spatialized on different territorial scales. Using cadastral data of more than 1,700,000 Walloon buildings and annual EC data from a sample collected in 2012 from the energy reports, the paper assesses the EC of the whole building stock and tests to what extent different types of variables (building factors and socio-demographics) explain annual EC. It then shows which individual variables have the highest explanatory power. In contrast to many other studies, the research recognizes the problem of multicollinearity between predictors in regression analysis and uses Lasso regression to address this issue. Three separate regression models were used to study the predictors of annual EC of residential, tertiary and industrial buildings. EC building factors (appliances, auxiliary and main heating, domestic hot water and cooking) explained the largest share which is 66.46% of the variability in EC for residential buildings whereas the EC usages share for tertiary buildings (lighting, heating and domestic hot water, air conditioning, cooling, etc.) is about 50.53% and 38.55% for industrial buildings. Socio-demographic variables on their own explained about 61.59%, 26.34% and 3.41% of the annual EC, respectively for residential, tertiary and industrial buildings. Hence, the building variables present the highest explanatory power for EC, presumably because heating and cooling EC are included in this study. The study highlights that when attempting to explain EC related to Walloon households, including heating and cooling EC, appliances usage has the strongest predictive power in residential buildings. On the other hand, the projected decrease in EC use for heating in existing residential buildings is −8.82% and −10% for existing tertiary buildings while the projected increase in EC use for cooling in existing tertiary buildings is + 11.94% from 2012 to 2050 on a regional scale.

The proposed strategy is inserted inside the core a hybrid metaheuristic model, applied for learning patterns from an important mini/microgrid forecasting problem, the household electricity demand forecasting. The future smart cities will surely rely on distributed energy generation, in which citizens should be aware about how to manage and control their own resources. In this sense, energy disaggregation research will be part of several typical and useful microgrid applications. Computational results show that the proposed GPU learning strategy is scalable as the number of training rounds increases, emerging as a promising deep learning tool to be embedded into smart sensors.",Deep learning; Graphics processing unit; Hybrid forecasting model; Smart sensors; Household electricity demand; Big data time-series

Rodrigues,2022,Oppositional chaos game optimization based clustering with trust based data transmission protocol for intelligent IoT edge systems,article,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,science_direct,"In the past decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes essential in consumer and industrial applications. The accessibility of high bandwidth Internet connection particularly with the arrival of robust 5G networks rises to innovative IoT solutions such as smart city, automobiles, industry 4.0, etc. IoT analytics represents edge computing as a term commonly employed for defining intelligent computational resources placed closer to the source of data generation. Despite the benefits of the IoT edge systems, security and energy efficiency remains major challenging issues. With this motivation, this paper presents an energy-efficient clustering based secure data transmission protocol (EEC-SDTP) for Intelligent IoT Edge systems. The goal of the EEC-SDTP technique is to select an appropriate set of cluster heads (CHs) and optimally secure routes for data transmission in the network. The proposed model involves oppositional chaos game optimization-based clustering (OCGOC) technique for proper CH selection and cluster construction. Besides, a trust-based model is designed to determine the trustworthiness of the node in the IoT edge systems. The proposed OCGOC technique derives a fitness function utilizing 3 input parameters like trust level, distance to neighbors, and energy. Finally, a trust-based secure routing protocol using the quantum sand piper optimization (SRP-QSPO) technique is employed to derive routes for secure data transmission. For examining the better efficiency of the proposed EEC-SDTP algorithm, an extensive group of experimentations were performed and the outcomes are investigated under several performance measures. The experimental outcomes highlighted the improved efficiency of the proposed method over the other related techniques.",Internet of Things; Edge computing; Artificial intelligence; Trust sensing model; Security

Although much research has been done on this subject, the efficiency and accuracy of existing water meter pointer reading technology can still be improved. This paper proposes a new water meter pointer reading recognition method based on target-key point detection. Our method consists of a target detection module and a key point detection module. The target detection module uses a modified YOLOv4-Tiny network to detect and classify the areas where the dials and pointers are located in water meter images with distinct characteristics. The key point detection module is used to detect the key point of the pointer image. In this module, the structure of the RFB-Net network is improved to introduce multiple layers of low-level feature information, therefore, it can make full use of the information between multi-scale feature layers for key point detection. In addition to, aiming at the problem of dial rotation, a method of establishing a right-angle coordinate system based on key point is proposed to realize pointer reading. The whole method proposed in this paper is compared to the Hough transform feature matching algorithm and traditional machine learning algorithms through experiments which test the detection and recognition of the water meter dial, pointer and key points. The experiment results show that the missed detection rate of the model in this paper is 1.88% and 1.07% for the dial region and the pointer region, respectively. And the accuracy rate reaches 98.68%, the average processing time per image is 0.37 s. This implies that the water meter inspection task is completed quickly and accurately with strong robustness.

As a modern management tool, energy management system provides a new way of intelligent management for iron and steel companies. The energy management system can be used to monitor the energy consumption in real time, master the energy consumption of the company and allocate the energy consumption of the company. So we can get better production plan, reduce the energy consumption of the company, and improve the competitiveness of the company. Two functions, energy allocation and energy consumption prediction, are developed in the energy management system.

As the roadmap of urban traffic, the urban expressway has a relatively high and stable driving speed, and also bears a large amount of urban traffic. However, in recent years, with the expansion of the city scale, the congestion of urban expressways has become increasingly severe. In various areas of the merged area, due to various factors such as mismatched traffic capacity and reduced driving speed, it is easy to cause deterioration of road conditions in a short period of time and cause more secondary accidents. In order to reduce the incidence of expressway traffic accidents and to avoid as much as possible the casualties and property losses caused by accidents, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) supported by information technology, data communication transmission technology, control technology and traffic engineering were introduced. With the rise of artificial intelligence and the continuous development of ITS, the video acquisition methods of real-time traffic flow data and the image recognition ability of video sequences continue to improve, providing theoretical basis and technical support for the research of urban expressway parallel pattern recognition. Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional pattern recognition methods, such as weak anti-interference to complex traffic environment and low correct recognition rate, this paper studies the pattern recognition method based on image processing, and selects the fuzzy C-means clustering in the currently used clustering methods (FCM) algorithm Because the FCM algorithm cannot obtain the global optimal solution and need to determine the number of cluster categories in advance, this paper uses ReliefF algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to compare the feature weight and number of clusters of traditional FCM algorithm.

In the past, traffic data were usually acquired and disseminated by government agencies through fixed-location sensors. High costs, infrastructure demands, and low coverage levels of these sensor devices require agencies and researchers to look beyond the traditional approaches. With the emergence of smartphones and navigation apps, location-based and crowdsourced Big Data are receiving increased attention. In this regard, location-based big data (LocBigData) collected from probe vehicles and road users can be used to provide speed and travel time information in different locations. Examining the quality of crowdsourced data is essential for researchers and agencies before using them. This study assessed the quality of Waze speed data from surface streets and conducted a case study in Sevierville, Tennessee. Typically, examining the quality of these data in surface streets and arterials is more challenging than freeways data. This research used Bluetooth speed data as the ground truth, which is independent of Waze data. In this study, three steps of methodology were used. In the first step, Waze speed data was compared to Bluetooth data in terms of accuracy, mean difference, and distribution similarity. In the second step, a k-means algorithm was used to categorize Waze data quality, and a multinomial logistics regression model was performed to explore the significant factors that impact data quality. Finally, in the third step, machine learning techniques were conducted to predict the data quality in different conditions. The result of the comparison showed a similar pattern and a slight difference between datasets, which verified the quality of Waze speed data. The statistical model indicates that that Waze speed data are more accurate in peak hours than in night hours. Also, the traffic speed, traffic volume, and segment length have a significant association on the accuracy of Waze data on surface streets. Finally, the result of machine learning prediction showed that a KNN method performed the highest prediction accuracy of 84.5% and 82.9% of the time for training and test datasets, respectively.

Further, the optimization process is a vital phase for the decrement of collision rate among moving objects, where the widely used Simulated Annealing (SA) usually suffers from the issue of slow convergence rate with a high computational overhead. Taking these aforementioned facts into account for feature extraction, we formulate a foreground extraction scheme exploring the concept of multi-frame and multi-scale in Generative Adversarial Network (mFS-GANs).

Previous research has especially focussed on pole-like road furniture, such as traffic signs and lamp posts. Published methods have mainly classified road furniture as individual objects. However, most road furniture consists of a combination of classes, such as a traffic sign mounted on a street light pole. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework to interpret road furniture at a more detailed level. Instead of being interpreted as single objects, mobile laser scanning data of road furniture is decomposed in elements individually labelled as poles, and objects attached to them, such as, street lights, traffic signs and traffic lights. In our framework, we first detect road furniture from unorganised mobile laser scanning point clouds. Then detected road furniture is decomposed into poles and attachments (e.g. traffic signs). In the interpretation stage, we extract a set of features to classify the attachments by utilising a knowledge-driven method and four representative types of machine learning classifiers, which are random forest, support vector machine, Gaussian mixture model and naïve Bayes, to explore the optimal method. The designed features are the unary features of attachments and the spatial relations between poles and their attachments. Two experimental test sites in Enschede dataset and Saunalahti dataset were applied, and Saunalahti dataset was collected in two different epochs. In the experimental results, the random forest classifier outperforms the other methods, and the overall accuracy acquired is higher than 80% in Enschede test site and higher than 90% in both Saunalahti epochs. The designed features play an important role in the interpretation of road furniture.

Firstly, combined with the dynamic monitoring model of fracturing fluid, many parameters are optimized and analyzed. The velocity monitoring of fracturing fluid is realized by constructing the average velocity formula of fracturing fluid, and its approximate position is calculated. After analyzing the limitations of traditional models, the monitoring model of the unsteady friction resistance is established by summarizing the existing models and fitting the weight function by the gradient descent method. In this paper, the relationship between the pressure-time curve and crack is studied. Then the pressure curve is optimized by OPTICS algorithm improved by the adjacency list, and conduct the unsupervised learning about the stress data. By using computers, the pressure data can be clustered automatically. The classification is rapid and more accurate than the manual classification, which improves the intelligence and accuracy of data analysis, and realizes more accurate and intuitive monitoring of fractures than before.

Given the power of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in learning temporal relations and graph neural networks (GNNs) in integrating graph-structured and node-attributed features, in this paper, we design a novel graph LSTM (GLSTM) framework to capture spatial-temporal representations in road speed forecasting.

To provide value-add services in these environments, data will have to be analysed to extract knowledge. Currently, this is typically achieved through centralised cloud-based data analytics services. However, according to many studies, this approach may present significant issues from the standpoint of data ownership, and even wireless network capacity. One possibility to cope with these shortcomings is to move data analytics closer to where data is generated. In this paper we tackle this issue by proposing and analysing a distributed learning framework, whereby data analytics are performed at the edge of the network, i.e., on locations very close to where data is generated. Specifically, in our framework, partial data analytics are performed directly on the nodes that generate the data, or on nodes close by (e.g., some of the data generators can take this role on behalf of subsets of other nodes nearby). Then, nodes exchange partial models and refine them accordingly. Our framework is general enough to host different analytics services. In the specific case analysed in the paper we focus on a learning task, considering two distributed learning algorithms. Using an activity recognition and a pattern recognition task, both on reference datasets, we compare the two learning algorithms between each other and with a central cloud solution (i.e., one that has access to the complete datasets).

Moreover, as smart cities continue to deploy diversified technologies to achieve assorted and high-performance cloud services, security issues with regards to communicating entities which share personal requester information still prevails. To mitigate these concerns, we introduce an automated secure continuous cloud service availability framework for smart connected vehicles that enables an intrusion detection mechanism against security attacks and provides services that meet users’ quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) requirements. Continuous service availability is achieved by clustering smart vehicles into service-specific clusters. Cluster heads are selected for communication purposes with trusted third-party entities (TTPs) acting as mediators between service requesters and providers. The most optimal services are then delivered from the selected service providers to the requesters. Furthermore, intrusion detection is accomplished through a three-phase data traffic analysis, reduction, and classification technique used to identify positive trusted service requests against false requests that may occur during intrusion attacks. The solution adopts deep belief and decision tree machine learning mechanisms used for data reduction and classification purposes, respectively. The framework is validated through simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in terms of intrusion attack detection.

One of the core functions of a smart city consists in the continuous monitoring of events, assets and people and the use of this information and intelligence for the streamlining of the city’s operations. Public opinion represents one type of intelligence of particular importance and value. By monitoring public opinion, governments seek to understand prevalent views about the current events and policies, as well as identify extreme views and trends that may represent problematic situations or precursors to violent actions. Ultimately, maintaining a constant awareness of public opinion means that authorities can better assess and predict public reactions in relation to ongoing events, and thus take appropriate actions to maintain public safety. Due to the popular use of social media to express sentiments and emotions about current events, social media content analysis has been contemplated as a promising solution to capture public opinion. However, existing approaches take a coarse-grained retrospective approach to social media content analysis. Furthermore, those approaches suffer from the lack of scalability and efficiency, as they necessitate the collection and analysis of large volumes of social media content (often millions of posts), to come up with relevant conclusions. In this work, we address those limitations by proposing a novel framework for the real-time monitoring of public opinion. To ensure efficiency and scalability, our framework focuses on the analysis of high impact social media content generated by opinion leaders and their followers as means to offer in-depth insights and sentiment intelligence reports about events, as they are occurring in real time. The proposed framework was implemented and tested on data harvested from 52 economic opinion leaders, with a focus on the China-US trade war as case study. The results show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier used for sentiment analysis yielded a classification accuracy of 86% when differentiating between four sentiment categories: Support, strong support, dissent, and strong dissent. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier employed to perform in-depth emotional analysis attained an accuracy of 82% when differentiating between five emotions: Angry, depressed, excited, happy, and worried. Unlike existing retrospective social media analysis approaches that require the analysis of millions of posts, our approach focuses on the analysis of high-impact social media content in real-time, thus constituting an efficient, sustainable, and timely solution to public opinion monitoring.",Smart cities; Sustainable cities; Public opinion; Opinion leaders; Sentiment analysis

Among all the early signs of potential damage in infrastructure systems, formation of cracks is a critical one because it is directly related to the structural capacity and could significantly affect the serviceability of the infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based method considering the connectivity of pixels for automatic pavement crack detection which has the potential to complement the current practice involving visual inspection which is costly, inefficient and time-consuming. In the proposed method, the convolutional layers are densely connected in a feed-forward fashion to reuse features from multiple layers, and transposed convolution layers are used for multiple level feature fusion. A novel loss function considering the connectivity of pixels is introduced to overcome the issues related to the output of transposed convolution layers. The proposed method is tested on two datasets, where the first one is collected from a handheld smartphone and the second one is collected from a high-speed camera mounted on the rear of a moving car. In both datasets, the proposed method shows superior performance than other available methods.",Crack detection; Deep learning; Transposed convolution layer; Densely connected layers; Connectivity of pixels

The field of AI, and more broadly the development of artificial cognitive machines, is making breathtaking advances. A significant increase in computing power is enabling the rapid adoption of a new paradigm of AI, whereby cognitive machines are no longer programmed line by line, instruction by instruction, but instead are now capable of learning autonomously, thereby continuously developing themselves. The new paradigm is unleashing extraordinary progress in a wide range of applications, from healthcare to transportation and even the justice system; at the same time, these new forms of intelligence are making decisions in complex ways that escape the limits of human comprehension. The technological transformation driven by artificial cognitive machines is already beginning to have far reaching consequences, some unintended, at a scale and pace which exceeds even that of the first and second industrial revolutions. This paper aims to discuss these implications, both with an ontological and epistemological perspective, to assess the potential challenges for the systemic viability of democratic societies: a fundamental change in the nature of economic wealth creation, which could raise significant social tensions, combined with the paradoxical reduction in the effectiveness of human communication.

We develop a crowd counting algorithm to provide the counting information for a bus dispatch system in a human–machine system. In consideration of the challenges (e.g., pedestrian occlusions, non-uniform crowd distributions, and scale variations) existed in hand-crafted features based crowd counting, a scale-distribution-aware multi-column convolutional neural network (SDA-MCNN) is presented to count crowds by summing up the output (denoted as the density map) of the SDA-MCNN.

A weighted Euclidean loss is proposed to handle non-uniform crowd distributions. The loss can increase activations in dense regions and restrain activations in backgrounds. A new approach to estimate perspective maps of dense crowds is put forward to offer necessary information for generating density maps with human-shaped kernels.

Digitalization enables smart cities such as Moscow to do more work with less resources.

To improve its waste management, lessons drawn from Berlin's experiences in waste management are discussed to inspire transformation in the city's waste sector in the framewok of resource recovery. In line with the 2030 UN Agenda, this work proposes a digitalization to accelerate societal transitions through waste recycling industry. Its global relevance is elaborated by presenting perspective of digitalization in waste management practices. In this work, case-study was selected as the research method to provide a means to investigate a complex waste problem in Moscow and Berlin. It was evident from cleaner production paradigm that digital technology can minimize the amount of unrecycled MSW, while conserving raw materials and reducing operational cost and GHG emissions. Digitalization builds cities' resilience by strengthening local waste management practices to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. In Moscow, the transition towards the digitalization of waste recycling through informal waste sectors has created 5,000 new jobs that reduces unemployment rate. This maximizes pick up time and enhance efficiency with a lower cost of operating trucks up to 75%. A convolutional neural network–based identification system that classifies identified materials yields almost perfect accuracy.

This paper proposes an S-Mask-RCNN network that integrates spatial attention mechanisms for pedestrian segmentation. Mask-RCNN uses residual neural networks in the feature extraction network, and the effect of model feature extraction is not ideal. Based on transfer learning, a spatial attention mechanism is introduced to focus more spatially on areas that need attention. The force mechanism focuses more on the areas that need attention in space.

Fortunately, more and more important smart cities are adopting the concept of intelligent surveillance systems. In these situations, intelligent surveillance systems require the most advanced techniques of crowd analysis to monitor crowd events properly. In this review, we explore various studies related to crowd analysis. Crowd analysis is commonly broken down into two major branches: crowd statistics and crowd behavior analysis. When crowd statistics determines the Level Of Service (LoS) of a crowded scene, crowd behavior analysis describes the motion patterns and the activities that are observed in a scene. One of the hottest topics of crowd analysis is anomaly detection. Although a unanimous definition of anomaly has not yet been met, each of crowd analysis subtopics can be subjected to abnormality.

There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China.

This study presents an intelligent data mining methodology as part of an expert system developed for SHM with noisy and delayed signals, which are generated by a through-substrate self-powered sensor network.

Based on this concept, vehicles can be used as code disseminators. That is, infrastructures of a smart city can be upgraded by receiving updated program codes that are disseminated by vehicles in the VSNs. Specifically, vehicles in the 5G network are hard to be managed. Under this domain, safety of program codes is a key challenge. Meanwhile, improving coverage of program codes is also challenging. However, arranging plenty of vehicles as code disseminators will incur large costs of the ground control station (GCS). Therefore, by utilizing machine learning methods, this paper proposes a “Machine Learning based Code Dissemination by Selecting Reliability Mobile Vehicles in 5G Networks” (MLCD) scheme to choose vehicles with higher reliable degree and coverage ratio as code disseminators to deliver code with lower costs. Firstly, reliable degrees of vehicles are calculated and selected to improve safety degree of code disseminations. Secondly, vehicles with higher coverage ratio are preferred to promise code coverage. Thirdly, machine learning methods are utilized to select vehicles with both higher coverage ratios and reliable degrees as code disseminators with limited costs. Compared to random-selection and coverage-only scheme respectively, the MLCD scheme can improve safety degree of code dissemination process by 83.6% and 18.86% in 5G networks, and can improve coverage ratio of updated information by 23.16%. Comprehensive performances of the proposed scheme can be improved by 80.56% and 17.25% respectively.

Fog computing overcomes this limitation and supports the requirements of time-sensitive applications by distributing computation, communication, and storage services along the Cloud to Things (C2T) continuum, empowering potential new applications, such as smart cities, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). However, the adoption of Fog-based computational resources and their integration with the Cloud introduces new challenges in resource management, which requires the implementation of new strategies to guarantee compliance with the quality of service (QoS) requirements of applications. In this context, one major question is how to map the QoS requirements of applications on Fog and Cloud resources. One possible approach is to discriminate the applications arriving at the Fog into Classes of Service (CoS). This paper thus introduces a set of CoS for Fog applications which includes, the QoS requirements that best characterize these Fog applications. Moreover, this paper proposes the implementation of a typical machine learning classification methodology to discriminate Fog computing applications as a function of their QoS requirements. Furthermore, the application of this methodology is illustrated in the assessment of classifiers in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness to noise.

The increasing amount of waste generated, and the collection and treatment of waste poses a major challenge to modern urban planning in general, and to smart cities in particular. To cope with this problem, automated vacuum waste collection (AVWC) uses air suction on a closed network of underground pipes to transport waste from the drop off points scattered throughout the city to a central collection point, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the inconveniences of conventional methods (odours, noise, etc.). Since a significant part of the cost of operating AVWC systems is energy consumption, we have developed a model with the aim of applying constraint programming technology to schedule the daily emptying sequences of the drop off points in such a way that energy consumption is minimized. In this paper we describe how the problem of deciding the drop off points that should be emptied at a given time can be modeled as a constraint integer programming (CIP) problem.

In this paper, we address the limitation of centralized IDS for resource-constrained devices by proposing two methods, namely semi-distributed and distributed, that combine well-performing feature extraction and selection and exploit potential fog-edge coordinated analytics. In order to distribute the computational tasks, we individually develop parallel machine-learning models corresponding to a partitioned attack dataset. In the semi-distributed case, the parallel models, running on the edge side, are applied for side-by-side feature selections, which are then followed by a single multi-layer perceptron classification running on the fog side. In the distributed case, the parallel models individually perform both the feature selection and multi-layer perceptron classification after which the outputs are combined by a coordinating edge or fog for final decision making. Based on the comparative study of existing works, the numerical results demonstrate the promise of the proposed methods, giving a comparable detection accuracy to the superior centralized IDS as well as exemplify their inherent trade-offs between the accuracy and building time performance.",Feature extraction; Feature selection; IDS; Intrusion detection; IoT; Machine learning; Semi-distributed; Distributed

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art accuracy comes at a computational cost rarely available in the edge cloud. At the same time, due to strict latency constraints and the vast amount of bandwidth edge cameras generate, we can no longer rely on offloading the task to a centralized cloud. Consequently, there is a need for a meeting point between the resource-constrained edge cloud and accurate real-time video analytics. If state-of-the-art models are too expensive to run on the edge, and lightweight models are not accurate enough for the use cases in the edge, one solution is to demand less from the lightweight model and specialize it in a narrower scope of the problem, a technique known as model specialization. By specializing a model to the context of a single camera, we can boost its accuracy while keeping its computational cost constant. However, this also involves one training per camera, which quickly becomes unfeasible unless the entire process is fully automated. In this paper, we present and evaluate COVA (Contextually Optimized Video Analytics), a framework to assist in the automatic specialization of models for video analytics in edge cloud cameras. COVA aims to automatically improve the accuracy of lightweight models by specializing them to the context to which they will be deployed. Moreover, we discuss and analyze each step involved in the process to understand the different trade-offs that each one entails. Using COVA, we demonstrate that the whole pipeline can be effectively automated by leveraging large neural networks used as teachers whose predictions are used to train and specialize lightweight neural networks.

Specifically, we consider reference wireless technologies for communication between the different types of nodes we consider, e.g. LTE, Nb-IoT, 802.15.4, 802.11, etc. Our results show that collecting data through the mobile nodes and executing the distributed analytics using short-range communication technologies, such as 802.15.4 and 802.11, allows to strongly reduce the energy consumption of the system up to 94% with a loss in accuracy w.r.t. a centralised cloud solution up to 2%.",Iot; Big data; Smart cities; Distributed learning; Communications efficiency

The aim of this study is to provide an overview of existing systematic reviews in this growing area of research and to synthesise the findings related to drivers, barriers and social implications of the AI adoption in business and management. The methodology used for this tertiary study is based on Kitchenham and Charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. These reviews cover the AI adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (HR, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). While the drivers for the AI adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders’perspectives. Very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the AI adoption. In addition to increased focus on social implications of AI, the reviews are recommending more rigorous evaluation, increased use of hybrid solutions (AI and non-AI) and multidisciplinary approach to AI design and evaluation. Furthermore, this study found that there is a lack of systematic reviews in some of the early AI adoption sectors such as financial industry and retail.",Artificial intelligence; Business; Machine learning; Management; Systematic literature review; Tertiary study

A coupled approach integrating satellite data products of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change along with chemical evaluation of As toxicity were modelled to evaluate the groundwater vulnerability. Change detection analysis was incorporated using the satellite images of 2013 and 2016 which shows 10 % increase in the buildings as compared to the total area of the study in given period. The LULC class that has been most compromised in this expansion and got reduced were the vegetation (∼6 %) and the barren areas (∼4 %) and the total surface water sources (0.5 %), all contributing in increased urban sprawl. As per the origin of As contamination in the area it seems that high sediment deposition along the braided Brahmaputra River stretch leads to As contamination which was associated with Fe-(oxy)-hydroxide dissolution. The vulnerability assessment using Artificial Neural Network technique in this region shows that As is present relatively in lesser concentration in the east direction. The continuous expansion of the urban habitation towards the greater As concentration zone will further make the situation critical for the people dependent on groundwater.

In particular, on-demand ridesharing services, which group together passengers with similar itineraries, are already operating in several metropolitan areas. These services can be of significant social and environmental benefit, by reducing travel costs, road congestion and CO2 emissions. The deployment of autonomous cars in the near future will surely change the way people are traveling. It is even more promising for a ridesharing service, since it will be easier and cheaper for a company to handle a fleet of autonomous cars that can serve the demands of different passengers. We argue that user satisfaction should be the main objective when trying to find the best assignment of passengers to vehicles and the determination of their routes. Moreover, the model of user satisfaction should be rich enough to capture the traveling time, cost, and other factors as well. We show that it is more important to capture a rich model of human satisfaction than peruse an optimal performance. That is, we developed a practical algorithm for assigning passengers to vehicles, which outperforms brute-force assignment algorithms that use a simpler satisfaction model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to exclusively concentrate on a rich and realistic general function of user satisfaction as the objective, which is (arguably) the most important aspect to consider for achieving a widespread adaption of ridesharing services.",Ride-sharing; Modeling human behavior; Human–agent interaction; Smart-cities

Under the condition of protecting user privacy, the federated learning model has become a popular research technology to solve the data islands problems. The edge computing network can be applied to smart city, Internet of vehicles and so on. Federated learning is a framework in which multiple hosts jointly learn a machine learning model. Each work device maintains the local model of its local training dataset, while the master device maintains the global model by aggregating the local models from the work devices. However, it cannot ensure that every local work device is an honest user because of a phenomenon that the hosts has been operated by attacker interferes in the process of local model training. In this paper, we assume that malicious nodes upload unreal learning parameters in the federated learning framework, which the global model will have high error rate. We propose a federated learning parameter aggregating algorithm based on mutual information. We introduced the relevance of model training learning rate to determine the consistency of the training direction of the local and central models at coarse granularity. We aggregated the parameters of the models at fine granularity based on the correlation of the gradients based on the mutual information. The mutual information method is used to calculate the similarity of the gradient trend between the local training model and overall model. We set the trust weight of each work device to reduce the negative impact of malicious nodes. The evaluation results show that the classification accuracy of the MIFL model is improved as compared with the average federated learning without malicious node.

The sensor network is segmented in four different regions, and then survival and neural network models are developed for each region separately. Findings show that the Weibull parametric models best describe the probability of a parking space to continue to be free in the forthcoming time intervals.

IoT networks characteristics, such as objects heterogeneity and scalability, require revolutionary solutions. Currently, there is no universal architecture for IoT. However, several architectures were proposed based on Software Defined Networks (SDN). SDN introduces network programmability, and centralisation, these features facilitate network abstractions, simplifying network management and eases evolution. In this paper, we investigate SDN as a novel communication architecture for IoT networking to enhance the security and resilience of IoT. SDN enhances network resilience and scalability which are essential in large-scale IoT deployments, e.g., smart cities. However, security is a significant concern for IoT while SDN deepens these concerns. SDN itself presents new security threats; specifically, threats related to the controller. We propose a secure, framework for IoT based on SDN. The framework is generalization for the integration of SDN and IoT. We focus on massive IoT deployment, for instance, smart cities applications, where, security is critical, and network traffic is enormous. The study investigates the SDN architecture from a security perspective. Improving SDN security will boost the deployment of SDN-based IoT architecture.

In some parts of the world the air quality index have reached to an irrefutable level which demands for a solution now. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to tackle this problem at a large scale by providing with an artificially intelligent mobile air purifier for “outdoors”. The main problem of DMAPS is to provide with purified air in the outdoors, such as a residential colony, in apartments, office complex, etc. since most of the times people travel outdoors and stay away from their home for a long time. This ability of providing with such a smart-sensing, self-driving machine is the advantage of the paper because other air purifiers exist but they are made for indoors, they do not have mobility and also do not possess AI capabilities. The method used in this air purifier is formulated by connecting three major functions. The first one being, ‘the smart mobility’ of the machine using the approach of deep reinforcement learning, the second is the air ‘purification using the Arduino system’ and the last is, ‘the detection of humans’ so that DMAPS can be around them and provide them with purified air, based on the YOLO algorithm. The whole system, works in a way that each and every function is very much connected and works simultaneously. In a nutshell, this air purifier, moves from one place (where there is low pollution content) to another place (where there is higher pollution content), purifies the environment and simultaneously have an objective to smartly detect humans to give out fresh air to them.

Due to the high frequency noise and complicated relationships in water demand series, forecasting the urban water demand is not an easy task. In order to improve the model’s abilities in handling the complex patterns and catching the peaks in time series, we propose a hybrid long short-term memory model combining with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and principal component analysis (PCA) pre-processing techniques for water demand forecasting, i.e., DWT-PCA-LSTM. First, the outliers of water demand series are identified and smoothed by 3σ criterion and weighted average method, respectively.

Currently, instruments and tools to study such systems and guide the prototyping process from simulation, to live deployment, and ultimately to a robust operation of a high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) are missing, or not practical in this distributed socio-technical context. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel testbed architecture for decentralized socio-technical systems running on IoT.

Wearable sensors, especially sensors embedded in smartphones, turn to be good data streams for human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. Unfortunately, most of the existing methods are evaluated on small and fixed-size datasets, and lack of data sharing as well as classifiers re-training functions. These issues will lead to the challenge of unadaptable learning when facing problems of volume and variety of data. In order to tackle these problems, this paper proposes a new method with adaptive, interactive, and general-personal-model training components, and data sharing on the cloud. The major advantage of the proposed method is very fast to detect human activities of a new user at the beginning (i.e. deploying a system to a new user) with an acceptable accuracy of detection using the general model. Then, the personal model will help to increase the accuracy of activities detection personally by interacting with users. Another advantage of the proposed method is to share data (e.g. sensory data, models, activities, and user’s profiles) among users/apps joined the system. These data will help to increase the accuracy of models timely by re-training periodically. Besides, the method can be used as a human-activity sensor that streams detected human activities to related components of smart-city scheme. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to de-facto datasets as well as state-of-the-art of HAR using smartphones. The experimental results show that there is a significant improvement of HAR’s accuracy when utilizing the proposed method.",Human Activity Recognition; Smartphones; Embedded Sensors; Smart-City; Heterogeneous Sensory Data Analytics; Data Mining; Machine Learning

We present thorough performance evaluation by using real social platform data in simulations. The numerical results show that collaboration among smart users can reveal anomalous behavior on the social accounts of other participants with a success ratio at the order of >90%.

This study develops an effective data-fusing methodology to estimate the heights of individual buildings at a city scale. We examined a machine-learning regression model by collecting public materials, including multi-source remote sensing-(RS)-based products, building-derived features, and relevant data to verify its performance in building height estimation. By applying the model in Shenzhen City, a dense city in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, results demonstrated that integrating rich multi-source explanatory variables could achieve high-accuracy building height retrieval. Using multiple building morphological metrics derived by building height data as proxy measures, the urban 3-D form patterns were further analyzed to understand current heterogeneous urban morphological structures. The proposed methodology can be conveniently applied to worldwide cities for urban 3-D morphology retrieval.

However, it is difficult to predict the degree of air pollution of a location by exploiting massive air pollution datasets incorporating data on spatially related locations. Construction of a spatial correlation prediction model for air pollution is therefore required for air pollution big-data mining. In this paper, we propose an air pollution-concentration spatial correlation prediction model based on a fusion deep neural network called FDN-learning. Three models are combined: a stacked anti-autoencoder network, Gaussian function model, and long short-term memory network (LSTM). The FDN-learning model is composed of three layers for feature expansion, intermediate processing, and data prediction. In the first layer, we employ a stacked anti-autoencoder model to learn the source-data spatial features through a feature expansion hidden layer; this can enrich the feature vector and mine more information for further prediction. In the second layer, the Gaussian function evaluates effective weights for the outputs of the stacked anti-autoencoder models in the preceding layer; the spatial correction effects are therefore incorporated in this layer. Finally, the LSTM model in the data prediction layer learns the air pollution-concentration temporal features. A fine-tuning method based on stochastic gradient descent is applied to the FDN-learning model for improved performance. Empirical results are used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed model based on a real-world air pollution dataset.",Fusion deep neural network; Gaussian function; LSTM; PM-concentration prediction; Stacked anti-autoencoder

Link prediction is an important task of data mining, especially in the knowledge graph, which is also called knowledge graph completion. Link prediction aims to find missing links or predict potential links according to the current social network. The most existing link prediction methods focus on static information in social networks, such as topology and node attributes, which are partly provided by users. When users are unwilling to provide or intentionally hide these static features, traditional link prediction methods cannot achieve ideal performance. The dynamic information of social influence propagation in social networks can avoid the user's subjective impact and better reflect the relationship between users. In addition, users show different degrees of interest and authority on various topics in the real world, leading to different influence propagation patterns. Therefore, we use context of social influence to optimize the topic-aware influence propagation model to improve the performance of link prediction. In this paper, we propose a new multi-output graph neural network framework to capture influence propagation in social networks and model the influence of users in different roles. In this way, the underlying information of influence between users can be used to construct new features to improve the performance of link prediction.

AmI creates, by using Artificial Intelligence (AI), an intelligent ecosystem in which computers, sensors, lighting, music, personal devices, and distributed services, work together to improve the user experience through the support of natural and intuitive user interfaces. Nowadays, AmI is used in various contexts, e.g., for building smart homes and smart cities, providing healthcare, and creating an adequate atmosphere in retail and public environments.

The system is based on a multi-agent computational intelligence model built on two main components: (i) machine learning methods that forecast appropriate values for the Spotify music features, and (ii) a multi-objective dynamic genetic algorithm that selects a specific Spotify music track, according to such values. Gym Intelligence is built by sensing the ambient with a minimal, low-cost, and non-intrusive set of sensors, and it has been designed considering the outcome of a preliminary analysis in real gyms, involving real users.

Several land price prediction models were built using five MLAs and various geographic variables. The experimental results show that the extra-trees regression algorithm and the radial basis function-based support vector regression algorithm perform best in Period Ⅰ (2010–2014) and Period Ⅱ (2015–2019), respectively; therefore, they were selected to estimate the RLPs of the grids without observations in the corresponding period. Based on the estimated results, we found that the spatial pattern of the RLP in Wuhan transitioned from monocentric to polycentric between the two periods, and RLPs grew rapidly near newly formed urban subcenters and waterscapes. The relative importance of the predictor variables shows that commercial and educational facilities are important determinants of the RLP distribution in Wuhan; moreover, the relative importance of natural amenities and education facilities increased over time, while that of commercial facilities and public transportation decreased slightly. The case of Wuhan confirms the feasibility of MLAs and openly accessible urban data in modeling fine-scale RLP distributions.

The basis of our motivation for choosing Istanbul is based on the ‘Waste Incineration and Power Generation Plant,11https://www.stantec.com/tr/projects/istanbul-waste-incineration-power-generation-plant-construction.’ which was built in Eyupsultan, Istanbul in 2017 and is planned to be operational in 2021. This plant will be Europe’s largest domestic waste incinerator with a capacity of 3000 tons/day. For the proposed WTE framework, we first build an ensemble model, Gradient Boosting (GB), to predict the amount of MSW using daily data related to other variables such as seasonality and socio-economic status. Then we use the calorific index value to predict generated energy from solid waste, categorized in 14 different waste types.",Waste-To-Energy; Smart city; Waste management; MSW; Machine learning

It is significantly vital to capture and analyze the data from various resources in smart cities. For instance, the real-time air pollution data are remarkably important in controlling air pollution for urban sustainability and protecting humans against the air pollution damages. However, in reality, the average construction investment and maintenance costs in the air pollution stations are too high. This paper intends to investigate whether and how we can measure air pollution using cost effective means and without using the expensive pollution sensors and facilities. In order to realize such a goal, a predictive model for particulate matter prediction was developed. The proposed model consists of multiple components to integrate heterogeneous multiple sources of urban data and predict the particulate matter based on transfer learning perspective in which neural network and regression was leveraged as the core of the prediction. The results of the particulate matter prediction exposed that while these data sources are capable of proper prediction of the particulate matter, they can also yield better results over the models, which were based only on the features of the air pollution sensors. This work provides an opportunity for evaluation of the model with the urban data from the city of Aarhus, in Denmark, and comparison of the model performance against various specified baselines.

In smart diagnosis, high-quality image labels are essential for supervised medical image learning. The correctness of labels has a substantial influence on smart disease diagnosis. However, the labelling of disease images by professional doctors is a time-consuming and labour-intensive project; therefore, obtaining correct and high-quality labels is a difficult task. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based label completion and correction method (LCC) for supervised medical image learning in smart diagnosis. We use a small number of labelled images in a dataset to train a model, and design a strategy to complement most of the unlabelled data and correct noise label data, and then use the results of completion and correction to continually modify the model to achieve better results. We take the diagnosis of Seborrheic Keratosis (SK) and Flat Wart (FW) as examples; the experimental results show that this strategy can use limited labelled data to complete the labels for most of the unlabelled data and correct some noise labels in the dataset, which improves the accuracy rate of the model to identify diseases.",Smart diagnosis; Label completion; Label correction; Deep learning

Face recognition technology lets the police detect a suspect’s face and compare it with image databases of known criminals and provides investigators with a match list of the most similar faces. Face recognition is a highly efficient and accurate tool in investigation processes. However, in some sensitive scenarios covert methods are required for the detection of suspects or missing persons without risking the lives of police. With the availability of the nano devices such as Raspberry Pi, law enforcement agencies such as police can be equipped with a concealed and secure face recognition system. In this paper, a Raspberry Pi and cloud assisted face recognition framework is proposed. A small-sized portable wireless camera is mounted on a police officer’s uniform to capture a video stream, which is passed to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition. The proposed method uses Bag of Words for extraction of oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF points from the detected face, followed by support vector machine for identification of suspects. Raspberry Pi has limited resources such as storage space, memory, and processing power, and therefore the proposed classifier is stored and trained on the cloud. The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 model B in Python 2.7 and is tested on various standard datasets.

Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities’ evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation.

Artificial intelligence improves the efficiency of chiller system fault diagnosis, and greatly reduces the energy consumption of urban buildings. The existing intelligent fault diagnosis methods of chiller mostly rely on balanced training datasets; lacking fault samples makes these methods incompetent to extract reliable features to recognize abnormal machine conditions, resulting in the degraded performance. To overcome the deficiencies of reported studies, a new method, called end-to-end chiller fault diagnosis, is proposed using a fused attention mechanism and dynamic cross-entropy. Firstly, a one-dimensional convolution network (1D-CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) are combined to capture the spatial-temporal features from the original data directly. Afterwards, a fused attention mechanism is developed to further refine the extracted features to increase the contribution of crucial features and achieve high-quality diagnostic information mining. Finally, the dynamic cross-entropy (DCE) is designed for updating the imbalance factor in real-time, with more focus on the hard-classified types.

Searching for available parking spots can be a time-consuming task that simultaneously increases traffic congestion and greenhouse gas pollution by a significant 40%. A solution that would increase drivers' ability to locate an empty parking spot would represent an important step towards more sustainable parking as it would have a direct impact on reducing greenhouse gas pollution in urban areas. This paper proposes how data science can help by evaluating the prediction performance of four machine learning models. Analysed machine learning models are based on different machine learning methods (i.e., CatBoost and Random Forest) and use different real-world data sets (i.e., parking sensor data only or contextually enriched parking sensor data). The dummy (baseline) model is considered as well, but with a R2 score of 61.29% is outperformed by more advanced data science approaches. Prediction performance in the case of using parking sensor data only gives R2 score of 84.31% and 88.16% for Random Forest and CatBoost, respectively. The best prediction performance is achieved using CatBoost and contextually enriched data, resulting in the high-performing machine learning model with the R2 value of 88.83%, thus outperforming the Random Forest model by 1.7%. In fact, for both machine learning methods, the contextually enriched data approach gives better results for predicting parking spot availability. This suggests that parking data should be enriched with contextual data when designing and building sustainable parking solutions for smart cities of the future.",Sustainable parking; Greenhouse gas pollution reduction; Parking spot availability; Smart city; Data science; Contextually enriched data

For example, how can calculations be conducted when there are extensibility and privacy problems in machine learning tasks? In view of the above challenges, a mobile edge server is taken as the focus, and the available resources around the mobile edge server are used for collaborative computing to further improve the computing performance of a mobile edge computing (MEC) system.

Therefore, using artificial intelligence method, we propose a solution of inter-vehicle communication for estimating the congestion level to maximize the vehicle traffic flow in the transport system, called TRAFFIC. For this, we modeled an ensemble of classifiers to estimate the congestion level using TRAFFIC. Hence, the ensemble classification is used as an input to the proposed dissemination mechanism, through which information is propagated between the vehicles. By comparing TRAFFIC with other studies in the literature, our solution has advanced the state of the art with new contributions as follows: (i) increase in the success rate for estimating the traffic congestion level; (ii) reduction in travel time, fuel consumption and CO2 emission of the vehicle; and (iii) high coverage rate with higher propagation of the message, maintaining a low packet transmission rate.",Smart cities; Traffic management systems; Ad-hoc networks; Traffic jam

Nonetheless, the applicability and effectiveness of these techniques cannot be guaranteed when dealing with discrete binary and incomplete/missing signals (i.e., not continuous in time). In this paper a novel data interpretation framework for SHM with noisy and incomplete signals, using a through-substrate self-powered sensing technology, is presented within the context of artificial intelligence (AI). AI methods, namely, machine learning and pattern recognition, were integrated within the data interpretation framework developed for use in a practical engineering problem: data-driven SHM of plate-like structures. Finite element simulations on an aircraft stabilizer wing and experimental vibration tests on a dynamically loaded plate were conducted to validate the proposed framework. Machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and artificial neural networks, were integrated within the developed learning framework for performance assessment of the monitored structures.

However, there are still two problems to be solved for energy forecasting, including the encoding of categorical characteristics and adaptive extraction of the most relevant characteristics for the use in predictions.

To address this issue, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled batch authentication scheme in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-envisioned IoV-based smart city deployment. The latest trends and revolutions in technologies incorporate AI/Machine Learning (ML) in blockchaining to produce a secure, efficient and intelligent blockchain based system. The data stored in the blocks in the blockchain are authentic and genuine, which makes the AI/ML algorithms to work at their exceptions in order produce correct predictions on the blockchain data. Through the signing phase of the proposed scheme, each vehicle in a dynamically formed cluster broadcasts a message to its own member and respective road-side unit (RSU). In the proposed scheme, two types of authentication take place: vehicle to vehicle (V2V) authentication allows a vehicle to authenticate its neighbor vehicles in its cluster, while batch authentication permits a group of cluster vehicles to be authenticated by their RSU. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles and RSU in their cluster. RSU then gathers securely data from its vehicles and form several transactions including the information of vehicles and its own given information to the cluster member vehicles. The transactions are formed later by the nearby fog server associated with RSU and then by the cloud server to form a complete block. The created blocks are mined by the cloud servers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud server network through the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authentic and genuine data of the blockchain are utilized for Big data analytics through AI/ML algorithms. It is shown that the proposed scheme is highly robust against various attacks through formal and informal security analysis, and also through formal security verification tool.

Energy consumption is one of the major issues in global and national policies, therefore scientific efforts in creating prediction models of energy consumption and cost are highly important. One of the largest energy consumers in every state is its public sector, consisting of educational, health, public administration, military, and other types of public buildings. Recent technologies based on sensor networks and Big data platforms enable collection of large amounts of data that could be used to analyze energy consumption and cost. A real data from Croatian public sector is used in this paper including a large number of constructional, energetic, occupational, climate and other attributes. The algorithms for data pre-processing and modeling by optimizing parameters are suggested. Three strategies were tested: (1) with all available variables, (2) with a filter-based variable selection, and (3) with a wrapper-based variable selection which integrates Boruta algorithm and random forest. Prediction models of energy cost are created using two approaches: (a) comparative usage of artificial neural networks and two types of regression trees, CART and random forest, and (b) integration of RF-Boruta variable selection and machine learning methods for prediction. A cross-validation procedure was used to optimize the artificial neural network and regression tree topology, as well to select the most appropriate activation function. Along with creating a prediction model, the aim of the paper was also to extract the relevant predictors of energy cost in public buildings which are important in planning the construction or renovation of buildings. The results have shown that the second approach which integrates machine learning with Boruta method, where the random forest algorithm is used for both variable reduction and prediction modeling, has produced a higher accuracy of prediction than the individual usage of three machine learning methods. Such findings confirm the potential of hybrid machine learning methods which are suggested in previous research, but in favor of random forest method over CART and artificial neural networks. Regarding the variable selection, the model has extracted heating and occupational data as the most important, followed by constructional, cooling, electricity, and lighting attributes.

In this paper, we design a novel detector, dubbed as PU-Net, that dynamically learns the PU activity patterns in a cognitive 5G smart city, where a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is deployed as flying base stations to serve the Internet-of-Things (IoT) users. Unlike the traditional schemes, the PU-Net is free from signal-noise model assumptions and is leveraged through deep residual learning integrated with atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to sense the PU's transmitted signal patterns in the network. The PU-Net detects and classifies the active and idle PU states by exploiting the multilevel spatial-temporal features in the signal and noise frames. The proposed model is trained using locally synthesized Rayleigh channel-impaired data with large variability of modulated signals and different noise floor regimes. Additionally, the PU-Net model is blind-tested and evaluated on real-world over-the-air signals and with variable-length frames and varying channel effects at secondary users (SUs). With extensive experiments, it is shown that PU-Net outperforms other benchmark detectors, obtaining an accuracy of 0.9974, with 0.9978 recall and 0.9970 precision in detecting and classifying the PU transmitted signal patterns.

We had previously developed a technology known as Smart Accident Precognition System (SAPS) which reduces the rate of accidents in automobile and also enhance the safety of the passengers. Current research advances this technique by integrating Google Assistant with the SAPS. The proposed system integrates several embedded devices in the automobiles that monitor various aspects such as speed, distance, safety measures like seatbelt, door locks, airbags, handbrakes etc. The real-time data is stored in the cloud and the vehicle can adapt to various situations from the previous data collected. Also, with the Google Assistant user can lock and unlock, start and stop, alert and do various automated tasks such as low fuel remainder, insurance remainders etc. The proposed IoT enabled real-time vehicle system can detect accidents and adapt to change according to various conditions. Further, with RFID keyless entry authentication the vehicle is secure than ever before. This proposed system is much efficient to the existing systems and will have a great positive impact in the automobile industry and society.",Artificial intelligence; Intelligent automobile system; Internet of Things; Smart Cities; Smart System

Knowledge graphs help to provide semantic and interconnectivity capabilities to the intelligent transportation system. In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for detecting outliers in the trajectory. Normal and outlier graphs are constructed using directed weighted graphs. Then, comparison with source and target graphs leading to vectors is performed. The similarity measure is used, which measures common nodes and edges. The features are then used by the machine learning based algorithm to classify the trajectory. Instead of a manually tuned parameter, the tree-based pipeline optimization method selects the best classifier and its hyperparameter. Then, the tuned model is compared with the traditional algorithms, i.e., random forest, decision tree, Naïve Bayes, and KNN. To evaluate the system under real conditions, an experiment is performed on a real dataset of trajectories. The results show that the graph-based method performs well and achieves an F-value of 0.81, while the optimization model achieves an F-value of 0.87. The graph-based model matched with the learning method helps to detect outliers and deviation points of the trajectory with high precision.",Trajectory analysis; Outlier detection; Data mining; Road traffic management; Smart city application

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is contributing significantly to the development of these systems, and the automotive industry is the most prominent example of ""smart"" technology entering the market: there are Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), Radar/LIDAR detection units and camera-based Computer Vision systems that can assess driving conditions. Actually, these technologies have become consumer goods and services in mass-produced vehicles to provide human drivers with tools for a more comfortable and safer driving. Nevertheless, they need to be further improved for progress in the transition to fully automated driving or simply to increase vehicle automation levels. To this end, it becomes imperative to accurately predict driver’s decisions, model human driving behaviors, and introduce more accurate risk assessment metrics. This paper presents a system that can learn to predict the future braking behavior of a driver in a typically urban vehicle-pedestrian conflict, i.e., when a pedestrian enters a zebra crossing from the curb and a vehicle is approaching. The algorithm proposes a sequential prediction of relevant operational indicators that continuously describe the encounter process. A car driving simulator was used to collect reliable data on braking behaviours of a cohort of 68 licensed university students, who faced the same urban scenario. The vehicle speed, steering wheel angle, and pedal activity were recorded as the participants approached the crosswalk, along with the azimuth angle of the pedestrian and the relative longitudinal distance between the vehicle and the pedestrian: the proposed system employs the vehicle information as human driving decisions and the pedestrian information as explanatory variables of the environmental state. In fact, the pedestrian’s polar coordinates are usually calculated by an on-board millimeter-wave radar which is typically used to perceive the environment around a vehicle. All mentioned information is represented in the form of time series data and is used to train a recurrent neural network in a supervised machine learning process. The main purpose of this research is to define a system of behavioral profiles in non-collision conditions that could be used for enhancing the existing intelligent driving systems, e.g., to reduce the number of warnings when the driver is not on a collision course with a pedestrian.

In the system, a new proof-of-computational closeness (PoCC) consensus protocol is proposed for the selection of miners and the creation of blocks. Moreover, an analytical energy pricing policy is designed to solve the problem of existing energy pricing policies in a distributed trading environment. A dynamic multi-pseudonym mechanism is developed for the prosumers to preserve their transactional privacy during energy trading. Since it requires extra storage and computing resources for the blockchain miners to simultaneously execute both mining process and application intensive tasks, therefore, an improved sparse neural network (ISNN) is proposed for computation offloading to the cloud servers. In ISNN, a Jaya optimization algorithm is used to accelerate the error convergence rate while reducing the number of connections between different layers of neurons. Besides, ISNN optimizes the overall computational cost of the system. Furthermore, the security of the prosumers is ensured using blockchain technology while security analysis shows that the system is robust against the Sybil attack. The proposed blockchain based peer-to-peer secure energy trading system is extremely important for sustainable cities and society. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed pricing policy is compared with time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing and real-time pricing policies. From the results, it is proved that the prosumers achieve a higher degree of satisfaction and utility when using the proposed pricing policy. Moreover, the probability of a successful Sybil attack is zero as the number of attackers’ identities and computational capacities increases. Under different sizes of data to be uploaded, the proposed ISNN scheme has the least average computational cost and data transmission time as compared to deep reinforcement learning combined with genetic algorithm (DRGO) and sparse evolutionary training and multi-layer perceptron (SET-MLP) schemes in the literature. Moreover, the proposed system is tested for scalability by increasing the number of prosumers.

The smart city provides better solutions for urban areas which are increasing at an unprecedented speed. This paper presents an empirical study carried out to assess and analyze the development pattern of 35 smart cities in China using the principal component analysis (PCA) and back propagation (BP) neural network techniques. The proposed PCA-BP neural network assessment processing model is applied with six dimensional factors and twenty-two operating indices. With the feature extraction and performance score calculated via PCA, BP neural network is adopted for city classification to recognize the development differences in smart cities. The results indicate that the factor-driven impetus evolves into innovation-driven impetus, narrowing the gap from the holistic perspective between the first and middle-ranking groups, while two middle-ranking groups show a similar upward trend in terms of developing a smart economy through sustainable productivity in innovative enterprises and high-tech industry. To some extent, in response to a similar improving trend in the application of smart services, a distinct advantage of an individual index can be a complementary offset to unapparent holistic highlighting the reception of the lowest average points. Unbalanced development exists in two subaverage groups that are deficient in the initial inventory of smart infrastructure and demands.

Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is a concept that represents the identifiable sensors, devices, and sources connected to the internet and that can be utilized in various automated patient monitoring applications to provide remote healthcare services. This article aims to provide an IoHT driven deep learning-based system for non-invasive patient discomfort detection. The developed system comprises of an RGB camera device to identify discomfort in a patient’s body instead of utilizing any wearable sensors or devices. In order to identify movement and discomfort, the system utilizes the YOLOv3 model to detect the patient’s body and the Alphapose method to extract different keypoints information of the patient’s body. Applying association rules, the detected keypoints are then converted into six central body organs. To detect a patient’s discomfort, pairwise distance is measured between detected keypoints, and finally, time frame rules are applied to set a threshold in order to analyze movements as either associated with normal or discomfort conditions. The patient’s body is monitored continuously for multiple frames, based on which comfort and discomfort levels are distinguished.

Smart surveillance is an important application of AIoT and we propose a two-stream neural network in this direction. The first stream comprises instant anomaly detection that is functional over resource-constrained IoT devices, whereas second phase is a two-stream deep neural network allowing for detailed anomaly analysis, suited to be deployed as a cloud computing service. Firstly, a self-pruned fine-tuned lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) classifies the ongoing events as normal or anomalous in an AIoT environment. Upon anomaly detection, the edge device alerts the concerned departments and transmits the anomalous frames to cloud analysis center for their detailed evaluation in the second phase.

This increased flexibility is required due to the growing proportion of intermittent renewable energy generation into the energy mix, and increasing complexity in demand profiles from the electrification of transport networks. Currently, less than 2% of the global potential for demand-side flexibility is currently utilised, but a more widespread adoption of residential consumers as flexibility resources can lead to substantially higher utilisation of the demand-side flexibility potential. In order to achieve this target, acquiring a better understanding of how residential DR participants respond in DR events is essential – and recent advances in novel machine learning and statistical AI provide promising tools to address this challenge. This study provides an in-depth analysis of how residential customers have responded in incentive-based DR, utilising household-related data from a large-scale, real-world trial: the Smart Grid, Smart City (SGSC) project.

Finally, we explore the temporal structure of the response – and although we found no supporting evidence of DR responders learning over time for the available data from this trial, the proposed methodologies could be used for longer-term longitudinal DR studies.

It happens when electricity is consumed without billing. Several methods are developed to detect ET automatically. Most of these methods only assess Electricity Consumption (EC) records. However, it is challenging to detect fraudulent consumers by only observing EC records because of diverse theft strategies (line tapping, meter tampering, etc.) and the irregularity of ET behavior. Furthermore, many methods have poor classification accuracy due to imbalanced data. This work proposes two novel methods to resolve the above-mentioned issues: Tomek Link Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique with Support Vector Machine (TBSSVM) and Temporal Convolutional Network with Enhanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (TCN-EMLP). The former resamples the data by balancing the majority and minority class instances. Whereas, the latter classifies normal and fraudulent consumers.

Mostafa,2021,IoTBoT-IDS: A novel statistical learning-enabled botnet detection framework for protecting networks of smart cities,article,Sustainable Cities and Society,science_direct,"The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, has enabled transforming urban areas into smart cities. Smart cities’ paradigm has resulted in improved quality of life and better services to citizens, like smart healthcare, smart parking, smart transport, smart buildings, smart homes, and so on. One of the major challenges of IoT devices is the limited capacity of their battery because the devices consume a large amount of energy once they communicate with each other. Furthermore, the IoT-based smart systems would contain sensitive data about network systems, introducing serious privacy and security issues. IoT-based smart systems are highly exposed to botnet attacks. Examples of such attacks are Mirai and BASHLITE malware launched from compromised surveillance devices, which are common in smart cities, resulting in paralysis of Internet-based services through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Such DDoS attacks on IoT devices and their networks further threaten the emerging concept of sustainable smart cities. To discover such cyberattacks, this paper proposes a novel statistical learning-based botnet detection framework, called IoTBoT-IDS, which protects IoT-based smart networks against botnet attacks. IoTBoT-IDS captures the normal behavior of IoT networks by applying statistical learning-based techniques, using Beta Mixture Model (BMM) and a Correntropy model. Any deviation from the normal behavior is detected as an anomalous event. To evaluate IoTBoT-IDS, three benchmark datasets generated from realistic IoT networks were used. The evaluation results showed that IoTBoT-IDS effectively identifies various types of botnets with an average detection accuracy of 99.2%, which is higher by about 2–5% compared with compelling intrusion detection methods, namely AdaBoost ensemble learning, fuzzy c-means, and deep feed forward neural networks.",IoT; Sustainable smart cities; Statistical learning; Botnet attacks; Intrusion detection system; Anomaly detection; Beta mixture model; Correntropy

This paper introduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively engaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens assemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters. The core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving witness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus to empower citizens’ trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS localization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how real-time collective measurements over citizens’ choices can be made in a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by deploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of transport means.

In addition, the fusion of IoT and AI also poses several challenges. The focus of this work is on the effective design of IoT framework and deep learning algorithm towards security of smart city. The system can be used to estimate the crowd traffic in public places, and can prevent the occurrence of congestion, stampede and other accidents, such as stations, airports, large-scale exhibitions, tourist attractions and other places. The constructed system contains video collection, upload and display as well as data analysis and early warning operation at the embedded device end, and automatically tracks densely crowd areas by controlling the video monitoring device. Moreover, the cloud platform can be controlled through the network. Our proposed algorithms are composed of two main aspects, i.e., division and focus. Firstly, we propose a novel density-adaptive Gaussian kernel to elevate the quality of density maps. Then, we propose a module based on conditional random fields for feature fusion. Finally, we propose a block segmentation module to predict our segmentation results and extract the context-aware information in segmentation stage.

However, the issue of bias in these data and the fairness of outcomes in smart cities has received relatively limited attention. This is a troubling and significant omission, as social equity should be a critical aspect of smart cities and needs to be addressed and accounted for in the use of new technologies and data tools. This paper examines bias in resident-reported data by analyzing socio-spatial disparities in ‘311’ complaint behavior in Kansas City, Missouri. We utilize data from detailed 311 reports and a comprehensive resident satisfaction survey, and spatially join these data with code enforcement violations, neighborhood characteristics, and street condition assessments. We introduce a model to identify disparities in resident-government interactions and classify under- and over-reporting neighborhoods based on complaint behavior. Despite greater objective and subjective need, low-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to report street condition or “nuisance” issues, while prioritizing more serious problems. Our findings form the basis for acknowledging and accounting for data bias in self-reported data, and contribute to the more equitable delivery of city services through bias-aware data-driven processes.",Smart city governance; Data bias; Machine learning; Social equity; 311; Complaint reporting

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level.

As smart cities and their applications grow, security and privacy challenges have become a major concern for billions of IoT smart devices. One reason for this could be the oversight of handling security issues of IoT devices by their manufacturers, which enables attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities in these devices by performing different types of attacks, e.g., DDoS and injection attacks. Intrusion detection is one way to detect and mitigate the risk of such attacks.

Rodrigues,2021,Adaptive recurrent NeuroFuzzy control for power system stability in smart cities,article,Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments,science_direct,"A smart city is a dynamic and sustainable urban system that provides a great quality of service to its residents by optimally managing its resources. In smart cities, low-frequency oscillations are a serious concern to the power system as they adversely affect system’s stability. Moreover, power system stabilizers are inefficient due to their fixed-parameter architecture. Flexible ac transmission system controller performs effective damping of low-frequency oscillations when provided with suitable supplementary damping control like a Static synchronous series compensator. In this context, the paper proposes an adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control for smart cities that uses the recurrent Gaussian membership function and recurrent wavelet neural network in antecedent and consequent parts respectively. The paper applies the gradient descent optimization with a back-propagation algorithm to update the parameters of suggested adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control. Simulations are performed on two test systems, both showing the effectiveness of the recommended control scheme as compared to traditional lead-lag control and artificial neuro-fuzzy Takagi Sugeno Kang control. Calculations of performance index for various fault scenarios lead to the conclusion that the control scheme can damp oscillations effectively and enhances the power system’s transient stability.",Sustainable smart cities; Low frequency oscillations; Neuro-fuzzy controller; FACTS controllers; Back-propagation

At the same time, future smart cities need to support resilient environments against cyber-threats on their supported information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, the cybersecurity of future smart cities and their smart grids is of paramount importance, especially on how to detect cyber-attacks with growing uncertainties, such as frequent topological changes and RES of intermittent nature. Such raised uncertainties can cause a significant change in the underlying distribution of measurements and system states. In such an environment, historical measured data will not accurately exhibit the current network’s operating point. Hence, future power grids’ dynamic behaviors within smart cities are much more complicated than the conventional ones, leading to incorrect classification of the new instances by the current attack detectors. In this paper, to address this problem, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is carefully designed by embedding the dynamically time-evolving power system’s characteristics to accurately model the dynamic behaviors of modern power grids that are influenced by RES or system reconfiguration to distinguish natural smart grid changes and real-time attacks. The proposed framework’s performance is evaluated using the IEEE 14-bus system using real-world load data with multiple attack cases such as attacks to the network after a line outage and combination of RES.

In this regard, the human detection system has gained notable attention since it is recognized as a crucial task in intelligent surveillance applications. Researchers practiced a variety of computer vision and deep neural networks-based techniques for human detection-based applications; however, they often focused on the frontal view camera perspective. Thus, in this work, we have introduced a human detection system for intelligent surveillance in smart cities and societies with a completely distinct perspective, i.e., an overhead perspective that can provide sufficient visibility and coverage of a scene in congested and obstructed environments. However, human appearance can be difficult from such an extreme point of view, as there are significant variations in humans’ poses and appearances. Therefore, in this work, leveraging the deep neural network-based object detection technique, the Gaussian YOLOv3 algorithm is used for human detection. The algorithm determines the bounding box uncertainty by modeling its coordinates as a Gaussian parameter, improving accuracy and reducing false positives. A Gaussian YOLOv3 is combined with channel attention and feature intertwine modules to improve specific feature maps. The channel attention module is combined with the feature map to learn each channel's weight autonomously, improve the key features, and enhance the network's ability to discriminate between humans and background. At the same time, different channels of the feature map are intertwined to obtain more representative features. Finally, the features obtained from the attention and feature intertwine modules are fused to form an improved feature map. In addition, to further increase the detection accuracy of the algorithm for human detection, transfer learning is adopted. The experimental outcomes reveal that training improves the Gaussian YOLOv3 algorithm's potential for human detection with an overall detection accuracy of 94%.",Deep neural network; Smart cities and societies; Human detection; Overhead view; Transfer learning; Gaussian YOLOv3

In the existing literature, the state-of-the-art method solve region-based problems with long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms that extract the temporal view and local convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms that extract the spatial view (local spatial correlation via local CNN). In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method for region-based prediction for smart cities. First, we divide the cities into regions based on the space dimension and model the situation of the cities in 3D volumes. Based on the constructed 3D volumes, we design a model called multiple local 3D CNN spatial-temporal residual networks (LMST3D-ResNet) for region-based prediction in smart cities. LMST3D-ResNet can extract multiple temporal dependencies (including trend, period and closeness) for local regions and then predict the future citywide activities according to the learned multiple spatial-temporal features. LMST3D-ResNet can also combine the spatial-temporal features with external factors. LMST3D-ResNet includes 3D CNNs and ResNet mechanisms for processing spatial-temporal information. In particular, 3D CNNs have the ability to model 3-dimensional information due to 3D convolution and 3D pooling operations, while ResNet enables the connection of the convolutional neural network across layers to obtain a deeper network structure. Specifically, in our proposed model, a novel region-based information extraction mechanism and an end-to-end multiple spatial-temporal dependency learning structure are designed for local regions.

Hence, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) must be developed for IoT-enabled smart cities to alleviate IoT-associated security attacks. Achieving high-level detection accuracy and lower training time are significant challenges in IDS. However, the existing traditional IDS are inefficient in handling them.

In parallel, artificial intelligence and cognitive computing have emerged as catalysts in the process aimed at designing and optimizing smart services&rsquo; supply and utilization in urban space. The latter are paramount in the domain of energy provision and consumption. This paper offers an insight into pilot systems and prototypes that showcase in which ways artificial intelligence can offer critical support in the process of attaining energy sustainability in smart cities. To this end, this paper examines smart metering and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) to make a case for the latter&rsquo;s value added in context of profiling electric appliances&rsquo; electricity consumption. By employing the findings in context of smart cities research, the paper then adds to the debate on energy sustainability in urban space. Existing research tends to be limited by data granularity (not in high frequency) and consideration of about six kinds of appliances. In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm support vector machine multiple kernel learning approach (GA-SVM-MKL) is proposed for NILM, with consideration of 20 kinds of appliance. Genetic algorithm helps to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and design the optimal kernel function based on various kernel properties. The performance indicators are sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and overall accuracy (OA) of the classifier. First, the performance evaluation of proposed GA-SVM-MKL achieves Se of 92.1%, Sp of 91.5% and OA of 91.8%. Second, the percentage improvement of performance indicators using proposed method is more than 21% compared with traditional kernel. Third, results reveal that by keeping different modes of electric appliance as identical class label, the performance indicators can increase to about 15%. Forth, tunable modes of GA-SVM-MKL classifier are proposed to further enhance the performance indicators up to 7%. Overall, this paper is a bold and novel contribution to the debate on energy utilization and sustainability in urban spaces as it integrates insights from artificial intelligence, IoT, and big data analytics and queries them in a context defined by energy sustainability in smart cities.",

Monitoring noise usually requires the use of professional and expensive instruments, called phonometers, able to accurately measure sound pressure levels. In many cases, phonometers are human-operated; therefore, periodic fine-granularity city-wide measurements are expensive. Recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) offer a window of opportunities for low-cost autonomous sound pressure meters. Such devices and platforms could enable fine time&ndash;space noise measurements throughout a city. Unfortunately, low-cost sound pressure sensors are inaccurate when compared with phonometers, experiencing a high variability in the measurements.

RaveGuard was initially deployed together with a professional phonometer for over two months in downtown Bologna, Italy, with the aim of collecting a large amount of precise noise pollution samples. The resulting datasets have been instrumental in designing InspectNoise, a library that can be exploited by IoT platforms, without the need of expensive phonometers, but obtaining a similar precision. In particular, we have applied supervised learning algorithms (adequately trained with our datasets) to reduce the accuracy gap between the professional phonometer and an IoT platform equipped with low-end devices and sensors. Results show that RaveGuard, combined with the InspectNoise library, achieves a 2.24% relative error compared to professional instruments, thus enabling low-cost unmanned city-wide noise monitoring.",

The concept of smart cities is evolving and adapting to new applications; the trend to create intelligent neighbourhoods, districts or territories is becoming increasingly popular, as opposed to the previous approach of managing an entire megacity. In this paper, the platform is presented, and its architecture and functionalities are described. Moreover, its operation has been validated in a case study where the bike renting service of Paris&mdash;V&eacute;lib&rsquo; M&eacute;tropole has been managed. This platform could enable smart territories to develop adapted knowledge management systems, adapt them to new requirements and to use multiple types of data, and execute efficient computational and artificial intelligence algorithms. The platform optimizes the decisions taken by human experts through explainable artificial intelligence models that obtain data from IoT sensors, databases, the Internet, etc. The global intelligence of the platform could potentially coordinate its decision-making processes with intelligent nodes installed in the edge, which would use the most advanced data processing techniques.",

In such cities, transport commuting is changing rapidly with the proliferation of contemporary vehicular technology. New models of vehicle ride sharing systems are changing the way citizens commute in their daily movement schedule. The use of a private vehicle per single passenger transportation is no longer viable in sustainable Smart Cities (SC) because of the vehicles&rsquo; resource allocation and urban pollution. The current research on car ride sharing systems is widely expanding in a range of contemporary technologies, however, without covering a multidisciplinary approach. In this paper, the focus is on performing a multidisciplinary research on car riding systems taking into consideration personalized user mobility behavior by providing next destination prediction as well as a recommender system based on riders&rsquo; personalized information. Specifically, it proposes a predictive vehicle ride sharing system for commuting, which has impact on the SC green ecosystem. The adopted system also provides a recommendation to citizens to select the persons they would like to commute with. An Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled weighted pattern matching model is used to assess user movement behavior in SC and provide the best predicted recommendation list of commuting users. Citizens are then able to engage a current trip to next destination with the more suitable user provided by the list. An experimented is conducted with real data from the municipality of New Philadelphia, in SC of Athens, Greece, to implement the proposed system and observe certain user movement behavior. The results are promising for the incorporation of the adopted system to other SCs.",

The concept of smart cities gains increasing importance in the European Union, a fact that is reflected in the project “European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities” of the European Commission. Smart cities are a practical example of how the new energy policies shape the lives of the European Union citizens, trying to improve it. As a consequence, new business models arise in big cities, involving the use of technology for better living conditions. These new, technology-based business models are important, as they improve the life quality of the inhabitants, they reduce the climate change impact, and they contribute as well to job creation in the IT-industry, promoting innovation. They have as well a social impact, as they bring experts from energy policies, business, economics, legal and IT together in order to project a new type of city—the smart city. The research hypothesis of the present article is that there is a high acceptance towards the concept of smart cities at the European Union level and that this concept could be implemented with the help of information technology and of artificial intelligence. This way, legal provisions, economic measures and IT-tools work together in order to create synergy effects for better life quality of the citizens of the European Union. The research hypothesis is analyzed by means of the questionnaire as a qualitative research method and is as well assessed by using case studies (e.g., Austria, Finland, Romania). The novelty of the case studies is that the development of smart cities is analyzed due to the new trend towards sustainability in two countries with different living conditions in the European Union.",

To build a virtual city that are close to a real city, a large number of various types of human models need to be created. To reduce the cost of acquiring models, this paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D human meshes from single images captured using a normal camera. It presents a method for reconstructing the complete mesh of the human body from a single RGB image and a generative adversarial network consisting of a newly designed shape–pose-based generator (based on deep convolutional neural networks) and an enhanced multi-source discriminator. Using a machine learning approach, the reliance on multiple sensors is reduced and 3D human meshes can be recovered using a single camera, thereby reducing the cost of building smart cities. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.1% in body shape recovery; it can also process 34 images per second. The method proposed in this paper approach significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches. Given a single view image of various humans, our results can be used to generate various 3D human models, which can facilitate 3D human modeling work to simulate virtual cities. Since our method can also restore the poses of the humans in the image, it is possible to create various human poses by given corresponding images with specific human poses.",

Producers, food industries and or traders have difficulties in defining the period when fruit are at the highest level of quality desired by consumers in terms of the physical-chemical parameters (hardness –H–, soluble solids content –SSC–, and acidity –Ac–). The evolution of peach quality in terms of these parameters depends directly on storage temperature –T– and relative humidity –RH–, as well on the storage duration –t–. This paper describes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Decision Support System (DSS) designed to predict the evolution of the quality of peaches, namely the storage time required before commercialization as well as the late commercialization time. The peaches quality is stated in terms of the values of SSC, H and Ac that consumers most like for the storage T and RH. An Artificial neuronal network (ANN) is proposed to provide this prediction. The training and validation of the ANN were conducted with experimental data acquired in three different farmers’ cold storage facilities. A user interface was developed to provide an expedited and simple prediction of the marketable time of peaches, considering the storage temperature, relative humidity, and initial physical and chemical parameters. This AI DSS may help the vegetable sector (logistics and retailers), especially smaller neighborhood grocery stores, define the marketable period of fruit. It will contribute with advantages and benefits for all parties—producers, traders, retailers, and consumers—by being able to provide fruit at the highest quality and reducing waste in the process.

By combining extensive study of the literature and expert interviews, this research explores the underlying reasons why many smart city initiatives relying on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) fail to scale up. The findings suggest that a multitude of factors may leave organizations ill prepared for smart city AIoT solutions, and that these tend to multiply when cities lack much-needed resources and capabilities.

Strategic factors tend to be more prominent in the earlier stages, whereas factors relating to people and the organization tend to feature later when organizations roll out solutions.

The number of public and private transportation vehicles is rapidly increasing, thus resulting in traffic congestion, traffic accidents, and environmental pollution. Although major cities have undergone considerable development in terms of transportation infrastructure, problems caused by a high number of moving vehicles cannot be completely resolved through the expansion of streets and facilities. This paper proposes a solution for the parking problem in cities that entails a shared parking system. The primary concept of the proposed shared parking system is to release parking lots that are open to specific groups for public usage without overriding personal usage. Open-to-specific-groups parking lots consist of parking spaces provided for particular people, such as parking buildings at universities for teachers, staff, and students. The proposed shared parking system comprises four primary steps: collecting and preprocessing data by using an Internet of Things system, predicting internal demand by using a recurrent neural network algorithm, releasing several unoccupied parking lots based on prediction results, and continuously updating the real-time data to improve future internal usage prediction. Data collection and data forecasting are performed to ensure that the system does not override personal usage. This study applied several forecasting algorithms, including seasonal ARIMA, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural network, long short-term memory recurrent neural network with a many-to-one structure, and long short-term memory recurrent neural network with a many-to-many structure. The proposed system was evaluated using artificial and real datasets. Results show that the recurrent neural network with the many-to-many structure generates the most accurate prediction. Furthermore, the proposed shared parking system was evaluated for some scenarios in which different numbers of parking spaces were released. Simulation results show that the proposed shared parking system can provide parking spaces for public usage without overriding personal usage.

The increased computing capacity of the nodes that create the network is allowing the addition of processing algorithms and artificial intelligence that provide more information about the sound sources and environment, e.g., detect sound events or calculate loudness. Several models to predict sound pressure levels in cities are available, mainly road, railway and aerial traffic noise. However, these models are mostly based in auxiliary data, e.g., vehicles flow or street geometry, and predict equivalent levels for a temporal long-term. Therefore, forecasting of temporal short-term sound levels could be a helpful tool for urban planners and managers. In this work, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network technique is proposed to model temporal behavior of sound levels at a certain location, both sound pressure level and loudness level, in order to predict near-time future values. The proposed technique can be trained for and integrated in every node of a sensor network to provide novel functionalities, e.g., a method of early warning against noise pollution and of backup in case of node or network malfunction. To validate this approach, one-minute period equivalent sound levels, captured in a two-month measurement campaign by a node of a deployed network of acoustic sensors, have been used to train it and to obtain different forecasting models. Assessments of the developed LSTM models and Auto regressive integrated moving average models were performed to predict sound levels for several time periods, from 1 to 60 min. Comparison of the results show that the LSTM models outperform the statistics-based models. In general, the LSTM models achieve a prediction of values with a mean square error less than 4.3 dB for sound pressure level and less than 2 phons for loudness. Moreover, the goodness of fit of the LSTM models and the behavior pattern of the data in terms of prediction of sound levels are satisfactory.",

In addition to assisting traffic management authorities, traffic forecasting can help drivers to choose the best path to their destinations. Accurate traffic forecasting is a basic requirement for traffic management. We propose a traffic forecasting approach that utilizes air pollution and atmospheric parameters. Air pollution levels are often associated with traffic intensity, and much work is already available in which air pollution has been predicted using road traffic. However, to the best of our knowledge, an attempt to improve forecasting road traffic using air pollution and atmospheric parameters is not yet available in the literature. In our preliminary experiments, we found out the relation between traffic intensity, air pollution, and atmospheric parameters. Therefore, we believe that addition of air pollutants and atmospheric parameters can improve the traffic forecasting. Our method uses air pollution gases, including     C O , N O , N  O 2  , N  O x  ,     and     O 3    . We chose these gases because they are associated with road traffic. Some atmospheric parameters, including pressure, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed have also been considered, as these parameters can play an important role in the dispersion of the above-mentioned gases. Data related to traffic flow, air pollution, and the atmosphere were collected from the open data portal of Madrid, Spain.

Unavailability of free parking spaces is one of the major reasons for traffic jams. Congestion and parking are interrelated because searching for a free parking spot creates additional delays and increase local circulation. In the center of large cities, 10% of the traffic circulation is due to cruising, as drivers nearly spend 20 min searching for free parking space. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a parking space availability prediction system that can inform the drivers in advance about the location-wise, day-wise, and hour-wise occupancy of parking lots. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on a deep long short term memory network to predict the availability of parking space with the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), cloud technology, and sensor networks. We use the Birmingham parking sensors dataset to evaluate the performance of deep long short term memory networks. Three types of experiments are performed to predict the availability of free parking space which is based on location, days of a week, and working hours of a day.

This paper presents a chronology of factors on the development of smart cities, including IoT technologies as network infrastructure. Increasing IoT nodes leads to increasing data flow, which is a potential source of failure for IoT networks. The biggest challenge of IoT networks is that the IoT may have insufficient memory to handle all transaction data within the IoT network. We aim in this paper to propose a potential compression method for reducing IoT network data traffic. Therefore, we investigate various lossless compression algorithms, such as entropy or dictionary-based algorithms, and general compression methods to determine which algorithm or method adheres to the IoT specifications. Furthermore, this study conducts compression experiments using entropy (Huffman, Adaptive Huffman) and Dictionary (LZ77, LZ78) as well as five different types of datasets of the IoT data traffic. Though the above algorithms can alleviate the IoT data traffic, adaptive Huffman gave the best compression algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to propose a conceptual compression method for IoT data traffic by improving an adaptive Huffman based on deep learning concepts using weights, pruning, and pooling in the neural network. The proposed algorithm is believed to obtain a better compression ratio. Additionally, in this paper, we also discuss the challenges of applying the proposed algorithm to IoT data compression due to the limitations of IoT memory and IoT processor, which later it can be implemented in IoT networks.",

This paper focuses on addressing two important research gaps in HAR research: (i) improving the HAR prediction accuracy and (ii) managing the frequent changes in the environment and data related to user activities. To address this, we propose an HAR method based on Soft-Voting and Self-Learning (SVSL). SVSL uses two strategies.

The first dataset consists of 562 features and the second dataset consists of five features. The data are collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope smartphone sensors.

For instance, mobile nodes are already utilized in many applications, and their localization needs to be considered during the deployment process. Besides, heterogeneous nodes are employed in many recent applications due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, the development areas might have different properties due to their importance. Those parameters increase the deployment complexity and make it hard to reach the best deployment scheme.

They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models.

The extreme conditions of vehicular environments, nonetheless, make communication between nodes that may be moving at very high speeds very difficult to achieve, so non-deterministic approaches are necessary to maximize the chances of packet delivery.

The best performing machine learning model, its architecture and parameters for a given task are ideally automatically determined through a hyperparameter tuning process. At the same time, edge computing is an emerging distributed computing paradigm that aims to bring computation and data storage closer to the location where they are needed to save network bandwidth or reduce the latency of requests. The challenge we address in this work is that hyperparameter tuning does not take into consideration resource trade-offs when selecting the best model for deployment in smart environments. The most accurate model might be prohibitively expensive to computationally evaluate on a resource constrained node at the edge of the network. We propose a multi-objective optimization solution to find acceptable trade-offs between model accuracy and resource consumption to enable the deployment of machine learning models in resource constrained smart environments. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by means of an anomaly detection use case.

The integration of these digitalization tools at the organizational level poses not only opportunities but also some challenges for the actors involved in infrastructure projects. An approach that is currently promoted in the infrastructure sector is the Building Information Model (BIM), which is a decision-making instrument that leverages various digitalization tools and applications. However, although the economic implications of BIM are widely discussed in the literature, the (inter-) organizational dynamics involving multiple actors in infrastructure projects are not fully grasped. Large infrastructure projects are sociotechnical endeavors embedded in complex institutional frames; hence the institutional norms, practices and logics in them are significant. Responding to this, this paper adopted an institutional analysis and put the BIM approach in the (inter-) organizational context in infrastructure delivery. Drawing on empirical data from three organizations in infrastructure delivery in Spain, this paper analyzed the tensions among actors during BIM adoption and implementation.",

We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of &lsquo;explainable deep learning&rsquo; as a subset of the &lsquo;explainable AI&rsquo; problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project. Monitoring of gullies and drainage in crucial geographical areas susceptible to flooding issues is an important aspect of any flood monitoring solution. Typical solutions for this problem involve the use of cameras to capture images showing the affected areas in real-time with different objects such as leaves, plastic bottles etc., and building a DL-based classifier to detect such objects and classify blockages based on the presence and coverage of these objects in the images. In this work, we uniquely propose an Explainable AI solution using DL and Semantic Web technologies to build a hybrid classifier. In this hybrid classifier, the DL component detects object presence and coverage level and semantic rules designed with close consultation with experts carry out the classification. By using the expert knowledge in the flooding context, our hybrid classifier provides the flexibility on categorising the image using objects and their coverage relationships. The experimental results demonstrated with a real-world use case showed that this hybrid approach of image classification has on average 11% improvement (F-Measure) in image classification performance compared to DL-only classifier. It also has the distinct advantage of integrating experts&rsquo; knowledge on defining the decision-making rules to represent the complex circumstances and using such knowledge to explain the results.",

Today, advanced VQA approaches model dense interactions between image regions and question words by designing co-attention mechanisms to achieve better accuracy. However, modeling interactions between each image region and each question word will force the model to calculate irrelevant information, thus causing the model&rsquo;s attention to be distracted. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a novel model called Multi-modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks (MESAN), which concentrates the model&rsquo;s attention by explicitly selecting the parts of the input features that are the most relevant to answering the input question. We consider that this method based on top-k selection can reduce the interference caused by irrelevant information and ultimately help the model to achieve better performance. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset VQA v2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our best single model delivers 70.71% and 71.08% overall accuracy on the test-dev and test-std sets, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can obtain better attended features than other advanced models through attention visualization.

Most of the intelligent systems are composed of prefabricated components. Inappropriate composition of components may lead to unsafe, power-consuming, and vulnerable intelligent systems. Although artificial intelligence-based systems can provide various advantages for humanity, they have several dark sides that can affect our lives. Some terms, such as security, trust, privacy, safety, and fairness, relate to the dark sides of artificial intelligence, which may be inherent to the intelligent systems. Existing solutions either focus on solving a specific problem or consider the some other challenge without addressing the fundamental issues of artificial intelligence. In other words, there is no general framework to conduct a component selection process while considering the dark sides in the literature. Hence, in this paper, we proposed a new framework for the component selection of intelligent systems while considering the dark sides of artificial intelligence. This framework consists of four phases, namely, component analyzing, extracting criteria and weighting, formulating the problem as multiple knapsacks, and finding components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first component selection framework to deal with the dark sides of artificial intelligence. We also developed a case study for the component selection issue in autonomous vehicles to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework.

Anonymization of data sets with multiple sensitive attributes presents some unique problems due to the correlation among these attributes. Artificial intelligence techniques can help the data publishers in anonymizing such data.

(*). In the second part of the article, a new solution is proposed for the detection of applications faults or unauthorized intrusions in traffic of communications networks. The first objective of the proposed method is to propose an approach for predicting time series. This approach is based on a multi-resolution decomposition of the signals employing the undecimate wavelet transform (UWT). The second approach for assessing traffic flow is based on the analysis of long-range dependence (LRD) (for this case, a long-term dependence). Estimating the degree of long-range dependence is performed by estimating the Hurst parameter of the analyzed time series. This is a relatively new statistical concept in communications traffic analysis and can be implemented using UWT. This property has important implications for network performance, design, and sizing. The presence of long-range dependency in network traffic is assumed to have a significant impact on network performance, and the occurrence of LRD can be the result of faults that occur during certain periods. The strategy chosen for this purpose is based on long-term dependence on traffic, and for the prediction of faults occurrence, a predictive control model (MPC) is proposed, combined with a neural network with radial function (RBF). It is demonstrated via simulations that, in the case of communications traffic, time location is the most important feature of the proposed algorithm.",

AI, if implemented ethically for sustainability, can enhance biodiversity, conserve water and energy resources, provide land-related services, power smart cities, and help mitigate climate change. However, there are significant issues in using AI to transition to sustainable food systems. AI’s own carbon footprint could cancel out any sustainability benefits that it creates. Additionally, the technology could further entrench inequalities between and within countries, and bias against minorities or less powerful groups. This paper draws on findings from a study of the Victorian Farmers’ Markets Association (VFMA) that investigated the complexity of designing AI tools to enhance sustainability and resilience for the benefit of the organisation and its members. Codesign workshops, both synchronous and asynchronous, semi-structured interviews, and design innovation methods led the VFMA to experiment with an AI tool to link sustainable soil practices, nutrient rich produce, and human health. The analysis shows that the codesign process and an agile approach created a co-learning environment where sustainability and ethical questions could be considered iteratively within transdisciplinary engagement. The bottom-up approach developed through this study supports organisations who want to engage with AI while reinforcing fairness, transparency, and sustainability.",

Smart cities were created to support residents in using various services, to give them the possibility of easy communication without time and local barriers. Therefore, high-quality smart solutions in cities significantly affect trust in the city and can affect its reputation. Given that the purpose of the article is to examine the perception of intelligent solutions also in the field of energy and their impact on the sense of privacy and security, different exchanges of perceptions of quality, the risks they pose to residents and their perception of what gives a picture, have been studied. The results of empirical research clearly showed that the safety and level of satisfaction with the activities carried out by the city have a significant impact on the perceived quality, which in turn has a positive impact on reputation. The authors proposed a methodology based on the Kano model for examining residents’ satisfaction in order to investigate undefined desires and identified and confirmed needs and to study the analysis of risk and potential threats. The study was in the form of a proprietary questionnaire that can be used in similar surveys on the satisfaction of residents; 2685 correctly completed questionnaires were analyzed and the results obtained after submission were included in management action plans.

This mechanism utilizes the advantages of a centralized control SDN (software defined network) and flexible traffic scheduling. The OpenFlow protocol is used to monitor the running status and link load information of the network in real time. According to the bandwidth requirement of the data flow, the improved load balanced routing is obtained by an Elman neural network. The simulation results show that the improved SDSNLB (software-defined sensor network load balancing) routing algorithm has better performance than LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol in balancing node traffic and improving throughput.",

In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the per-pixel depths from a single image. Inspired by the recent works on generative neural network models, we formulate the task of depth estimation as a generative task where we synthesize an image of the depth map from a single Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) input image. We propose a novel generative adversarial network that has an encoder-decoder type generator with residual transposed convolution blocks trained with an adversarial loss.

Automatic detection of violence for quick actions is very significant and can efficiently assist the concerned departments. In this paper, we propose a triple-staged end-to-end deep learning violence detection framework. First, persons are detected in the surveillance video stream using a light-weight convolutional neural network (CNN) model to reduce and overcome the voluminous processing of useless frames. Second, a sequence of 16 frames with detected persons is passed to 3D CNN, where the spatiotemporal features of these sequences are extracted and fed to the Softmax classifier. Furthermore, we optimized the 3D CNN model using an open visual inference and neural networks optimization toolkit developed by Intel, which converts the trained model into intermediate representation and adjusts it for optimal execution at the end platform for the final prediction of violent activity. After detection of a violent activity, an alert is transmitted to the nearest police station or security department to take prompt preventive actions.

Firstly, under the guidance of user behavior cognition, the characteristics of multi-channel information resources in a VR system were analyzed, and the correlation matrix of the VR system scenario resource characteristics was constructed based on the design criteria of human&ndash;computer interaction, cognition, and low-load demand. Secondly, analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-QFD combined with evaluation matrix is used to output the priority ranking of VR system resource characteristics. Then, the VR system task scenario cognitive load experiment is carried out on users, and the CNN input set and output set data are collected through the experiment, in order to build a CNN system and predict the user cognitive load and satisfaction in the human&ndash;computer interaction in the VR system.

However, traditional ways of measuring urban shrinkage are focused on tracking population loss at the city level and are unable to capture the spatially heterogeneous shrinking patterns inside a city. Consequently, the spatial mechanism and patterns of urban shrinkage inside a city remain less understood, which is unhelpful for developing accommodation strategies for shrinkage. The smart city initiatives and practices have provided a rich pool of geospatial big data resources and technologies to tackle the complexity of urban systems. Given this context, we propose a new measure for the delineation of shrinking areas within cities by introducing a new concept of functional urban shrinkage, which aims to capture the mismatch between urban built-up areas and the areas where significantly intensive human activities take place. Taking advantage of a data fusion approach to integrating multi-source geospatial big data and survey data, a general analytical framework is developed to construct functional shrinkage measures. Specifically, Landsat-8 remote sensing images were used for extracting urban built-up areas by supervised neural network classifications and Geographic Information System tools, while cellular signaling data from China Unicom Inc. was used to depict human activity areas generated by spatial clustering methods. Combining geospatial big data with urban land-use functions obtained from land surveys and Points-Of-Interests data, the framework further enables the comparison between cities from dimensions characterized by indices of spatial and urban functional characteristics and the landscape fragmentation; thus, it has the capacity to facilitate an in-depth investigation of fundamental causes and internal mechanisms of urban shrinkage. With a case study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei megaregion using data from various sources collected for the year of 2018, we demonstrate the validity of this approach and its potential generalizability for other spatial contexts in facilitating timely and better-informed planning decision support.",

In 3D urban models, road signs are small but provide valuable information for navigation. However, due to the problems of sliced shape features, blurred texture and high incline angles, road signs cannot be fully reconstructed in oblique photogrammetry, even with state-of-the-art algorithms. The poor reconstruction of road signs commonly leads to less informative guidance and unsatisfactory visual appearance. In this paper, we present a pipeline for embedding road sign models based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). First, we present an end-to-end balanced-learning framework for small object detection that takes advantage of the region-based CNN and a data synthesis strategy. Second, under the geometric constraints placed by the bounding boxes, we use the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) to extract the corresponding points on the road signs. Third, we obtain the coarse location of a single road sign by triangulating the corresponding points and refine the location via outlier removal. Least-squares fitting is then applied to the refined point cloud to fit a plane for orientation prediction. Finally, we replace the road signs with computer-aided design models in the 3D urban scene with the predicted location and orientation. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a high mAP in road sign detection and produces visually plausible embedded results, which demonstrates its effectiveness for road sign modeling in oblique photogrammetry-based 3D scene reconstruction.",

However, the traditional processing of large amounts of spatial data has become increasingly costly, both time-wise and financially. Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have been increasingly used for 3D segmentation tasks. Yet, most of these deep neural networks (DNNs) were conducted on benchmarks. It is, therefore, arguable whether DL approaches can achieve the state-of-the-art performance of 3D point clouds segmentation in real-life scenarios.

Based on the similarity of the parking duration distributions, we propose an attention mechanism called distAtt to measure the similarity of parking duration distributions. Through the distAtt mechanism, we add the long-term spatial–temporal correlations to our spatial–temporal convolutional block, and thus, we can capture complex hybrid spatial–temporal correlations to achieve a higher accuracy of parking availability prediction.

This forecasted temperature is fed into a fuzzy controller for optimizing output based on user demand. This processed information leads to energy distribution based on their requirement using a smart energy sensing system. Based on the experimentation result and performance analysis, it was found that the proposed system is more robust and has a high control response in comparison to the existing systems with minimum energy consumption. The analytical results support the feasibility of the proposed framework architecture to facilitate energy conserving in smart city buildings.",

This phenomenon is mainly due to the evolution of high-speed broadband Internet and, more specifically, the popularization and wide spread use of smartphones and associated accessible data plans. Although 4G with its long-term evolution (LTE) technology is seen as a mature technology, there is continual improvement to its radio technology and architecture such as in the scope of the LTE Advanced standard, a major enhancement of LTE. However, for the long run, the next generation of telecommunication (5G) is considered and is gaining considerable momentum from both industry and researchers. In addition, with the deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, smart cities, vehicular networks, e-health systems, and Industry 4.0, a new plethora of 5G services has emerged with very diverging and technologically challenging design requirements. These include high mobile data volume per area, high number of devices connected per area, high data rates, longer battery life for low-power devices, and reduced end-to-end latency. Several technologies are being developed to meet these new requirements, and each of these technologies brings its own design issues and challenges. In this context, deep learning models could be seen as one of the main tools that can be used to process monitoring data and automate decisions. As these models are able to extract relevant features from raw data (images, texts, and other types of unstructured data), the integration between 5G and DL looks promising and one that requires exploring. As main contribution, this paper presents a systematic review about how DL is being applied to solve some 5G issues. Differently from the current literature, we examine data from the last decade and the works that address diverse 5G specific problems, such as physical medium state estimation, network traffic prediction, user device location prediction, self network management, among others. We also discuss the main research challenges when using deep learning models in 5G scenarios and identify several issues that deserve further consideration.",

However, for our time-series forecasting problem, deep learning methods are preferable when it comes to simplicity and immediacy of use, since they do not require a time-consuming model selection for each different cell. Deep learning approaches are also appropriate when aiming to reduce the maximum forecasting error. Statistical methods instead show their superiority in providing more precise forecasting results, but they require data domain knowledge and computationally expensive techniques in order to select the best parameters.",

However, state-of-the-art image-based automatic 3D reconstruction methods cannot effectively handle the unavoidable geometric deformation and incorrect texture mapping problems caused by moving cars in a city. This paper proposes a method to address this situation and prevent the influence of moving cars on 3D modelling by recognizing moving cars and combining the recognition results with a photogrammetric 3D modelling procedure. Through car detection using a deep learning method and multiview geometry constraints, we can analyse the state of a car’s movement and apply a proper preprocessing method to the geometrically model generation and texture mapping steps of 3D reconstruction pipelines. First, we apply the traditional Mask R-CNN object detection method to detect cars from oblique images. Then, a detected car and its corresponding image patch calculated by the geometry constraints in the other view images are used to identify the moving state of the car. Finally, the geometry and texture information corresponding to the moving car will be processed according to its moving state. Experiments on three different urban datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in recognizing and removing moving cars and can repair the geometric deformation and error texture mapping problems caused by moving cars. In addition, the methods proposed in this paper can be applied to eliminate other moving objects in 3D modelling applications.",

To cater to this, there is a need to develop and implement real-time flood management systems that could instantly detect flooded regions to initiate relief activities as early as possible. Current imaging systems, relying on satellites, have demonstrated low accuracy and delayed response, making them unreliable and impractical to be used in emergency responses to natural disasters such as flooding. This research employs Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to develop an automated imaging system that can identify inundated areas from aerial images. The Haar cascade classifier was explored in the case study to detect landmarks such as roads and buildings from the aerial images captured by UAVs and identify flooded areas. The extracted landmarks are added to the training dataset that is used to train a deep learning algorithm. Experimental results show that buildings and roads can be detected from the images with 91% and 94% accuracy, respectively. The overall accuracy of 91% is recorded in classifying flooded and non-flooded regions from the input case study images. The system has shown promising results on test images belonging to both pre- and post-flood classes.

The DGG mainly contains three parts, i.e., Detecting Candidate Frame of Gathering (DCFG), Gathering Area Detection (GAD), and Gathering Judgement (GJ). The DCFG is proposed to find the frame index in a video that has the maximum people number based on the crowd counting method. This frame means that the crowd has gathered and the specific gathering area will be detected next.

In the near future, biometrics systems will be everywhere in the society, such as government, education, smart cities, banks etc. Due to its uniqueness, characteristic, biometrics systems will become more and more vulnerable, privacy being one of the most important challenges. The classic cryptographic primitives are not sufficient to assure a strong level of secureness for privacy. The current paper has several objectives. The main objective consists in creating a framework based on cryptographic modules which can be applied in systems with biometric authentication methods. The technologies used in creating the framework are: C#, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell. The wide range of technologies for developing the algorithms give the readers the possibility and not only, to choose the proper modules for their own research or business direction. The cryptographic modules contain algorithms based on machine learning and modern cryptographic algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption System), SHA-256, RC4, RC5, RC6, MARS, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, THREEFISH, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), Elliptic Curve, and Diffie Hellman. As methods for implementing with success the cryptographic modules, we will propose a methodology which can be used as a how-to guide. The article will focus only on the first category, machine learning, and data clustering, algorithms with applicability in the cloud computing environment. For tests we have used a virtual machine (Virtual Box) with Apache Hadoop and a Biometric Analysis Tool. The weakness of the algorithms and methods implemented within the framework will be evaluated and presented in order for the reader to acknowledge the latest status of the security analysis and the vulnerabilities founded in the mentioned algorithms. Another important result of the authors consists in creating a scheme for biometric enrollment (in Results). The purpose of the scheme is to give a big overview on how to use it, step by step, in real life, and how to use the algorithms. In the end, as a conclusion, the current work paper gives a comprehensive background on the most important and challenging aspects on how to design and implement an authentication system based on biometrics characteristics.",

This 10V data growth poses two primary challenges, namely storing and processing. Concerning the latter, new frameworks have been developed including distributed platforms such as the Hadoop ecosystem. Classification is a major machine learning task typically executed on distributed platforms and as a consequence many algorithmic techniques have been developed tailored for these platforms. This article extensively relies in two ways on classifiers implemented in MLlib, the main machine learning library for the Hadoop ecosystem. First, a vast number of classifiers is applied to two datasets, namely Higgs and PAMAP. Second, a two-step classification is ab ovo performed to the same datasets. Specifically, the singular value decomposition of the data matrix determines first a set of transformed attributes which in turn drive the classifiers of MLlib. The twofold purpose of the proposed architecture is to reduce complexity while maintaining a similar if not better level of the metrics of accuracy, recall, and     F 1    .

SIS, the technologies that build on big data analytics, typically facilitated by AI techniques such as machine learning, are expected to grow in importance and impact. Some of these impacts are likely to be beneficial, notably the growth in efficiency and profits, which will contribute to societal wellbeing. At the same time, there are significant ethical concerns about the consequences of algorithmic biases, job loss, power asymmetries and surveillance, as a result of SIS use. SIS have the potential to exacerbate inequality and further entrench the market dominance of big tech companies, if left uncontrolled. Measuring the impact of SIS on SDGs thus provides a way of assessing whether an SIS or an application of such a technology is acceptable in terms of balancing foreseeable benefits and harms. One possible approach is to use the SDGs as guidelines to determine the ethical nature of SIS implementation. While the idea of using SDGs as a yardstick to measure the acceptability of emerging technologies is conceptually strong, there should be empirical evidence to support such approaches.

Though with the enormous usage of the Internet of Medical Things, security and privacy become intrinsic issues, thus adversaries can exploit these devices or information on these devices for malicious intents. These devices generate and log large and complex raw data which are used by decision support systems to provide better care to patients. Investigation of these enormous and complicated data from a victim&rsquo;s device is a daunting and time-consuming task for an investigator. Different feature-based frameworks have been proposed to resolve this problem to detect early and effectively the access logs to better assess the event. But the problem with the existing approaches is that it forces the investigator to manually comb through collected data which can contain a huge amount of irrelevant data. These data are provided normally in textual form to the investigators which are too time-consuming for the investigations even if they can utilize machine learning or natural language processing techniques.

However, due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the context-aware IoT security solutions, especially for a sensitive use case like IoT healthcare environment.",

Solutions aiming to guarantee QoS support have not been deployed in large-scale networks. Traffic classification is a mechanism used to manage different aspects, including QoS requirements. However, conventional traffic classification methods, such as the port-based method, are inefficient because of their inability to handle dynamic port allocation and encryption. Traffic classification using machine learning has gained research interest as an alternative method to achieve high performance. In fact, machine learning embeds intelligence into network functions, thus improving network management. In this study, we apply machine learning algorithms to predict network traffic classification. We apply four supervised learning algorithms: support vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and decision tree. We also apply a port-based method of traffic classification based on applications’ popular assigned port numbers. Then, we compare the results of this method to those obtained from the machine learning algorithms. The evaluation results indicate that the decision tree algorithm provides the highest average accuracy among the evaluated algorithms, at 99.18%. Moreover, network traffic classification using machine learning provides more accurate results and higher performance than the port-based method.",

Additionally, the distributed nature of data processing in many proposed solutions explicitly increases the threats of information leakages and damages the network integrity.

In smart grids (SGs), quality of service (QoS) and AMI traffic management need to be considered in the design of efficient AMI architectures. In this article, we propose a QoS-aware machine-learning-based framework for AMI applications in smart grids. Our proposed framework comprises a three-tier hierarchical architecture for AMI applications, a machine-learning-based hierarchical clustering approach, and a priority-based scheduling technique to ensure QoS in AMI applications in smart grids. We introduce a three-tier hierarchical architecture for AMI applications in smart grids to take advantage of IoT communication technologies and the cloud infrastructure. In this architecture, smart meters are deployed over a georeferenced area where the control center has remote access over the Internet to these network devices. More specifically, these devices can be digitally controlled and monitored using simple web interfaces such as REST APIs. We modify the existing K-means algorithm to construct a hierarchical clustering topology that employs Wi-SUN technology for bi-directional communication between smart meters and data concentrators. Further, we develop a queuing model in which different priorities are assigned to each item of the critical and normal AMI traffic based on its latency and packet size. The critical AMI traffic is scheduled first using priority-based scheduling while the normal traffic is scheduled with a first-in&ndash;first-out scheduling scheme to ensure the QoS requirements of both traffic classes in the smart grid network. The numerical results demonstrate that the target coverage and connectivity requirements of all smart meters are fulfilled with the least number of data concentrators in the design. Additionally, the numerical results show that the architectural cost is reduced, and the bottleneck problem of the data concentrator is eliminated. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated and validated on the CloudSim simulator. The simulation results of our proposed framework show efficient performance in terms of CPU utilization compared to a traditional framework that uses single-hop communication from smart meters to data concentrators with a first-in&ndash;first-out scheduling scheme.",

In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of new vehicular applications and services, Edge Computing (EC) is one of the most promising technologies when integrated into the Vehicular Networks (VNs). EC-enabled VNs can facilitate new latency-critical and data-intensive applications and services. However, ground-based EC platforms (i.e., Road Side Units&mdash;RSUs, 5G Base Stations&mdash;5G BS) can only serve a reduced number of Vehicular Users (VUs), due to short coverage ranges and resource shortage.

The goal of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a novel joint air-ground EC platform within a VN architecture for helping VUs with new intelligent applications and services.

A sufficient sample size has been identified as a very crucial pre-request in machine learning algorithms for urban landuse classification. However, it is often difficult to recognize and label landuse categories from remote sensing images alone. Alternatively, field investigation is time-consuming with a high demand in human resources and monetary cost. Therefore, previous studies on urban landuse classification have often relied on a small size of labeled samples with very uneven spatial distribution. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of a semi-supervised classification framework with multi-source data for detailed urban landuse classification with a few labeled samples. A disagreement-based semi-supervised learning approach, the Co-Forest, was employed and compared with traditional supervised methods (e.g., random forest and XGBoost). Multi-source geospatial data were utilized including optical and nighttime light remote sensing and geospatial big data, which present the physical and socio-economic features of landuse categories. Taking urban landuse classification in Shenzhen City as a case, results show that the classification accuracy of the semi-supervised method are generally on par with that of traditional supervised methods, and less labeled samples are needed to achieve a comparable result under different training set ratios. Given a small sample size, the accuracy tends to be stable with training samples no less than 5% in total. Our results also indicate that the classification accuracy by using multi-source data is significantly higher than that with any single data source being applied. Among these data, map POI and high-resolution optical remote sensing data make larger contributions on the classification, followed by mobile data and nighttime light remote sensing data.",

The municipalities and the city administrations use the traditional wastage classification techniques which are manual, very slow, inefficient and costly. Therefore, automatic waste classification and management is essential for the cities that are being urbanized for the better recycling of waste. Better recycling of waste gives the opportunity to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills by reducing the need to collect new raw material.

Our aim is to provide an efficient framework to support the decision making of the QC that should swiftly select the appropriate processor for each query. We provide mathematical formulations for the discussed problem and present simulation results. Through a comprehensive experimental evaluation, we reveal the advantages of the proposed models and describe the outcomes results while comparing them with a deterministic framework.",

Most of fatalities occur because of the late response to these emergency cases. The time after the traumatic injury is called the golden hour, where providing essential medical and surgical aid at that time increases the probability of saving human lives by one-third an average. Thus, the focus of this paper was to develop a system based on IoT for accident detection and classification. The system detects and classifies vehicle accidents based on severity level and reports the essential information about the accident to emergency services providers. The system consists of a microcontroller, GPS, and a group of sensors to determine different physical parameters related to vehicle motion. In addition, different types of machine learning classifiers were examined with the developed system to determine the most accurate classifier for the system. The classifiers are the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Naive-Bayes Tree (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). The implementation of the system showed that GMM and CART models were better in terms of precision and recall. It was also shown that the severity of accidents depends mainly on the g-force value and fire occurrence.",
