abstract = {Urban route planning is important for smart cities and intelligent transportation systems. Most of the exiting methods of urban route planning are either graph based search algorithms or optimization methods, however they show many weaknesses in real-world applications due to their high computational complexities and needs for global information of urban environments. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based default logic for route planning. The proposed method is composed of three parts. The first part is the default theory of route planning, forcing no loops in the generated routes. The second part is the RNN based default reasoning to recommend default rules. The RNN outputs the probability distribution of the defaults used next, so the proposed method is a probabilistic method. The third part is the update algorithm of map models to improve the accuracy of default reasoning in dynamic environments. Training the proposed RNN is simple because no statistic computation is required for training. The time complexity of the proposed method during testing is just O(ρ2), where ρ is the length of the optimal route for two given nodes. To evaluate the proposed method, we build a new map model named BJ simulating the complex urban environments of the Beijing city, China. Extensive experiments on the BJ map model in both static and dynamic environments show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.}

abstract = {The identification of a favorable location for investment is a key aspect influencing the real estate market of a smart city. The number of factors that influence the identification easily runs into a few hundreds (including floor space area, crime in the locality and so on). Existing literature predominantly focuses on the analysis of price trends in a given location. This paper aims to develop a set of tools to compute an optimal location for investment, a problem which has received little attention in the literature (analysis of house price trends has received more attention). In previous work the authors proposed a machine learning approach for computing optimal locations. There are two main issues with the previous work. All real estate factors were assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables. To address this, in the current paper we propose a network structure to derive the relational inferences between the factors. However, solving the location identification problem using only a network incurs computational burden. Hence, the machine learning layers from the previous work is combined with a network layer for computing an optimal location with proven lower computational cost. A second issue is that the computations are performed on an online database which has inherent privacy risks. The online data, user information and the algorithms can be tampered through privacy breaches. We present a privacy preservation technique to protect the algorithms, and use blockchains to secure the identity of the user. This paper presents solutions to two interesting problems in the analysis of real estate networks: a) to design tools that can identify an optimal location for investment and b) to preserve the privacy of the entire process using privacy preserving techniques and block chains.}

It is an important step for extracting objects from remote-sensing images, and provides a reliable theoretical basis for key property monitoring, environmental monitoring, disaster monitoring, and agricultural monitoring. To improve the accuracy of object segmentation and to solve the problem of inadequate edge recognition, a joint-learning segmentation scheme was designed that combines the conditional random field (CRF) model with an improved U-net model. It employs the improved U-net model as the front-end model of the joint-learning framework for feature fusion and the CRF model as the back-end of the joint-learning framework for transforming to gradient optimization-based recurrent neural networks. The joint-learning framework enables the front and back parts to interact with each other to obtain the location of the target and its classification information accurately. The joint-learning framework was realized on open datasets and compared with state-of-the-art remote-sensing image segmentation algorithms. The experiment results show that the accuracy of the ground object segmentation improved to 86.1%, which is an encouraging improvement.}

Several studies revealed that the amount of energy spent on transmitting data from IoT devices to a cloud server is considerably high and resulted in rapid energy depletion. In this view, this paper presents an Energy Efficient Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Clustering (EEPSOC) technique for the effective selection of cluster heads (CHs) among diverse IoT devices. The IoT devices used for sensing healthcare data are grouped into a form of clusters and a CH will be elected by the use of EEPSOC. The elected CH will forward the data to the cloud server. Then, the CH is responsible for transmitting data of the IoT devices to the cloud server through fog devices. Next to that, an artificial neural network (ANN) based classification model is applied to diagnose the healthcare data in the cloud server to identify the severity of the diseases. For experimentation, a systematic student perspective healthcare data is produced utilizing UCI dataset and medicinal gadgets to foresee the diverse student levels of disease severity. A detailed comparative analysis is carried out and the simulation outcome ensured the goodness of the EEPSOC-ANN model over the compared methods under various aspects.}

The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based image demosaicking and denoising methods has been very successful. However, still there is a room for improvement in the network performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The main challenge that remains to be addressed is to guarantee the visual quality of reconstructed images, particularly in the presence of noise. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel demosaicking and denoising conjunct strategy using deep adaptive residual learning. The proposed framework has three stages. Initially, zero padding is performed to increase processing speed and preserve the edges of the image. In the second phase, we perform demosaicking using interpolation in order to find missing values using information about neighboring pixels. Finally, the reconstructed image is created using the original image. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, we used Pytorch and Google Colab with 400 images for training and 100 images for validation The outcomes show that the proposed scheme beats cutting edge joint demosaicking and denoising schemes regarding both structural similarity index metrics (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and basic similitude record measurements (SSIM).}

They mainly find applications in agriculture monitoring, environment monitoring, smart city development and defence. These applications demand high-end performance from the WSN. However, the performance of a WSN is highly vulnerable to various types of security threats. Any intrusion may reduce the performance of the WSN and result in fatal problems. Hence, fast intrusion detection and prevention is of great use. This paper aims towards fast detection and prevention of any intrusion using a machine learning approach based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model. We have proposed three methods (S-GPR, C-GPR and GPR) based on feature scaling for accurate prediction of k-barrier coverage probability. We have selected the number of nodes, sensing range, Sensor to Intruder Velocity Ratio (SIVR), Mobile to Static Node Ratio (MSNR), angle of the intrusion path, and required k as the potential features. These features are extracted using an analytical approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method III accurately predicts the k-barrier coverage probability and outperforms the other two methods (I and II) with a correlation coefficient (R = 0.85) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.095). Further, the proposed methods achieve a higher accuracy as compared to other benchmark schemes.}

abstract = {Smart cities are nowadays equipped with pervasive networks of sensors that monitor traffic in real-time and record huge volumes of traffic data. These datasets constitute a rich source of information that can be used to extract knowledge useful for municipalities and citizens. In this paper we are interested in exploiting such data to estimate future speed in traffic sensor networks, as accurate predictions have the potential to enhance decision making capabilities of traffic management systems. Building effective speed prediction models in large cities poses important challenges that stem from the complexity of traffic patterns, the number of traffic sensors typically deployed, and the evolving nature of sensor networks. Indeed, sensors are frequently added to monitor new road segments or replaced/removed due to different reasons (e.g., maintenance). Exploiting a large number of sensors for effective speed prediction thus requires smart solutions to collect vast volumes of data and train effective prediction models. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of real-world sensor networks calls for solutions that are resilient not only to changes in traffic behavior, but also to changes in the network structure, where the cold start problem represents an important challenge. We study three different approaches in the context of large and dynamic sensor networks: local, global, and cluster-based. The local approach builds a specific prediction model for each sensor of the network. Conversely, the global approach builds a single prediction model for the whole sensor network. Finally, the cluster-based approach groups sensors into homogeneous clusters and generates a model for each cluster. We provide a large dataset, generated from ∼1.3 billion records collected by up to 272 sensors deployed in Fortaleza, Brazil, and use it to experimentally assess the effectiveness and resilience of prediction models built according to the three aforementioned approaches. The results show that the global and cluster-based approaches provide very accurate prediction models that prove to be robust to changes in traffic behavior and in the structure of sensor networks.}

In order to reduce the road accidents, one key area of research is monitoring the driving behavior of drivers. Understanding the driver behavior is an essential component in Intelligent Driver Assistance Systems. One of potential cause of traffic fatalities is aggressive driving behavior. However, drivers are not fully aware of their aggressive actions. So, in order to increase awareness and to promote driver safety, a novel system has been proposed. In this work, we focus on DTW based event detection technique, which have not been researched in motion sensors based time series data to a great extent. Our motivation is to improve the classification accuracy to detect sudden braking and aggressive driving behaviors using sensory data collected from smartphone. A very significant feature of DTW is to be able to automatically cope with time deformations and different speeds associated with time-dependent data which makes it suitable for our chosen application where data might get affected due to factors such as: high variability in road and vehicle conditions, heterogeneous smartphone sensors, etc. Our technique is novel as it uses fusion of sensors to enhance detection accuracy. The experimental results show that proposed algorithm outperforms the existing machine learning and threshold-based techniques with 100% detection rate of braking events and 97% & 86.67% detection rate of normal left & right turns and aggressive left & right turns respectively.}

Smart places (cities, districts, neighbourhoods, ecosystems) depend on the way digitalisation disrupts systems of innovation in cities, making it more open, global, participatory and experimental. We argue that the rise and interconnection of various types of intelligence (artificial, human, collective) could bring profound changes in the way smart places are being created and evolve. In this context, cyber-physical systems of innovation are deployed through multiple nodes acquiring digital companions, collaboration is deployed over physical, social, and digital spaces, and actors can use complex methods guided by software and get insights from data and analytics. The paper also presents the case study of OnlineS3, a two-year Horizon 2020 project, which developed and tested a digital platform composed of applications, datasets and roadmaps, which altogether create a digital environment for empowering the design of smart specialisation strategies for local and regional systems of innovation. The results indicate that digital transformation allows the operationalisation of multiple methodologies which have not been used earlier by policy makers, due to lack of capabilities. It can also increase the scalability of indicators facilitating decision making at different spatial scales and, therefore, better respond to the complexity of innovation systems providing dynamic and scale-diverse information.}

abstract = {This study financed by ERDF and the Wallonia Region estimates the annual electricity consumption (EC) of building stock, including the 3 building sectors namely residential, tertiary and industrial building. The estimation takes into account appliances, electrical heating, cooling, lighting, cooking and EC by m2 on a building level. The results are spatialized on different territorial scales. Using cadastral data of more than 1,700,000 Walloon buildings and annual EC data from a sample collected in 2012 from the energy reports, the paper assesses the EC of the whole building stock and tests to what extent different types of variables (building factors and socio-demographics) explain annual EC. It then shows which individual variables have the highest explanatory power. In contrast to many other studies, the research recognizes the problem of multicollinearity between predictors in regression analysis and uses Lasso regression to address this issue. Three separate regression models were used to study the predictors of annual EC of residential, tertiary and industrial buildings. EC building factors (appliances, auxiliary and main heating, domestic hot water and cooking) explained the largest share which is 66.46% of the variability in EC for residential buildings whereas the EC usages share for tertiary buildings (lighting, heating and domestic hot water, air conditioning, cooling, etc.) is about 50.53% and 38.55% for industrial buildings. Socio-demographic variables on their own explained about 61.59%, 26.34% and 3.41% of the annual EC, respectively for residential, tertiary and industrial buildings. Hence, the building variables present the highest explanatory power for EC, presumably because heating and cooling EC are included in this study. The study highlights that when attempting to explain EC related to Walloon households, including heating and cooling EC, appliances usage has the strongest predictive power in residential buildings. On the other hand, the projected decrease in EC use for heating in existing residential buildings is −8.82% and −10% for existing tertiary buildings while the projected increase in EC use for cooling in existing tertiary buildings is + 11.94% from 2012 to 2050 on a regional scale. These trends follow the predicted regional heating degree-days (HDD) of −11.76% and cooling degree-days (CDD) of 14.04% for the same period based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) an implemented deep learning (DL) model. In addition, the produced EC maps on different territorial scales show that the highest EC is seen in large and main cities in general.}

Our analysis highlights that: (1) methods based on image classification can be effectively leveraged when the position of parking stalls is known in advance, (2) methods based on image segmentation should be preferred over methods based on object detection when the geometry of the scene is not known, (3) temporal smoothing can be effectively used to improve predictions over time.}

abstract = {The growing number of IoT devices and the different computing and communication capabilities of IoT devices require an efficient offloading scheme. This offloading scheme need to consider the mobility of IoT devices and helps to intelligently select the optimal server for offloading. An efficient offloading scheme need to take in consideration important factors such as mobility of the IoT user device, speed and direction of the IoT user device as well as the computational capabilities of the user mobile device and the load of nearby servers. Unbalanced load of data or task offloading lead to high latency and poor services. An optimal selection of offloading server will clearly improve latency and QoS. Some new architecture of cellular network suggest the deployment of small-cell base stations (SBS) [1], [2] with a certain computing capabilities which can help offloading task of IoT mobile device or of their nearby SBS. In smart city environment, the mobile IoT device user needs to choose an SBS from several available SBSs within the its communication proximity. In this paper, we propose a Smart Ranking based Task Offloading approach for selecting an SBS and to improve the Quality of Service. This approach uses Q-Learning for SBS selection which will be modelled in Software Defined Network controller to deal with the problem of choosing the SBS in an intelligent way for Task offloading.}

Intrusion detection(ID) is a practical issue in the field of computer security whose primary objective is to detect rare attack or assaults and to ensure the security of interior systems. This paper also proposes a semi-class intrusion detection method that combines multiple classifiers to arrange exceptions and typical exercises in a computer system. The abuse detection model is constructed in the light of the decision tree learning-iterative dichotomise 3(DTL-ID3) and is assembled by utilizing the gathered data based on anomaly detection model executed by one class-support vector machine(OC-SVM). In recent years, people have paid more attention to ID/intrusion prevention system (IDS / IPS), which is closely related to the protection and utilization of system management. A few machine-learning standards including neural system, direct hereditary programming, and advanced support vector machines(ASVMs), Bayesian system, multivariate versatile relapse splines, fluffy derivation systems(FIS) and other analogical systems have been researched for the outline of intrusion detection system. In this paper, we build up an amalgam method based on DTL-ID3 and OC-SVM(A-DT and SVM) and evaluate the performance of the projected methodology by using a specific dataset and a crossover method in order to enhance the accuracy of IDS/IPS when contrasted with a singular support vector machine.}

However, developing a robust application with high accuracy is still a challenging task mainly due to the inherent problems related to human emotions, lack of sufficient data, and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel, cost-effective, and energy-efficient framework designed for suspicious activity recognition based on facial expression analysis for smart security in law-enforcement services. The Raspberry Pi camera captures the video stream and detects faces using the Viola Jones algorithm. The face region is pre-processed using Gabor filter and median filter prior to feature extraction. Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) features are then extracted and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained, which predicts the known emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise). Based on the collective emotions of the faces, we predict the sentiment behind the scene. Using this approach, we predict if a certain situation is hostile and can prevent it prior to its occurrence. The system is tested on three publically available datasets: Cohen Kande (CK+), MMI, and JAFEE. A detailed comparative analysis based on SURF, SIFT, and ORB is also presented. Experimental results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system in accurate recognition of suspicious activity compared to state-of-the-art methods and validate its superiority for enhancing security in law enforcement services.}

Given a query vehicle image, the vehicle re-ID aims to search and retrieve the images of the same vehicle that have been captured by different surveillance cameras with various viewing angles. Based on the observation that essential vehicle attributes, like vehicle‘s color and types (e.g., sedan, bus, truck, and so on), could be used as important traits to recognize vehicle, an effective multi-label learning (MLL) method is proposed in this paper that can simultaneously learn three labels: vehicle’s ID, type, and color. With three labels, a multi-label smoothing regularization (MLSR) is further proposed, which can allocate a uniform label distribution to the multi-labeled training images to regularize MLL model and improve vehicle re-ID performance. Extensive experiments conducted on the VeRi and VehicleID datasets have demonstrated that the proposed MLL with MLSR approach can effectively improve the performance delivered by the baseline and outperform multiple state-of-the-art vehicle re-ID methods as well.}

In this paper (a substantial extension of the short version presented at REM2016 on April 19–21, Maldives [1]), we design a novel parallel strategy for time series learning, in which different parts of the time series are evaluated by different threads. The proposed strategy is inserted inside the core a hybrid metaheuristic model, applied for learning patterns from an important mini/microgrid forecasting problem, the household electricity demand forecasting. The future smart cities will surely rely on distributed energy generation, in which citizens should be aware about how to manage and control their own resources. In this sense, energy disaggregation research will be part of several typical and useful microgrid applications. Computational results show that the proposed GPU learning strategy is scalable as the number of training rounds increases, emerging as a promising deep learning tool to be embedded into smart sensors.}

The accessibility of high bandwidth Internet connection particularly with the arrival of robust 5G networks rises to innovative IoT solutions such as smart city, automobiles, industry 4.0, etc. IoT analytics represents edge computing as a term commonly employed for defining intelligent computational resources placed closer to the source of data generation. Despite the benefits of the IoT edge systems, security and energy efficiency remains major challenging issues. With this motivation, this paper presents an energy-efficient clustering based secure data transmission protocol (EEC-SDTP) for Intelligent IoT Edge systems. The goal of the EEC-SDTP technique is to select an appropriate set of cluster heads (CHs) and optimally secure routes for data transmission in the network. The proposed model involves oppositional chaos game optimization-based clustering (OCGOC) technique for proper CH selection and cluster construction. Besides, a trust-based model is designed to determine the trustworthiness of the node in the IoT edge systems. The proposed OCGOC technique derives a fitness function utilizing 3 input parameters like trust level, distance to neighbors, and energy. Finally, a trust-based secure routing protocol using the quantum sand piper optimization (SRP-QSPO) technique is employed to derive routes for secure data transmission. For examining the better efficiency of the proposed EEC-SDTP algorithm, an extensive group of experimentations were performed and the outcomes are investigated under several performance measures. The experimental outcomes highlighted the improved efficiency of the proposed method over the other related techniques.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of video image technology and fifth-generation mobile network technology, the automatic verification of mechanical water meters has become an increasingly important topic in smart cities. Although much research has been done on this subject, the efficiency and accuracy of existing water meter pointer reading technology can still be improved. This paper proposes a new water meter pointer reading recognition method based on target-key point detection. Our method consists of a target detection module and a key point detection module. The target detection module uses a modified YOLOv4-Tiny network to detect and classify the areas where the dials and pointers are located in water meter images with distinct characteristics. The key point detection module is used to detect the key point of the pointer image. In this module, the structure of the RFB-Net network is improved to introduce multiple layers of low-level feature information, therefore, it can make full use of the information between multi-scale feature layers for key point detection. In addition to, aiming at the problem of dial rotation, a method of establishing a right-angle coordinate system based on key point is proposed to realize pointer reading. The whole method proposed in this paper is compared to the Hough transform feature matching algorithm and traditional machine learning algorithms through experiments which test the detection and recognition of the water meter dial, pointer and key points. The experiment results show that the missed detection rate of the model in this paper is 1.88% and 1.07% for the dial region and the pointer region, respectively. And the accuracy rate reaches 98.68%, the average processing time per image is 0.37 s. This implies that the water meter inspection task is completed quickly and accurately with strong robustness. Thanks to the lightweight algorithm of our approach, the model can also be fully automated and easily deployed on mobile devices.}

In this paper, a novel urban sound event classification model based on 2-order dense convolutional network using dual features is proposed, which aims at the problems of insufficient classification accuracy and adaptability of current models. Firstly, the brief introduction of urban sound classification development and application is presented in Section 1. Then, the method of feature extraction and add noise environment is respectively introduced in Section 2. Moreover, a new network structure referred to as 2-order dense convolutional network (shorten as 2-DenseNet) and its algorithm are presented in Section 3. Meanwhile, an urban sound event classification model based on 2-DenseNet using dual features, i.e. D-2-DenseNet is proposed in this paper. Theoretically, D-2-DenseNet not only can accelerate the convergence speed when compared with DenseNet, but also can enhance the classification accuracy and guarantee a good generalization ability owing to the fact that dual features fusion is exploited in the proposed model. Finally, in order to validate advantages of the D-2-DenseNet, this new model is respectively exploited in the urban sound event classification based on UrbanSound8K and Dcase2016 datasets. The experimental result shows that the accuracy of the network is respectively 84.83% and 85.17%, which has increase up to 13.81% and 7.07% compared with baseline. Compared with single feature network, the classification accuracy of D-2-DenseNet has increased by 3.35% and 4.78% respectively in noise environment.}

The application of artificial intelligence and data technology has become one of the important meaning to improve the management level of steel plant and to improve the city environment. As a modern management tool, energy management system provides a new way of intelligent management for iron and steel companies. The energy management system can be used to monitor the energy consumption in real time, master the energy consumption of the company and allocate the energy consumption of the company. So we can get better production plan, reduce the energy consumption of the company, and improve the competitiveness of the company. Two functions, energy allocation and energy consumption prediction, are developed in the energy management system. According to the formula of iron balance and the relationship between iron and energy consumption in each production unit, the mathematical model of energy allocation is established and applied in the energy management system. Another one of the functions of the energy management system is to predict the energy consumption of steel companies with maximum prediction error is about 5%, which provides the basis for the auxiliary decision-making of energy management. The forecasted results can be used to better understand the trend of energy consumption of the whole company, so as to do a good decision of energy reserve and reduce unnecessary waste.}

abstract = {With the sustained and rapid development of the social economy and the rapid growth of urban vehicles, urban expressway has developed rapidly. As the roadmap of urban traffic, the urban expressway has a relatively high and stable driving speed, and also bears a large amount of urban traffic. However, in recent years, with the expansion of the city scale, the congestion of urban expressways has become increasingly severe. In various areas of the merged area, due to various factors such as mismatched traffic capacity and reduced driving speed, it is easy to cause deterioration of road conditions in a short period of time and cause more secondary accidents. In order to reduce the incidence of expressway traffic accidents and to avoid as much as possible the casualties and property losses caused by accidents, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) supported by information technology, data communication transmission technology, control technology and traffic engineering were introduced. With the rise of artificial intelligence and the continuous development of ITS, the video acquisition methods of real-time traffic flow data and the image recognition ability of video sequences continue to improve, providing theoretical basis and technical support for the research of urban expressway parallel pattern recognition. Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional pattern recognition methods, such as weak anti-interference to complex traffic environment and low correct recognition rate, this paper studies the pattern recognition method based on image processing, and selects the fuzzy C-means clustering in the currently used clustering methods (FCM) algorithm Because the FCM algorithm cannot obtain the global optimal solution and need to determine the number of cluster categories in advance, this paper uses ReliefF algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to compare the feature weight and number of clusters of traditional FCM algorithm. Make improvements. Through the experimental analysis of the acquired video images, the results show that the improved FCM algorithm based on the proposed method has better real-time and accuracy in the application of urban expressway parallel pattern recognition.}

abstract = {Obtaining accurate speed and travel time information is a challenge for researchers, geographers, and transportation agencies. In the past, traffic data were usually acquired and disseminated by government agencies through fixed-location sensors. High costs, infrastructure demands, and low coverage levels of these sensor devices require agencies and researchers to look beyond the traditional approaches. With the emergence of smartphones and navigation apps, location-based and crowdsourced Big Data are receiving increased attention. In this regard, location-based big data (LocBigData) collected from probe vehicles and road users can be used to provide speed and travel time information in different locations. Examining the quality of crowdsourced data is essential for researchers and agencies before using them. This study assessed the quality of Waze speed data from surface streets and conducted a case study in Sevierville, Tennessee. Typically, examining the quality of these data in surface streets and arterials is more challenging than freeways data. This research used Bluetooth speed data as the ground truth, which is independent of Waze data. In this study, three steps of methodology were used. In the first step, Waze speed data was compared to Bluetooth data in terms of accuracy, mean difference, and distribution similarity. In the second step, a k-means algorithm was used to categorize Waze data quality, and a multinomial logistics regression model was performed to explore the significant factors that impact data quality. Finally, in the third step, machine learning techniques were conducted to predict the data quality in different conditions. The result of the comparison showed a similar pattern and a slight difference between datasets, which verified the quality of Waze speed data. The statistical model indicates that that Waze speed data are more accurate in peak hours than in night hours. Also, the traffic speed, traffic volume, and segment length have a significant association on the accuracy of Waze data on surface streets. Finally, the result of machine learning prediction showed that a KNN method performed the highest prediction accuracy of 84.5% and 82.9% of the time for training and test datasets, respectively. Overall, the study results suggest that Waze speed data is a promising data source for surface streets.}

Vehicle detection and recognition, which is one of the most important aspects of intelligent transportation, plays a very important role in various areas of our daily life; one such important area is criminal investigation. In the fine-grained vehicle type detection and recognition, several difficult issues such as problems in data acquisition and tagging, dramatic variance in the data of different vehicle types, and challenges in identifying vehicles of the same brand with highly similar appearances remain unsolved. For the problems of data acquisition and tagging, this paper presents a strategy for automatic data acquisition and tagging based on object detection that can label the vehicle images efficiently while rapidly acquiring all types of fine-grained models. Considering the problem of data imbalance in the training process, this paper proposes a Faster-RCNN based data equalizing strategy (Faster-BRCNN), thereby improving the performance of object detection. In view of the severe information attenuation caused by the feature information transfer obstruct between layers in the traditional deep learning network, the lack of mutual dependency of these features, and the inability of the network to focus on the important region and characteristics, we propose an intensive dense attention network (DA-Net). Through its intensive connection and attention unit, we enhance the model's detection ability. The proposed method achieves mAP of 94.5% and 95.8% in the Stanford Cars and FZU Cars datasets, respectively, thereby verifying its effectiveness.}

abstract = {This paper evaluates the accuracy of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and empirical solar radiation models with different combination of input parameters. The parameters include month, latitude, longitude, bright sunshine hours, day length, relative humidity, maximum and minimum temperature. The models are evaluated based on statistical measures. Four new empirical models are introduced and validated with experimental data. This work is focused on the prediction of monthly mean daily global solar radiation (GSR) for different cities in India with most influencing input parameters identified using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software. WEKA identifies month, latitude, maximum temperature and bright sunshine hours as the most influencing and relative humidity as the least influencing input parameter. SVM model with most influencing input parameter performs better than ANN and Empirical models. Exclusion of relative humidity does not affect the prediction accuracy. Therefore this work reduces the dimensionality of the data and improves the prediction accuracy. This work also attempts in assessing the solar energy potential of smart cities of Tamil Nadu, India using the SVM model. The predicted annual GSR varies from 17 to 22 MJ/m2/day which is precise enough for a wide range of solar applications.}

abstract = {Video Synopsis is a smart and efficient solution to summarize a long duration of surveillance video into short. Most of the video synopsis techniques are not suitable to address complex situations like changes in illumination, dynamic background, camera jitter, etc. These techniques firmly depend on the preprocessing results of foreground extraction and multiple objects tracking. Further, the optimization process is a vital phase for the decrement of collision rate among moving objects, where the widely used Simulated Annealing (SA) usually suffers from the issue of slow convergence rate with a high computational overhead. Taking these aforementioned facts into account for feature extraction, we formulate a foreground extraction scheme exploring the concept of multi-frame and multi-scale in Generative Adversarial Network (mFS-GANs). Further, an optimization algorithm is proposed through the hybridization of SA and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), named as, HGWOSA to ensure global optimal result with a low computing overhead. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through extensive simulations and compared with that of the benchmark schemes. The experiments are carried out using some standard surveillance video dataset (ChangeDetection.Net, MIT Surveillance Dataset, and UMN Dataset) and one self-generated surveillance video at IIIT Bhubaneswar. Overall analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the other competing schemes in terms of both the quantitative and qualitative measures. Finally, the proposed model can be substantially employed in the generation of off-line video synopsis, which is potentially applicable to video surveillance applications for smart cities.}

abstract = {In the face of continued global urbanization, cities are challenged to satisfy increasing standards in terms of quality of life, environmental conditions, safety, security, health, economic growth and mobility. The concept of “smart cities” aims at utilising advanced technologies, artificial intelligence and high computational capacity to increase their resilience and improve the services provided to the citizens. Computation-based numerical simulations have been essentially used to estimate the effects of explosion events in urban environments in terms of both structural damage and human casualties. These provide urban planners and decision makers with valuable information for vulnerability assessment and aid developing prevention or mitigation solutions. In this article, we present a framework to generate a 3D large-scale urbanistic finite element model, where the desired geospatial data are extracted from the open-source world map OpenStreetMap. The model is used to simulate blast wave propagation effects in a wide urban area taking into account the reflections at building surfaces via a sophisticated Fluid-Structure interaction technique integrated in the EUROPLEXUS explicit finite element method software. The explosion in the Port of Beirut in Lebanon, which took place on the 4th of August 2020, was remarkable for the large amount of explosive material causing considerable damage to surrounding structures and a high number of deaths and injured. Such characteristics make the event suitable for assessing the performance of the proposed computational approach in a widely exposed (by the blast wave) urban zone.}

abstract = {With the development of information technology and the popularization of monitoring network, how to quickly and automatically detect abnormal behaviors in surveillance video is becoming more and more important for public security and smart city. The emergence of deep learning has greatly promoted the development of anomaly detection and much remarkable work has been presented on this topic. However, the existing approaches for anomaly detection generally encounter problems such as insufficient utilization of motion patterns and instability on different datasets. To improve the performance of anomaly detection in surveillance video, we propose a framework based on bidirectional prediction, which predicts the same target frame by the forward and the backward prediction subnetworks, respectively. Then the loss function is constructed based on the real target frame and its bidirectional prediction frame. Furthermore, we also propose an anomaly score estimation method based on the sliding window scheme which focuses on the foregrounds of the prediction error map. The comparison with the state-of-the-art shows that the proposed model outperforms most competing models on different video surveillance datasets.}

abstract = {Road furniture recognition has become a prevalent issue in the past few years because of its great importance in smart cities and autonomous driving. Previous research has especially focussed on pole-like road furniture, such as traffic signs and lamp posts. Published methods have mainly classified road furniture as individual objects. However, most road furniture consists of a combination of classes, such as a traffic sign mounted on a street light pole. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework to interpret road furniture at a more detailed level. Instead of being interpreted as single objects, mobile laser scanning data of road furniture is decomposed in elements individually labelled as poles, and objects attached to them, such as, street lights, traffic signs and traffic lights. In our framework, we first detect road furniture from unorganised mobile laser scanning point clouds. Then detected road furniture is decomposed into poles and attachments (e.g. traffic signs). In the interpretation stage, we extract a set of features to classify the attachments by utilising a knowledge-driven method and four representative types of machine learning classifiers, which are random forest, support vector machine, Gaussian mixture model and naïve Bayes, to explore the optimal method. The designed features are the unary features of attachments and the spatial relations between poles and their attachments. Two experimental test sites in Enschede dataset and Saunalahti dataset were applied, and Saunalahti dataset was collected in two different epochs. In the experimental results, the random forest classifier outperforms the other methods, and the overall accuracy acquired is higher than 80% in Enschede test site and higher than 90% in both Saunalahti epochs. The designed features play an important role in the interpretation of road furniture. The results of two epochs in the same area prove the high reliability of our framework and demonstrate that our method achieves good transferability with an accuracy over 90% through employing the training data of one epoch to test the data in another epoch.}

abstract = {Thanks to increasing urban development, it has become important for municipalities to understand how ecological processes function. In particular, urban wetlands are vital habitats for the people and the animals living amongst them. This is because wetlands provide great services, including water filtration, flood and drought mitigation, and recreational spaces. As such, several recent urban development plans are currently needed to monitor these invaluable ecosystems using time- and cost-efficient approaches. Accordingly, this study is designed to provide an initial response to the need of wetland mapping in the City of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. Specifically, we produce the first high-resolution wetland map of the City of St. John's using advanced machine learning algorithms, very high-resolution satellite imagery, and airborne LiDAR. An object-based random forest algorithm is applied to features extracted from WorldView-4, GeoEye-1, and LiDAR data to characterize five wetland classes, namely bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and open water, within an urban area. An overall accuracy of 91.12% is obtained for discriminating different wetland types and wetland surface water flow connectivity is also produced using LiDAR data. The resulting wetland classification map and the water surface flow map can help elucidate a greater understanding of the way in which wetlands are connected to the city's landscape and ultimately aid to improve wetland-related conservation and management decisions within the City of St. John's.}
