abstract = {5G promises much faster Internet transmission rates at minimum latencies with indoor and outdoor coverage in Smart Cities. 5G could potentially replace traditional Wi-Fi for network connectivity and Bluetooth technology for geolocation with a seamless radio coverage and network backbone therefore accelerating new services such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Although Wi-Fi 6 is already in the market designed for IoT applications. New Smart City applications based on Big Data will depend on 5G as a mobile Internet service provider therefore eliminating the need to deploy additional private network infrastructure or mobile networks. The benefits due to the expanded network access and enhanced connectivity between devices also intrinsically increase cybersecurity risks. Cyber attackers will be provided with additional digital targets; in addition, wireless and mobile network including the access channel infrastructure will be shared between independent services. To address these cybersecurity issues, this article presents the Blockchain Random Neural Network for Cybersecurity applications in a holistic digital and physical cybersecurity user and channel authentication methods. The user identity is kept secret as the neural weights codify the user information, although in case of cybersecurity breach, the confidential identity can be mined and the attacker identified. The proposed method therefore enables a decentralized authentication method. The validation results prove that the addition of the Blockchain Random Neural Network provides a user access control algorithm with increased cybersecurity resilience and decentralized user access and connectivity.}

Besides WoT, an essential aspect of understanding dynamic urban systems is artificial intelligence (AI). Via AI, data produced by WoT-enabled sensory observations can be analyzed and transformed into meaningful information, which describes and predicts current and future situations in time and space. This paper examines the impact of WoT and AI in smart cities, considering a real-world problem, the one of predicting parking availability. Traffic cameras are used as WoT sensors, together with weather forecasting Web services. Machine learning (ML) is employed for AI analysis, using predictive models based on neural networks and random forests. The performance of the ML models for the prediction of parking occupancy is better than the state of the art work in the problem under study, scoring an MSE of 7.18 at a time horizon of 60 minutes.}

PVs are motivated to assist in deep learning model inference for the captured image data in such applications.

A central administrator appointed by the government manages and maintains the security of each node. Smart City relies upon millions of sensors that are heterogeneous and do not support standard security architecture. Different manufacturers have weak protection protocols for their products and do not update their firmware upon newly identified operating systems’ vulnerabilities. Adversaries using brute force methods exploit the lack of inbuilt security systems on IoT devices to grow their bot network. Smart cities require a standard framework combining soft computing and Deep Learning (DL) for device fleet management and complete control of sensor operating systems for absolute security. This paper presents a real-world application for IoT fleet management security using a lightweight container-based botnet detection (C-BotDet) framework. Using a three-phase approach, the framework using Artificial Intelligence detects compromised IoT devices sending malicious traffic on the network. Balena Cloud revokes API keys and prevents a compromised device from infecting other devices to form a more giant botnet. VPN (Virtual Private Network) prevents inter-device communication and routes all malicious traffic through an external server. The framework quickly updates the standard Linux-based operating system IoT device fleet without relying on different manufacturers to update their system security individually. The simulation and analysis of the C-BotDet framework are presented in a practical working environment to demonstrate its implementation feasibility.}

Many Ambient Assisted Living systems are coupled with Android Apps for command-and-control purposes. Consequently, the privacy and security of Ambient Assisted Living systems depend on the privacy and security of the corresponding Android Apps, which follow a privacy self-management model. Unfortunately, the privacy self-management model ignores the decision-making abilities of the elderly and increases their cognitive loads, which put their privacy protection and wellbeing at stake. In this paper, we follow a Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence inspired approach for addressing these issues. This approach uses privacy as a shared responsibility model instead of the privacy self-management model. We have proposed two algorithms, the participatory privacy protection algorithm-I, and participatory privacy protection algorithm-II, for determining optimal privacy settings of an Ambient Assisted Living App and handling its runtime Permission requests, respectively. We demonstrated the working of these algorithms using a case study. We have also compared the proposed approach with state-of-the-art privacy management schemes for Android Apps. The proposed algorithms can improve the privacy protection of Ambient Assisted Living App users in smart cities and relieve them through cognitive offloading.}

The research focuses on several most used language learning apps and the presence of artificial intelligence in them. The findings of the paper are as follows: basically none of the analysed apps uses any kind of machine learning, artificial intelligence or deep learning, and they are mostly based on predefined algorithms that do not utilize the full potential of the computational power we have currently available. The paper also suggests possible solutions and brings practical advice on how to implement artificial intelligence in these apps.

However, challenges such as security, privacy, trust, scalability, verifiability, and centralization prevent faster adaptations of IoT-driven smart cities. Thus, in this paper, a Trustworthy Privacy-Preserving Secured Framework (TP2SF) for smart cities is presented. This framework includes three modules namely: a trustworthiness module, a two-level privacy module, and an intrusion detection module. In trustworthiness module, address-based blockchain reputation system is designed. In the two-level privacy module, a blockchain based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is simultaneously applied with Principal Component analysis (PCA) to transform data into a new reduced shape for preventing inference and poisoning attacks. In the intrusion detection module, an optimized gradient tree boosting system (XGBoost) is deployed. Finally, due to inherited strengths and weaknesses of Fog–Cloud architecture, we present a blockchain-IPFS integrated Fog–Cloud infrastructure namely, CloudBlock and FogBlock to deploy proposed TP2SF framework in smart city. The TP2SF framework is evaluated using two realistic IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. The findings indicate the superiority of TP2SF framework over other state-of-the-art techniques in both nonblockchain and blockchain systems.}

Integrated NG-IoT network, AR can improve efficiency in many fields such as mobile computing, smart city, intelligent transportation and telemedicine. However, limited by capability of mobile device, the reliability and latency requirements of AR applications is difficult to meet by local processing. To solve this problem, we study a binary offloading scheme for AR edge computing. Based on the proposed model, the parts of AR computing can offload to edge network servers, which is extend the computing capability of mobile AR devices. Moreover, a deep reinforcement learning offloading model is considered to acquire B5G network resource allocation and optimally AR offloading decisions. First, this offloading model does not need to solve combinatorial optimization, which is greatly reduced the computational complexity. Then the wireless channel gains and binary offloading states is modeled as a Markov decision process, and solved by deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results show that our scheme can achieve better performance compared with existing optimization methods.}

Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can be considered key elements for today's Intelligent Transportation Systems. A small number of research investigations is found to aim at exploiting the resources of CAVs for services provisioning within a smart city. Moreover, and to the best of our knowledge, no research investigations have yet investigated exploiting the computational capabilities of CAVs to become an added value to the computational power of smart cities. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Vehicle as a Computational Resource (VaCR) and develop a system that enables vehicles to share their computational resources within smart cities. Users rely on Service Provider (SP) to acquire the required services that meet their Quality of Experience (QoE) preferences. The device capabilities of VaCR are one of the main indicators in QoE preferences. To that end, evaluation models are developed based on aggregate statistics and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the discovery and selection of the appropriate VaCRs to participate in the provisioning of services. The deployment is modeled using a multiagent system. Then, game theory is used to model the recruitment that aims at optimizing QoE for Connected Vehicles (CVs). Thorough simulations, analyses, and evaluations of the proposed VaCR system are carried out. The performed validations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in optimizing QoE and the successful VaCR system operation, while attaining appealing performance characteristics.}

abstract = {The trillion-fold increase in computing power brings the accessibility of deep learning to everyone. Deep learning offers precise information almost all the time when compared to other learning algorithms. On the other hand, the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) has increased in various areas such as Smart City, Oil Mining, and Transportation. Edge/Fog computing environment helps to handle significant challenges faced by the IoT, viz. latency, bandwidth consumption, and everlasting network connectivity. For analytics in Edge computing, which is distributed in nature, the trend is more towards distributed machine learning. This research work is focused on the integration of data flow and distributed deep learning in the IoT-Edge environment to bring down the latency and increase accuracy starting from the data generation phase. To this end, a novel Data Flow and Distributed Deep Neural Network (DF-DDNN) based IoT-Edge model for big data environment has been proposed. Our proposed method has resulted in latency reduction of up to 33% when compared to the existing traditional IoT-Cloud model.}

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level. To sum up, improving the smart city’s IoT-BDA system using the DL approach can reduce data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and offer actual efficacy, providing experimental references for the digital development of smart cities in the future.}

However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the limitations of existing smart city deployment; hence; the development of systems and architectures capable of providing fast and effective mechanisms to limit further spread of the virus has become paramount. An active surveillance system capable of monitoring and enforcing social distancing between people can effectively slow the spread of this deadly virus. In this paper, we propose a data-driven deep learning-based framework for the sustainable development of a smart city, offering a timely response to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through mass video surveillance. To implementing social distancing monitoring, we used three deep learning-based real-time object detection models for the detection of people in videos captured with a monocular camera. We validated the performance of our system using a real-world video surveillance dataset for effective deployment.}

The reason is that it is the foundation of modern traffic management and traffic control. Most of the existing advanced traffic speed prediction models are Spatial-Temporal hybrid models. They improve the predicting accuracy by leveraging Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract spatial and temporal features from the traffic speed data, respectively. However, these models have complex structures and high computational costs. To improve the accuracy of prediction and reduce the cost of model training, we propose a hybrid model, Spatial-Temporal Gated Graph Attention network (ST-GGAN), based on Graph Attention mechanism (GAT) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Such a method has a simpler structure, lower computational costs, and higher predicting accuracy. The experimental results show that our model's performance is better than the existing advanced models on a real-world dataset.}

More sustainable Bike-sharing systems (BSS) have become an indispensable part of the transport offer by world's major metropolis. Like any computerized service system, they generate voluminous and complex data that the use of which is essentially limited to the management and operation of the system. The movements made by system users can provide valuable information on many aspects of urban life including the spatial and temporal dynamics of travel in the city, on the place of the bicycle among other modes of transport, or on the distribution of territorial and social inequalities in geographical space. In this paper, we study the problem of intelligent management of shared bicycle systems. Indeed, the management of these systems faces many optimization problems in its procession. Thus, to improve the BSS user's satisfaction, it's useful to inform the actors/users in this system about the state of bike sharing for a station. For this, we propose an approach that integrates in these systems both the new IoT for smart city technologies and machine learning in order to facilitate the task of management, availability and profitability. In addition, we propose an automatic management system capable of predicting the number of bikes shared per hour, day or month by taking several dynamic parameters.

In this context, many demand-side management programs are being developed to achieve flexibility from different loads like space heating. As space heating models for flexibility simulations are an interdisciplinary field of work, complex civil engineering thermal models need to be combined with complex electrical engineering control simulations in different software frameworks. Traditionally used methods have shortcomings in one of those two domains as the publications that provide complex control strategies for demand response are lacking complex thermal models and vice versa. Co-simulations overcome this problem but are computationally expensive and have compatibility limitations. Thus, the aim of this work is to develop a methodology for designing space heating/cooling models, intended for positive energy district- or smart city simulations, which provide high accuracy at low computational expense. This could be achieved by synthesizing neural network object models from IDA-ICE civil engineering models in Matlab. These machine learning models showed improvements of more than 30% in different error metrics and a simulation time reduction of more than 80% compared to other methods, making them suitable for use in microgrid simulations, including flexibility analyses.}

The system comprises the collection of health-related data, data processing and analysis at edge nodes, and permanent storage and sharing at edge data centers. The edge nodes and edge controller schedule patients and provide resources in real time. Simulations were conducted to test system performance. The results for end-to-end time, computing, optimization, and transmission latency prove to be very promising. To determine system performance in a real-world scenario, a neural network was used to model transmission latency. The system is extremely useful for those who are disabled or elderly, as well as in pandemic situations.}

Digital Twin (DT) is an AI-based virtual replica of the real-world physical entity. DTs have been successfully adopted in manufacturing and industrial sectors, they are however still at the early stage in smart city based applications. The major reason for this lag is the lack of trust and privacy issues in sharing sensitive data. Federated Learning (FL) is a technology that could be integrated along with DT to ensure privacy preservation and trustworthiness. This paper focuses on the integration of these two promising technologies for adoption in real-time and life-critical scenarios, as well as for ease of governance in smart city based applications. We present an extensive survey on the various smart city based applications of FL models in DTs.

To allocate appropriate loads to utilize edge computing efficiently, we propose an edge computing solution for smart city environments that assigns some of the deep learning layers to edge nodes in order to support deep learning tasks on Internet of Things devices. The proposed deep learning layer assignment in edge computing algorithm determines the ideal number of deep learning layers to be assigned to each edge considering computing capacity and bandwidth of each edge separately. Simulation results of the proposed algorithm were compared with other existing methods such as Li's offline and online method, fixed assignment, and cloud-only method.

Computational offloading provides assisted means of processing large amounts of data generated by abundant IoT devices, speed up processing of intensive tasks and save battery life. In this paper, we propose a secure computation offloading scheme in Fog-Cloud-IoT environment (SecOFF-FCIoT). Using machine learning strategies, we accomplish efficient, secure offloading in Fog-IoT setting. In particular, we employ Neuro-Fuzzy Model to secure data at the smart gateway, then the IoT device selects an optimal Fog node to which it can offload its workload using Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) via the smart gateway. If the fog node is not capable of handling the workload, it is forwarded to the cloud after being classified as either sensitive or non-sensitive. Sensitive data is maintained in private cloud. Whereas non-sensitive data is offloaded using dynamic offloading strategy. In PSO, the availability of fog node is computed using two metrics; i) Available Processing Capacity (APC), and ii) Remaining Node Energy (RNE). Selection of cloud is based on Reinforcement Learning. Our proposed approach is implemented for smart city applications using NS-3 simulator with JAVA Programming. We compare our proposed secure computation offloading model with previous approaches which include DTO-SO, FCFS, LOTEC, and CMS-ACO. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme minimizes latency as compared to selected benchmarks.}

Smart cities rely on the integration of IoT and 5G technologies, and this has created a demand for a massive IoT network of connected devices. The data traffic coming from indoor wireless networks (e.g., smart homes, smart hospitals, smart factories , or smart school buildings) contributes to over 80% of the total data traffic of the current IoT network. As smart cities and their applications grow, security and privacy challenges have become a major concern for billions of IoT smart devices. One reason for this could be the oversight of handling security issues of IoT devices by their manufacturers, which enables attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities in these devices by performing different types of attacks, e.g., DDoS and injection attacks. Intrusion detection is one way to detect and mitigate the risk of such attacks. In this paper, an intrusion detection method was proposed to detect injection attacks in IoT applications (e.g. smart cities). In this method, two types of feature selection techniques (constant removal and recursive feature elimination) were used and tested by a number of machine learning classifiers (i.e., SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree). The T-Test was conducted to evaluate the quality of this proposed feature selection method. Using the public data set, AWID, the evaluation results showed that the decision tree classifier can be used to detect injection attacks with an accuracy of 99% using only 8 features, which were selected using the proposed feature selection method. Also, the comparison with the most related work showed the advantages of the proposed intrusion detection method.}

In smart cities, low-frequency oscillations are a serious concern to the power system as they adversely affect system’s stability. Moreover, power system stabilizers are inefficient due to their fixed-parameter architecture. Flexible ac transmission system controller performs effective damping of low-frequency oscillations when provided with suitable supplementary damping control like a Static synchronous series compensator. In this context, the paper proposes an adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control for smart cities that uses the recurrent Gaussian membership function and recurrent wavelet neural network in antecedent and consequent parts respectively. The paper applies the gradient descent optimization with a back-propagation algorithm to update the parameters of suggested adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control. Simulations are performed on two test systems, both showing the effectiveness of the recommended control scheme as compared to traditional lead-lag control and artificial neuro-fuzzy Takagi Sugeno Kang control. Calculations of performance index for various fault scenarios lead to the conclusion that the control scheme can damp oscillations effectively and enhances the power system’s transient stability.}

Efficiency improvements and advanced control strategies have a significant impact in the reduction of energy costs and CO2 emissions. Building energy simulation is widely used to help planners, contractors, and building owners analyse diverse options regarding the planning and management of energy consumption in buildings. Furthermore, recent advances in data processing and computing have led to the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can learn from large datasets, e.g., sensor data from buildings, and use them to develop building-specific adaptive and automatic energy controllers. Control algorithms, such as deep reinforcement learning can tune themselves, are model-free, and economical to implement. In this paper, we introduce an integrated simulation environment that combines CitySim, a fast building energy simulator, and TensorFlow, a platform for efficient implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is achieved via Keras—an API for TensorFlow—and a set of text and csv files for data transfer between the applications. This new environment will allow researchers to investigate novel learning control algorithms, and demonstrate their robustness and potential for diverse applications in the built environment.

This task is an essential but crucial loop in future smart cities construction, which can be widely applied in urban traffic management, disaster monitoring and mobility analysis. In recent years, video-like spatial–temporal modelling has been the most common approach in many deep learning models. However, the video-like modelling approach cannot consider some latent region-wise correlations other than geographic spatial distance information. To overcome the limitation, we propose a novel neural network framework, Adaptive Dual-View WaveNet (ADVW-Net), for the urban spatial–temporal event prediction. By integrating the spatial representations from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and that from adaptive Graph convolutional neural network (GCN), our proposed model can capture not only the geographic correlations but also some latent region-wise dependencies from the input data. In addition, the effective architecture, WaveNet, can be transferred to region-wise spatial–temporal prediction scenarios for long-range temporal dependencies learning. Experimental results on three urban datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model.}

At the same time, future smart cities need to support resilient environments against cyber-threats on their supported information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, the cybersecurity of future smart cities and their smart grids is of paramount importance, especially on how to detect cyber-attacks with growing uncertainties, such as frequent topological changes and RES of intermittent nature. Such raised uncertainties can cause a significant change in the underlying distribution of measurements and system states. In such an environment, historical measured data will not accurately exhibit the current network’s operating point. Hence, future power grids’ dynamic behaviors within smart cities are much more complicated than the conventional ones, leading to incorrect classification of the new instances by the current attack detectors. In this paper, to address this problem, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is carefully designed by embedding the dynamically time-evolving power system’s characteristics to accurately model the dynamic behaviors of modern power grids that are influenced by RES or system reconfiguration to distinguish natural smart grid changes and real-time attacks. The proposed framework’s performance is evaluated using the IEEE 14-bus system using real-world load data with multiple attack cases such as attacks to the network after a line outage and combination of RES. Results confirm that the developed LSTM-based attack detection model has a generalization ability to catch modern power grids’ dynamic behaviors, excelling current traditional approaches in the designed case studies and achieves accuracy higher than 90% in all experiments.}

However, it is difficult to understand and describe smart cities from different perspectives, given the widespread application of the concept of smart city in diverse disciplines, such as urban planning, electronic engineering, and computer sciences. This work conducted a comprehensive smart city literature review based on text mining of 3,315 papers on smart cities published in journals indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index databases. These include “all papers” classified as research articles published from 1999 to April 2020. Our findings show the state of the art of research on smart cities, including (i) smart city literature statistics from 1999 to 2019, (ii) 23 research topics related to smart cities, and (iii) geographical variations in smart-city research. Based on these findings, we offer theoretical and practical implications of (1) missing fields of studies, (2) future research directions, and (3) the applicability of text-mining techniques to literature reviews. We believe that this work, which aims to establish a common ground for understanding smart cities from multiple disciplinary perspectives, will encourage further research and development regarding smart cities.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), owing to its ability to support sustainability in various fields, has recently been considered one of the most important components of the information and communications technology (ICT) for sustainable smart cities. To achieve the required quality of the IoT communication system, performance prediction is necessary; it is beneficial for fault avoidance through the dynamic and continuous adaptation of network behavior, which helps achieve sustainable improvement of IoT communication systems in smart cities. Herein, a deep-learning (DL) model to evaluate and predict the performance of an IoT communication system is proposed. In the proposed model, the number of dynamic neural networks is equal to the number of networks in the IoT system. Each neural network predicts the performance of a given IoT network. Subsequently, the performance of the entire IoT communication system can be predicted from the outputs of individual networks, which will be considered the inputs for another dynamic neural network. The proposed IoT DL model was tested using network simulator (ns-3) to construct a simulated IoT environment. The simulation results verify that the proposed DL model predicted and improved the performance of an entire simulated IoT system highly accurately.}

Work has hypothesize that the combination of Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, and High powered computers will make technology more human-centric, even, the idea that smart cities will be able to understand the thought process of a human being seems very much likely today. This paper is along this line of thought. In particular, we try to present a method to model the cognitive state of human interest. This is done to take one more step towards the realization of a smart cognitive city. An approach which is Subjective–Objective in nature is presented to model the computation of activity inspired by interest. Based on activity, human latent state values are indirectly deduced. Inspiration is drawn from Physics and interest is modeled upon the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Concepts of Adaptive filtering are used to formulate an evolving transformation function that automatically and adaptively models the conversion of interest into activity. Particle filter is employed to provide an elucidation which is computationally feasible. To validate the viability of the method, experimentation is performed with real datasets.}

abstract = {Nowadays, deep neural networks are widely applied in sustainable smart cities and societies, including smart manufacturing, healthcare, industries, agriculture, surveillance, and various artificial intelligence-based real-life applications. In this regard, the human detection system has gained notable attention since it is recognized as a crucial task in intelligent surveillance applications. Researchers practiced a variety of computer vision and deep neural networks-based techniques for human detection-based applications; however, they often focused on the frontal view camera perspective. Thus, in this work, we have introduced a human detection system for intelligent surveillance in smart cities and societies with a completely distinct perspective, i.e., an overhead perspective that can provide sufficient visibility and coverage of a scene in congested and obstructed environments. However, human appearance can be difficult from such an extreme point of view, as there are significant variations in humans’ poses and appearances. Therefore, in this work, leveraging the deep neural network-based object detection technique, the Gaussian YOLOv3 algorithm is used for human detection. The algorithm determines the bounding box uncertainty by modeling its coordinates as a Gaussian parameter, improving accuracy and reducing false positives. A Gaussian YOLOv3 is combined with channel attention and feature intertwine modules to improve specific feature maps. The channel attention module is combined with the feature map to learn each channel's weight autonomously, improve the key features, and enhance the network's ability to discriminate between humans and background. At the same time, different channels of the feature map are intertwined to obtain more representative features. Finally, the features obtained from the attention and feature intertwine modules are fused to form an improved feature map. In addition, to further increase the detection accuracy of the algorithm for human detection, transfer learning is adopted. The experimental outcomes reveal that training improves the Gaussian YOLOv3 algorithm's potential for human detection with an overall detection accuracy of 94%.}

This has led to the concept of Smart cities where Information Communication and Technology (ICT) is merged with the existing traditional infrastructure of a city which is then coordinated and managed using digital technology. This idea of smart cities is slowly but surely coming into reality as many countries around the globe are adopting this idea and coming up with their own model of smart cities. At the core of smart city lies the sensors and actuators embedded in the smart devices that sense the environment for facilitating effective decision making. The microcontrollers available in these devices are programmed to take decisions automatically based on the information received from the sensors. This involves integration of several information and communication technologies like artificial intelligence, protocols, Internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor network (WSN) etc. This paper discusses and extensively reviews the role of enabling technologies in smart cities. The paper further highlights the challenges and limitations in the development of smart cities along with the mitigation strategies. Specifically, three categories of challenges are identified namely technical, socio-economic and environmental giving specifics of each category. Finally, some of the best practices for attaining sustainable smart cities are provided.}

There are several types of forgery in digital media transmission, especially digital image transmission. A common type of forgery is copy-move forgery (CMF). The CMF may be encountered in streets, railway stations, underground stations, or festivals. This type of forgery may lead to hugger-mugger in some cases. Therefore, there is a need to find a sufficient countermeasure mechanism to detect image forgeries. This paper presents a new CMFD approach that depends on deep learning for IoT based smart cities. Two well-known deep learning models, namely CNN and ConvLSTM, are adopted for CMFD. The proposed models are tested on MICC-220, MICC-600 and MICC 2000 datasets for validation. Several tests are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models. The simulation results reveal that the testing accuracy reaches 95%, 73%, and 94% for MICC-F220, MICC-F600 and MICC-F2000 datasets.

Secondly, algorithms exploring convolution deep neural networks, which learn different features of historical data to determine the collective abnormal human behaviors. Experiments on an actual human behaviors database have been carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithms. The results show that the deep learning solution outperforms both data mining as well as the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime and accuracy performance. In particular, for large datasets, the accuracy of the deep learning solution reaches 88%, however other solutions do not exceed 81%.

This study aims to evaluate the electrical energy consumption in Mashhad, Iran, based on machine learning tools and present the dynamic strategies for promoting citizens’ willingness for renewable energy generation based on the experts’ knowledge. The main novelty of this research is simultaneous application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and statistical analysis for creating a Decision Support System (DSS). Then, the solar energy potential is appraised by the PV system simulation tool during one year in our case study in Mashhad, Iran. Furthermore, a Classical Delphi (CD) method is applied for motivational strategies and further TP implementation. In particular, the motivational strategies are suggested by 45 experts and then are prioritized in sequential expert meetings. The outcomes of this research indicate that the ANN model can successfully forecast the electrical energy consumption in summer and winter periods with a 99% accuracy. Then, based on the solar energy computations in the PV system, the peak of electrical energy consumption can be controlled in the hottest and coldest months. Last but not least, the superposition of experts’ and citizens’ opinions reveal A4 (sharing benefits of optimized costs with the citizens by solar energy generation), B2 (reducing the electrical energy cost for solar energy generation, especially in peak times) and C1 (creating the energy coin in the city with credits instead of spending money in urban activities fits to solar energy generation) as the main motivational strategies for solar energy generation in short, middle and long-term planning horizons.}

The applicability of our work is in smart parking systems, which can benefit from this classification in three ways: i) tagging parking spots in the city without the need of sensor infrastructure; ii) ease parking exchange when a public parking spot gets available; iii) predict when a user is approaching a public or a private spot based on his last parking in the same area.}

abstract = {While there has been a significant interest in understanding the cyber threat landscape of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and the design of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security approaches, there is a lack of distributed architecture led to generating heterogeneous datasets that contain the actual behaviors of real-world IoT networks and complex cyber threat scenarios to evaluate the credibility of the new systems. This paper presents a novel testbed architecture of IoT network which can be used to evaluate Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security applications. The platform NSX vCloud NFV was employed to facilitate the execution of Software-Defined Network (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Service Orchestration (SO) to offer dynamic testbed networks, which allow the interaction of edge, fog and cloud tiers. While deploying the architecture, real-world normal and attack scenarios are executed to collect labeled datasets. The generated datasets are named ‘TON_IoT’, as they comprise heterogeneous data sources collected from telemetry datasets of IoT services, Windows and Linux-based datasets, and datasets of network traffic. The TON_IoT network dataset is validated using four machine learning-based intrusion detection algorithms of Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Deep Neural Networks, revealing a high performance of detection accuracy using the set of training and testing. A comparative summary of the TON_IoT network dataset and other competing network datasets demonstrates its diverse legitimate and anomalous patterns that can be used to better validate new AI-based security solutions. The architecture and datasets can be publicly accessed from TON_IOT Datasets (2020).}

abstract = {In smart cities, region-based prediction (e.g. traffic flow and electricity flow) is of great importance to city management and public safety, and it remains a daunting challenge that involves complicated spatial-temporal-related factors such as weather, holidays, events, etc. Region-based forecasting aims to predict the future situation for regions in a city based on historical data. In the existing literature, the state-of-the-art method solve region-based problems with long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms that extract the temporal view and local convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms that extract the spatial view (local spatial correlation via local CNN). In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method for region-based prediction for smart cities. First, we divide the cities into regions based on the space dimension and model the situation of the cities in 3D volumes. Based on the constructed 3D volumes, we design a model called multiple local 3D CNN spatial-temporal residual networks (LMST3D-ResNet) for region-based prediction in smart cities. LMST3D-ResNet can extract multiple temporal dependencies (including trend, period and closeness) for local regions and then predict the future citywide activities according to the learned multiple spatial-temporal features. LMST3D-ResNet can also combine the spatial-temporal features with external factors. LMST3D-ResNet includes 3D CNNs and ResNet mechanisms for processing spatial-temporal information. In particular, 3D CNNs have the ability to model 3-dimensional information due to 3D convolution and 3D pooling operations, while ResNet enables the connection of the convolutional neural network across layers to obtain a deeper network structure. Specifically, in our proposed model, a novel region-based information extraction mechanism and an end-to-end multiple spatial-temporal dependency learning structure are designed for local regions. Extensive experimental results on two datasets, i.e., MLElectricity and BJTaxi demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the exisiting state-of-the-art methods.}

However, recent developments of machine learning within Big Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method, and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for developing such a platform that could be used by public administration to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings as part of smart cities. Such digital transformation of energy management can increase energy efficiency of public administration, its higher quality of service and healthier environment.}

It is crucial for smart cities to monitor energy efficiency to be sustainable. In this study, we search to expose the possibilities offered by the energy data of Songdo, a South Korean smart city. First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem. To obtain this result, first we design a baseline regressors for the prediction, second, we apply a three-combination of each best model of the base regressors, and finally, a weighted meta-regression model was applied using meta-XGBoost. We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting. This study also shows that the weighted meta model outperforms several machine learning models in terms of R2, MAE and RSME.}

To solve the inefficiency problem of feature engineering, we propose TC-Droid, an automatic framework for Android malware detection based on text classification method. The core idea of TC-Droid is derived from the field of text classification. TC-Droid feeds on the text sequence of APPs analysis reports generated by AndroPyTool, applies a convolutional neural network (CNN) to explore significant information (or knowledge) under original report text, instead of manual feature engineering. In an evaluation with different number of real-world samples, TC-Droid outperforms state-of-the-art model (Drebin) and several classic models (NB, LR, KNN, RF) as well.

Smart cities efficiently manage assets, services, and resources with better IoT technologies and new smart devices. However, their deployment elevates the potential security threats making IoT smart city projects vulnerable to disparate attacks. Hence, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) must be developed for IoT-enabled smart cities to alleviate IoT-associated security attacks. Achieving high-level detection accuracy and lower training time are significant challenges in IDS. However, the existing traditional IDS are inefficient in handling them. This paper proposes a hybrid optimization and deep-learning-centric IDS to face these challenges in IoT-enabled smart cities. The dataset initially undergoes pre-processing to acquire an effective and accurate IDS. Then, feature selection and clustering are performed utilizing the Hybrid Chicken Swarm Genetic Algorithm (HCSGA) and MinK-means Algorithm.

Precise energy consumption prediction (ECP) and integrated local energy systems (ILES) are critical to boost clean energy management systems between consumers and suppliers. Various obstacles such as environmental factors and occupant behavior affects the performance of existing approaches for long- and short-term ECP. Thus, to address such concerns, we present a novel hybrid network model ‘DB-Net’ by incorporating a dilated convolutional neural network (DCNN) with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). The proposed approach allows efficient control of power energy in ILES between consumer and supplier when employed for long- and short-term ECP. The first phase combines data acquisition and refinement procedures into a preprocessing module in which the main goal is to optimize the collected data and to handle outliers. In the next phase, the refined data is passed into DCNN layers for feature encoding followed by BiLSTM layers to learn hidden sequential patterns and decode the feature maps. In the final phase, the DB-Net model forecasts multi-step power consumption (PC), including hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly output. The proposed approach attains better predictive performance than existing methods, thereby confirming its effectiveness.}

Due to the reliance of various components of smart cities on information and communication technology, cyber-security challenges (such as information leakage and malicious cyber-attacks) in this field affect smart cities behavior. Therefore, in order to respond to the enthusiastic acceptance of global smart city technologies, cyber security must develop in same direction.

abstract = {This work is developed to discuss the feasibility and efficiency of adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) Deep Learning in smart city scenarios. A traffic flow prediction model is constructed based on the Deep Belief Network (DBN) algorithm. The target road section and its historical traffic flow data in Tianjin are collected and pre-processed. Then, several Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) are stacked together to form a DBN, which is trained as a generative model. Finally, its performance is analyzed by the simulation experiment. The algorithm model proposed is compared with Neuro Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) model, Deep Learning Architecture (DLA), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the algorithm model proposed are 4.42%, 6.21%, and 8.03%, respectively. Its prediction accuracy is significantly higher than that of the other three algorithms. In addition, the algorithm can effectively suppress the spread of congestion in the smart city, achieving timely evacuation of traffic congestion. In short, the constructed Deep Learning-based traffic flow prediction model has a high-precision prediction effect and traffic congestion evacuation performance, which can provide experimental references for the later construction of smart cities.}

Accurate urban hotspots spatiotemporal prediction can improve urban planning, scheduling and, security capability, reduce resource consumption. Existing deep spatiotemporal prediction methods mainly utilize geographic grid based image, some given network structure or some additional data to capture spatiotemporal dynamic. However, we observed that mining some latent self-semantics from raw data and fusing them with geospatial based grid images can also improve the performance of spatiotemporal predictions. In this paper, we propose Geographic-Semantic Ensemble Neural Network (GSEN), a novel deep learning approach to stack geographical prediction neural network and semantical prediction neutral network. GSEN model integrates the structures of Predictive Recurrent Neural Network (PredRNN), Graph Convolutional Predictive Recurrent Neural Network (GC-PredRNN), and Ensemble Layer to capture spatiotemporal dynamics from different views. And this model can also be correlated with some latent high-level dynamics in the real-world without any external data. We evaluate our proposed model on three different domains real-world datasets and the experimental studies demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of GSEN in different urban hotspots spatiotemporal prediction tasks.}

How to effectively leverage these data for anomaly detection has become an increasingly popular research field as it is a fundamental aspect of cyber security for smart city services. The existing methods often focus on either static data for anomaly detection or streaming data without considering the influence of poor detection accuracy caused by concept drift phenomenon. In this paper, we concentrate on the anomaly detection problem of smart city services and distinguish different anomalies of communication in an effective way, which is aimed to protect data privacy of users. Then we propose an innovative concept drift adaptive method to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection, which fully considers time influence to change the sample distribution along timeline. Furthermore, we present an AI based Improved Long Short-Term Memory (I-LSTM) neural network that adds time factor and employs a novel smooth activation function, which can enhance the performance of multi-classification for anomaly detection. Finally, our proposed methods are evaluated with a real communication dataset. Extensive experimental results indicate that I-LSTM achieves the highest values on all indicators.

Concretely, we propose a homomorphic outsourcing computing toolkit to protect the privacy of multiple users for predictive computation. It can meet the needs of large-scale users to securely outsource their data to cloud servers for storage, management and processing of their own data. This toolkit, using the Paillier encryption system and Lagrangian interpolation law, can implement most commonly basic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division etc. It can also implement secure comparison of user data in the encrypted domain.

Present research on IoT mainly focus on the processing of scalar sensor data events and barely considers the challenges posed by multimedia based events. In this paper, we systematically review the existing solutions available for the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) by analyzing sensing, networking, service, and application-level services provided by IoT. We present state-of-the-art event-based middleware methods and their suitability for multimedia event processing methods. We observe that existing IoT event-based middleware solutions focus on structured (scalar) events and possess only domain-specific characteristics for unstructured (multimedia) events. A case study for object detection is also presented to demonstrate the requirements associated with the processing of multimedia events within smart cities, even with common image recognition based applications. In order to validate the existing issues in the detection of objects, we also presented an evaluation of object detection models using existing datasets. At the end of each section, we shed light on trends, gaps, and possible solutions based on our analysis, experiments, and review of the existing research. Finally, we summarize the challenges and future research directions for the generalized multimedia event processing (by taking detection of each and every object as an example) based on applications using IoMT. Our experiments demonstrate that existing models are very slow to respond to any unseen class, and existing rich datasets do not have a sufficient number of classes to meet the requirements of real-time applications of smart cities. We show that although there is a significantly large technical literature on IoT, and research on IoMT is also quite actively growing, there have not been much research efforts directed towards the processing of multimedia events. As an example, although deep learning techniques have been shown to achieve impressive performance in applications like image recognition, the methods are deficient in detecting new (previously unseen) objects for multimedia based applications in smart cities. In light of these facts, it becomes imperative to conduct research on bringing together the abilities of event-based middleware for IoMT, and low response-time based online training and adaptation techniques.}
