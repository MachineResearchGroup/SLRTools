abstract = {Metropolitan areas around the world are experiencing a surge in air pollution levels due to different anthropogenic causes, making accurate air quality prediction a critical task for public health. Although many prediction systems have been researched and modelled, many of them have neglected the different effects that air pollution has on each individual citizen. Hence, we present a novel context prediction model that includes context-aware computing concepts to merge an accurate air pollution prediction algorithm (using Long Short-Term Memory Deep Neural Network) with information from both surrounding pollution sources (e.g., bushfire incidents, traffic volumes) and user’s health profile. This model is then integrated into a tool called My Air Quality Index (MyAQI), which is further implemented and evaluated in a real-life use case set up in Melbourne Urban Area (Victoria, Australia). Results obtained with MyAQI show both that (i) high precision levels are reached (90–96%) when forecasting air quality situations in four air quality monitoring stations, and (ii) the proposed model is highly adaptable to users’ individual health condition effects under the same airborne pollutant levels.}

abstract = {A Smart City can be defined as a high-tech city with several public and private services capable to strategically solve (or mitigate) problems normally generated by rapid urbanization. Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities’ evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation’s companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers’ companies.}

abstract = {Fault diagnosis techniques play an increasingly important role in the operation and maintenance of smart city systems. Artificial intelligence improves the efficiency of chiller system fault diagnosis, and greatly reduces the energy consumption of urban buildings. The existing intelligent fault diagnosis methods of chiller mostly rely on balanced training datasets; lacking fault samples makes these methods incompetent to extract reliable features to recognize abnormal machine conditions, resulting in the degraded performance. To overcome the deficiencies of reported studies, a new method, called end-to-end chiller fault diagnosis, is proposed using a fused attention mechanism and dynamic cross-entropy. Firstly, a one-dimensional convolution network (1D-CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) are combined to capture the spatial-temporal features from the original data directly. Afterwards, a fused attention mechanism is developed to further refine the extracted features to increase the contribution of crucial features and achieve high-quality diagnostic information mining. Finally, the dynamic cross-entropy (DCE) is designed for updating the imbalance factor in real-time, with more focus on the hard-classified types. The experimental analysis results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method in identifying chiller system faults with imbalanced datasets.}

Smart cities are composed of complex systems that usually process and analyse big data from the Cyber, Physical, and Social worlds. Traffic event detection is an important and complex task in smart transportation modelling and management. We address this problem using semi-supervised deep learning with data of different modalities, e.g., physical sensor observations and social media data. Unlike most existing studies focusing on data of single modality, the proposed method makes use of data of multiple modalities that appear to complement and reinforce each other. Meanwhile, as the amount of labelled data in big data applications is usually extremely limited, we extend the multi-modal Generative Adversarial Network model to a semi-supervised architecture to characterise traffic events. We evaluate the model with a large, real-world dataset consisting of traffic sensor observations and social media data collected from the San Francisco Bay Area over a period of four months. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in extracting and classifying traffic events.}

abstract = {One of the challenges of living in today's cities is parking availability. Searching for available parking spots can be a time-consuming task that simultaneously increases traffic congestion and greenhouse gas pollution by a significant 40%. A solution that would increase drivers' ability to locate an empty parking spot would represent an important step towards more sustainable parking as it would have a direct impact on reducing greenhouse gas pollution in urban areas. This paper proposes how data science can help by evaluating the prediction performance of four machine learning models. Analysed machine learning models are based on different machine learning methods (i.e., CatBoost and Random Forest) and use different real-world data sets (i.e., parking sensor data only or contextually enriched parking sensor data). The dummy (baseline) model is considered as well, but with a R2 score of 61.29% is outperformed by more advanced data science approaches. Prediction performance in the case of using parking sensor data only gives R2 score of 84.31% and 88.16% for Random Forest and CatBoost, respectively. The best prediction performance is achieved using CatBoost and contextually enriched data, resulting in the high-performing machine learning model with the R2 value of 88.83%, thus outperforming the Random Forest model by 1.7%. In fact, for both machine learning methods, the contextually enriched data approach gives better results for predicting parking spot availability. This suggests that parking data should be enriched with contextual data when designing and building sustainable parking solutions for smart cities of the future.}

Recently, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence techniques offer new opportunities for the revolution of industrial CPSs. Therefore, to achieve security in industrial CPS, AI based intrusion detection system (IDS) can be developed to detect anomalies and prevent their harmful effects. With this motivation, this paper presents a novel cognitive computing based IDS technique to achieve security in industrial CPS. The proposed model involves different stages of operations such as data acquisition, preprocessing, feature selection, classification, and parameter optimization. The proposed model involves preprocessing to discard the noise that exists in the data. Then, the presented model uses binary bacterial foraging optimization (BBFO) based feature selection technique to elect an optimal subset of features. Besides the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model is applied to identify the presence of intrusions in the industrial CPS environment. Finally, Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (NADAM) optimizer is applied for the hyperparameter optimization of the GRU model in such a way that the detection rate can be enhanced. In order to validate the performance of the BBFO-GRU model, a series of experiments were carried out using the data from industrial CPS and the resultant values highlighted the promising performance of the proposed model with an accuracy of 98.45%.}

While traditional contact tracing approaches are gradually being replaced by peer-to-peer smartphone-based systems, the new applications tend to ignore the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem that is steadily growing in smart city environments. This work presents a contact tracing framework that logs smart space users’ co-existence using IoT devices as reference anchors. The design is non-intrusive as it relies on passive wireless interactions between each user’s carried equipment (e.g., smartphone, wearable, proximity card) with an IoT device by utilizing received signal strength indicators (RSSI). The proposed framework can log the identities for the interacting pair, their estimated distance, and the overlapping time duration. Also, we propose a machine learning-based infection risk classification method to characterize each interaction that relies on RSSI-based attributes and contact details. Finally, the proposed contact tracing framework’s performance is evaluated through a real-world case study of actual wireless interactions between users and IoT devices through Bluetooth Low Energy advertising. The results demonstrate the system’s capability to accurately capture contact between mobile users and assess their infection risk provided adequate model training over time.}

abstract = {Increasing population density in cities, and the increasing demand for efficiency in resource usage call for architectures enabling smart cities, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In most such scenarios, the data generated by IoT sensors is not confidential, but its integrity is critical. Data integrity can be achieved by establishing certification mechanisms that provide cryptographic message authentication protocols; however, this requires relatively expensive components for storing and processing the encryption key on the sensor and consumes more power while processing and transmitting data, which leads to the renunciation of security issues in cost sensitive deployments. In this paper, we propose a security solution that provides data integrity without draining the batteries of IoT sensors. Our solution consists of, (i) differentiating legitimate sensors by taking advantage of their impurities formed during the manufacturing process of the transceiver components, and (ii) eliminating the complex components that carry out cryptography as well as the redundant packet header fields, thereby yielding power savings. The testbed implementation of the proposed solution yields power measurement results providing an estimate of 2.52 times improvement in battery life without compromising the integrity of communications in the system, in addition to offering an increase in spectral efficiency and a decrease in the overall IoT device cost.}

We use several off-the-shelf models of deep neural networks pre-trained for smart city applications, ready for online object recognition and edge computing. Our system works without any retraining, additional annotation, or human intervention. Specifically, we present heuristics for the automated creation of PGT (Pseudo-Ground Truth). Based on PGT, we can automatically decide which model is the best in the specific environment. We present an application of fully automated enhancing image capture camera outputs to smarter ones. We evaluate our system in a controlled experiment. Low-resolution cameras and large areas cause problems for our method. We present a proof-of-concept for improving our system even in these challenging situations. The benefit is a knowledge extraction in a simple and inexpensive way to expand the organizations’ databases with information from unstructured data from CCTV/IP cameras.}

It is known that thousands of zero-day attacks are continuously emerging because of the addition of various protocols mainly from Internet of Things (IoT). Most of these attacks are small variants of previously known cyber-attacks. This indicates that even advanced mechanisms such as traditional machine learning systems face difficulty of detecting these small mutants of attacks over time. On the other hand, the success of deep learning (DL) in various big data fields has drawn several interests in cybersecurity fields. The application of DL has been practical because of the improvement in CPU and neural network algorithms aspects. The use of DL for attack detection in the cyberspace could be a resilient mechanism to small mutations or novel attacks because of its high-level feature extraction capability. The self-taught and compression capabilities of deep learning architectures are key mechanisms for hidden pattern discovery from the training data so that attacks are discriminated from benign traffic. This research is aimed at adopting a new approach, deep learning, to cybersecurity to enable the detection of attacks in social internet of things. The performance of the deep model is compared against traditional machine learning approach, and distributed attack detection is evaluated against the centralized detection system. The experiments have shown that our distributed attack detection system is superior to centralized detection systems using deep learning model. It has also been demonstrated that the deep model is more effective in attack detection than its shallow counter parts.}

In this paper, we propose an autonomic machine learning platform which provides the decision factors to be made during the developing of machine learning applications. In the proposed autonomic machine learning platform, machine learning processes are automated based on the specification of autonomic levels. This autonomic machine learning platform can be used to derive a high-quality learning result by minimizing experts’ interventions and reducing the number of design selections that require expert knowledge and intuition.

In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) to bridge the gap between controllable building parameters and thermal comfort, by conducting an extensive study on the efficacy of different ML techniques for modeling comfort levels. We show that neural networks are especially effective, and achieve 98.7% accuracy on average. We also show these networks can lead to linear models where thermal comfort score scales linearly with the HVAC setpoint, and that the linear models can be used to quickly and accurately find the optimal setpoint for the desired comfort level.}

For example, how can calculations be conducted when there are extensibility and privacy problems in machine learning tasks? In view of the above challenges, a mobile edge server is taken as the focus, and the available resources around the mobile edge server are used for collaborative computing to further improve the computing performance of a mobile edge computing (MEC) system. The alternating direction multiplier method is used to solve the problem.

abstract = {One of the main challenges in urban development faced by large cities is related to traffic jam. Despite increasing efforts to maximize the vehicle flow in large cities, to provide greater accuracy to estimate the traffic jam and to maximize the flow of vehicles in the transport infrastructure, without increasing the overhead of information on the control-related network, still consist in issues to be investigated. Therefore, using artificial intelligence method, we propose a solution of inter-vehicle communication for estimating the congestion level to maximize the vehicle traffic flow in the transport system, called TRAFFIC. For this, we modeled an ensemble of classifiers to estimate the congestion level using TRAFFIC. Hence, the ensemble classification is used as an input to the proposed dissemination mechanism, through which information is propagated between the vehicles. By comparing TRAFFIC with other studies in the literature, our solution has advanced the state of the art with new contributions as follows: (i) increase in the success rate for estimating the traffic congestion level; (ii) reduction in travel time, fuel consumption and CO2 emission of the vehicle; and (iii) high coverage rate with higher propagation of the message, maintaining a low packet transmission rate.}

Several geospatial rules are detailed in order to distinguish several categories implying locational issues. Then, a general structure for geographic knowledge base systems is given together with some fundamental elements for an infrastructure in which human collective intelligence is a key-element.

Mitigating adversary device selection in this platform prevents irrelevant data exchange and eases information access and exchange. External and internal communication hindering factors needs to be addressed to sustain uninterrupted communication. To improve the precision in communication security, an observation-based security system is modeled in this manuscript. This security system observes the local and global behavioral change in IoT device communication. The local and global behavioral changes are defined using device attributes and behavior modeling. The device and service provider input observations are processed by a neural network-based learning scheme to identify errors in the resource access. The communicating users and IoT devices are secured by selecting reputed service providers and data sources to improve the distributed resource utilization in IoT based smart city. The performance of the proposed scheme balances between security and resource utilization requirements of the users by reducing response loss and non-reputed device selection.}

In the work, based on the collected historical data of Xixian City, Henan Province, China, using the Internet of Things system (IoT) in 2011-2018, a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) multi-step flood prediction model with attention mechanism is proposed. In our model, the attention mechanism is used to automatically adjust the matching degree between the input features and output. Besides, we use a bidirectional GRU model, which can process the input sequence from two directions of time series (chronologically and antichronologically), then merge their representations together. Compared with the prediction model using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), our method can generate better prediction result, as can be seen from the arrival time error and peak error of floods during multi-step predictions.}

Nonetheless, the applicability and effectiveness of these techniques cannot be guaranteed when dealing with discrete binary and incomplete/missing signals (i.e., not continuous in time). In this paper a novel data interpretation framework for SHM with noisy and incomplete signals, using a through-substrate self-powered sensing technology, is presented within the context of artificial intelligence (AI). AI methods, namely, machine learning and pattern recognition, were integrated within the data interpretation framework developed for use in a practical engineering problem: data-driven SHM of plate-like structures. Finite element simulations on an aircraft stabilizer wing and experimental vibration tests on a dynamically loaded plate were conducted to validate the proposed framework. Machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and artificial neural networks, were integrated within the developed learning framework for performance assessment of the monitored structures. Different levels of harvested energy were considered to evaluate the robustness of the SHM system with respect to such variations. Results demonstrate that the SHM methodology employing the proposed machine learning-based data interpretation framework is efficient and robust for damage detection with incomplete and sparse/missing binary signals, overcoming the notable issue of energy availability for smart damage identification platforms being used in structural/infrastructure and aerospace health monitoring. The present study aims to advance data mining and interpretation techniques in the SHM domain, promoting the practical application of machine learning and pattern recognition with incomplete and missing/sparse signals in smart cities and smart infrastructure monitoring.}

This work focuses on studying the data generated by parking systems in order to develop predictive models that generate forecasted information.

Deep learning algorithms are commonly used to reliably predict potential energy usage since they can overcome the issue of dependency on long-distance data in energy forecasting relative to the standard regression model. However, there are still two problems to be solved for energy forecasting, including the encoding of categorical characteristics and adaptive extraction of the most relevant characteristics for the use in predictions. To address the problems, we proposed a sequential forecasting model for medium- and long-term energy demand forecasting based on an embedding mechanism and a two-stage attention-based long-term memory neural network. An empirical study was conducted on three years of daily electricity consumption data from the residential buildings of the Pudong district of Shanghai to evaluate the model. The results show that the model can effectively extract the key features that are highly correlated with energy consumption dynamics by employing long-term dependencies in time series. In addition, the hybrid model outperforms others in terms of long-term forecasting capability. This paper also discusses future research directions and the possibilities for applying deep learning techniques in the energy sector.}

However, at the same time, various security threats arise due to insecure communication happening among various entities in an IoV-based smart city deployment. To address this issue, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled batch authentication scheme in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-envisioned IoV-based smart city deployment. The latest trends and revolutions in technologies incorporate AI/Machine Learning (ML) in blockchaining to produce a secure, efficient and intelligent blockchain based system. The data stored in the blocks in the blockchain are authentic and genuine, which makes the AI/ML algorithms to work at their exceptions in order produce correct predictions on the blockchain data. Through the signing phase of the proposed scheme, each vehicle in a dynamically formed cluster broadcasts a message to its own member and respective road-side unit (RSU). In the proposed scheme, two types of authentication take place: vehicle to vehicle (V2V) authentication allows a vehicle to authenticate its neighbor vehicles in its cluster, while batch authentication permits a group of cluster vehicles to be authenticated by their RSU. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles and RSU in their cluster. RSU then gathers securely data from its vehicles and form several transactions including the information of vehicles and its own given information to the cluster member vehicles. The transactions are formed later by the nearby fog server associated with RSU and then by the cloud server to form a complete block. The created blocks are mined by the cloud servers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud server network through the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authentic and genuine data of the blockchain are utilized for Big data analytics through AI/ML algorithms. It is shown that the proposed scheme is highly robust against various attacks through formal and informal security analysis, and also through formal security verification tool. A detailed comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme achieves superior security and functionality features, and offers comparable storage, communication and computational costs as compared to other existing competing schemes. Finally, the blockchain implementation has been carried out on the proposed scheme to show its effectiveness.}

In many cases, due to a wide range of financial or installation limitations, off-grid small scale micro power panels are favoured as modular systems to power lighting in gardens or to be integrated together to power small devices such as mobile phone chargers and distributed smart city facilities and services. Manufacturers and systems’ integrators have a wide range of options of micro-scale photo voltaic panels to choose from. This makes the selection of the right panel a challenging task and risky investment. To address this and to help manufacturers, this paper suggests and evaluates a novel approach based on integrating empirical lab-testing with short-term real data and neural networks to assess the performance of micro-scale photovoltaic panels and their suitability for a specific application in specific environment. The paper outlines the combination of lab testing power output under seasonal and hourly conditions during the year combined with environmental and operating conditions such as temperature, dust accumulation and tilt angle performance. Based on the lab results, a short in-situ experimental work is implemented and the performance over the year in the selected location in Kuwait is evaluated using deep learning neural networks. The findings of this approach are compared with simulation and long-term real data. The results show a maximum error of 23% of the neural network output when compared with the actual data, and a correlation values with previous work within 87.3% and 91.9% which indicate that the proposed approach could provide an experimental rapid and accurate assessment of the expected power output. Hence, supporting the rapid decision-making process for manufacturers and reducing investment risks.}

On the other hand, the work in this article considers specific needs and financial limitations of suburban or rural communities in the mobility sector. This article presents the work in the design, test and performance evaluation of a low-cost, machine learning based, solution for distributed monitoring of the use of public transit in small communities. The proposed solution utilizes a low-resolution infrared array, that provides non-personally identifiable information coupled with a low-power deep learning module. We also compare the machine-based solution to a traditional algorithmic approach. We believe the solution allows small communities, with limited resources, to collect near real-time data that can be employed for evidence-based decisions of coverage and frequency in public transit. The successful collection of this kind of mobility data is vital for small communities as this is needed to support grant applications that are increasingly commonly used to improve public transit or other mobility modes.}

Autonomous driving will play an import role in the future smart cities, reduce the time and economic cost of the whole society, and be helpful for the sustainability of the city and society. A significant task for autonomous driving is to detect surrounding objects accurately in real-time, including car, pedestrian, cyclist, etc. In this paper, we propose one end-to-end three dimensional (3D) object detection method based on voxelization, sparse convolution, and feature fusion. The proposed method exploits only point cloud as input, and it has two key components—small voxels and efficient feature fusion. Instead of utilizing extra networks to transform voxels, we directly average the points within each voxel as their feature representation. To enrich features for prediction, we have designed a two-step feature fusion method called fusion of fusion network that can combine information of multiple scales and 3D space. We have submitted to the official test server of the 3D detection benchmark—KITTI, and achieved state-of-the-art performance especially in the Cyclist class. Besides, detection speed of our method achieves 0.05 s/frame with a 2–4 fold runtime improvement against state-of-the-art methods due to its simple and compact architecture.}

abstract = {The paper deals with modeling the cost of energy consumed in public buildings by leveraging three machine learning methods: artificial neural networks, CART, and random forest regression trees. Energy consumption is one of the major issues in global and national policies, therefore scientific efforts in creating prediction models of energy consumption and cost are highly important. One of the largest energy consumers in every state is its public sector, consisting of educational, health, public administration, military, and other types of public buildings. Recent technologies based on sensor networks and Big data platforms enable collection of large amounts of data that could be used to analyze energy consumption and cost. A real data from Croatian public sector is used in this paper including a large number of constructional, energetic, occupational, climate and other attributes. The algorithms for data pre-processing and modeling by optimizing parameters are suggested. Three strategies were tested: (1) with all available variables, (2) with a filter-based variable selection, and (3) with a wrapper-based variable selection which integrates Boruta algorithm and random forest. Prediction models of energy cost are created using two approaches: (a) comparative usage of artificial neural networks and two types of regression trees, CART and random forest, and (b) integration of RF-Boruta variable selection and machine learning methods for prediction. A cross-validation procedure was used to optimize the artificial neural network and regression tree topology, as well to select the most appropriate activation function. Along with creating a prediction model, the aim of the paper was also to extract the relevant predictors of energy cost in public buildings which are important in planning the construction or renovation of buildings. The results have shown that the second approach which integrates machine learning with Boruta method, where the random forest algorithm is used for both variable reduction and prediction modeling, has produced a higher accuracy of prediction than the individual usage of three machine learning methods. Such findings confirm the potential of hybrid machine learning methods which are suggested in previous research, but in favor of random forest method over CART and artificial neural networks. Regarding the variable selection, the model has extracted heating and occupational data as the most important, followed by constructional, cooling, electricity, and lighting attributes. The model could be implemented in public buildings information systems and their IoT networks within the concept of smart buildings and smart cities.}

The tool presented here can coordinate different sub-systems in a district to avoid the violation of high-level system constraints and is designed in a generic fashion to enable transferable use across different energy sectors. The work demonstrates the potential for a single open-source optimisation framework to be applied across multiple energy vectors, providing local government the opportunity to manage different assets in a coordinated fashion. This is shown through case studies that integrate low-carbon communal heating for social housing with electric vehicle charge-point management to achieve high-level system constraints and local government objectives in the borough of Greenwich, London.

abstract = {Primary user (PU) signal detection or classification is a critical component of cognitive radio (CR) related wireless communication applications. In CR, the PU detection methods are mostly based on statistical models, and their detection performance heavily relies on the accuracy of assumed models. In this paper, we design a novel detector, dubbed as PU-Net, that dynamically learns the PU activity patterns in a cognitive 5G smart city, where a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is deployed as flying base stations to serve the Internet-of-Things (IoT) users. Unlike the traditional schemes, the PU-Net is free from signal-noise model assumptions and is leveraged through deep residual learning integrated with atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to sense the PU's transmitted signal patterns in the network. The PU-Net detects and classifies the active and idle PU states by exploiting the multilevel spatial-temporal features in the signal and noise frames. The proposed model is trained using locally synthesized Rayleigh channel-impaired data with large variability of modulated signals and different noise floor regimes. Additionally, the PU-Net model is blind-tested and evaluated on real-world over-the-air signals and with variable-length frames and varying channel effects at secondary users (SUs). With extensive experiments, it is shown that PU-Net outperforms other benchmark detectors, obtaining an accuracy of 0.9974, with 0.9978 recall and 0.9970 precision in detecting and classifying the PU transmitted signal patterns. Correspondingly, the proposed PU-Net can be adopted for IoT/UAV-assisted communication systems in optimizing spectrum efficiency and resolving the coexistence issues in 5G and beyond networks.}

Knowledge graphs help to provide semantic and interconnectivity capabilities to the intelligent transportation system. In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for detecting outliers in the trajectory. Normal and outlier graphs are constructed using directed weighted graphs. Then, comparison with source and target graphs leading to vectors is performed. The similarity measure is used, which measures common nodes and edges. The features are then used by the machine learning based algorithm to classify the trajectory. Instead of a manually tuned parameter, the tree-based pipeline optimization method selects the best classifier and its hyperparameter. Then, the tuned model is compared with the traditional algorithms, i.e., random forest, decision tree, Naïve Bayes, and KNN. To evaluate the system under real conditions, an experiment is performed on a real dataset of trajectories. The results show that the graph-based method performs well and achieves an F-value of 0.81, while the optimization model achieves an F-value of 0.87. The graph-based model matched with the learning method helps to detect outliers and deviation points of the trajectory with high precision.}

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the most widespread threats to smart city infrastructure. In this paper, a smart city intrusion detection framework based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) is proposed. RBMs are applied due to their ability to learn high-level features from raw data in an unsupervised way and handle real data representation generated from smart meters and sensors. On top of these extracted features, different classifiers are trained. The performance of the proposed methodology is tested and benchmarked using a dataset from a smart water distribution plant. The results show the efficiency of the proposed methodology in attack detection with high accuracy.

This research field is extremely important for all sorts of applications, from natural disasters preparation and criminal activity prevention to urban management and development of smart cities. However, even the leading models have an important disadvantage: they are based on prior knowledge about events being expected. So forecasting systems based on such models are heavily limited by a list of events that can be predicted and all events of other types will be out of systems’ scope. In this work, we try to address this issue and propose a deep learning model, which is able to predict an area of the future event in the urban environment. This model is able to predict the future state of the city - a level of users activity in the location-based social network Instagram - with the average deviation from the ground truth of 1%, and achieves 69% recall when solving the events prediction problem.}

There has been the unprecedented increase in annual installation of wind turbines reaching 60 GW for the first time in history from 51.7 GW of wind energy installation in 2014. Most of the high-power installations utilized double-fed induction generators (DFIG) due to low power losses, which reduced the cost of power converters required in the circuit. Nevertheless, natural factors, such as varying wind speed, influence the output of generators which results in the unsteady generation of power thus affecting the stability of the system. A neural network-based DFIG integrated with super capacitor energy storage system (SCESS) is proposed in this paper. Modeling and simulation have been carried out in MATLAB/Simulink and the observations indicate the significant improvement in the stability of the system.}

The framework is a bottom-up integration of highly scalable Raw Data Storages(RD-Stores) technology, hybrid indexing and queries technology, and machine learning technology for emergency disasters. Experimental results show that hybrid index and query technology have better performance under the condition of supporting multi-modal retrieval, and providing a better solution to offer real-time retrieval for the massive sensor sampling data in the IoT. In addition, further works to evaluate the top-level sub-application system in this framework were performed based on the GPS trajectory data of 35,000 Beijing taxis and the volumetric ground truth data of 7,500 images. The results show that the framework has desirable scalability and higher utility.}

In the current era of big data, the application of image retrieval technology for large-scale data is a popular research area. To ensure the robustness and security of digital image watermarking, we propose a novel algorithm using synergetic neural networks. The algorithm first processes a meaningful gray watermark image, then embeds it as a watermark signal into the block Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) component. The companion algorithm for detection and extraction of the watermark uses a cooperative neural network, where the suspected watermark signal is used as the input while the output consists in the result of the recognition process. The simulation experiments show that the algorithm can complete certain image processing operations with improved performance, not only simultaneously completing watermark detection and extraction, but also efficiently determining the watermark attribution. Compared with other state-of-the-art models, the proposed model obtains an optimal Peak Signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).}

abstract = {The sustainable growth of cities created the need for better informed decisions based on information and communication technologies to sense the city and quantify its pulse. An important part of this concept of “smart cities” is the characterization of vehicular traffic flows and the prediction of urban mobility. Although there are several sensors that are able to infer the traffic flows in the city, road-mounted traffic counters can measure the number of vehicles in different parts of the roads. However, they are not usually used in traffic city prediction; therefore, we can provide a first step for the usefulness of these sensors in the city management. In this paper we study both statistical and deep learning methods to describe, understand and predict the city traffic profile. Although traffic presents seasonal patterns, in occasional situations these may not be verified. Considering the proposed approaches, statistical algorithms, such as SARIMA, and neural network algorithms, such as FFNN, LSTM, CNN and hybrid LSTM-CNN, we found that statistical models are significantly good to predict the traffic counters data in the short-term, even when anomalous traffic conditions are observed. For long-term predictions, CNNs have shown to be efficient and robust. Long-term and short-term forecasting, in the context of traffic flow prediction, may be a strategy to accomplish different goals. Long-term forecasting can be chosen for traffic flow description, and short-term forecasting can be used to identify and mitigate anomalies.}

VANET (vehicular ad hoc network) is one of the emergent transportation technologies that has a great impact on ensuring mainly traffic management and road safety in urban areas by effciently using data sharing among vehicles. To further increase the security and safety of passengers and drivers, ITSs are continually striving to make the fusion of emergent network technologies to provide more reliable and effcient services. Relating VANET to UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is an example of this fusion, where UAVs act as an assistant to vehicles aiming to extend the network connectivity while effciently avoiding obstacles (e.g., Buildings) and providing high data delivery ratios. However, VANET and UAV are still critical security subjects that must be addressed. Advanced Machine Learning (e.g., Deep Learning) techniques have recently been used to protect VANET and UAV communications against various cyber attacks that deteriorate the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of vehicular data. Thus, in this paper, we focus on reviewing related work on machine learning techniques for intrusion detection systems in VANET- and UAV-aided networks. We also highlight the main open research challenges in literature and provide hints for improving security in ITSs.}

Of particular concern is the potential for large-scale attacks to disrupt road transportation, which is the lifeline of cities. This concern has only been growing with the increase in cybersecurity incidents and disinformation attacks in related infrastructures. In this study, we develop a framework to quantify, detect, and mitigate cascading consequences of attacks on road transportation networks. Application of our framework to the road network of Boston reveals that targeted attacks on a small fraction of nodes leads to disproportionately larger disruptions of routes. We develop an unsupervised machine learning algorithm based on network percolation theory and density based clustering (P-DBSCAN) to quantify risk for urban networks based on real-time traffic data. Our study illustrates a holistic approach to build resilience in existing road networks to attacks. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our framework in other smart city infrastructures.}

abstract = {Smart cities and smart mobility come from intelligent systems designed by humans. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is contributing significantly to the development of these systems, and the automotive industry is the most prominent example of "smart" technology entering the market: there are Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), Radar/LIDAR detection units and camera-based Computer Vision systems that can assess driving conditions. Actually, these technologies have become consumer goods and services in mass-produced vehicles to provide human drivers with tools for a more comfortable and safer driving. Nevertheless, they need to be further improved for progress in the transition to fully automated driving or simply to increase vehicle automation levels. To this end, it becomes imperative to accurately predict driver’s decisions, model human driving behaviors, and introduce more accurate risk assessment metrics. This paper presents a system that can learn to predict the future braking behavior of a driver in a typically urban vehicle-pedestrian conflict, i.e., when a pedestrian enters a zebra crossing from the curb and a vehicle is approaching. The algorithm proposes a sequential prediction of relevant operational indicators that continuously describe the encounter process. A car driving simulator was used to collect reliable data on braking behaviours of a cohort of 68 licensed university students, who faced the same urban scenario. The vehicle speed, steering wheel angle, and pedal activity were recorded as the participants approached the crosswalk, along with the azimuth angle of the pedestrian and the relative longitudinal distance between the vehicle and the pedestrian: the proposed system employs the vehicle information as human driving decisions and the pedestrian information as explanatory variables of the environmental state. In fact, the pedestrian’s polar coordinates are usually calculated by an on-board millimeter-wave radar which is typically used to perceive the environment around a vehicle. All mentioned information is represented in the form of time series data and is used to train a recurrent neural network in a supervised machine learning process. The main purpose of this research is to define a system of behavioral profiles in non-collision conditions that could be used for enhancing the existing intelligent driving systems, e.g., to reduce the number of warnings when the driver is not on a collision course with a pedestrian. Preliminary experiments reveal the feasibility of the proposed system.}

During inference, mappings of normal examples fall within the learned hypersphere, whereas mappings of anomalies fall outside the hypersphere. The whole system is end-to-end trainable and outperforms other advanced methods in real-world dataset.}

Especially, since industrial sewage is normally highly toxic, which could cause serious pollution in a city and lead to health problems of residents, it is critical to monitor and predictably maintain sewage treatment facilities in cities. This paper presents an intelligent sewage treatment system based on machine learning and Internet of Things sensors to assist to manage the sewage treatment in a fine chemical plant. The implemented system has operated for twenty months, acquired multi-dimension data such as temperatures in different treatment processes, operation parameters of devices, and real-time Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Since the change trend of outflow COD is highly related to operation status, this paper innovatively uses different types of temperature and water inflow data as model inputs and applies three algorithms to make prediction, which are Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. The experimental results show that GRU model performs better (MAPE = 10.18%, RMSE = 35.67, MAE = 31.16) than LSTM and SVR.

abstract = {This paper proposes a secure blockchain based energy trading system for residential homes. In the system, a new proof-of-computational closeness (PoCC) consensus protocol is proposed for the selection of miners and the creation of blocks. Moreover, an analytical energy pricing policy is designed to solve the problem of existing energy pricing policies in a distributed trading environment. A dynamic multi-pseudonym mechanism is developed for the prosumers to preserve their transactional privacy during energy trading. Since it requires extra storage and computing resources for the blockchain miners to simultaneously execute both mining process and application intensive tasks, therefore, an improved sparse neural network (ISNN) is proposed for computation offloading to the cloud servers. In ISNN, a Jaya optimization algorithm is used to accelerate the error convergence rate while reducing the number of connections between different layers of neurons. Besides, ISNN optimizes the overall computational cost of the system. Furthermore, the security of the prosumers is ensured using blockchain technology while security analysis shows that the system is robust against the Sybil attack. The proposed blockchain based peer-to-peer secure energy trading system is extremely important for sustainable cities and society. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed pricing policy is compared with time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing and real-time pricing policies. From the results, it is proved that the prosumers achieve a higher degree of satisfaction and utility when using the proposed pricing policy. Moreover, the probability of a successful Sybil attack is zero as the number of attackers’ identities and computational capacities increases. Under different sizes of data to be uploaded, the proposed ISNN scheme has the least average computational cost and data transmission time as compared to deep reinforcement learning combined with genetic algorithm (DRGO) and sparse evolutionary training and multi-layer perceptron (SET-MLP) schemes in the literature. Moreover, the proposed system is tested for scalability by increasing the number of prosumers. Extensive simulations are performed and the results depict the satisfactory performance of the proposed system.}

The reason to select that data is air pollution rates are often associated with traffic congestion, and there is intensive research that exists to forecast air pollution by road traffic. To the best of our knowledge, any effort to enhance road traffic prediction through air quality and ensemble regression model techniques is not yet been proposed. In this research, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we have performed a comparative analysis of 7 different regression models to find out which model gives better accuracy. Secondly, we propose a framework using regression models in which the first regression model's result is boosted using boosting ensemble method and is passed to the next regression model which shows that the proposed framework gives more satisfying results than the above 7 regression models. The experimental findings show the effectiveness of the proposed framework which decreases the error rate by 2.47 %.}

The smart city provides better solutions for urban areas which are increasing at an unprecedented speed. This paper presents an empirical study carried out to assess and analyze the development pattern of 35 smart cities in China using the principal component analysis (PCA) and back propagation (BP) neural network techniques. The proposed PCA-BP neural network assessment processing model is applied with six dimensional factors and twenty-two operating indices. With the feature extraction and performance score calculated via PCA, BP neural network is adopted for city classification to recognize the development differences in smart cities. The results indicate that the factor-driven impetus evolves into innovation-driven impetus, narrowing the gap from the holistic perspective between the first and middle-ranking groups, while two middle-ranking groups show a similar upward trend in terms of developing a smart economy through sustainable productivity in innovative enterprises and high-tech industry. To some extent, in response to a similar improving trend in the application of smart services, a distinct advantage of an individual index can be a complementary offset to unapparent holistic highlighting the reception of the lowest average points. Unbalanced development exists in two subaverage groups that are deficient in the initial inventory of smart infrastructure and demands. A relatively large difference exists in the smart mobility index among cities, whereas the opposite case is found concerning the smart environment index. Finally, corresponding optimized development pattern are recommended for building a sustainable smart city.}

Smart healthcare is becoming a field of remarkable transformations and growth in the new era of smart cities and digitally interconnected societies. In smart healthcare systems, multiple sensors, devices, and sources are interconnected through networks and collect valuable data that gives insights about the patient’s health status and ongoing health trends. Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is a concept that represents the identifiable sensors, devices, and sources connected to the internet and that can be utilized in various automated patient monitoring applications to provide remote healthcare services. This article aims to provide an IoHT driven deep learning-based system for non-invasive patient discomfort detection. The developed system comprises of an RGB camera device to identify discomfort in a patient’s body instead of utilizing any wearable sensors or devices. In order to identify movement and discomfort, the system utilizes the YOLOv3 model to detect the patient’s body and the Alphapose method to extract different keypoints information of the patient’s body. Applying association rules, the detected keypoints are then converted into six central body organs. To detect a patient’s discomfort, pairwise distance is measured between detected keypoints, and finally, time frame rules are applied to set a threshold in order to analyze movements as either associated with normal or discomfort conditions. The patient’s body is monitored continuously for multiple frames, based on which comfort and discomfort levels are distinguished. Different video sequences are used for experimental evaluations; results reveal the effectiveness of the developed system by achieving a True Positive Rate of 95% with a 6% False Positive Rate.}

In this work, we present an efficient and robust framework to recognize anomalies from surveillance Big Video Data (BVD) using Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Smart surveillance is an important application of AIoT and we propose a two-stream neural network in this direction. The first stream comprises instant anomaly detection that is functional over resource-constrained IoT devices, whereas second phase is a two-stream deep neural network allowing for detailed anomaly analysis, suited to be deployed as a cloud computing service. Firstly, a self-pruned fine-tuned lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) classifies the ongoing events as normal or anomalous in an AIoT environment. Upon anomaly detection, the edge device alerts the concerned departments and transmits the anomalous frames to cloud analysis center for their detailed evaluation in the second phase. The cloud analysis center resorts to the proposed two-stream network, modeled from the integration of spatiotemporal and optical flow features through the sequential frames. Fused features flow through a bi-directional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) layer, which classifies them into their respective anomaly classes, e.g., assault and abuse. We perform extensive experiments over benchmarks built on top of the UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 datasets to test the effectiveness of our framework. We report a 9.88% and 4.01% increase in accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art methods evaluated over the aforementioned datasets.}

However, due to the complexity and diversity of the IoT data, it is difficult to build an efficient energy prediction system that reflects the dynamics of the IoT environment. To address this problem, a short-term energy prediction system based on edge computing architecture is proposed, in which data acquisition, data processing and regression prediction are distributed in sensing nodes, routing nodes and central server respectively.

In order to achieve this target, acquiring a better understanding of how residential DR participants respond in DR events is essential – and recent advances in novel machine learning and statistical AI provide promising tools to address this challenge. This study provides an in-depth analysis of how residential customers have responded in incentive-based DR, utilising household-related data from a large-scale, real-world trial: the Smart Grid, Smart City (SGSC) project. Using a number of different machine learning approaches, we model the relationship between a household’s response and household-related features. Moreover, we examine the potential effects of households’ features on the residential response behaviour, and highlight a number of key insights which raise questions about the reported level of consumers’ engagement in DR schemes, and the motivation for different customers’ response level. Finally, we explore the temporal structure of the response – and although we found no supporting evidence of DR responders learning over time for the available data from this trial, the proposed methodologies could be used for longer-term longitudinal DR studies. Our study concludes with a broader discussion of our findings and potential paths for future research in this emerging area.}

Recently, the research community in the field of IoT Security endeavor hard to build anomaly, intrusion and cyber attacks traffic identification model using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for IoT security analysis. However, the critical and significant problem still not studied in depth that is how to select an effective ML algorithm when there are numbers of ML algorithms for cyber attacks detection system for IoT security. In this paper, we proposed a new framework model and a hybrid algorithm to solve this problem. Firstly BoT-IoT identification dataset is applied and its 44 effective features are selected from a number of features for the machine learning algorithm. Then five effective machine learning algorithm is selected for the identification of malicious and anomaly traffic identification and also select the most widely ML algorithm performance evaluation metrics. To find out which ML algorithm is effective and should be used to select for IoT anomaly and intrusion traffic identification, a bijective soft set approach and its algorithm is applied. Then we applied the proposed algorithm based on bijective soft set approach. Our experimental results show that the proposed model with the algorithm is effective for the selection ML algorithm out of numbers of ML algorithms.}

The use of smart technologies such as Internet of Things, BigData, Artificial Intelligence and so on, requires strengthening or even creating a new communication infrastructure in the field of traffic. This paper discusses the risks of ITS implementation by analyzing the current state, identifying the key risk factors and showing possibilities in reduction of these risk using system methodology. It can be assumed that this transformation will be time-consuming, not only in policy and construction areas, but also in putting these systems into operation. In this meantime, when smart and non-smart systems will come in contact, there should be expected risk situations, that could cause difficulties for large-scale ITS to emerge, for example for large cities. An important part is also early awareness of the population which is affected by the situation of putting the system into operation, especially trainings for professional drivers. A participant in traffic, who are not affected by smart technologies as so-called “internet generation“ should be taken into account, as possible source of risk situations. Determining the potential risks on all the above-mentioned case is a current problem because of the rapid development and onset of ITS.}

This inspires us to exploit low-resolution (LR) pattern images or LR phase image to generate HR 3D point cloud. Specifically, we attempt to solve this problem using deep learning based super-resolution (SR) methods. We formulate a new deep learning based SR method for 3D point cloud. We show that the proposed SR surely improves the resolution of the reconstructed 3D point cloud.

The IoT-supported devices capacitate, embedded with sensors, enabled numerous context-aware applications to recognize physical activities. There are some activity recognition applications; however, they are still deficient in recognizing activities accurately. In this paper, a novel framework for human activity recognition (HAR) is proposed using raw readings from a combination of fused smartphone sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and Google Fit activity tracking module. The proposed framework applies deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) to an extensive training dataset. The latter consists of five activity classes from 12 individuals using a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN). An extensive training dataset is used consisting of five activity classes from a group of 12 individuals. The designed android application (runs in the background) collects data from the smartphone's embedded sensors fused with the Google Fit API to validate the results proposed framework. The proposed framework shows promising results in recognizing human activities compared to other similar studies and achieves an accuracy of 99.43% for activity recognition using DRNN.}

In order to manage the numerous services keeping their Quality of Service (QoS) demands upright, it is imperative to employ context aware computing as well as fog computing simultaneously. This paper investigates the feasibility of energy minimization at the fog layer through intelligent sleep and wake-up cycles of the fog nodes which are context-aware. It proposes a virtual machine management approach for effectively allocating service requests with a minimal number of active fog nodes using a genetic algorithm (GA); and thereafter, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach is incorporated to optimize the period of fog nodes’ duty cycle. Simulations are carried out using MATLAB and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves energy consumption of the fog layer by approximately 11–21% when compared to existing context sharing based algorithms.}

abstract = {In energy sectors, power utilities face financial losses due to Electricity Theft (ET). It happens when electricity is consumed without billing. Several methods are developed to detect ET automatically. Most of these methods only assess Electricity Consumption (EC) records. However, it is challenging to detect fraudulent consumers by only observing EC records because of diverse theft strategies (line tapping, meter tampering, etc.) and the irregularity of ET behavior. Furthermore, many methods have poor classification accuracy due to imbalanced data. This work proposes two novel methods to resolve the above-mentioned issues: Tomek Link Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique with Support Vector Machine (TBSSVM) and Temporal Convolutional Network with Enhanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (TCN-EMLP). The former resamples the data by balancing the majority and minority class instances. Whereas, the latter classifies normal and fraudulent consumers. Moreover, deep learning models suffer from high variance in their final results due to the assignment of different weights. Therefore, an averaging ensemble strategy is applied in this work to reduce the high variance. Furthermore, State Grid Cooperation of China (SGCC) and Pakistan Residential Electricity Consumption (PRECON) datasets are used in this paper for performing the simulations. SGCC is an imbalanced and labeled dataset while PRECON is an unlabeled dataset comprised of normal consumers' EC records (sequential) and auxiliary (non-sequential) data. Simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines, i.e., wide and deep convolutional neural network, extreme gradient boosting, long short-term memory with multi-layer perceptron, etc., in terms of ET detection.}

This approach can establish sensible factors and risk indices for the occurrence of floods at the city level, which could be instrumental for outlining a long-term strategy for Smart Cities. The most performant Machine Learning model was a Random Forest, with a Matthew's Correlation Coefficient of 0.77 and an Accuracy of 0.96. To support and extend the capabilities of the Machine Learning model, a GIS model was developed to find areas with higher likelihood of being flooded under critical weather conditions. Therefore, hot spots were defined for the entire city given the observed flood history. The scores obtained from the Random Forest model and the Hot Spot analysis were then combined to create a flood risk index.}

Smart cities’ paradigm has resulted in improved quality of life and better services to citizens, like smart healthcare, smart parking, smart transport, smart buildings, smart homes, and so on. One of the major challenges of IoT devices is the limited capacity of their battery because the devices consume a large amount of energy once they communicate with each other. Furthermore, the IoT-based smart systems would contain sensitive data about network systems, introducing serious privacy and security issues. IoT-based smart systems are highly exposed to botnet attacks. Examples of such attacks are Mirai and BASHLITE malware launched from compromised surveillance devices, which are common in smart cities, resulting in paralysis of Internet-based services through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Such DDoS attacks on IoT devices and their networks further threaten the emerging concept of sustainable smart cities. To discover such cyberattacks, this paper proposes a novel statistical learning-based botnet detection framework, called IoTBoT-IDS, which protects IoT-based smart networks against botnet attacks. IoTBoT-IDS captures the normal behavior of IoT networks by applying statistical learning-based techniques, using Beta Mixture Model (BMM) and a Correntropy model. Any deviation from the normal behavior is detected as an anomalous event. To evaluate IoTBoT-IDS, three benchmark datasets generated from realistic IoT networks were used. The evaluation results showed that IoTBoT-IDS effectively identifies various types of botnets with an average detection accuracy of 99.2%, which is higher by about 2–5% compared with compelling intrusion detection methods, namely AdaBoost ensemble learning, fuzzy c-means, and deep feed forward neural networks.}

Repositioning democratic values of citizens’ choices in these complex ecosystems has turned out to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and opportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper introduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively engaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens assemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters. The core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving witness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus to empower citizens’ trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS localization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how real-time collective measurements over citizens’ choices can be made in a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by deploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of transport means. Furthermore, witness presence of cycling risk is validated using official accident data from public authorities, which are compared against wisdom of the crowd. The paramount role of dynamic consensus, self-governance and ethically aligned artificial intelligence in the augmented democracy paradigm is outlined.}

The CRBFT algorithm divides the nodes into three types, each with different responsibilities: master node, sub-nodes, and candidate nodes, and sets the credit attribute to the node. The node’s credit can be adjusted adaptively through the reinforcement learning algorithm, which can dynamically change the state of nodes. CRBFT algorithm can automatically identify malicious nodes and invalid nodes, making them exit from the consensus network. Experimental results show that the CRBFT algorithm can effectively improve the consensus network’s security. Besides, compared with the PBFT algorithm, in CRBFT, the consensus delay is reduced by about 40%, and the traffic overhead is reduced by more than 45%.

However, an insecure technique for decision-making may lead to the breach of SG data where hackers gained full access to consumer data. On the contrary, a secure technique for decision-making can provide satisfaction to all the stakeholders, including consumers and utility providers. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents a comprehensive literature survey and analysis of state-of-the-art proposals for Secure Data Analytics (SDA) in the SG system. However, to achieve SDA for the SG systems is one of the critical tasks. The existing research and development endeavors not fully exploited the SDA in the SG system. In this paper, we discuss the distinctive nature of SDA and its complexity over the SG data. A detailed taxonomy abstracted into a novel process model, which highlights various research challenges such as secure data collection and preprocessing, secure load data processing and storage, load prediction, load management and analysis, data security and privacy issues, and data communication. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the process model.}

abstract = {The increasing population in the whole world demands adequate infrastructure to satisfy varied requirements. To fulfill this requirement, the introduction of information techniques presents an opportunity for the development of smart cities. For instance, an automatic visual inspection can be employed to replace the role of workers in quality management and streamlines automation. Previously, a large amount of machine vision-based algorithms has been presented to address this problem. However, accurate detection of various tiny integrated circuits remains an unresolved issue. To bridged this gap, a novel deep learning-based approach was proposed for instance segmentation in printed circuit board images. By adding the geometric attention-guided mask branch into the fully convolutional one-stage object detector under the framework of Mask R-CNN, it can produce a segmentation mask for each bounding box to enhance the identification accuracy. To evaluate the ability of the proposed approach, the comparison experiments were conducted between state-of-the-art techniques and ours. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented algorithm outperformed the state-of-the-art both in precision, sensitivity, and accuracy for both small devices like resistors and capacitors as well as integrated circuits.}

The IoT industry system has also gradually improved, forming a complete industrial foundation, including chips, electronic components, equipment, software, integrated systems, IoT services, and telecom operators. In the event of selective forwarding attacks, virus damage, malicious virus intrusion, etc., the losses caused by such security problems are more serious than those of traditional networks, which are not only network information materials, but also physical objects. The limitations of sensor node resources in the Internet of Things, the complexity of networking, and the open wireless broadcast communication characteristics make it vulnerable to attacks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) helps identify anomalies in the network and takes the necessary countermeasures to ensure the safe and reliable operation of IoT applications. This paper proposes an IoT feature extraction and intrusion detection algorithm for intelligent city based on deep migration learning model, which combines deep learning model with intrusion detection technology. According to the existing literature and algorithms, this paper introduces the modeling scheme of migration learning model and data feature extraction. In the experimental part, KDD CUP 99 was selected as the experimental data set, and 10% of the data was used as training data.

abstract = {With the recent advances in deep learning, data-driven methods have shown compelling performance in various application domains enabling the Smart Cities paradigm. Leveraging spatial–temporal data from multiple sources for (citywide) traffic forecasting is a key to strengthen the smart city management in areas such as urban traffic control, abnormal event detection, etc. Existing approaches of traffic flow prediction mainly rely on the development of various deep neural networks –e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks such as ResNet are used for modeling spatial dependencies among different regions, whereas recurrent neural networks are increasingly implemented for temporal dynamics modeling. Despite their advantages, the existing approaches suffer from limitations of intensive computations, lack of capabilities to properly deal with missing values, and simplistic integration of heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel urban flow prediction framework by generalizing the hidden states of the model with continuous-time dynamics of the latent states using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). Specifically, we introduce a discretize-then-optimize approach to improve and balance the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. It not only guarantees the prediction error but also provides high flexibility for decision-makers. Furthermore, we investigate the factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that affect the city traffic volume and use separate neural networks to extract and disentangle the influencing factors, which avoids the brute-force data fusion in previous works. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, while requiring significantly less memory cost and fewer model parameters.}

The results show that in the analysis of image local optimization effect, it is found that the classification performance of all algorithms decreases with the increase of noise, and the performance of local anisotropic mode (LAP) is superior, which has strong robustness to rotation, illumination, and noise. In the analysis of image feature similarity effect, it is found that the chi square distance between Log Gabor features is positively correlated with the degree of image distortion, and the validity of the measurement method is verified. Further analysis of the video processing effect of industrial visual perception technology shows that the video processing effect of test algorithm is significantly better than that of HM16.8 by comparing the distortion performance of the two algorithms with different sequences, with low distortion and significantly improved performance.

This work attempts to evaluate and implement machine learning (ML) based supervised classifiers to semi-automate the process for extraction, quantification and mapping of urban built-up impervious areas. The work emphasised on the usage of freely available open-source high-resolution satellite datasets acquired from Sentinel-2 mission. Three different machine learning-based supervised classification techniques were evaluated for a better understanding of feature extraction methods along with suitable classifier for classification of urban impervious areas. It is a well-known phenomenon that an increase in the impervious surface contributes to declining of green cover. Also, a zonal analysis of extracted built-up impervious surfaces was conducted to understand the spatial configuration of the pilot study area. This zonal assessment of urban built-up impervious surfaces can be used as a worthy tool for better sustainable smart cities development. These can serve as a valuable resource for restoring the required urban green cover for better sustainable urban development.}

In this context, finding an unoccupied parking slot by the interested vehicle owners with least overhead becomes an NP-Hard problem bounded by various constraints. In-advance availability of information regarding parking occupancy plays a major role in hassle free trip optimization for motorists. It also facilitates services-cum-profit management for the parking owners. It further helps in curbing congestion by reducing cruising time and hence, helps in controlling pollution of the smart cities. Thus, accurate and timely information regarding parking occupancy and availability has become the basic need in the evolution of the smart cities. Motivated by these facts, an occupancy-driven machine learning based on-street parking pricing scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme uses machine learning based approaches to predict occupancy of parking lots, which in turn is used to deduce occupancy driven prices for arriving vehicles. In order to train, test, and compare different machine learning models, on-street parking data of Seattle city has been used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that parking occupancy prediction system is used to generate occupancy based parking prices for on-street parking system of the Seattle city. Results obtained using the proposed occupancy driven machine learning based on-street parking pricing scheme demonstrate its effectiveness over other existing state-of-the-art schemes.}

UAV path planning deals with finding the most optimal or shortest path for UAVs such that minimum energy and resources are utilized. This paper examines the path planning algorithms for UAVs through a literature survey conducted on 139 systematically retrieved articles published in the last decade that are narrowed down to 36 highly relevant articles. As retrieved from the shortlisted articles, the path planning algorithms include RRT, Artificial Potential, Voronoi, D-Star, A-Star, Dijkstra, MILP, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization that are classified into four main types: Model-based, Conventional, Learning-based, and Cell-based. Most of the disaster-related articles are focused on the post-disaster phase only and use conventional and learning-based algorithms with applications to localize victims and optimize paths. Regarding the UAV communication network (UAVCN), the key challenges are communication issues, resource allocation, UAV deployment, defining UAV trajectory, and content security. UAV path planning’s key barriers are path optimization, path completeness, optimality, efficiency, and achieving robustness. Accordingly, a holistic IoT-powered UAV-based smart city management system has been recommended in the current study where all the smart city key components are integrated to address disasters like floods, earthquakes, and bush fire. The proposed holistic system can help prepare for disasters and mitigate them as soon as these arise and help enhance the smart city governance.}

The influx of health-related queries and the volume of answers within the medical forums is a testimony to this adaption. The scalability, natural interaction and dynamism of the continuously collected and connected user-generated social big data can support health assessment, intervention and provisioning to produce the best kind of cognitive smart city. On the flip side the use of social media for healthcare communication suffers from data deluge, lack of reliability and quality, confidentiality and privacy (location/personal) issues. Duplicate questions, that is, queries with similar semantics (meaning) corrupt the filtering mechanism, increase the response time and compromise with the quality of the answer too. This research puts forward solutions to resolve the key challenge of duplicacy within the medical community Question-Answering sites (Medical CQAs). We propose to solve the semantic question matching problem for duplicate question pair detection, using a hybrid deep learning model, which combines a Co-attention based Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Siamese neural network and a Multi-layer perceptron classifier to output the probability of a similarity match between the two questions. Euclidean distance function is then used to compute the similarity between questions. The proposed model is validated on 100 question pairs which are scrapped from three featured groups, namely, ‘Irritable Bowel Syndrome’, ‘Anxiety Disorder’ and ‘Menopause’ of Patient.info community forum and an accuracy of 86.375% is observed. The results obtained are comparable to that of the Quora’s state-of-the-art results for duplicate detection.}

With the proliferation of physical things being connected to internet and enabled with sensory capabilities to form an Internet of Thing (IoT) network, it is increasingly important to run CNN inference, a computationally intensive application, on the resource constrained IoT devices. Object detection is a fundamental computer vision problem that provides information for image understanding in several artificial intelligence (AI) applications in smart cities. Among various object detection algorithms, CNN has emerged as a new paradigm to improve the overall performance. The Multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which are used repeatedly in the convolution layers of CNN, hold extreme computational complexity. Hence, the overall computational workloads and their respective energy consumption of any CNN applications are on the rise. To overcome these escalating challenges, approximate computing mechanism has played a vital role in reducing power and area of computation intensive CNN applications. In this paper, we have designed an approximate MAC architecture, termed Shift and Accumulator Unit (SAC), for the error-resilient CNN based object detection algorithm targeting embedded platforms. The proposed computing unit deliberately trades accuracy to reduce design complexity and power consumption, thus suiting the resource constrained IoT devices. The pipeline architecture of the SAC unit saves approximately 1.8× clock cycles than the non-pipeline SAC architecture. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed computing unit has better energy efficiency and resource utilization than the accurate multiplier and state-of-the-art approximate multipliers without noticeable deterioration in overall performance.}

This paper examines bias in resident-reported data by analyzing socio-spatial disparities in ‘311’ complaint behavior in Kansas City, Missouri. We utilize data from detailed 311 reports and a comprehensive resident satisfaction survey, and spatially join these data with code enforcement violations, neighborhood characteristics, and street condition assessments. We introduce a model to identify disparities in resident-government interactions and classify under- and over-reporting neighborhoods based on complaint behavior. Despite greater objective and subjective need, low-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to report street condition or “nuisance” issues, while prioritizing more serious problems. Our findings form the basis for acknowledging and accounting for data bias in self-reported data, and contribute to the more equitable delivery of city services through bias-aware data-driven processes.}

abstract = {This study describes a neural network approach to collecting pedestrian traffic statistics from street surveillance cameras. Collecting and processing pedestrian traffic is one of the most important areas in the development of smart cities. To solve the problem of collecting pedestrian traffic statistics, a modern system of object detection in real time, YOLOv3, was used. To train the neural network, a data set of 750 labeled frames with pedestrians was used, which amounted to 20,000 objects. According to the results of the system testing, the recognition accuracy was 79%. The presented data set can be used by other researchers in their studies.}
