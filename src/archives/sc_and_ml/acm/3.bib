abstract = {Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) can boost the development of smart cities, and artificial intelligence and edge computing are key technologies that support the implementation of ITS. Vehicle localization is critical for ITS since the safety driving and location-aware serves highly depend on the accurate location information. In this article, we construct a vehicle localization system architecture composed of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) with arbitrary array configuration and a large amount of vehicles in smart cities. In order to deal with the coexisting of circular and non-circular signals transmitted by vehicles, we proposed several vehicle number estimation methods for non-circular signals. Based on the machine learning technique, we extend the vehicle number estimation method into mixed signals in more complex scenario of smart cities. Then the DOA estimation method for non-circular signals based on IoT is proposed, and then the performance of this method is analyzed as well. Simulation outcomes verify the excellent performance of the proposed vehicle number estimation methods and the DOA estimation method in smart cities, and the vehicle positions can be achieved with high estimation accuracy.},

Automated recognition of street parking signs, however, is a more challenging task, due to their small size and huge diversity. Identification of street parking signs is not only helpful in autonomous driving but also in notifying drivers of available parking spaces ahead, significantly alleviating traffic congestion. In this paper, we introduce a new street parking sign detection and classification method that is based on a deep learning network that receives a video feed from a car camera to accurately detect and classify different street parking signs in real-time. Performance evaluations showed that our model achieves mean average precision of 98.56%.},

abstract = {Singapore ratified the Paris Agreement on September 21, 2016, and the unconditional target by 2030 is the reduction of emission by 36%. Furthermore, the cities are the major source of emission, and transportation accounts for about 14% of the total emissions in Singapore. Transportation is one of the necessary infrastructures for cities and over 80% of the population in Singapore depends on public transportation systems. To significantly cut emissions, smart cities are expected to play an essential role, therefore the conventional transportation systems are transforming to be intelligent. The emission of vehicles depends on various factors like the average speed of the vehicle, total distance covered by the vehicle, urban driving conditions, and type of vehicle. In this research, COPERT model is used for calculation of emission cost after extracting features from real-world GPS datasets, and machine learning models are built to predict the total emission cost of the buses in an area of Singapore. In this study, the performance of emission cost estimation using three modeling techniques, namely MLP, RF, and Light GBM are compared. Results prove that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is 97% when Light GBM is implemented.},

abstract = { Graffiti is an element of graphic expression that manifests different states of the human being. However, for many governments worldwide, it has been an element of discord between them and the communities that express themselves through graffitis. This article proposes identifying graffiti and concentration zones through Computer Vision and object detection and localization to support public policy management in smart cities. ASUM-DM methodology is used to achieve the aim. Initially, the current problems faced by municipal governments in the management of public graffiti policy are identified. Then available datasets of images from Google Street View (GSV) and other acquired datasets are identified for the case study carried out in the city of Medell\'{\i}n (Colombia) and border municipalities. A training dataset of 1,395 images and a production dataset of 71,100 panoramas is placed on strictly using the experimental method of the division of training data, validation, and a production sample, to make a correct estimation of the generalization error. As a result of the training process, we obtained an Average Precision of 69,14%, which presented a high precision Tag of 89.23%, and low precision of 59.13% in Mural. Finally, it is possible to build heat maps of graffiti concentration areas that could guide rulers to create or improve public policies related to graffiti expression.},

abstract = {Efficient signal control at isolated intersections is vital for relieving congestion, accidents, and environmental pollution caused by increasing numbers of vehicles. However, most of the existing studies not only ignore the constraint of the limited computing resources available at isolated intersections but also the matching degree between the signal timing and the traffic demand, leading to high complexity and reduced learning efficiency. In this article, we propose a traffic signal control method based on reinforcement learning with state reduction. First, a reinforcement learning model is established based on historical traffic flow data, and we propose a dual-objective reward function that can reduce vehicle delay and improve the matching degree between signal time allocation and traffic demand, allowing the agent to learn the optimal signal timing strategy quickly. Second, the state and action spaces of the model are preliminarily reduced by selecting a proper control phase combination; then, the state space is further reduced by eliminating rare or nonexistent states based on the historical traffic flow. Finally, a simplified Q-table is generated and used to optimize the complexity of the control algorithm. The results of simulation experiments show that our proposed control algorithm effectively improves the capacity of isolated intersections while reducing the time and space costs of the signal control algorithm.},

abstract = {Nowadays, urban traffic affects the quality of life in cities and metropolitan areas as the problem becomes ever more exacerbated by parking issues: congestion increases due to drivers looking for slots to park their vehicles. An Internet of Things approach permits drivers to know the parking space availability in real time through wireless networks of sensor devices. This research focuses on studying the data generated by parking systems in order to develop predictive models that generate forecasted information. This can be useful in improving the management of parking areas, especially on-street parking, while having an important effect on urban traffic. This work begins by looking at the state of the art in predictive methods based on machine learning for time series. Similar proposed solutions for parking prediction are described in terms of the technology and current state-of-the-art predictive models. This paper then introduces the recurrent neural network method that was used in this research, namely Gated Recurrent Unit, as well as the model developed according to a real scenario in the city of Riyadh. In order to improve the quality of the model, exogenous variables related with weather and calendar effects are considered, and the baseline model is compared to the models that used this extra information. Finally, the obtained results are described, followed by suggestions for future research.},

This paper proposes, through data collection, the recognition of vibratory patterns for the classification of surfaces using machine learning techniques. This is an important issue, as it offers a proposal for greater security of bicycle circulation points with the identification of possible irregularities. The analysis of roads surface quality is possible with the use of an accelerometer to collect data important for the audition of tracks. This data is then classified generating information, classified as patterns (asphalt and pavement surfaces). We have performed field data gathering and applied algorithms calculations to classify data to identify the surface the bicycle ridden, with results in percentages of accuracy up to more than 96%.},

abstract = {Nowadays, a sustainable and smart city focuses on energy efficiency and the reduction of polluting emissions through smart mobility projects and initiatives to “sensitize” infrastructure. Smart parking is one of the building blocks of intelligent mobility, innovative mobility that aims to be flexible, integrated, and sustainable and consequently integrated into a Smart City. By using the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors located in the parking areas or the underground car parks in combination with a mobile application, which indicates to citizens the free places in the different areas of the city and guides them toward the chosen parking, it is possible to reduce air pollution and fluidifying noise traffic. In this article, we present and discuss an innovative Deep Learning-based ensemble technique in forecasting the parking space occupancy to reduce the search time for parking and to optimize the flow of cars in particularly congested areas, with an overall positive impact on traffic in urban centres. A genetic algorithm has also been used to optimize predictors parameters. The main goal is to design an intelligent IoT-based service that can predict, in the next few hours, the parking spaces occupancy of a street. The proposed approach has been assessed on a real IoT dataset composed by over than 15M of collected sensor records. Obtained results demonstrate that our method outperforms both single predictors and the widely used strategy of the mean providing inherently robust predictions.},

The advancements in deep learning have greatly enhanced visual understanding, but the domain of aerial vision remains largely unexplored. Aerial images pose many unique challenges for performing proper scene parsing such as high-resolution data, small-scaled objects, a large number of objects in the camera view, dense clustering of objects, background clutter, and so on, which greatly hinder the performance of the existing deep learning methods. In this work, we propose ISDNet (Instance Segmentation and Detection Network), a novel network to perform instance segmentation and object detection on visual data captured by UAVs. This work enables aerial image analytics for various needs in a smart city. In particular, we use dilated convolutions to generate improved spatial context, leading to better discrimination between foreground and background features. The proposed network efficiently reuses the segment-mask features by propagating them from early stages using residual connections. Furthermore, ISDNet makes use of effective anchors to accommodate varying object scales and sizes. The proposed method obtains state-of-the-art results in the aerial context.},

The APIs accessed from this website enable users to query the ML models and obtain answers to questions such as: which parts of the city have the greatest pedestrian traffic, or the availability and cost of parking spots. The freeware tool RStudio was used for Big Data analytics while Machine Learning with Plumber was used to wrap the R code into APIs and Swagger to specify and document them. Postman and Swagger were used for testing while Docker was employed to package the APIs into standard containers for cloud deployment. The prototype website was developed using Wix and deployed on the Nectar cloud. The resulting website provides predictive models for COM traffic, parking, and transport and demonstrates the application of online smart city services for city planners and managers.},

While a number of projects already address current challenges of exploiting such technological advancements in digital government, the full scope of deploying the disruptive technologies in smart city initiatives requires more research. This paper therefore aims at investigating research needs in successfully implementing and deploying disruptive technologies in smart cities.

abstract = {Cities have entered the age of the sensor and located sensors everywhere over and under cities. The sensors monitor a host of factors that assess City operations and life such as air quality, noise, city services and traffic. Further, the sensors have “gone mobile” with announcements of situation aware mobile sensor platforms designed for city-level security and public safety. These wearable sensor platforms combine video, audio, and location data with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities. However, the many sensors and functional platforms have not yet made the cities employing these many diverse sensors truly Smart. We are analyzing why the success toward the Smart city is limited, or late in coming. The explanations for the constrained effectiveness are assigned to many factors, but one of significance can be teased from a long-accepted explanation that associates data, information, and knowledge. Smart Cities need to effectively use the sensor data and the information assembled from these interpreted and organized data to create knowledge that serves the city and its people by answering and resolving key problems and questions. But the systems and analytic models needed to associate these data from many sensors have yet to be designed, constructed, and proven in the complex cities of today. Thus, the data (and information from the diverse sensors) lacks crucial integration and coordination for decisions and sense-making. While these sensor-based systems were, and in many cases are meeting some intended functionally discrete goals, they appear to be better described as data collection tools feeding centralized analytical engines. They are point solutions with specialized or targeted sensors feeding specialized solutions. This is a significant limiting factor in a city's drive to improve the quality of life and the efficiency of the services a city provides to its stakeholders. In this paper we present current trends in Smart City development, emerging issues with data and complexity growth, and proposes a mean to leverage the advancing technologies to address the integration problem.},

abstract = {Recently, the deployment of various Internet of Things (IoT) sensors has encouraged smart cities to accumulate a large volume of data. When machine learning models utilize such accumulated raw data to predict events and situations, various systems of a smart city, such as traffic accident management systems, can be further developed by utilizing the predicted events and situations. However, although there has been a large volume of various IoT raw data on smart cities, such data do not have labels that are related to events or situations. Data with meaningful labels are required for the training of the models. Because these sensor data do not have meaningful labels, the data cannot be utilized into the models. There are several existing methods for labeling, but they have different drawbacks. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of utilizing social media messages to extract meaningful labels for machine learning to predict events and situations in smart city environments. As a case study, we compared the extracted labels from social media messages with the events and situations found in announced traffic news, and other articles. The results show that it is feasible to utilize social media messages as a source for meaningful labels of events and situations. We also propose an improved clustering algorithm using an outlier detection technique to extract meaningful labels in a more robust way. Furthermore, for other researchers who want to utilize the IoT raw data, we analyze and release the refined sensor data on which there were unknown noise.},

Conventional education system and work environments were now challenging but the show had to go on.With a sudden surge of requirement for online education, e-commerce and work from home, IT had a big role to play. While we had the doctors and policemen at fore front, IT was the backbone of all the systems up and running.Cloud technology has had a major role in making sure that the world continues even from the comfort of our homes. Cloud migration became the no. 1 priority even for companies which were not planning migration. Businesses were now looking for resiliency, High Availability and Load balancing for a seamless customer experience.Amongst all this chaos and complexity of managing work and education, countries and cities also had to control the spread of the deadly virus. With number of infected increasing on the graph, it became the focus area for the government to control the spread.Major issues faced by countries during the pandemic:1. Maintaining social distance to limit the contact with others.2. With the number of infected cases increasing, hospitals were short of beds, oxygen and other resources.3. Since doctors, policemen had to be at the forefront too were at the risk of getting infected.4. Contamination and spread of virus at public places like hospitals, stations, airports etc.5. Surface contamination at such public places where the infected person might have touched.},

abstract = {Transportation agencies often own extensive networks of monocular traffic cameras, which are typically used for traffic monitoring. However, the information captured by such cameras can also be of great value for transportation planning and operations applications, particularly when large data sets may be systematically analyzed. In this paper, we propose an approach to use data collected by existing monitoring cameras to automatically identify locations where pedestrian safety may be a concern. Our methodology utilizes a convolutional-neural-network-based method to recognize pedestrians in traffic camera feeds. Results are stored and aggregated, and may be queried for further analyses. The proposed computational approach may leverage hardware such as GPUs and distributed computing clusters to enable the analysis of large volumes of data. The post recognition analysis utilizes unsupervised learning methods to identify the spatial and temporal patterns of pedestrian positions, which are then correlated to specific scenarios such as usage of crosswalk, compliance with traffic signals, and pedestrian-vehicle interactions. Applications include the identification of potential safety concerns, measuring the effectiveness of proposed safety strategies, and identifying the need for improvements. This work provides preliminary results based on data from cameras owned by the City of Austin. We also discuss outputs such as pedestrian volume estimation and crossing hot-zones identification in the context of Smart Cities, and identify potential challenges and limitations.},

However, serious security problems arise with this development with more and more smart devices collecting private information under smart city scenario. In this article, we investigate the task of detecting insiders’ anomalous behaviors to prevent urban big data leakage. Specifically, we characterize a user's daily activities from four perspectives and use several deep learning algorithms (long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional LSTM (convLSTM)) to calculate deviations between realistic actions and normalcy of daily behaviors and use multilayer perceptron (MLP) to identify abnormal behaviors according to those deviations. To evaluate the proposed multimodel-based system (MBS), we conducted experiments on the CERT (United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team) dataset. The experimental results show that our proposed MBS has a remarkable ability to learn the normal pattern of users’ daily activities and detect anomalous behaviors.},

abstract = {In order to provide individuals with restricted mobility the opportunity to travel more efficiently, various systems have proposed modeling techniques and routing algorithms that handle accessible navigation through the built environment which is otherwise dotted with mobility barriers. Such systems use data gathered from smartphone sensors or crowd-sourcing to pinpoint the location of the barriers as well as the facilities, such as crosswalks with traffic signals or access ramps to curbs. Though the previous works have identified the type of surface and incline to be important features to determine accessibility, no extensive empirical research exists on how these parameters affect navigation. In order to address this problem, we propose to build a novel system called WheelShare, which uses machine learning to classify surfaces into accessible or otherwise and uses that knowledge to generate accessible routes for wheelchair users. We have trained our system with accelerometer and gyroscope data obtained from 26 different surfaces found frequently in indoor and outdoor environments across Europe and USA. More data is collected by the system through crowd-sourcing based contribution from interested users. Our evaluation shows that WheelShare can achieve an accuracy of up to 96% in identifying surfaces in one of the 5 different accessibility classes. Overall, WheelShare is a novel, scalable and data-centric approach to objectively identify the accessible features of a surface and can generate end-to-end routes for wheelchair users using frequently updated crowd-sourced information.},

abstract = {In the last years, the concept of Cognitive Smart City (CSC) emerged from the convergence of the Internet of Things, big data, smart city technologies, and artificial intelligence techniques. At the same time, computational argumentation has consolidated itself as a vibrant area in Artificial Intelligence (AI) which has engineered different approaches to reflect aspects of how humans build, exchange and analyze arguments in their daily lives, mainly to deal with controversial or inconsistent information. Thus, computational argumentation provides a valuable metaphor for reasoning on top of available data in order to draw conclusions and offer explanations for them. This paper discusses a first approach towards integrating computational argumentation in a layered model for cognitive cities, where the bottom layers comprise raw data collected from sensor, actuators and other artifacts deployed in the context of a smart city, and argumentation provides high-level intelligence abilities. We show how our approach can be paired with a layered model for computational argumentation. To illustrate our proposal, we analyze a case study, based on the DECIDE 2.0 framework.},

abstract = {Deep-learning-based intelligent services have become prevalent in cyber-physical applications including smart cities and health-care. Deploying deep-learning-based intelligence near the end-user enhances privacy protection, responsiveness, and reliability. Resource-constrained end-devices must be carefully managed in order to meet the latency and energy requirements of computationally-intensive deep learning services. Collaborative end-edge-cloud computing for deep learning provides a range of performance and efficiency that can address application requirements through computation offloading. The decision to offload computation is a communication-computation co-optimization problem that varies with both system parameters (e.g., network condition) and workload characteristics (e.g., inputs). On the other hand, deep learning model optimization provides another source of tradeoff between latency and model accuracy. An end-to-end decision-making solution that considers such computation-communication problem is required to synergistically find the optimal offloading policy and model for deep learning services. To this end, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based computation offloading solution that learns optimal offloading policy considering deep learning model selection techniques to minimize response time while providing sufficient accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for edge devices in an end-edge-cloud system and evaluate with a real-setup implementation using multiple AWS and ARM core configurations. Our solution provides 35% speedup in the average response time compared to the state-of-the-art with less than 0.9% accuracy reduction, demonstrating the promise of our online learning framework for orchestrating DL inference in end-edge-cloud systems.},

However, in the IoT system, while information exchange and communication, wireless sensor network devices may not be able to resist all forms of attacks, which may lead to security issues such as user data disclosure. Aiming at the information security risks in smart city, the typical technologies in IoT is analyzed from the perspective of IoT perception layer and provides corresponding security solutions for the existing security threats. Regarding the communication security, the emerging wireless technology, long range (LoRa), is discussed, and the performance of wireless communication protocol is analyzed through simulation experiments, to verify that the IoT technology based on LoRa communication technology can improve the security of the system in the construction of smart city. The results show that REBEB, a new backoff algorithm, is similar to the binary exponential backoff algorithm in terms of throughput performance. REBEB focuses more on fairness, which is up to 0.985, and to a certain extent, its security is significantly improved. The fairness of REBEB algorithm is more than 0.4 in different nodes and competing windows, and the fairness of the system is better when the number of nodes is small. To sum up, the IoT system based on LoRa communication can effectively improve the security performance of the system in the construction of smart city and avoid the security threats in the IoT signal transmission.},

Meanwhile, the ubiquitous deployments of IoT are raising the importance of processing data in real-time at the edge of networks rather than in remote cloud data centers. Based on above, edge computing has been proposed to exploit the capabilities of edge devices in providing in-proximity computing services for various IoT applications. In this paper, we present UrbanEdge, a conceptual edge computing architecture empowered by deep learning for urban IoT time series prediction. We design a hierarchical architecture to process correlated IoT time series and illustrate the work-flow of UrbanEdge in data collection, data transmission and data processing. As a core component of UrbanEdge, a deep learning model is developed with attention-based recurrent neural networks. Composed with multiple processing layers, the deep learning model can extract feature representations from raw IoT data for monitoring and prediction. We evaluate the designed deep learning model of UrbanEdge on real-world datasets, evaluation results show that the UrbanEdge outperforms other baseline methods in time series prediction.},

However, the recent advancement in machine learning techniques promises new deeper insights with the possibility of finding new spatio-temporal patterns in cities. In this paper, we show that one of the recent advancements in machine learning, Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), can discover a new type of pattern, which we refer to in the paper as the Socio-demographic Regional Pattern. This pattern illustrates the ability of predicting the district of a city given a set of weekly activities captured from LBSNs. Specifically, we have found instances of this embedded pattern for the boroughs in New York City by training a DBN model that can classify with nearly 70% accuracy the location of weekly region-footprints. We further validated the existence and complexity of this type of pattern by applying a probabilistic topic model, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We believe that this research can yield to a deeper understanding about social commonalities and the geographical evolution of different regions and areas, between cities across the globe.},

abstract = {Since 2014, a growing body of critical research has pointed out flaws in smart city development. It has been described as too technology-led and business-oriented, diminishing citizens' agency and causing digital divides. As the agenda keeps spreading, there is an urgent need to develop more participatory, inclusive and bottom-up approaches to balance interests of those currently in strong power positions, such as large corporations. Participatory design (PD) and participatory approaches in general have been suggested as a remedy, but they often tend to be local, small-scale and short-term. Therefore, their impacts are often modest as well. We suggest that we need to start thinking about ways to create scalable approaches that would grow the temporal and spatial impact of actions and practices that intend to increase citizens' understanding and control over new technologies, i.e. their technological agency. Without making sure that more people have adequate knowledge and sufficient control and mastery of technologies, societal discussion and ultimately, political decisions, are left to few experts. We explore the potential of public libraries to act as an ally and cooperation partner in participatory design and technology education in general, with a significant potential to broaden micro-level actions' impact.The paper consists of a broad literature review mapping the central challenges of current smart city development; this is followed with an introduction to the Finnish library system as a democratic project; finally, we present three examples of how libraries are carrying out technological education connected to emerging technologies, particularly to 3D printing, robotics and virtual reality. Our central argument is that there is a need to bridge micro-level actions, such as those connected to participatory design projects, with the macro-level technopolitical development by collaborating with meso-level actors and networks.},

abstract = {The objective of the study is to investigate the efficient packet transfer among vehicles in the smart city. With the evolution of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication is becoming more prominent for safety and non-safety related applications. The V2V communication facilitates vehicles to interconnect with each other to support numerous applications that will be highly helpful for drivers and passenger's welfare. However, due to the extreme dynamic nature of transportation, the Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) faces many challenges for transferring information among vehicles. Therefore, efficient clustering and dynamic routing are becoming a supreme area of improvement to increase the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and reduce the End-to-End delay for data transfer. In order to overcome the major obstacle, in this paper, we propose an intelligent self-learning approach-based hybrid clustering by integrating Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and dynamic Dijkstra routing for packet transfer between vehicles. Also, experiments were carried out to support the data transfer with the help of drones to provide higher coverage in high dynamic vehicle mobility scenarios. The proposed algorithm is modeled, trained, and tested for performance evaluations metrics such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End to End delay, CH selection delay.},

abstract = {Infrastructure maintenance requires extensive financial and human resources, and a lack of these resources---and, in particular, a shortage of experts---is a problem in many countries and regions around the world. In response to such circumstances, there is considerable research on infrastructure damage-detection methods using camera images and machine-learning. However, even if a large number of damaged parts are found using such methods, the decision whether to repair damaged areas is nevertheless determined empirically, by taking into account several factors such as road statistics and the regional characteristics. For these reasons, the current situation is that municipalities that lack experts cannot make comprehensive decisions regarding repairs.Therefore, in this research, we extracted maintenance management standards and automated decision-making using the decisions made by local government officials regarding damaged roads in Japan. We focused on roads, because roads are considered to be one of the most influential infrastructure. In order to do so, we cooperated with six municipalities in Japan. We combined statistical information regarding damaged roads with regional characteristics. As a result, in a very understandable way, we were then able to reproduce the decisions made by experts with an accuracy of 0.75. Our research has the potential to enable automated decision-making in the future.},

These principles have implications in social equity and the future of technology management in smart cities projects. Principle implementation involves the collaboration of different agencies, particularly focused on ethics and human rights supporting sustainable development.This work is part of emergent strategies for a new generation of city services based on data and information, which aim to improve civic engagement, social benefits to communities in city neighborhoods and better collaboration with partners and other government agencies.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview on Data Mining (DM) technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT has become an active area of research, since IoT promises among other to improve quality of live and safety in Smart Cities, to make resource supply and waste management more efficient, and optimize traffic. DM is highly domain specific and depends on what is being mined for. For instance, if IoT is used to optimize traffic in a Smart City to reduce traffic jams and to find parking spaces quicker, different types of data needs to be collected and analysed from an eHealth solution, where IoT is used in a Smart Home to monitor the well being of patients or elderly people. IoT connects things that can collect numeric data from smart sensors, streaming data from cameras or route information on maps. Depending on the type of data, different techniques need to be adopted to analyse them. Also, many IoT applications analyse data from different devices and correlate them to make predictions about possible machine failures in production sites or looming emergency situations in Smart Buildings in a home security application. DM techniques need to handle the heterogeneity of IoT data, the large volumes of data and the speed at which they are produced. This paper explores the state of the art DM techniques for IoT.},

abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence have driven increasing intelligent applications at the network edge, such as smart home, smart factory, and smart city. To deploy computationally intensive Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices, traditional approaches have relied on either offloading workload to the remote cloud or optimizing computation at the end device locally. However, the cloud-assisted approaches suffer from the unreliable and delay-significant wide-area network, and the local computing approaches are limited by the constrained computing capability. Towards high-performance edge intelligence, the cooperative execution mechanism offers a new paradigm, which has attracted growing research interest recently. In this paper, we propose CoEdge, a distributed DNN computing system that orchestrates cooperative DNN inference over heterogeneous edge devices. CoEdge utilizes available computation and communication resources at the edge and dynamically partitions the DNN inference workload adaptive to devices’ computing capabilities and network conditions. Experimental evaluations based on a realistic prototype show that CoEdge outperforms status-quo approaches in saving energy with close inference latency, achieving up to 25.5% ~ 66.9% energy reduction for four widely-adopted CNN models.},

abstract = { IoT systems grow quickly and are massively present in urban areas. Their successful deployment requires autonomy that can be built on automated learning technologies such as Deep Learning. The IoT applications require important computational resources, rarely available on devices. Autonomous IoT systems require the computation power available on the edge and cloud servers in order to offload some tasks related to the supported applications and the underlying platforms. Task offloading constitutes a big challenge in autonomous IoT systems due to the huge number of IoT devices for scenarios of the family of smart cities. Managing task offloading in such contexts requires adaptive strategies capable of taking into consideration the rapid evolution of available resources and proposing efficient offloading solutions to all received requests. In this paper we use a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach capable of handling large state spaces, and resolve the optimization problem in this context, where other techniques can not scale efficiently. Our solution is based on a DRL agent that was developed in the ns3-gym framework and was tested on IoT system scenario implemented in the NS3 simulator. The results obtained show that the DRL agent can adapt quickly to resource evolution in the IoT system and can handle big number of demands fulfilling scalabilty requirements of autonomous IoT systems.},

The proposed system addresses the challenges related to GPS outage, unknown schedule and stoppages of buses, and unavailability of real time traffic information along the bus-route. The system is evaluated using multiple-trip data collected over a 32 kilometer long route during the peak and off-peak hour traffic conditions. The bus-stop detection accuracy of 75% (6 out of 8 bus-stops are accurately detected) could be achieved using an arbitrary set of trips conducted over the route. The arrival time prediction error of 7% (5 minutes) has been reported. The scalability assessment of the system shows that it can support the transit of more than ten thousand buses and over one million subscribers/commuters.},

abstract = {Smart City is one of the vital issues in the next coming years as it is estimated that more number of people will be migrating towards city and by 2040 cities is populated by 70% of the world's population. This will give raise to the city management problems like traffic congestion, parking queues, capacity planning and continuous depreciation in energy. Hence there is a need to understand the upcoming issues and find an efficient way to resolve them by resource planning.The evolution of city to Smart City demand information and communications technology (ICT) to gather data. The data is collected based on city infrastructure and conduct of people in the city. This big data is analyzed to make knowledgeable decisions to give quality of life to the citizens. It is referred as the evolution of intelligent city to the next generation city of information technology. ICT provides real time processing of data to gather useful information. Based on this information visual applications can be developed to have a more farsighted view of the Smart City. Online banking, online shopping and remote video communication are some of the applications of Smart City.As one of the concepts to improve city structure and its facilities, Smart City is vital in city management and development and uses information and communication technology (ICT) for city evolution and fast growth. These cities are planned to enhance more business and industrial growth thus increasing in economic development and raising living standard of the inhabitants [1]. It offers various facilities to the city like better transportation in the city, more job opportunities, less travelling time, healthy environment, better healthcare, less crime etc.Smart City is a concept which works with sensors and data analytics to enhance the standard and quality of life in the cities. Smart City deals with the challenges like traffic, parking, capacity planning, energy etc. and resolves them to provide better city facilities to their citizens [2]. ICT is becoming widespread in the cities and is being used as a tool to deal with Smart City application domains. Smart City is using big data to generate intelligent information systems which support decision making capabilities. With effective data sources and data analytics tool we can design high end services for the citizens in urban cities. Big data has changed the way we store data and process the data efficiently. Now this crucial data is not only used to get the historic trends information but also used to predict the future. It is significant in planning the future of the cities. Data is analyzed to develop action plans from the predicted results.In this paper, various datasets for traffic management and parking garage management have been tested and evaluated by using data analytics techniques in order to find a pattern in a historical information. Based on this research this information is further analyzed by machine learning tools and algorithms to predict the future behavior and help on taking decision. Machine learning and Analytics tools for Data Analytics from Hadoop and Elasticsearch environments as well as Mining algorithms from Python library are used for data prediction.This paper gives us the details of some domain applications of Smart City listed as below:• Smart City Traffic Management• Smart City Parking Management.},

Unfortunately, deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices presents significant challenges. These workloads are computationally intensive and often require cloud-like resources. Prior solutions attempted to address these challenges by either introducing more design efforts or by relying on cloud resources for assistance.In this paper, we propose a runtime adaptive convolutional neural network (CNN) acceleration framework that is optimized for heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The framework leverages spatial partitioning techniques through fusion of the convolution layers and dynamically selects the optimal degree of parallelism according to the availability of computational resources, as well as network conditions. Our evaluation shows that our framework outperforms state-of-art approaches by improving the inference speed and reducing communication costs while running on wirelessly-connected Raspberry-Pi3 devices. Experimental evaluation shows up to 1.9x ~ 3.7x speedup using 8 devices for three popular CNN models.},

abstract = {The problem, the solution of which the paper is devoted to, is an assessment of the cybersecurity risks of large-scale dynamic networks of smart city (IoT, IIoT, MANET, VANET) in the current situation of cyber threats. Analysis of relevant cyber threats for such systems showed that the main threats are those aimed at disrupting the management processes of enterprises, urban infrastructure, and not at stealing personal data. As a result of a detailed review of existing risk assessment methods, it was found that traditional cyber-risk analysis strategies developed for static computer networks do not meet the requirements and cannot be directly applied in the construction and evaluation of heterogeneous, flexible, reconfigurable information systems based on dynamic networks. In this paper, the author proposes a neural network approach to assessing cybersecurity risks, based on a quantitative assessment and takes into account the use of a large number of devices and their constant interaction. A three-layer perceptron was chosen as a model of a neural network, datasets were generated synthetically using a network simulator NS-3. Experimental results showed that the neural network model proposed by the author allows for rapidly changing conditions to unambiguously and reasonably assess the risks of cybersecurity. The developed risk assessment method is comprehensive and adapted to various types of objects in large dynamic networks of a smart city.},

abstract = {As an alternative means of convenient and smart transportation, mobility-on-demand (MOD), typified by online ride-sharing and connected taxicabs, has been rapidly growing and spreading worldwide. The large volume of complex traffic and the uncertainty of market supplies/demands have made it essential for many MOD service providers to proactively dispatch vehicles towards ride-seekers. To meet this need effectively, we propose STRide, an MOD coordination-learning mechanism reinforced spatio-temporally with capsules. We formalize the adaptive coordination of vehicles into a reinforcement learning framework. STRide incorporates spatial and temporal distributions of supplies (vehicles) and demands (ride requests), customers' preferences and other external factors. A novel spatio-temporal capsule neural network is designed to predict the provider's rewards based on MOD network states, vehicles and their dispatch actions. This way, the MOD platform adapts itself to the supply-demand dynamics with the best potential rewards. We have conducted extensive data analytics and experimental evaluation with three large-scale datasets (~ 21 million rides from Uber, Yellow Taxis and Didi). STRide is shown to outperform state-of-the-arts, substantially reducing request-rejection rate and passenger waiting time, and also increasing the service provider's profits, often making 30% improvement over state-of-the-arts.},

abstract = {Smart and connected traffic intersections are a key component of the smart city idea. These intersections will be equipped with dynamic street and traffic lights, traffic analysis, anomaly detection, and other "smart" features, contributing towards solving various energy, safety, and congestion problems. The objective of this paper is to lay out a process for utilizing deep learning technologies to develop a smart traffic flow for cities. With the increase in accurate deep learning video analytic models, we propose developing multiple object detection and tracking solutions for traffic video analytics. One key challenge is that the detection results from each video frame are not associated with each other, thus causing the traffic tracking to be lack continuity. To solve this problem, we propose a Deep Associated Elastic Tracker (DAE-Tracker) that performs multi-stage object association and tracking for various deeplearning based detectors. We tested our solution with multiple deep learning models under different datasets. We also deployed our system on the roof of our engineering building and contributed our own dataset.},

abstract = {Action knowledge graphs can play a central role in smart cities, smart homes, robot planning, and so on. This is since both of the subject and the object of the actions can add more meaningful information for the higher-level application than the action alone as a predicate. We built a system that generates the action knowledge graphs from video using deep learning. Especially, we propose an algorithm which perceives the interaction between hand and object by measuring the proximity between them with considering the direction of fingers. We showed that this approach achieves the performance of 83% in accuracy using the Stair Lab data.},

abstract = {The advancements in sensor technology and ubiquity of connected devices has enabled the generation of large volume of disparate, dynamic and geographically distributed data both by scientific communities and citizens. With astonishing technological innovations and convergence, there have been major changes in peoples daily activities and social interaction. The socio-technological innovations motivate the concept of smart and connected cities. A smart city, however, is subjected to the same challenges as a conventional city, such as environmental damages, hazard impacts, access to services and resources, due to continuous population and economic growth. Therefore, it is imperative to improve our understanding of Resilient and Intelligent Cities in order to leverage technologies and artificial intelligence to tackle the challenges cities face, which range from climate change, public health, traffic congestion, economic growth, to digital divide, social equity, political movements, and cultural conflicts, among others.},
