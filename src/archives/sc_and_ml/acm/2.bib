abstract = {Vehicle flow estimation has many potential smart cities and transportation applications. Many cities have existing camera networks which broadcast image feeds; however, the resolution and frame-rate are too low for existing computer vision algorithms to accurately estimate flow. In this work, we present a computer vision and deep learning framework for vehicle tracking. We demonstrate a novel tracking pipeline which enables accurate flow estimates in a range of environments under low resolution and frame-rate constraints. We demonstrate that our system is able to track vehicles in New York City's traffic camera video feeds at 1 Hz or lower frame-rate, and produces higher traffic flow accuracy than popular open source tracking frameworks.},

As smart technologies rely heavily on such computational capabilities their sustainability is pivotal for a smart future. This paper explores the literature to: identify the problems; categorize the challenges as well as possible solutions; explore how simulation and machine learning can improve computational sustainability; and consider the need to conduct trade-off analysis to determine when to apply simulation and machine learning benefits.

This system collects the real-time temperature inside the refrigeration implement, record the information of products and enhance function of refrigerators through the application of Internet of Things technology to facilitate people in managing their refrigerated and frozen groceries smartly. The proposed system is divided into two parts, On-board sub-system and Internet based sub-system. An Arduino Leonardo board is used in onboard sub-system to control other components including low power machine vision OpenMV module, temperature &amp; Humidity sensor, and GY-302 light intensity sensor. OpenMV camera module is used for recognizing types of food, reading barcodes and OCR (optical character recognition) through convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm and tesseract-ocr. The food type identification model is trained by the deep learning framework Caffe. GY-302 light intensity sensor works as a switch of camera module. DHT11 sensor is used to monitor the environmental information inside the freezer. The internet based sub-system works on the things network. It saves the information and uploads it from onboard sub-system and works as an interface to food suppliers.

abstract = {The global urbanization imposes unprecedented pressure on urban infrastructure and public resources. The population explosion has made it challenging to satisfy the daily needs of urban residents. 'Smart City' is a solution that utilizes different types of data collection sensors to help manage assets and resources intelligently and more efficiently. Under the Smart City umbrella, the primary research initiative in improving the efficiency of car-hailing services is to predict the citywide passenger demand to address the imbalance between the demand and supply. However, predicting the passenger demand requires analysis on various data such as historical passenger demand, crowd outflow, and weather information, and it remains challenging to discover the latent relationships among these data. To address this challenge, we propose to improve the passenger demand prediction via learning the salient spatial-temporal dynamics within a reinforcement learning framework. Our model employs an information selection mechanism to focus on the most distinctive data in historical observations. This mechanism can automatically adjust the information zone according to the prediction performance to find the optimal choice. It also ensures the prediction model to take full advantage of the available data by introducing the positive and excluding the negative correlations. We have conducted experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset that covers 1.5 million people in a major city in China. The results show our model outperforms state-of-the-art and a series of baselines by a large margin.},

abstract = {The construction of a smart city needs to be supported by good machine learning methods, random forest is a kind of technology which has been widely applied in dealing with regression or classification problems. The difficult points to be solved include how to set random forest parameters. The number of subtrees and samples will affect the performance of the algorithm to a great extent. This paper proposes a forest parameter optimization method based on firework algorithm (FWA-RF). By using its explosion, mutation and selection mechanisms, the parameters are adjusted in self-adaptive man-ner to avoid falling into a local optimal state. Through the comparative experiments on 15 UCI databases, the accuracy of the improved algorithm is higher than that of the original RF classification by 1.55% to 26.67%, and is superior to decision tree, Bagging, Adaboost as well as RF based on genetic algorithm. The results indicate that this method can effectively find the range of effective adjustment parameters, make parameter optimization and adjustment easier, and provide technical support for the creation of smart city.},

abstract = {The recent breakthrough of artificial intelligence, as well as the wide adoption of the wisdom of the crowd, also known as collective intelligence, across sectors, has received attention and excitement across disciplines. In addition to the scientific breakthrough, recent public sector studies recognize AI's potential contributions in public services, such as big data for decision making, the development of smart cities, and social and health care. Studies have also recognized crowdsourcing's potential for service provisions, innovation, information generation, and policymaking. However, we have only a limited understanding of the connections between these two types of intelligence and adoption conditions to properly utilize them for the public sector. To understand what roles AI and crowds can play in enhancing public services and policymaking, we adopt a bibliometric analysis to identify emerging themes and interconnections between these two streams of literature. Our study provides key themes and significance for each cluster. Our first examination of AI and crowd literature regarding connection to public values, complementary in public decision making, as well as future potential for joint adoption by governments provides some implications for future considerations.},

abstract = {Using deep reinforcement learning, we successfully train a set of two autonomous vehicles to lead a fleet of vehicles onto a round-about and then transfer this policy from simulation to a scaled city without fine-tuning. We use Flow, a library for deep reinforcement learning in microsimulators, to train two policies, (1) a policy with noise injected into the state and action space and (2) a policy without any injected noise. In simulation, the autonomous vehicles learn an emergent metering behavior for both policies which allows smooth merging. We then directly transfer this policy without any tuning to the University of Delaware's Scaled Smart City (UDSSC), a 1:25 scale testbed for connected and automated vehicles. We characterize the performance of the transferred policy based on how thoroughly the ramp metering behavior is captured in UDSSC. We show that the noise-free policy results in severe slowdowns and only, occasionally, it exhibits acceptable metering behavior. On the other hand, the noise-injected policy consistently performs an acceptable metering behavior, implying that the noise eventually aids with the zero-shot policy transfer. Finally, the transferred, noise-injected policy leads to a 5% reduction of average travel time and a reduction of 22% in maximum travel time in the UDSSC.

Among them, the distance-based data streams anomaly detection algorithm is well received by researchers because it can adapt well to the infinite growth of data streams. However, the existing distance-based detection algorithm needs to manually estimate the specific value of the detection threshold parameter according to the historical data, which seriously affects the detection efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, this paper introduces the extreme value theory and proposes a data streams anomaly detection algorithm based on self-set threshold with extreme value theory (ESOD).The algorithm can not only automatically set the detection threshold, but also update the threshold in real time according to the detection data to adapt to the data streams environment of concept drift. After theoretical analysis and experimental verification, ESOD algorithm has good usability and high efficiency.},

abstract = {The size of sensor networks supporting smart cities is ever increasing. Sensor network resiliency becomes vital for critical networks such as emergency response and waste water treatment. One approach is to engineer “self-aware” sensors that can proactively change their component composition in response to changes in work load when critical devices fail. By extension, these devices could anticipate their own termination, such as battery depletion, and offload current tasks onto connected devices. These neighboring devices can then reconfigure themselves to process these tasks, thus avoiding catastrophic network failure. In this article, we compare and contrast two types of self-aware sensors. One set uses Q-learning to develop a policy that guides device reaction to various environmental stimuli, whereas the others use a set of shallow neural networks to select an appropriate reaction. The novelty lies in the use of field programmable gate arrays embedded on the sensors that take into account internal system state, configuration, and learned state-action pairs, which guide device decisions to meet system demands. Experiments show that even relatively simple reward functions develop both Q-learning policies and shallow neural networks that yield positive device behaviors in dynamic environments.},

abstract = {In light of the rapid progress in building smart cities and smart traffic systems, the need for an accurate and real-time counting vehicles system has become a very urgent need. Finding a robust and accurate counting system is a challenge, as the system must detect, classify and track multi vehicles in complex and dynamic scene situations, different models and classes, and various traffic densities. Several hardware and software systems have emerged for this purpose and their results have varied. In recent years, and due to the great growth in computational capacities and deep learning techniques, deep learning based vehicle counting systems have delivered an impressive performance at low costs. In this study, several state-of-the-art detection and tracking algorithms are studied and combined with each other to render different models. These models are applied in automatic vehicle counting frameworks in traffic videos to assess how accurate are their results against the ground truth. Experiments on these models present the existing challenges that hinder their ability to extract the distinctive object features and thus undermine their efficiency such as problems of occlusion, large scale objects detection, illumination, and various weather conditions. The study revealed that the detectors coupled with the Deep Sort tracker, such as YOLOv4, Detectron2 and CenterNet, achieved the best results compared to the rest of the models.},

abstract = {Video analytics systems based on deep learning approaches are becoming the basis of many widespread applications including smart cities to aid people and traffic monitoring. These systems necessitate massive amounts of labeled data and training time to perform fine tuning of hyper-parameters for object classification. We propose a cloud based video analytics system built upon an optimally tuned deep learning model to classify objects from video streams. The tuning of the hyper-parameters including learning rate, momentum, activation function and optimization algorithm is optimized through a mathematical model for efficient analysis of video streams. The system is capable of enhancing its own training data by performing transformations including rotation, flip and skew on the input dataset making it more robust and self-adaptive. The use of in-memory distributed training mechanism rapidly incorporates large number of distinguishing features from the training dataset - enabling the system to perform object classification with least human assistance and external support. The validation of the system is performed by means of an object classification case-study using a dataset of 100GB in size comprising of 88,432 video frames on an 8 node cloud. The extensive experimentation reveals an accuracy and precision of 0.97 and 0.96 respectively after a training of 6.8 hours. The system is scalable, robust to classification errors and can be customized for any real-life situation.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things equips citizens with a phenomenal new means for online participation in sharing economies. When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning. This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections, accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies.},

Each adjustment in innovation gets better than ever, with old gadgets being supplanted and deserted. Such Electronic and Electrical Equipments (EEEs) that are disposed of by clients are named e-waste. EEEs are comprised of a large number of segments, some containing poisonous substances that affect human wellbeing and climate, if not handled appropriately. The volume of EEEs that is delivered all through the world, has driven governments in different nations to make severe arrangements, to guarantee effective removal of the created e-waste. This paper presents the utilization of ML (Machine Learning) for E-Waste Management framework with a center to build up a prescient model by contrasting the presentation of gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) and Neural Network (NN) ML calculations to gauge week by week e-wastage for every Urban sub-segments. Various information-driven strategies incorporate the current designed model and its alteration alongside regular machine learning calculations. The utilization of Machine Learning calculation gives improved arrangement exactness of 99.1 % when utilizing the best performing algorithm.

Improvements in deep neural networks imply extensive use of such models for analytics and inferencing on large volume of data, including sensor observations, images, speech. A growing need for such inferencing to be run on devices closer to the data sources, i.e. devices which reside at the edge of the network, popularly known as fog devices exists, in order to reduce the upstream network traffic. However, being computationally constrained in nature, executing complex deep inferencing models on such devices has been proved difficult. This has led to several new approaches to partition/distribute the computation and/or data over multiple fog devices. In this paper we propose a novel depth-wise input partitioning scheme for CNN models and experimentally prove that it achieves better performance compared to row/column or grid based schemes.},

abstract = {3D point cloud presentation has been widely used in computer vision, automatic driving, augmented reality, smart cities and virtual reality. 3D point cloud compression method with higher compression ratio and tiny loss is the key to improve data transportation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new 3D point cloud geometry compression method based on deep learning, also an auto-encoder performing better than other networks in detail reconstruction. It can reach much higher compression ratio than the state-of-art while keeping tolerable loss. It also supports parallel compressing multiple models by GPU, which can improve processing efficiency greatly. The compression process is composed of two parts. Firstly, Raw data is compressed into codeword by extracting feature of raw model with encoder. Then, the codeword is further compressed with sparse coding. Decompression process is implemented in reverse order. Codeword is recovered and fed into decoder to reconstruct point cloud. Detail reconstruction ability is improved by a hierarchical structure in our decoder. Latter outputs are grown from former fuzzier outputs. In this way, details are added to former output by latter layers step by step to make a more precise prediction. We compare our method with PCL compression and Draco compression on ShapeNet40 part dataset. Our method may be the first deep learning-based point cloud compression algorithm. The experiments demonstrate it is superior to former common compression algorithms with large compression ratio, which can also reserve original shapes with tiny loss.},

abstract = {Sustainable mobility is one of the main goals of both European and United Nations plans for 2030. The concept of Smart Cities has arisen as a way to achieve this goal by leveraging IoT interconnected devices to collect and analyse large quantities of data. However, several works have pointed out the importance of including the human factor, and in particular, citizens, to make sense of the collected data and ensure their engagement along the data value chain. This paper presents the design and implementation of two end-to-end hybrid human-machine workflows for solving two mobility problems: modal split estimation, and mapping mobility infrastructure. For modal split, we combine the use of i-Log, an app to collect data and interact with citizens, with reinforcement learning classifiers to continuously improve the accuracy of the classification, aiming at reducing the required interactions from citizens. For mobility infrastructure, we developed a system that uses remote crowdworkers to explore the city looking for Points of Interest, that is more scalable than sending agents on the field. Crowdsourced maps are then fused with existing maps (if available) to create a final map that then is validated on the field by citizens engaged through the i-Log app.},

abstract = {User authentication is a critical process in both corporate and home environments due to the ever-growing security and privacy concerns. With the advancement of smart cities and home environments, the concept of user authentication is evolved with a broader implication by not only preventing unauthorized users from accessing confidential information but also providing the opportunities for customized services corresponding to a specific user. Traditional approaches of user authentication either require specialized device installation or inconvenient wearable sensor attachment. This article supports the extended concept of user authentication with a device-free approach by leveraging the prevalent WiFi signals made available by IoT devices, such as smart refrigerator, smart TV, and smart thermostat, and so on. The proposed system utilizes the WiFi signals to capture unique human physiological and behavioral characteristics inherited from their daily activities, including both walking and stationary ones. Particularly, we extract representative features from channel state information (CSI) measurements of WiFi signals, and develop a deep-learning-based user authentication scheme to accurately identify each individual user. To mitigate the signal distortion caused by surrounding people’s movements, our deep learning model exploits a CNN-based architecture that constructively combines features from multiple receiving antennas and derives more reliable feature abstractions. Furthermore, a transfer-learning-based mechanism is developed to reduce the training cost for new users and environments. Extensive experiments in various indoor environments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed authentication system. In particular, our system can achieve over 94% authentication accuracy with 11 subjects through different activities.},

abstract = {Traffic flow analysis, prediction and management are keystones for building smart cities in the new era. With the help of deep neural networks and big traffic data, we can better understand the latent patterns hidden in the complex transportation networks. The dynamic of the traffic flow on one road not only depends on the sequential patterns in the temporal dimension but also relies on other roads in the spatial dimension. Although there are existing works on predicting the future traffic flow, the majority of them have certain limitations on modeling spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial temporal graph neural network for traffic flow prediction, which can comprehensively capture spatial and temporal patterns. In particular, the framework offers a learnable positional attention mechanism to effectively aggregate information from adjacent roads. Meanwhile, it provides a sequential component to model the traffic flow dynamics which can exploit both local and global temporal dependencies. Experimental results on various real traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Roads form a critical part of any region's infrastructure. Their constant monitoring and maintenance is thus essential. Traditional monitoring mechanisms are heavy-weight, and hence have insufficient coverage. In this paper, we explore the use of crowd-sourced intelligent measurements from commuters' smart-phone sensors. Specifically, we propose a deep-learning based approach to road surface quality monitoring, using accelerometer and GPS sensor readings. Through extensive data collection of over 36 hours on different kinds of roads, and subsequent evaluation based on this, we show that the approach can achieve high accuracy (98.5%) in a three-way classification of road surface quality. We also show how the classification can be extended to a finer grained 11-point scale of road quality. The model is also efficient: it can be implemented on today's smart-phones, thus making it practical. Our approach, called RoadCare, enables several useful smart-city applications such as spatio-temporal monitoring of the city's roads, early warning of bad road conditions, as well as choosing the "smoothest" road route to a destination.},

abstract = {User authentication is a critical process in both corporate and home environments due to the ever-growing security and privacy concerns. With the advancement of smart cities and home environments, the concept of user authentication is evolved with a broader implication by not only preventing unauthorized users from accessing confidential information but also providing the opportunities for customized services corresponding to a specific user. Traditional approaches of user authentication either require specialized device installation or inconvenient wearable sensor attachment. This paper supports the extended concept of user authentication with a device-free approach by leveraging the prevalent WiFi signals made available by IoT devices, such as smart refrigerator, smart TV and thermostat, etc. The proposed system utilizes the WiFi signals to capture unique human physiological and behavioral characteristics inherited from their daily activities, including both walking and stationary ones. Particularly, we extract representative features from channel state information (CSI) measurements of WiFi signals, and develop a deep learning based user authentication scheme to accurately identify each individual user. Extensive experiments in two typical indoor environments, a university office and an apartment, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed authentication system. In particular, our system can achieve over 94% and 91% authentication accuracy with 11 subjects through walking and stationary activities, respectively.},

abstract = {Taxi demand prediction is of much importance, which enables the building of intelligent systems and smart city. It is necessary to predict taxi demand accurately to schedule taxi fleet in a reasonable and efficient way and to reduce the pressure of traffic jam. However, the taxi demand involves complex and non-linear spatial-temporal impacts. The superiority of deep learning makes people explore the possibility to apply it to traffic prediction. State-of-the-art methods on taxi demand prediction only capture static spatial correlations between regions (e.g., Using static graph embedding) and only take taxi demand data into consideration. We propose a Multi-Task Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (MSTGAT-Net) framework which models the correlations between regions dynamically with graph-attention network and captures the correlation between taxi pick up and taxi drop off with multi-task training. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first paper to address the taxi demand prediction problem with graph attention network and multi-task learning. Experiments on real-world taxi data show that our model is superior to state-of-the-art methods.},

In some GPS-denied environments, accurate drone position cannot be obtained due to occlusion, multi-path interference and other factors. While understanding and localization the content of the images is vital for earth observation, map revision, multi-source image fusion, disaster relief, smart city and other applications. The progress of computer vision and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) in image processing provide a promising solution to locate UAVs aerial image and mapping to the large-scale reference image. Firstly, key localization techniques based on image retrieval-----image description, image matching and position mapping are summarized considering the characteristics of UAVs aerial images. And then, image localization based on extracting deep semantic features and image localization based on classification method by subdividing areas are recommended. Throughout this paper, we will have an insight into the prospect of the UAVs image localization and the challenges to be faced.},

abstract = {Ridehailing applications that collect mobility data from individuals to inform smart city planning predict each trip's fare pricing with automated algorithms that rely on artificial intelligence (AI). This type of AI algorithm, namely a price discrimination algorithm, is widely used in the industry's black box systems for dynamic individualized pricing. Lacking transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation providers publish anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the first large-scale measurement of the disparate impact of price discrimination algorithms used by ridehailing applications.The application of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature combines the city-level effects of AI bias on fare pricing from census tract attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey. An analysis of 100 million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from ridehailing utilization patterns associated with demographic attributes. Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations, higher poverty levels, younger residents, and high education levels are significantly associated with higher fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32, -0.28, 0.69, and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively. Further, our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing the sources of disparate impact in AI algorithms learning from datasets that contain U.S. geolocations.},

abstract = {Smart hospitals are important components of smart cities. An intelligent medical system for brain tumor segmentation is required to construct smart hospitals. To achieve intelligent brain tumor segmentation, morphological variety and serious category imbalance must be managed effectively. Conventional deep neural networks have difficulty in predicting high-accuracy segmentation images due to these issues. To solve these problems, we propose using multimodal brain tumor images combined with the UNET and LSTM models to construct a new network structure with a mixed loss function to solve sample imbalance and describe an intelligent segmentation process to identify brain tumors. To verify the practicability of this algorithm, we used the open source Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge dataset to train and verify the proposed network. We obtained DSCs of 0.91, 0.82, and 0.80; sensitivities of 0.93, 0.85, and 0.82; and specificities of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.98 in three tumor regions, including the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhanced tumor (ET). We also compared the results of the proposed network with those of other brain tumor segmentation methods, and the results showed that the proposed algorithm could segment different tumor lesions more accurately, highlighting its potential application value in the clinical diagnosis of brain tumors.},

abstract = {Urban flow monitoring systems play important roles in smart city efforts around the world. However, the ubiquitous deployment of monitoring devices, such as CCTVs, induces a long-lasting and enormous cost for maintenance and operation. This suggests the need for a technology that can reduce the number of deployed devices, while preventing the degeneration of data accuracy and granularity. In this paper, we aim to infer the real-time and fine-grained crowd flows throughout a city based on coarse-grained observations. This task is challenging due to the two essential reasons: the spatial correlations between coarse- and fine-grained urban flows, and the complexities of external impacts. To tackle these issues, we develop a method entitled UrbanFM based on deep neural networks. Our model consists of two major parts: 1) an inference network to generate fine-grained flow distributions from coarse-grained inputs by using a feature extraction module and a novel distributional upsampling module; 2) a general fusion subnet to further boost the performance by considering the influences of different external factors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance on this problem.},

abstract = {Sound event detection (SED) is a hot topic in consumer and smart city applications. Existing approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs) are very effective, but highly demanding in terms of memory, power, and throughput when targeting ultra-low power always-on devices.Latency, availability, cost, and privacy requirements are pushing recent IoT systems to process the data on the node, close to the sensor, with a very limited energy supply, and tight constraints on the memory size and processing capabilities precluding to run state-of-the-art DNNs.In this paper, we explore the combination of extreme quantization to a small-footprint binary neural network (BNN) with the highly energy-efficient, RISC-V-based (8+1)-core GAP8 microcontroller. Starting from an existing CNN for SED whose footprint (815 kB) exceeds the 512 kB of memory available on our platform, we retrain the network using binary filters and activations to match these memory constraints. (Fully) binary neural networks come with a natural drop in accuracy of 12-18% on the challenging ImageNet object recognition challenge compared to their equivalent full-precision baselines. This BNN reaches a 77.9% accuracy, just 7% lower than the full-precision version, with 58 kB (7.2\texttimes{} less) for the weights and 262 kB (2.4\texttimes{} less) memory in total. With our BNN implementation, we reach a peak throughput of 4.6 GMAC/s and 1.5 GMAC/s over the full network, including preprocessing with Mel bins, which corresponds to an efficiency of 67.1 GMAC/s/W and 31.3 GMAC/s/W, respectively. Compared to the performance of an ARM Cortex-M4 implementation, our system has a 10.3\texttimes{} faster execution time and a 51.1\texttimes{} higher energy-efficiency.},

abstract = {With the development of low-cost, low-power sensing and communication technologies, there has been growing interest in the IoT for realizing smart cities, in order to maximize the productivity and reliability of urban infrastructure. One of the most representative examples is smart parking system, which consists of parking sensors and backend servers. In existing systems, parking sensors are placed in each parking spot to monitor the status of the parking spot, and then the sensing data is send to backend servers for further processing. Based on these sensor data, the smart parking system can provide some smart services, such as parking spot availability prediction, remote booking and parking guidance. The premise of all these smart services is that the sensor data is accurate and reliable. However, as the sensor ages, the sensor may produce some unreliable data, which brings great challenges to our smart services. In this paper, we present a novel anomaly detection and calibration system in "Suzhou Center", one of the largest most advanced urban complexes in China. Our system uses supervised machine learning algorithms, focusing on capturing spatio-temporal features. The experimental results show that our system can identify most anomalies and improve the accuracy of the sensor.},

Traditional centralized learning frameworks require uploading all training data from different sources to a remote data server, which incurs significant communication overhead, service latency, and privacy issues.To further extend the frontiers of the learning paradigm, a new learning concept, namely, Edge Learning (EL) is emerging. It is complementary to the cloud-based methods for big data analytics by enabling distributed edge nodes to cooperatively training models and conduct inferences with their locally cached data. To explore the new characteristics and potential prospects of EL, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent research efforts on EL. Specifically, we first introduce the background and motivation. We then discuss the challenging issues in EL from the aspects of data, computation, and communication. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the enabling technologies for EL, including model training, inference, security guarantee, privacy protection, and incentive mechanism. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities on EL. We believe that this survey will provide a comprehensive overview of EL and stimulate fruitful future research in this field.},

abstract = {In smart cities, green cellular networks play a crucial role to support wireless access for numerous devices anywhere and anytime with efficiency and sustainability. Because base stations (BSes) consume more than 70% of overall cellular network infrastructure energy, saving the power consumption of BSes is the key task to build a green cellular network. Except for low power design of the BS hardware and software, the traffic-driven BS sleeping operation is an economical way to improve existing cellular networks, which can reduce the BS power consumption at low traffic load. However, prior BS sleeping strategies establish on the static temporal characteristics of traffic load, which ignore the fact that network traffic is influenced by many factors such as time, human mobility, holiday, weather, etc. Hence, prior traffic estimation is coarse, and the BS sleeping strategies cannot apply to the changing network traffic. In this paper, we exploit a machine learning method to estimate the BS traffic and propose a BS sleeping strategy based on predicted traffic for power saving in the cellular network. We analyze network traffic in multi-views: temporal influence, spatial influence, and event influence. Then, we propose a multi-view ensemble learning model to predict network traffic load, which learns the traffic in multi-views and combine the results with ensemble. Furthermore, we formulate a BS sleeping strategy based on the predicted traffic load. Finally, we evaluate our traffic prediction algorithm on real cellular network data. The evaluation shows that our traffic prediction algorithm improves about 40% than state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Also, we evaluate the proposed BS sleeping strategy, which yields about 10% more energy savings and less device damage than the competitors in the simulated environment.},

abstract = {High crime rates have become a public health problem in many important cities, according to World Health Organization. Many researchers have been developing algorithms to predict crime occurrences to tackle this problem. The smart cities' environment can provide us enough ubiquitous data, e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and Points of Interest (POI) information, to feed those predictive policing algorithms and reflect city dynamics. POIs data provide essential information such as geographical location, category, customer reviews, and busy hours. Recent studies have shown that POI geographical locations are useful for predictive policing. In this paper, we aim at predicting crimes in a delimited region around the POIs of a city with new environmental features. We investigate the relevance of POIs location and the semantic and the temporal features from POIs data in our problem. We also propose and analyze different machine learning approaches to train prediction functions based on these features and conduct experiments on real crime data over multiple years. The experiments demonstrate that the popular time feature is more relevant than the historical information about the number of crimes around a POI, but both information is much less critical than the spatio-temporal information. This work is the first that studies the popular time feature extracted from POIs data and historical criminal information for predictive policing from the authors' knowledge.},

abstract = {As a new initiative by smart city projects that are going viral in worldwide ICT developments, mostly by governments, IoT sensors and their applications have been exploited and adopted proactively nowadays. A useful but relatively low-tech application is counting human presence by using carbon dioxide sensor. Such CO2 sensors are durable and inexpensive, with their compact sizes they could be deployed anywhere for estimating head counts ubiquitously. In this paper, a case study of applying CO2 sensors in public buses is investigated. Counting passengers in public buses or public transport in general has great economics advantages. However, a few technical challenges include but not limited to the mobility of the bus, the dynamic air flows, and factors such as windows were open, ventilation and even urban pollution etc, would affect the accuracy of occupancy counting. Hardly there would be a simple linear mapping between the number of people in a bus and the measurement of CO2 level. Hence, non-linear machine learning tool is used for inferring the non-linear relation between the two, with the consideration of the mentioned influential factors. Empirical data are collected from experiments conducted in several different buses over different times. The results can point to a promising conclusion that satisfactory accuracy could be achieved.},

abstract = {The classification of environmental sounds (ESC) has been increasingly studied in recent years. The main reason is that environmental sounds are part of our daily life, and associating them with our environment that we live in is important in several aspects as ESC is used in areas such as managing smart cities, determining location from environmental sounds, surveillance systems, machine hearing, environment monitoring. The ESC is however more difficult than other sounds because there are too many parameters that generate background noise in the ESC, which makes the sound more difficult to model and classify. The main aim of this study is therefore to develop more robust convolution neural networks architecture (CNN). For this purpose, 150 different CNN-based models were designed by changing the number of layers and values of their tuning parameters used in the layers. In order to test the accuracy of the models, the Urbansound8k environmental sound database was used. The sounds in this data set were first converted into an image format of 32x32x3. The proposed CNN model has yielded an accuracy of as much as 82.5% being higher than its classical counterpart. As there was not that much fine-tuning, the obtained accuracy has been found to be better and satisfactory compared to other studies on the Urbansound8k when both accuracy and computational complexity are considered. The results also suggest further improvement possible due to low complexity of the proposed CNN architecture and its applicability in real-world settings.},

abstract = {The democratization of Internet of Things and ubiquitous computing equips citizens with phenomenal new ways for online participation and decision-making in application domains of smart grids and smart cities. When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing. The contribution of an I-EPOS open source software suite implemented as a paradigmatic artifact for community aspires to settle a knowledge exchange for the design of new algorithms and application scenarios of sharing economies towards highly participatory and sustainable digital societies.},

abstract = {Due to the widespread functional benefits, such as supporting internet connectivity, having high visibility and enabling easy connectivity between sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become popular and used in many applications, such as for smart city, smart health, smart home, and smart vehicle realizations. These IoT-based systems contribute to both daily life and business, including sensitive and emergency situations. In general, the devices or sensors used in the IoT have very limited computational power, storage capacity, and communication capabilities, but they help to collect a large amount of data as well as maintain communication with the other devices in the network. Since most of the IoT devices have no physical security, and often are open to everyone via radio communication and via the internet, they are highly vulnerable to existing and emerging novel security attacks. Further, the IoT devices are usually integrated with the corporate networks; in this case, the impact of attacks will be much more significant than operating in isolation. Due to the constraints of the IoT devices, and the nature of their operation, existing security mechanisms are less effective for countering the attacks that are specific to the IoT-based systems. This article presents a new insider attack, named loophole attack, that exploits the vulnerabilities present in a widely used IPv6 routing protocol in IoT-based systems, called RPL (Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks). To protect the IoT system from this insider attack, a machine learning based security mechanism is presented. The proposed attack has been implemented using a Contiki IoT operating system that runs on the Cooja simulator, and the impacts of the attack are analyzed. Evaluation on the collected network traffic data demonstrates that the machine learning based approaches, along with the proposed features, help to accurately detect the insider attack from the network traffic data.},
