abstract = {Crime has been prevalent in our society for a very long time and it continues to be so even today. Currently, many cities have released crime-related data as part of an open data initiative. Using this as input, we can apply analytics to be able to predict and hopefully prevent crime in the future. In this work, we applied big data analytics to the San Francisco crime dataset, as collected by the San Francisco Police Department and available through the Open Data initiative. The main focus is to perform an in-depth analysis of the major types of crimes that occurred in the city, observe the trend over the years, and determine how various attributes contribute to specific crimes. Furthermore, we leverage the results of the exploratory data analysis to inform the data preprocessing process, prior to training various machine learning models for crime type prediction. More specifically, the model predicts the type of crime that will occur in each district of the city. We observe that the provided dataset is highly imbalanced, thus metrics used in previous research focus mainly on the majority class, disregarding the performance of the classifiers in minority classes, and propose a methodology to improve this issue. The proposed model finds applications in resource allocation of law enforcement in a Smart City.},

abstract = {The expansion of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) market is visible in homes, factories, public places, and smart cities. While the massive deployment of connected devices offers opportunities to improve quality of life and to develop new services, the impact of such devices on the security of the users in a context where the level of malicious threat continues to increase is a major concern. One of the challenges is the heterogeneity and constant evolution of wireless technologies and protocols used. To overcome this problem, we propose RIDS, a Radio Intrusion Detection System that is based on the monitoring and profiling of radio communications at the physical layer level using autoencoder neural networks. RIDS is independent of the wireless protocols and modulation technologies used. Besides, it is designed to provide a threefold diagnosis of the detected anomalies: temporal (start and end date of the detected anomaly), frequential (main frequency of the anomaly), and spatial (location of the origin of the anomaly). To demonstrate the relevance and the efficiency of our approach, we collected a large dataset of radio-communications recorded with three different probes deployed in an experimental room. Multiple real-world attacks involving a wide variety of communication technologies are also injected to assess the detection and diagnosis efficiency. The results demonstrate the efficiency of RIDS in detecting and diagnosing anomalies that occurred in the 400–500&nbsp;Mhz and 800–900&nbsp;Mhz frequency bands. It is noteworthy that compromised devices and attacks using these communication bands are generally not easily covered by traditional solutions.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction (e.g. crowd flow prediction) is of great importance in a wide range of smart city applications from urban planning, intelligent transportation and public safety. Recently, many deep neural network models have been proposed to make accurate prediction. However, manually designing neural networks requires amount of expert efforts and ST domain knowledge. How to automatically construct a general neural network for diverse spatio-temporal predication tasks in cities? In this paper, we study Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for spatio-temporal prediction and propose an efficient spatio-temporal neural architecture search method, entitled AutoST. To our best knowledge, the search space is an important human prior to the success of NAS in different applications while current NAS models concentrated on optimizing search strategy in the fixed search space. Thus, we design a novel search space tailored for ST-domain which consists of two categories of components: (i) optional convolution operations at each layer to automatically extract multi-range spatio-temporal dependencies; (ii) learnable skip connections among layers to dynamically fuse low- and high-level ST-features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-word spatio-temporal prediction tasks, including taxi flow and crowd flow, showing that the learned network architectures can significantly improve the performance of representative ST neural network models. Furthermore, our proposed efficient NAS approach searches 8-10x faster than state-of-the-art NAS approaches, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of AutoST.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, in conjunction with the one of smart cities, is pursuing toward the concept of smart buildings, i.e., ``intelligent'' buildings able to receive data from a network of sensors and thus to adapt the environment. IoT sensors can monitor a wide range of environmental features such as the energy consumption inside a building at fine-grained level (e.g., for a specific wall-socket). Some smart buildings already deploy energy monitoring in order to optimize the energy use for good purposes (e.g., to save money, to reduce pollution). Unfortunately, such measurements raise a significant amount of privacy concerns.In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of recognizing the pair laptop-user (i.e., a user using her own laptop) from the energy traces produced by her laptop. We design MTPlug, a framework that achieves this goal relying on supervised machine learning techniques as pattern recognition in multivariate time series. We present a comprehensive implementation of this system and run a thorough set of experiments. In particular, we collected data by monitoring the energy consumption of two groups of laptop users, some office employees and some intruders, for a total of 27 people. We show that our system is able to build an energy profile for a laptop user with accuracy above 80%, in less than 3.5 hours of laptop usage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that assesses the feasibility of laptop users profiling relying uniquely on fine-grained energy traces collected using wall-socket smart meters.},

abstract = { Machine Learning (EdgeML) algorithms on edge devices facilitate safety-critical applications like building security management and smart city interventions. However, their wired/wireless connections with the Internet make such platforms vulnerable to attacks compromising the embedded software. We find that in the prior works, the issue of regular runtime integrity assessment of the deployed software with negligible EdgeML performance degradation is still unresolved. In this paper, we present PracAttest, a practical runtime attestation framework for embedded devices running compute-heavy EdgeML applications. Unlike the conventional remote attestation schemes that check the entire software in each attestation event, PracAttest segments the software and randomizes the integrity check of these segments over short random attestation intervals. The segmentation coupled with the randomization leads to a novel performance-vs-security trade-off that can be tuned per the EdgeML application’s performance requirements. Additionally, we implement three realistic EdgeML benchmarks for pollution measurement, traffic intersection control, and face identification, using state-of-the-art neural network and computer vision algorithms. We specify and verify security properties for these benchmarks and evaluate the efficacy of PracAttest in attesting the verified software. PracAttest provides 50x-80x speedup over the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of mean attestation time, with negligible impact on application performance. We believe that the novel performance-vs-security trade-off facilitated by PracAttest will expedite the adoption of runtime attestation on edge platforms.},

abstract = {Adaptive traffic signal control plays a significant role in the construction of smart cities. This task is challenging because of many essential factors, such as cooperation among neighboring intersections and dynamic traffic scenarios. First, to facilitate the cooperation of traffic signals, existing work adopts graph neural networks to incorporate the temporal and spatial influences of the surrounding intersections into the target intersection, where spatial-temporal information is used separately. However, one drawback of these methods is that the spatial-temporal correlations are not adequately exploited to obtain a better control scheme. Second, in a dynamic traffic environment, the historical state of the intersection is also critical for predicting future signal switching. Previous work mainly solves this problem using the current intersection's state, neglecting the fact that traffic flow is continuously changing both spatially and temporally and does not handle the historical state.In this paper, we propose a novel neural network framework named DynSTGAT, which integrates dynamic historical state into a new spatial-temporal graph attention network to address the above two problems. More specifically, our DynSTGAT model employs a novel multi-head graph attention mechanism, which aims to adequately exploit the joint relations of spatial-temporal information. Then, to efficiently utilize the historical state information of the intersection, we design a sequence model with the temporal convolutional network (TCN) to capture the historical information and further merge it with the spatial information to improve its performance. Extensive experiments conducted in the multi-intersection scenario on synthetic data and real-world data confirm that our method can achieve superior performance in travel time and throughput against the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {We aim to increase the revenue or reduce the purchase cost of a given market participant in a double-sided, day-ahead, wholesale electricity market serving a smart city. Using an operations research based market clearing mechanism and attention based time series forecaster as sub-modules, we build a holistic interactive system. Through this system, we discover better bidding strategies for a market participant using reinforcement learning (RL). We relax several assumptions made in existing literature in order to make the problem setting more relevant to real life. Our Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation enables us to tackle action space explosion and also compute optimal actions across time-steps in parallel. Our RL framework is generic enough to be used by either a generator or a consumer participating in the electricity market.We study the efficacy of the proposed RL based bidding framework from the perspective of a generator as well as a buyer on real world day-ahead electricity market data obtained from the European Power Exchange (EPEX). We compare the performance of our RL based bidding framework against three baselines: (a) an ideal but un-realizable bidding strategy; (b) a realizable approximate version of the ideal strategy; and (c) historical performance as found from the logs. Under both perspectives, we find that our RL based framework is more closer to the ideal strategy than other baselines. Further, the RL based framework improves the average daily revenue of the generator by nearly €7,200 (€2.64 M per year) and €9,000 (€3.28 M per year) over the realizable ideal and historical strategies respectively. When used on behalf of a buyer, it reduces average daily procurement cost by nearly €2,700 (€0.97 M per year) and €57,200 (€52.63 M per year) over the realizable ideal and historical strategies respectively. We also observe that our RL based framework automatically adapts its actions to changes in the market power of the participant.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) controllers can cooperate to provide more effective load shaping in a model-free, decentralized, and scalable way with very limited sharing of anonymous information. Rapid urbanization, increasing electrification, the integration of renewable energy resources, and the potential shift towards electric vehicles create new challenges for the planning and control of energy systems in smart cities. Energy storage resources can help better align peaks of renewable energy generation with peaks of electricity consumption and flatten the curve of electricity demand. Model-based controllers, such as MPC, require developing models of the systems controlled, which is often not cost-effective or scalable. Model-free controllers, such as RL, have the potential to provide good control policies cost-effectively and leverage the use of historical data for training. However, it is unclear how RL algorithms can control a multitude of energy systems in a scalable coordinated way. In this paper, we introduce MARLISA, a controller that combines multi-agent RL with our proposed iterative sequential action selection algorithm for load shaping in urban energy systems. This approach uses a reward function with individual and collective goals, and the agents predict their own future electricity consumption and share this information with each other following a leader-follower schema. The RL agents are tested in four groups of nine simulated buildings, with each group located in a different climate. The buildings have diverse load and domestic hot water profiles, PV panels, thermal storage devices, heat pumps, and electric heaters. The agents are evaluated on the average of five normalized metrics: annual net electric consumption, 1 -- load factor, average daily peak demand, annual peak demand, and ramping. MARLISA achieves superior results over multiple independent/uncooperative RL agents using the same reward function. Our results outperformed a manually optimized rule-based controller (RBC) benchmark by reducing the average daily peak load by 15%, ramping by 35%, and increasing the load factor by 10%. A multi-year case study on real weather data shows that MARLISA significantly outperforms the RBC in within a year and converges in less than 2 years. Combining MARLISA and the RBC for the first year improves overall initial performance by learning from the RBC rather than random exploration.},

abstract = {As a key use case of Industry 4.0 and the Smart City, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) provides an efficient way for city managers to regulate the traffic flow, improve the commuting performance, reduce the transportation facility cost, alleviate the traffic jam, and so on. In fact, the significant development of Internet of Vehicles has boosted the emergence of a variety of Industry 4.0 applications, e.g., smart logistics, intelligent transforation, and autonomous driving. The prerequisite of deploying these applications is the design of efficient data dissemination schemes by which the interactive information could be effectively exchanged. However, in Internet of Vehicles, an efficient data scheme should adapt to the high node movement and frequent network changing. To achieve the objective, the ability to predict short-term traffic is crucial for making optimal policy in advance. In this article, we propose a novel data dissemination scheme by exploring short-term traffic prediction for Industry 4.0 applications enabled in Internet of Vehicles. First, we present a three-tier network architecture with the aim to simply network management and reduce communication overheads. To capture dynamic network changing, a deep learning network is employed by the controller in this architecture to predict short-term traffic with the availability of enormous traffic data. Based on the traffic prediction, each road segment can be assigned a weight through the built two-dimensional delay model, enabling the controller to make routing decisions in advance. With the global weight information, the controller leverages the ant colony optimization algorithm to find the optimal routing path with minimum delay. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of the traffic prediction model and the superiority of the proposed data dissemination scheme for Industry 4.0 applications.},

abstract = {Intelligent public transportation systems are the cornerstone to any smart city, given the advancements made in the field of self-driving autonomous vehicles - particularly for autonomous buses, where it becomes really difficult to systematize a way to identify the arrival of a bus stop on-the-fly for the bus to appropriately halt and notify its passengers. This paper proposes an automatic and intelligent bus stop recognition system built on computer vision techniques, deployed on a low-cost single-board computing platform with minimal human supervision. The on-device recognition engine aims to extract the features of a bus stop and its surrounding environment, which eliminates the need for a conventional Global Positioning System (GPS) look-up, thereby alleviating network latency and accuracy issues. The dataset proposed in this paper consists of images of 11 different bus stops taken at different locations in Chennai, India during day and night. The core engine consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) of size ~260 kB that is computationally lightweight for training and inference. In order to automatically scale and adapt to the dynamic landscape of bus stops over time, incremental learning (model updation) techniques were explored on-device from real-time incoming data points. Real-time incoming streams of images are unlabeled, hence suitable ground truthing strategies (like Active Learning), should help establish labels on-the-fly. Light-weight Bayesian Active Learning strategies using Bayesian Neural Networks using dropout (capable of representing model uncertainties) enable selection of the most informative images to query from an oracle. Intelligent rendering of the inference module by iteratively looking for better images on either sides of the bus stop environment propels the system towards human-like behavior. The proposed work can be integrated seamlessly into the widespread existing vision-based self-driving autonomous vehicles.},
