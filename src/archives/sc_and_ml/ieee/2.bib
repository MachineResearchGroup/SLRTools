abstract={The rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) holds vast potential for transportation systems through improved safety, efficiency, and access to mobility. However, the progression of these impacts, as AVs are adopted, is not well understood. Numerous technical challenges arise from the goal of analyzing the partial adoption of autonomy: partial control and observation, multivehicle interactions, and the sheer variety of scenarios represented by real-world networks. To shed light into near-term AV impacts, this article studies the suitability of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for overcoming these challenges in a low AV-adoption regime. A modular learning framework is presented, which leverages deep RL to address complex traffic dynamics. Modules are composed to capture common traffic phenomena (stop-and-go traffic jams, lane changing, intersections). Learned control laws are found to improve upon human driving performance, in terms of system-level velocity, by up to 57% with only 4–7% adoption of AVs. Furthermore, in single-lane traffic, a small neural network control law with only local observation is found to eliminate stop-and-go traffic—surpassing all known model-based controllers to achieve near-optimal performance—and generalize to out-of-distribution traffic densities.},

abstract={The Random Neural Network with a Genetic algorithm and its integration into an Intelligent Building: iBuilding is proposed in this paper. The presented biological method, founded on the Genome, codifies and transmits the information from the Intelligent Building. Furthermore, it also multiplexes its data entirely to generate Clusters of Buildings that are interconnected with each other. The key concept proposed in this paper is that the learned information obtained by iBuilding after its interaction with the environment is never lost when the building is decommissioned or retrofitted but transmitted to future iBuilding generations as distributed organisms. Data is codified in the network weights instead of the neurons, similar as the Genome, in order to enable an Artificial Intelligence evolution in iBuilding. The presented biological algorithm is inserted into an iBuilding model where sensorial neurons distributed within the Intelligent Building collect measurements about its environment and select relevant information. This proposed model has been validated with several research datasets that cover several key scenarios; experimental results demonstrate that the Random Neural Network Genetic Algorithm codifies, transmits and multiplexes iBuilding information to future generations with insignificant error, therefore, successfully creating a cluster of buildings.},

abstract={Over the past decade, smart city applications have gained significant attention in industrial informatics. However, little attention has been given to perceiving the emotions and perceptions of citizens who have a direct impact on smart city initiatives. In this article, we propose the use of publicly available abundant social media conversations that contain contextual information encompassing citizens' emotions and perceptions, which could be considered to provide the means to feel the “emotional pulse” of a city. We propose an automated AI-based observation framework to detect the emergence of public emotions and negativity in conversations. We evaluated the applicability of the framework using 29 928 social media conversations toward the much-debated topic of self-driving vehicles which will become increasingly relevant to smart cities. The patterns and transitions of citizens' collective emotions were modeled using the Natural Language Processing and Markov models while the negativity (toxicity) in conversations was evaluated using a deep learning based classifier. The framework could be adopted by industry leaders and government officials for smart observation of citizen opinions to improve security, communication, and policymaking.},

abstract={Nowadays, cities all over the globe are transforming into smart cities. Smart cities initiatives need to address environmental concerns such as air pollution to provide clean air. A scalable and cost-effective air monitoring system is imperative to monitor and control air pollution for smart city development. Air pollution has notable effects on the well-being of the population a whole, global atmosphere, and worldwide economy. This paper presents a scalable smart air quality monitoring system with low-cost sensors and long-range communication protocol. The sensors collect four parameters, temperature, humidity, dust and carbon dioxide in the air. The proposed end-to-end system has been implemented and deployed in Yangon, the business capital of Myanmar, as a case study since Jun 2018. The system allows the users to log in to an online dashboard to monitor the real-time status. In addition, based the collected air quality parameters for the past two months, a machine learning model has been trained to make predictions of parameters such that proactive actions can be taken to alleviate the impacts from air pollution.},

The deep neural network has been fed with the driving input of a couple of hours. The duly trained network was then tested with 30 minutes of driving data, recorded and used separately. Two control parameters were derived viz. speed of the vehicle and the steering angle. An eight layered convolutional network with two gated recurrent and four dense layers was trained and tested on GPU based system.

abstract={Due to the increase of the population and car ownership level, car-related problems which represented by traffic congestion and air pollution are caused. Parking problem is one of the most significant issues of them. Especially, long cruising time for parking spaces causes enormous economic cost. Thanks to recent IoT (Internet of Things) technology, it becomes possible to monitor availability of parking lots and some cities are providing monitored information to drivers. This system makes drivers to find parking spots easier than before. Nevertheless, there is a controversy over quality and quantity of availability information. Because of update interval and network delay, provided information is different from the real-time status (quality issues). Plus, there are still many unmonitored parking lots of which availability information couldn’t be read (quantity issues). In this paper, we propose two prediction models for qualitative and quantitative improvement of parking availability information. The proposed solution is evaluated using one month of occupancy rate data, publicly available from Seattle Department of Transportation.},

abstract={Edge of Things (EoT) technology enables end-users participation with smart-sensors and mobile devices (such as smartphones, wearable devices) to the smart devices across the smart city. Trust management is the main challenge in EoT infrastructure to consider the trusted participants. The Quality of Service (QoS) is highly affected by malicious users with fake or altered data. In this paper, a Robust Trust Management (RTM) scheme is designed based on Bayesian learning and collaboration filtering. The proposed RTM model is regularly updated after a specific interval with the significant decay value to the current calculated scores to update the behavior changes quickly. The dynamic characteristics of edge nodes are analyzed with the new probability score mechanism from recent services’ behavior. The performance of the proposed trust management scheme is evaluated in a simulated environment. The percentage of collaboration devices are tuned as 10%, 50% and 100%. The maximum accuracy of 99.8% is achieved from the proposed RTM scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that the RTM scheme shows better performance than the existing techniques in filtering malicious behavior and accuracy.},

One of the ways is a smart city sensor network with applications that can predict air quality for the next few days and warn the population in the case of the upcoming severe pollution. The prediction task in this paper is conducted by using state-of-the-art algorithms such as CatBoost, with additional features that help improve the quality of the model. Three models are examined, regular CatBoost, CatBoost with additional variable, and the new approach where CatBoost model is boosted with another model.

abstract={Analyzing surveillance videos is mandatory for the public and industrial security. Overwhelming growth in computer vision fields has been made to automate the surveillance system in terms of human activity recognition such as behavior analysis, Violence Detection (VD), etc. However, it is challenging to detect and analyze the violent scenes intelligently to fulfill the notion of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based surveillance buoyed by constrained resources to reduce computational power. To tackle this challenge, an Artificial Intelligence enabled IIoT-based framework with VD-Network (VD-Net) is proposed. First, the input video frames are passed to light-weight convolutional neural network model for important information collection including humans or suspicious objects such as Knives/Guns. Upon suspicious object detection, an alert is generated as an earlier VD in IIoT network while the information is shared with concern departments. Only the frames with objects are forwarded to cloud for detail investigation where features are extracted using Convolutional Long Short-term Memory (ConvLSTM). The latter from ConvLSTM is propagated to Gated Recurrent Unit for final VD. The conducted experiments and ablation study on the existing surveillance and non-surveillance datasets empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed VD-Net by improving 3.9% increase in the accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VD methods.},

abstract={The efficient management of a smart city and the improvement of the quality of humans' every-day life are becoming challenging problems due to smart cities' increased heterogeneity and complexity. In this paper, we present a novel socio-physical human orchestration framework to deal with the aforementioned issues, by capitalizing on recent advances in game theory and reinforcement learning. Initially, each human selects, in a distributed manner, a Point of Interest (PoI) that it wants to visit, by acting as stochastic learning automaton, exploiting the socio-physical conditions of the environment while learning from its previous experiences. As a result, those humans that have selected a specific PoI to visit, "compete" with each other in order to finally perform their visit. The humans' behavior is studied as a non-cooperative game among them, via adopting the theory of minority games, while the concluding Nash equilibrium point identifies the humans that will finally visit each PoI. A low complexity algorithm is introduced to realize the overall framework, while the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through modeling and simulation under several scenarios, and its superiority is demonstrated.},

abstract={The quick and accurate identification of criminal activity is paramount to securing any residence. With the rapid growth of smart cities, the integration of crime detection systems seeks to improve this security. In the past a strong reliance has been put on standard video surveillance in order to achieve this goal. This often creates a backlog of video data that must be monitored by a supervising official. For large urban areas, this creates a increasingly large workload for supervising officials which leads to an increase in error rate. Solutions have been implemented to help reduce the workload. Currently, auto regressive models have been used to better forecast criminal acts, but also have a list of shortcomings. We propose a solution of using neural networks in combination with a Hybrid Deep Learning algorithm to analyze video stream data. Our system will be able to quickly identify and assess criminal activity which will in turn reduce workloads on the supervising officials. When implemented across smart city infrastructure it will allow for a efficient and adaptable crime detection system.},

abstract={In our day and age where the numbers of cars on the road are rapidly increasing, thereby causing traffic. Drivers are becoming more reckless and carefree as the burden on the current human and automated system grows. Drivers and bikers who may wish to save a few minutes may break red lights and avoid wearing helmets but these small actions can have a significant impact and can result in the loss of lives. We propose a system that will intelligently use deep learning-based object detection to identify traffic offenders and provide methods to penalize them by recognizing their number plate.

abstract={One of the greatest issues modern urban environments are facing is poor air quality. It directly affects human health having a long-term negative impact on people's lives and is a major cause of deaths in the world. Smart cities combined with advances in deep learning provide a novel platform for dealing with this problem. This paper uses pollution data from smart sensor networks and a CNN-LSTM architecture to forecast the air pollution concentration of the current hour based on the previous 24-hour pollution concentration and several meteorological features from the previous hour. Initially data is preprocessed with special focus and strategy for handling missing values. The performance of the model is fine-tuned by taking into account additional temporal and seasonal dependency of this type of data. Comparison with other models from classical machine learning shows that the proposed deep learning model has better performance according to the provided metrics.},

abstract={Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication, as a part of 5G wireless communications, has been considered one of the most significant techniques for Smart City. Vehicles platooning is an application of Smart City that improves traffic capacity and safety by C-V2X. However, different from vehicles platooning travelling on highways, C-V2X could be more easily eavesdropped and the spectrum resource could be limited when vehicles converge at an intersection. Satisfying the secrecy rate of C-V2X, how to increase the spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) in the platooning network is a big challenge. In this paper, to solve this problem, a Security-Aware Approach to Enhancing SE and EE Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning is proposed, named SEED. The SEED formulates an objective optimization function considering both SE and EE, and the secrecy rate of C-V2X is treated as a critical constraint of this function. The optimization problem is transformed into the spectrum and transmission power selections of V2X links using deep Q network (DQN). The heuristic result of SE and EE is obtained by the DQN based on rewards mechanism. Finally, the traffic and communication environments are simulated by Python 3. The evaluation results demonstrate that the SEED outperforms the DQN-wopa algorithm and the baseline algorithm by 31.83% and 68.40% in efficiency, respectively.},

abstract={The smart city is an integrated environment that heavily relies on intelligent robots, which provides the basis for the warehouse automation. However, a warehouse is a typical unstructured environment, and robotic grasp and manipulation are extremely important for the package, transfer, search, and so on. Currently, the most usual method is to detect the picking or grasping points for some specific end-effector including suction cup, gripper, or robotic hand. The manipulation performance is, therefore, strongly influenced by the visual detector. To tackle this problem, the affordance map has recently been developed. It characterizes the operation possibilities afforded by the operation scene and has been used for several grasp tasks. Nevertheless, the conventional affordance method often fails in complicated environments due to the mistake calculation results. In this article, we develop a novel framework to integrate the interactive exploration with a composite robotic hand for robotic grasping in a complicated environment. The exploration strategy is obtained by a deep reinforcement learning procedure. The developed new composite hand, which integrates the suction cup and grippers, is used to test the merits of the proposed interactive perception method. Experimental results show the proposed method significantly increases the manipulation efficiency and may bring great economic and social and benefits for smart cities.},

abstract={Smart cities and other cyber-physical systems (CPSs) rely on various scientific, engineering, business, and social applications that provide timely intelligence for their design, operations, and management. Many of these scientific and analytics applications require the solution of sparse linear equation systems, where sparse matrix-vector (SpMV) product is a key computing operation. Several factors determine the performance of parallel SpMV computations, including matrix characteristics, storage formats, and the rising complexity and heterogeneity of computer systems. There is a pressing need for new ways of exploiting parallelism, and mapping data and applications to the computing resources. We propose here ZAKI+, a data-driven machine-learning approach, allowing users to automatically, effortlessly, and speedily obtain the best configuration (the data distribution, the optimal number of processes, and mapping strategy) and performance for the execution of the parallel SpMV computations on distributed memory machines. We train and test the tool using three machine learning methods-decision trees, random forest, and Xtreme boosting-and nearly 2000 real-world matrices obtained from 45 application domains, including computer vision and robotics. ZAKI+ provides optimal process mapping and outperforms the MPI default mapping policy by a factor of 4.24. This is the first work where the sparsity structure of matrices has been exploited to predict the optimal mapping of processes and data in distributed-memory environments by using different base and ensemble machine learning methods. Various CPSs comprise compute-intensive machine learning applications, such as the SpMV, and hence, the process and data mapping contributions of this paper would be of paramount impact for the CPSs.},

abstract={The development of smart technology and smart cities has solved the problem of data islands, but it has also brought about information security problems. Federated learning provides solutions to information security problems, which is a new machine learning method that effectively protects the local privacy of edge devices by distributing models to edge devices for training. However, due to malicious attacks from malicious edge devices, the accuracy and efficiency of federated learning are greatly compromised. Therefore, to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a reputation-aware method based on reinforcement learning (RA-RL) to select edge devices to ensure that the federated learning process is not attacked. Specifically, we introduce a reputation measurement scheme to evaluate the reputation of edge devices and use it as one of the features of edge devices. Then extract the feature matrix of candidate edge devices as the RL training environment to calculate the probability of each edge device is selected, and finally use the greedy algorithm to determine the devices that will eventually participate in the federated learning. Simulation experiments show that the RA-RL algorithm can effectively solve the training data security problem in federated learning, and is superior to other algorithms in terms of load balance, efficiency and accuracy.},

abstract={Urban arterial traffic coordination control has attracted much attention in smart city construction process. To achieve optimal signal timing, many studies have attempted to adjust green splits of a cycle time according to the distance between road intersections. However, existing green wave traffic control systems usually require a sophisticated calculation that depend upon the stability of vehicle speed and traffic flow, which can lead to weak robustness. Therefore, this article proposes two novel approaches to control arterial traffic coordination with the help of artificial intelligence: DDPG-BAND and ES-BAND. DDPG-BAND has two stages: a coarse-tuning stage reduces the blocking coefficient, and a fine-tuning stage optimizes the traffic evaluation index. ES-BAND introduces the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES), a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning, into signal timing. Different traffic variables are adopted as parameters to search for the optimal value by the CMA-ES. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approaches, we import real traffic flow data from Zhongshan Road, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, into a traffic environment simulator for training and then conduct a series of experiments. The results show that ES-BAND outperforms the traditional methods in terms of better convergence, lower journey time, fewer stops, and more throughput.},

abstract={Cloud computing has been a main-stream computing service for years. Recently, with the rapid development in urbanization, massive video surveillance data are produced at an unprecedented speed. A traditional solution to deal with the big data would require a large amount of computing and storage resources. With the advances in Internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and communication technologies, edge computing offers a new solution to the problem by processing all or part of the data locally at the edge of a surveillance system. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using edge computing for smart parking surveillance tasks, specifically, parking occupancy detection using the real-time video feed. The system processing pipeline is carefully designed with the consideration of flexibility, online surveillance, data transmission, detection accuracy, and system reliability. It enables artificial intelligence at the edge by implementing an enhanced single shot multibox detector (SSD). A few more algorithms are developed either locally at the edge of the system or on the centralized data server targeting optimal system efficiency and accuracy. Thorough field tests were conducted in the Angle Lake parking garage for three months. The experimental results are promising that the final detection method achieves over 95% accuracy in real-world scenarios with high efficiency and reliability. The proposed smart parking surveillance system is a critical component of smart cities and can be a solid foundation for future applications in intelligent transportation systems.},

abstract={Considerable attention has been given to leverage a variety of smart city applications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The rapid advances in artificial intelligence can empower UAVs with autonomous capabilities allowing them to learn from their surrounding environment and act accordingly without human intervention. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal scheduling framework for autonomous UAVs using reinforcement learning. The framework enables UAVs to autonomously determine their schedules to cover the maximum of pre-scheduled events spatially and temporally distributed in a given geographical area and over a pre-determined time horizon. The designed framework has the ability to update the planned schedules in case of unexpected emergency events. The UAVs are trained using the Q-learning (QL) algorithm to find effective scheduling plan. A customized reward function is developed to consider several constraints especially the limited battery capacity of the flying units, the time windows of events, and the delays caused by the UAV navigation between events. Numerical simulations show the behavior of the autonomous UAVs for various scenarios and corroborate the ability of QL to handle complex vehicle routing problems with several constraints. A comparison with an optimal deterministic solution is also provided to validate the performance of the learning-based solution.},

abstract={Air pollution is becoming a rising and serious environmental problem, mainly as a result from the migrations in urban areas. By employing effective air pollution monitoring systems, the pollution could be closely monitored, but this is not enough to make a significant impact in decreasing the pollution. The most effective value obtained from these systems is the amount of data that can be used to build pollution prediction models. To date, there are lot of different attempts to tackle the problem of air pollution prediction, but there is no evidence of their successful implementation in decreasing air pollution. In the last years, with the recent advances of deep learning techniques, and the increasing amount of data available, there are lot of proposed models for tackling the problem. In this research paper, we propose two different attention based models for air pollution prediction. Our models differ from all previous proposed models by introducing different attention factors for the previous timesteps when making a prediction. The model learns the attention factors, allowing it to learn the optimal amount that previous timesteps affect the current prediction. Using this approach we could better learn the patterns and dependencies in the data and in turn build better prediction models. We show that our models outperform two state-of-the-art models by employing our novel architecture.},

abstract={Pedestrian recognition is a key problem for a number of application domains namely autonomous driving, search and rescue, surveillance and robotics. Real-time pedestrian recognition entails determining if a pedestrian is in an image frame. State-of-art pedestrian detection convolution neural networks(CNN) such as Fast R-CNN depend on computationally expensive region detection algorithms to hypothesize pedestrian locations. This paper presents a simple, fast and very accurate approach by cascading fast regional detection and deep convolution networks. Convolution networks have been shown to excel at image classification. However, convolution networks are notoriously slow at inference time. In this work, we introduce a fast regional detection cascaded with deep convolution networks that enables real-time pedestrian detection that could be used to alert a driver if a pedestrian is on the roadway. The classification CNN has given an accuracy of 95.7%, with a processing rate of about 15 frames per second on a low performance system without a graphical processing unit (GPU).},

abstract={As a key pillar of smart transportation in smart city applications, electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular for their contribution in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One of the key challenges, however, is the strain on power grid infrastructure that comes with large-scale EV deployment. The solution to this lies in utilization of smart scheduling algorithms to manage the growing public charging demand. Using data-driven tools and machine learning algorithms to learn the EV charging behavior can improve scheduling algorithms. Researchers have focused on using historical charging data for predictions of behavior such as departure time and energy needs. However, variables such as weather, traffic, and nearby events, which have been neglected to a large extent, can perhaps add meaningful representations, and provide better predictions. Therefore, in this paper we propose the usage of historical charging data in conjunction with weather, traffic, and events data to predict EV session duration and energy consumption using popular machine learning algorithms including random forest, SVM, XGBoost and deep neural networks. The best predictive performance is achieved by an ensemble learning model, with SMAPE scores of 9.9% and 11.6% for session duration and energy consumptions, respectively, which improves upon the existing works in the literature. In both predictions, we demonstrate a significant improvement compared to previous work on the same dataset and we highlight the importance of traffic and weather information for charging behavior predictions.},

However, the models are often complex and hardly interpretable for the developers and operators. Indeed, the model interpretations are beneficial in multifold such as for system inspection and optimization. In this article, we propose an interpretable thermal comfort system to introduce interpretability to any black-box comfort models. First, we focus on the relationship between a model's input features and output comfort level. The feature impact on comfort is investigated and the impact patterns are shown to be diverse for different features. Second, we unveil the model mechanisms about the data processing inside the model by building the model surrogates based on the interpretable machine learning algorithms. The surrogates offer outstanding fidelity for simulating the actual model mechanisms and the interpretations based on the surrogates are intuitive and informative. Our interpretable comfort system can be integrated with the existing building management systems. Accordingly, we can ease building owner's concerns about adopting new black-box technologies and enable various smart building applications like smart energy management.},

In the first level of the framework, the similarity measures of DNS queries are estimated using siamese networks based on a predefined threshold for selecting the most frequent DNS information across Ethernet connections. In the second level of the framework, a domain generation algorithm based on deep learning architectures is suggested for categorizing normal and abnormal domain names. The framework is highly scalable on a commodity hardware server due to its potential design of analyzing DNS data.

To predict the position, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is generally applied using the sensor's measures and the GPS position as a helper. However, the DGPS high cost solution still suffers from GPS satellite signals loss due to multipath errors and the INS require more complex computing. Furthermore, the EKF performance depends on the vehicle dynamic variations and may quickly diverge because of environment changes (i.e, GPS failures by obstructions from building and trees). In this paper, we present a robust low cost approach using EKF and neural networks (NN) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reliably estimate the real time vehicle position using GPS enhanced with low cost Dead Reckoning (DR) sensors. While GPS signals are available, we train the NN with GA on different dynamics and outage times to learn the position errors so we can correct the future EKF predictions during GPS signal outages. We obtain empirically an improvement of up to 95% over the simple EKF predictions in case of GPS failures.},

abstract={Smoke detection in Internet of Things (IoT) environment is a primary component of early disaster-related event detection in smart cities. Recently, several smoke and fire detection methods are presented with reasonable accuracy and running time for normal IoT environment. However, these methods are unable to detect smoke in foggy IoT environment, which is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient system based on deep convolutional neural networks for early smoke detection in both normal and foggy IoT environments. Our method takes advantage of VGG-16 architecture, considering its sensible stability between the accuracy and time efficiency for smoke detection compared to the other computationally expensive networks, such as GoogleNet and AlexNet. Experiments performed on benchmark smoke detection datasets and their results in terms of accuracy, false alarms rate, and efficiency reveal the better performance of our technique compared to state-of-the-art and verifies its applicability in smart cities for early detection of smoke in normal and foggy IoT environments.},

abstract={Solutions for smart cities are being created everywhere in the world, using technology to improve urban infrastructure and make urban centers more efficient and better to live. In this way, the proposal of this work is based on the capture of information through sensors in a smart city context. Sensors are coupled on a bicycle and connected to an Arduino and a Mobile Application. After this, the captured data are saved in a cloud database, displayed and analyzed through a Web Application. In this work, our methodology is organized in three main phases: (i) data collection of the surface in which the cyclist is traveling, and the ultrasonic distance sensor, to identify areas of risk based on the proximity of objects from bicycle, (ii) data analysis and data classification, using machine learning concepts and (iii) data visualization, using map views in a Web Application. This methodology allows the identification of injury risk situations to cyclists. The main contributions of this work are surfaces classification with data collected by the accelerometer and ultrasonic sensor generating useful information through simple data. Real experiments were conducted at Fortaleza (Ceara, Brazil) and Aracati (Ceara, Brazil). This work brings new perspectives to collaborative data collection for identification of injury risk situations to cyclists, since it can be used to suggest routes based on these risk indicators and offer a secure environment for cyclists.},

This article predominantly focuses on energy consumption coupled with CO2 emissions in cellular networks in the context of smart cities. We use Reinforcement Learning (RL) vertical traffic offloading algorithm to optimize energy consumption in Base Stations (BSs) and to reduce carbon footprint by applying widely accepted strategy of cell switching and traffic offloading. The algorithm relies on a macro cell and multiple small cells traffic load information to determine the cell offloading strategy in most energy efficient way while maintaining quality of service demands and fulfilling users applications. Spatio-temporal simulations are performed to determine a cell switch on/off operation and offload strategy using varying traffic conditions in control data separated architecture.

abstract={Traffic accidents and lack of road monitoring are never-ending cause of tribulation in metropolitan areas. A solution is required to tackle with these problems. The human eye is not capable of capturing each and everything happening on the roads. To build a secure environment in smart cities an intelligent surveillance system is required to keep an eye on what is happening on roads. The current security measures for surveillance are not enough to capture everything. For instance, single view and fixed CCTV cameras are installed on roads. They are only capable of providing information on a fixed angle. The current solution lacks at recognizing the type, model, and license plate of the vehicle. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a 3D road monitoring model to provide intelligent surveillance in smart cities. The proposed solution is capable of performing efficient vehicle detection along with sensing unusual activities on the road. For this, pre-trained models trained using deep neural networks for vehicle detection, license plate recognition, and unusual activity detection are combined through stacking. It will reduce the man work, time, and complexity of the traffic controls.},

abstract={Smart-city intersections will play a crucial role in automated traffic management and improvement in pedestrian safety in cities of the future. They will (i) aggregate data from in-vehicle and infrastructure sensors; (ii) process the data by taking advantage of low-latency high-bandwidth communications, edge-cloud computing, and AI-based detection and tracking of objects; and (iii) provide intelligent feedback and input to control systems. The Cloud Enhanced Open Software Defined Mobile Wireless Testbed for City-Scale Deployment (COSMOS) enables research on technologies supporting smart cities. In this paper, we provide results of experiments using bird's eye cameras to detect and track vehicles and pedestrians from the COSMOS pilot site. We assess the capabilities for real-time computation, and detection and tracking accuracy - by evaluating and customizing a selection of video pre-processing and deep-learning algorithms. Distinct issues that are associated with the difference in scale for bird's eye view of pedestrians vs. cars are explored and addressed: the best multiple-object tracking accuracies (MOTA) for cars are around 73.2, and around 2.8 for pedestrians. The real-time goal of 30 frames-per-second - i.e., a total of 33.3 ms of latency for object detection for vehicles will be reachable once the processing time is improved roughly by a factor of three.},

abstract={With rapid development of compelling application scenarios of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as smart cities, it becomes substantially important to strengthen the management of data traffic in IoT networks. Traffic classification is beneficial in terms of both ensuring network security and improving quality of service. Traditional IoT traffic classification methods separate the classification algorithm and the design of feature engineering, which includes feature extraction and feature selection. Then, traffic identification or classification is performed by combining both. This paper proposes an end-to-end IoT traffic classification method relying on a deep learning aided capsule network for the sake of forming an efficient classification mechanism that integrates feature extraction, feature selection, and classification model. Our proposed traffic classification method beneficially eliminates the process of manually selecting traffic features, and is particularly applicable to smart city scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that capsule networks have been used in the context of traffic classification. Experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed traffic classification mechanism, which yields high classification accuracy.},

abstract={The concept of a Smart City is the forefront in the development of our near future. One of the most important parts of such cities is the transport infrastructure. Threats implementation for such infrastructure can have critical consequences for a city. To prevent such threats in the future we should investigate and counteraction them in the present. The first step in this way can be the creation of a threats classification for the transport infrastructure of a Smart City. The paper describes a set of methods that can be used for this. As a result, a scheme for categorical and cluster classifications creation is proposed. The categorical classification relies on the division of categories for elements grouping. The cluster one uses machine learning methods for elements grouping. Examples of classifications applying for the top-10 threats from the official state database are given.},

abstract={Waste collection and management presents a major challenge for municipalities wanting to achieve cleaner urban environments. Smart city infrastructure incorporating the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm offers substantial advantages in terms of real-time waste monitoring capability. Basic sensory monitoring by itself, however, falls short of achieving optimal waste management without comprehensive data analytics. To this end, the present work proposes an off-the-shelf IoT-based waste monitoring solution, combined with back-end data analytics for efficient waste collection. The work employs Raspberry Pi and ultrasonic sensors, mounted on waste-bins in a specific area of a cooperating municipality for waste capacity monitoring. Realtime bin status and machine learning analytics are used to identify present as well as predict future waste collection scheduling. Dynamic collection servicing routes are accordingly mapped for utilization by waste collection vehicles. During a tenday trial and validation period, it was observed that the proposed design increases fuel efficiency by up to 46% and a reduction in collection times by up to 18%. In addition to the noted quantitative improvements, the proposed scheme can also aid in optimizing long-term waste policies in smart city environments using the recorded statistics.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, systems, and applications demonstrate potential in serving smart city development. Crowdsensing approaches for road surface conditions monitoring can benefit smart city road information services. Deteriorated roads induce vehicle damage, traffic congestion, and driver discomfort which influence traffic management. In this paper, we propose a framework for monitoring road surface anomalies. We analyze the common road surface types and irregularities as well as their impact on vehicle motion. In addition to the traditional use of sensors available in smart devices, we utilize the vehicle motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) presently available in most land vehicles. Various land vehicles were used in this paper, spanning different sizes, and year model for extensive road experiments. These trajectories were used to collect and build multiple labeled data sets that were used in the system structure. In order to enhance the performance of the sensor measurements, wavelet packet de-noising is used in this paper to enable efficient classification of road surface anomalies. We adopt statistical, time domain, and frequency domain features to distinguish different road anomalies. The descriptive data sets collected in this paper are used to build, train, and test a system classifier through machine learning techniques to detect and categorize multiple road anomalies with different severity levels. Furthermore, we analyze and assess the capabilities of the smart devices and the other vehicle motion sensors to accurately geo-reference the road surface anomalies. Several road test experiments examine the benefits and assess the performance of the proposed architecture.},

To aid in combating this threat, monitoring smart city and connected vehicle's sensor data will allow for construction of a behavioral model. Implementing machine learning will aid in constructing a standard behavior such that any device that begins to malfunction or behave maliciously can be detected and mitigated in real-time. This behavioral analysis will be further applied to supplement trust management approaches such that a more accurate value can be associated with the device's perceived trustworthiness without the need to rely on a majority consensus.},

abstract={Video streaming has become one of the most prevalent mobile applications and uses a substantial portion of the traffic on mobile networks today. With the limited bandwidth of mobile networks, understanding the user perception of the quality (i.e., Quality of Experience or QoE) of video streaming services is thus paramount for content providers and content-delivery network providers to flexibly configure network bandwidth, video servers, routing devices, and other network resources to save energy in smart cities. Although various video QoE assessment approaches have been proposed using different key performance indicators (KPIs), they all essentially relate to a common parameter: bitrate. However, because YouTube has adopted hyper text transfer protocol over secure socket layer (HTTPS) as its adaptive video streaming method to better protect user privacy and network security, bitrate can no longer be obtained from encrypted video traffic via typical deep packet inspection. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a machine-learning-based bitrate estimation (MBE) approach to parse bitrate information from IP packet level measurements. First, we filter HTTPS YouTube traffic based on the previously established video server IP according to the data packet googlevideo field. Then, we identify the transmission mode according to the traffic characteristics of several previous packets. Next, we identify the bitrates and resolutions of HTTP Live Streaming and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP modes according to the characteristics of video chunks. Finally, for evaluating the effectiveness of MBE, we have chosen the video Mean Opinion Score (vMOS) proposed by a leading telecom vendor as the QoE assessment framework, and have conducted comprehensive experiments to study the impact of bitrate estimation accuracy on its KPIs for the HTTPS YouTube video streaming service. Experimental results show that MBE is a feasible and highly effective QoE evaluation approach to flexibly configure network resources in smart cities.},

General strategy is composed of three main steps. First of these consists to implement traffic signs ontologies by one of Semantic Web languages. Second step consists to use SPARQL language queries to query these ontologies in order to recuperate necessary synonyms to interpret a message sent by a traffic sign.

abstract={The development of smart cities and their fast-paced deployment is resulting in the generation of large quantities of data at unprecedented rates. Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data. This article also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.},

One of them is the development of techniques and services capable of contributing to the enhancement of security public policies. Finding criminal patterns from historical data would arguably help in predicting and even preventing thefts and burglaries that continuously increase in urban centers worldwide. However, accessing such history and finding patterns across the interrelated crime occurrences data are challenging tasks, particularly to underdevelopment countries. In this paper, we address these problems by combining three techniques: we collect crime data from existing crowd-sourcing systems, we automatically induce patterns with relational machine learning, and we manage the entire process using scientific workflows. The framework developed under these lines is named CRiMINaL (Crime patteRn MachINe Learning). Experimental results conducted from a popular Brazilian source of data and a traditional relational learning system shows that CRiMINaL is a promising tool to induce interpretable models that can assist police departments on crime prevention.},

In this scenario, the satisfaction of security and privacy requirements to preserve data integrity, confidentiality and authentication is of fundamental importance. In particular, this is essential in the healthcare sector, where health-related data are considered sensitive information able to reveal confidential details about the subject. In this regard, to limit the possibility of security attacks or privacy violations, we present a reliable mobile voice disorder detection system capable of distinguishing between healthy and pathological voices by using a machine learning algorithm. This latter is totally embedded in the mobile application, so it is able to classify the voice without the necessity of transmitting user data to or storing user data on any server. A Boosted Trees algorithm was used as the classifier, opportunely trained and validated on a dataset composed of 2003 voices. The most frequently considered acoustic parameters constituted the inputs of the classifier, estimated and analyzed in real time by the mobile application.},

However, edge servers are not always safe. For instance, there are researches show that 89% of WiFi hotspots are unsecured. Hence, it is possible for attackers to know where you go at a given time of the day, which places you prefer to visit from images collected by IoT devices, such as camera, UAVs. Considering the data collected by IoT devices could include the sensitive information about users, we propose a scheme that applies differential privacy to protect the collected data. We experiment on the INRIA Person Dataset and use three deep learning networks. Results show that even though adding differential privacy makes images blurred, the deep learning network on edge servers can detect pedestrians in the images with accuracy as high as 97.3%.},

abstract={In the era of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city ecosystems, there is a need for innovative smart parking systems for more sustainable cities. With the increasing number of vehicles in the cities every year, it takes more time to find parking spaces. The solution methods developed are no longer sufficient. The time that passes while waiting for a parking space in traffic carries with it problems such as energy, environmental pollution and stress. In this study, a deep learning and cloud-based new mobile smart parking application was developed to minimize the problem of searching for parking spaces. Within the application, a service has been developed based on deep learning with Long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the parking space. Here, dynamic access is provided to the LSTM-based model previously created through the mobile device of the user, and the process of displaying the occupancy rates of the parks at the desired place is accomplished on the mobile device by entering the relevant parameters. By this means, both energy and time savings have been achieved. With the real-time car parking data collected in the city of Istanbul in Turkey, high accuracy results were obtained. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model proposed, it was compared with the Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and ARIMA methods. The results have confirmed the high accuracy and reliability that was promised.},

abstract={As urbanization moves into making smart cities, intelligent transportation applications have recently sprung up, creating a bad need of realtime traffic flow information. However, legacy approaches to estimating or predicting traffic flow fall short in pursuing urban-scale realtime traffic flow. In this paper, we turn to a new idea: deploying lightweight deep learning on smartphone-like mobile edge devices to achieve realtime traffic flow estimation in urban scale. Specifically, we design a cloud-free system, Deeput, which resides in mobile edge devices and listens to vehicular traffic noise along roads. Locally at these devices, Deeput maps the recorded traffic noise into spectrograms, and then, infers realtime traffic flow from these spectrograms by a novel deep learning model. We build a prototype of Deeput that can smoothly run on Android smartphone, and the experimental results show Deeput’s efficacy and efficiency. The Deeput designs are also insightful for realizing urban-scale, realtime applications that require or target on-edge intelligence.},

This will result in reduced traffic congestion and carbon dioxide emission. However, traffic forecasting is a challenging task due to the highly complex traffic pattern. Standard time series techniques may not be able to capture the nonlinear and noisy nature of the traffic flow. In this paper, we investigate how the deep learning models capture these characteristics and provide better predictive performance over standard time series and regression models. We compare the performances of state-of-the-art deep learning models on two traffic flow data sets and show their effectiveness in traffic flow prediction over traditional models.},

abstract={Using large-scale GPS trajectory data to improve taxi services has recently attracted much attention in Internet of Things and smart city communities. In this paper, we use a large-scale GPS trajectory dataset generated by over 12 000 taxis in a period of three months in Shanghai, China, and present an efficient passenger-hunting recommendation framework with the multitask deep learning paradigm. This framework contains two modules: 1) offline training of passenger-hunting recommendation model (OT-PHRM) and 2) online application of passenger-hunting recommendation model (OA-PHRM). The module OT-PHRM mainly includes two deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and uses the multitask learning strategy. The first DCNN realizes the region prediction for picking up passengers, while the second DCNN uses the weight-sharing structure to predict the levels of road congestion and earnings of carrying passengers. In particular, for the input of two DCNNs, we not only consider contextual features of taxi driving, region features and valuable statistical features, but also combine individual features into meaningful ones. In the module OA-PHRM, we propose DL-PHRec, which calculates three prediction values using two trained DCNNs in OT-PHRM in real time, and then recommends a personal ranking-list of regions to each taxi driver according to their scores. The experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of our recommendation framework.},

With these applications, IP surveillance network is regarded as one of the potential technologies toward developing smart cities. To support the concept of IP surveillance networks, automatic attribute recognition systems have emerged as a promising intelligent management system. To automatically recognize attributes of pedestrians (e.g., gender and clothing), we apply deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the main contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) we proposed a practical system architecture for intelligent management of surveillance networks; (2) we implemented different deep CNNs, and an ensemble-learning method that leverages these multiple deep-learning models; (3) we evaluated the models using the real data of IP surveillance networks.},

abstract={In the past few years, edge computing has brought tremendous convenience to the development of smart cities, releasing computation pressure to edge compute nodes. However, a series of problems, such as the explosive growth of smart devices and limited spectrum resources, still greatly limit the application of edge computing. Different types of end devices generate and collect multimodal information, and substantial data is transmitted to upper nodes. Multimodal machine learning methods process data at edge nodes, and only high-level features are uploaded to the cloud in order to save bandwidth. In this article, we propose a novel multimodal data processing framework based on multiple attention mechanisms. Two distinct attention mechanisms are used to capture inter and intra-modality dependencies and align different modalities together. We conduct experiments on image captioning, a core research hotspot in multimodal machine learning. A unified hierarchical structure extracts features from images and natural language. Matching attention aligns visual and textual information. Besides, we propose a new attention mechanism, positional attention, which finds the relationship of each element within one sensory modality. The hierarchical structure realizes parallel computation in the training phase and speeds up the training of the model. Experiments and analysis demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, proving the effectiveness of our method.},

In recent years, smart supervision based on a new generation of information technology has achieved results in the fields of government procurement, traditional food and medical insurance, whereas it relies on a single technical form. Therefore, how to organically integrate various forms of new-generation information technology with smart supervision may become a future direction. Taking the new generation of information technology represented by "ABCD" as the starting point, this article proposes that smart supervision which integrates multiple technical forms further improves the accuracy and real-time of smart supervision and the effectiveness of the construction of smart cities. Meantime, it can effectively coordinate regional development, vigorously promote the comprehensive reform of "intelligence+", strengthen data correlation research, solve the problem of asymmetry in regulatory information, mine the information behind the data, improve the utilization rate of regulatory data, give full play to the power of social think tanks, and make the best of the media convergence, which would accelerate the process of China's information modernization and improve national quality of life.},

abstract={Cities are growing at a dizzying pace and they require improved methods to manage crowded areas. Crowd management stands for the decisions and actions taken to supervise and control densely populated spaces and it involves multiple challenges, from recognition and assessment to application of actions tailored to the current situation. To that end, Wi-Fi-based monitoring systems have emerged as a cost-effective solution for the former one. The key challenge that they impose is the requirement to handle large datasets and provide results in near real-time basis. However, traditional big data and event processing approaches have important shortcomings while dealing with crowd management information. In this paper, we describe a novel system architecture for real-time crowd recognition for smart cities and smart buildings that can be easily replicated. The described system proposes a privacy-aware platform that enables the application of artificial intelligence mechanisms to assess crowds' behavior in buildings employing sensed Wi-Fi traces. Furthermore, the present paper shows the implementation of the system in two buildings, an airport and a market, as well as the results of applying a set of classification algorithms to provide crowd management information.},

abstract={With the fast development of smart cities and 5G, the amount of mobile data is growing exponentially. The centralized cloud computing mode is hard to support the continuous exchanging and processing of information generated by millions of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, mobile-edge computing (MEC) and software-defined networking (SDN) are introduced to form a cloud-edge-terminal collaboration network (CETCN) architecture to jointly utilize the communicational and computational resources. Although the CETCN brings many benefits, there still exist some challenges, such as the unclear operation mode, low utilization of edge resources, as well as the limited energy of terminals. To address these problems, a reinforcement learning-based joint communicational-and-computational resource allocation mechanism (RJCC) is proposed to optimize overall processing delay under energy limits. In RJCC, a Q -learning-based online offloading algorithm and a Lagrange-based migration algorithm are designed to jointly optimize computation offloading across multisegments and on edge platform, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed RJCC outperforms the delay-optimal, energy-optimal, and edge-to-terminal offloading algorithm by 42%-74% in long-term average energy consumption while maintaining relatively low delay.},

abstract={Smart city is an evolving concept and a continually moving target. The priorities for a "Smart city" depend on the unique plans, challenges, and resourcefulness of the local government supported by the vision of the policy makers of the country. The vision of smart cities of today may not be the same after some time. "Smart city" aims to improve the quality of life (QoL) of people by reducing costs, creating improved services, ensuring sustainability, and pave ways for growth of businesses, institutions, and residents. Study shows that "Smart city" improves QoL by use of digital sensors, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and automation to drive intelligent decision-making. [1] By virtue of their scale, infrastructure, and established relationships with local bodies in the region, utilities can play a pivotal role in the creation of Smart cities. However, the question comes up - how well the utility companies are prepared in terms of their organization, operational processes, policies, systems, and skilled manpower to support the diverse needs of Smart cities. They will need new skills, business models, operational processes, and possible partnerships to lead and succeed in this new scenario. Any lack in their expertise, resources, and skills is likely to impede the creation of Smart cities in the region. This paper focuses on the preparedness of the electric utility companies. It discusses about the smart region opportunity for utilities analysing a few examples of the modern technologies and business practices for an improved operational and energy efficiency. It refers to the energy policies amidst the era of smart cities and highlights the skills and training required by utilities' manpower to contribute to the creation of smart cities effectively and efficiently.},

abstract={Radar imaging is a competitive option for smart city applications over optical approaches, as it raises no privacy concerns. The inherent difficulty of interpreting radar signals can be overcome using deep learning techniques to leverage the capabilities of monitoring sensors with a minimum of human intervention. In this paper, we use a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying radar images in order to detect vacant parking spaces with a 77-GHz imaging radar. Although training CNNs for radar-image classification is challenging due to poor generalization performance caused by the lack of labeled training data, the modified architecture takes into account the properties of the radar image in order to introduce prior information into the model and improve performance. A MIMO-FMCW radar is utilized to render a slant-range image of a parking scenario, and the image patches corresponding to each parking location are classified independently in the CNN. Since the radiation pattern of a MIMO array varies as a function of the scanning angle, the corresponding spatial coordinate of each patch is included as an additional feature in the upper layers of the network. This allows the model to combine local features from each patch with global scenario information in order to learn robust features that generalize properly to new scenarios. Several models are trained end to end with data from four different parking scenarios and evaluated in a 4-fold cross-validation scheme, and performance is improved when spatial prior information is included.},

However, finding an appropriate deployment scenario is often a complex task and requires considering several criteria. In this paper, we introduce a multicriteria decision-making method based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process for the comparison and selection of deployment alternatives. We use the RECAP simulation framework to model and simulate DDNN deployments on different scales to provide a comprehensive assessment of deployments to system designers.

abstract={During the process of smart city construction, city managers always spend a lot of energy and money for cleaning street garbage due to the random appearances of street garbage. Consequently, visual street cleanliness assessment is particularly important. However, the existing assessment approaches have some clear disadvantages, such as the collection of street garbage information is not automated and street cleanliness information is not real-time. To address these disadvantages, this paper proposes a novel urban street cleanliness assessment approach using mobile edge computing and deep learning. First, the high-resolution cameras installed on vehicles collect the street images. Mobile edge servers are used to store and extract street image information temporarily. Second, these processed street data is transmitted to the cloud data center for analysis through city networks. At the same time, Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) is used to identify the street garbage categories and count the number of garbage. Finally, the results are incorporated into the street cleanliness calculation framework to ultimately visualize the street cleanliness levels, which provides convenience for city managers to arrange clean-up personnel effectively. The overall approach is illustrated and visualized using the street images of Jiangning District in Nanjing, China. The practical application shows the feasibility and usability of the approach.},

Our system employs IoT devices mounted on vehicles as well as static reference stations to measure a variety of city parameters, such as humidity, temperature, and air pollution. Mobile measurements cover a larger area compared to static stations; however, there is a tradeoff between temporal and spatial resolution. We address this problem as a matrix completion on graphs problem and rely on variational graph autoencoders to propose a deep learning solution for the estimation of the unknown air pollution values. Our model is extended to capture the correlation among different air pollutants, leading to improved estimation. We conduct experiments at different spatial and temporal resolution and compare with state-of-the-art methods to show the efficiency of our approach. The observed and estimated air pollution values can be accessed by interested users through a Web visualization tool designed to provide an air pollution map of the city of Antwerp.},

pages={61213-61225},
abstract={The smooth operation of largely deployed Internet of Things (IoT) applications will depend on, among other things, effective infrastructure failure detection. Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%. The proposed framework holds potential for other pattern recognition tasks in smart-city wireless infrastructures, that would enable the monitoring, prediction and improvement of the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by IoT applications.},

abstract={Smart cities and societies are driving unprecedented technological and socioeconomic growth in everyday life albeit making us increasingly vulnerable to infinitely and incomprehensibly diverse threats. Short Message Service (SMS) spam is one such threat that can affect mobile security by propagating malware on mobile devices. A security breach could also cause a mobile device to send spam messages. Many works have focused on classifying incoming SMS messages. This paper proposes a tool to detect spam from outgoing SMS messages, although the work can be applied to both incoming and outgoing SMS messages. Specifically, we develop a system that comprises multiple machine learning (ML) based classifiers built by us using three classification methods -- Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes Multinomial (NBM)- and five preprocessing and feature extraction methods. The system is built to allow its execution in cloud, fog or edge layers, and is evaluated using 15 datasets built by 4 widely-used public SMS datasets. The system detects spam SMSs and gives recommendations on the spam filters and classifiers to be used based on user preferences including classification accuracy, True Negatives (TN), and computational resource requirements.},

The healthcare system is going through a crisis. Many precautionary measures have been taken to reduce the spread of this disease where wearing a mask is one of them. In this paper, we propose a system that restrict the growth of COVID-19 by finding out people who are not wearing any facial mask in a smart city network where all the public places are monitored with Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras. While a person without a mask is detected, the corresponding authority is informed through the city network. A deep learning architecture is trained on a dataset that consists of images of people with and without masks collected from various sources. The trained architecture achieved 98.7% accuracy on distinguishing people with and without a facial mask for previously unseen test data. It is hoped that our study would be a useful tool to reduce the spread of this communicable disease for many countries in the world.},

The developed system is also implemented and tested for live video stream using NVIDIA Jetson TX2 development platform with an accuracy of 97% and average fps of 30. Here, the proposed IDS is a generic one where the user can select the region of interest (the area to be intrusion free) of any size and shape from the reference (starting) frame and potential intruders such as a person, vehicle, etc. from the list of trained object classes. Hence, it can have a wide range of smart city applications such as person intrusion free zone, no vehicle entry zone, no parking zone, smart home security, etc.},

abstract={With the accelerating pace of urban life, population movements are changing dynamically in both space and time. However, the ensuing traffic congestion and potentially dangerous problems caused by crowd flow and increasing uncertain traffic data cannot be ignored. Crowd flow prediction is of critical importance for reducing traffic congestion and eliminating public safety risks in smart city. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Temporal Long-and Short-Term Network (STLSN) model employing deep learning method to predict crowd flow in high precision. The proposed STLSN considers both short and long term temporal dependencies, and it employs local Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to capture spatial correlations between regions. Specifically, we employ the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to capture short term dependency while using recurrentskip architecture which utilizes the periodic characteristic of flow data to capture the long term temporal dependencies. Moreover, the weighting Point of Interest (POI) is applied to differentiate the importance of function categories. Finally, we conduct experiments on practical dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model is over the compared methods.},

abstract={Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS) photo-based is an arising field of interest and a trending topic in the domain of ubiquitous computing. It has recently drawn substantial attention of the smart cities and urban computing communities. In fact, the built-in cameras of mobile devices are becoming the most common way for visual logging techniques in our daily lives. MCS photo-based frameworks collect photos in a distributed way in which a large number of contributors upload photos whenever and wherever it is suitable. This inevitably leads to evolving picture streams which possibly contain misleading and redundant information that affects the task result. In order to overcome these issues, we develop, in this paper, a solution for selecting highly relevant data from an evolving picture stream and ensuring correct submission. The proposed photo-based MCS framework for event reporting incorporates (i) a deep learning model to eliminate false submissions and ensure photos credibility and (ii) an A-Tree shape data structure model for clustering streaming pictures to reduce information redundancy and provide maximum event coverage. Simulation results indicate that the implemented framework can effectively reduce false submissions and select a subset with high utility coverage with low redundancy ratio from the streaming data.},

abstract={Nowadays, traffic management and sustainable mobility are becoming one of the central topics for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Thanks to the today's technologies, it is possible to collect real-time data to monitor the traffic situation in some specific areas. An important challenge in ITS is the ability to predict road traffic variables. The short-term predictions of traffic aspects are a complex nonlinear task that has been the subject of many research efforts in the past few decades. Accessing to precise traffic flow data is mandatory for a large number of applications which have to guarantee high level of services such as: traffic flow reconstruction, which in turn is used to perform what-if analysis, conditioned routing, etc. They have to be reliable and precise for sending rescue teams and fire brigades. This paper proposes a solution for a short- and long-term traffic flow prediction estimation by using and comparing a number of machine learning approaches. The solution has been developed in the context of Sii-Mobility smart city mobility and transport national project and it is in use in other EC projects and solution such as Snap4City PCP EC and TRAFAIR CEF, but also for REPLICATE H2020 SCC1 and control room in Florence area.},

abstract={This smart city traffic management approach seeks to use edge-based video-stream processing (using multicore and GPU processors) at intersections and in public vehicles (city buses, fire trucks, ambulances, school buses) to convert video data into space-time trajectories of individual vehicles and pedestrians that are transmitted to a cloud-based system. Key information is then synthesized in the cloud from them to create a real-time city-wide traffic palette. Real-time or offline processing both at the edge and the cloud will then be leveraged to optimize intersection operations, manage network traffic, identify near-collisions between various units of traffic, provide street parking information, and a host of other applications. Additional information such as weather and environment will also be leveraged. The use of edge-based real-time machine learning (ML) techniques and videostream processing has several significant advantages. (1) Because there is no need to store copious amounts of video (few minutes typically suffice for edge-based processing), it automatically addresses concerns of public agencies who do not want person-identifiable information to be stored for reasons of citizen privacy and legality. (2) The processing of the video stream at the edge will allow for the use of low bandwidth communication using wireline and wireless networks to a central system such as a cloud, resulting in a compressed and holistic picture of the entire city. (3) The real-time nature of processing enables a wide variety of novel transportation applications at the intersection, street, and system levels that were not possible hitherto, significantly impacting safety and mobility.},

abstract={Building monitoring and management are some of the important components of smart cities. It provides valuable information to the city manager and power supplier to better optimize their resources. With a steady rise in electricity prices in recent years, the importance of efficient use of the Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems becomes vital since they contribute to more than 10% of building power consumption. Given the growth on the Internet of Things (IoT) more HVAC equipment is being deployed with sensors. These sensors can produce large amounts of data that can be transformed into knowledge about the operation of a building. In this paper, we examine a large amount of sensor data from a building with more than 200 rooms. We analyze the power consumption of the building and compare different algorithms to predict the power consumption of the building using indoor and outdoor temperatures. We compare 8 different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in order to examine their effectiveness. We then cluster rooms based on the temperature settings. Our evaluation results illustrate reasonable prediction accuracy and pinpoint several clusters with an inefficient temperature setting. The results can help the university to better utilize its resources and reduce the power consumption costs.},

abstract={Traffic situation in smart cities is getting worse day by day, which needs optimized control of traffic signals. This paper proposes a complete solution for real-time traffic signal control to reduce traffic congestion. For providing efficient solutions, we develop two machine-learning approaches, namely Edge based Traffic Light Control (ETLC) and Global Traffic Light Control (GTLC). The former approach is used to control traffic congestion for a smaller congested area and latter one provides the solution for the whole city. Both the approaches utilize real-time traffic data, generated from a vehicular traffic simulator, to solve the congestion problem in real-time. The ETLC approach identifies the most congested area through K-Means clustering and applies fuzzy logic for congestion removal. The GTLC approach identifies multiple congested areas using an occupancy threshold and reduces congestion. Our model is flexible to run each approach individually or integrate both the approaches to run sequentially. Comparison of the two approaches shows that the ETLC approach works better than GTLC approach for small areas. However, GTLC gives good results in peak congestions spanning larger areas.},

abstract={Smart environments, such as smart cities and smart homes, are Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPSs) which are becoming an increasing part of our everyday lives. Several applications in these systems, such as energy management through home appliance identification or activity recognition, adopt Machine Learning (ML) as a practical tool for extracting useful knowledge from raw data. These applications are usually characterized by a sequential stream of data, unlike the classical ML scenario in which the entire data is available during training. For such applications, Stream-based Active Learning (SAL) has been designed as a type of supervised ML in which an expert is asked to label the most informative instances as they arrive. Previous SAL techniques assume that the expert is always available and always labels the data correctly. However, in several applications, such as those mentioned above, the SAL activity interweaves with the everyday life of regular residents, who are often not experts, and may also not always be willing to participate in the labeling process. In this paper, we discuss the importance of user-centered ML, and show how taking into account realistic models of user behavior significantly improves the accuracy and reduces the training period of smart environment applications based on SAL. We consider two use cases, namely appliance identification and activity recognition. Results based on real data sets show an improvement in terms of accuracy up to 55.38%.},

abstract={The exponential growth of vehicular volume causes inevitable traffic congestions particularly in urban road networks. Road expansion to accommodate such situations can be very difficult especially when demolishing adjacent residential and commercial buildings is not possible. Effective traffic control systems are pivotal in ensuring progressive throughput of traffic by controlling the volume and sequence of vehicles traveling through intersections and avoiding motional conflicts. Relying on conventional fixed time plan systems deteriorates level of service and increases congestion due to adaptability deprivation to put up with random and continuous variation of traffic flows. The system can be too rigid, lacks the intelligence, not real-time adaptable and does not possess tunable decision-making capabilities. In this work, novel algorithms which transform simple vehicle actuation and multiplan algorithms into highly adaptable, flexible and intelligent systems are presented. These optimizations exhibit continuous learning of the flow variation using vehicle sensing data, making traffic control systems more resilient to random traffic patterns and potential sensor failures. Result when Auto-Revised VA Maximum Time plan in place is presented and discussed. It has shown an improvement in overall of 11.5% in green time allocation at an intersection while ensuring total waiting time is within the limits, thus increasing the efficiency of traffic flow offering road users potential travel time reduction.},

In this work, we make predictions about the statuses of the stations of the public bicycle service in Barcelona. We show that it is feasible to correctly predict nearly half of the times when the stations are either completely full of bikes or completely empty, up to 2 days before they actually happen. That is, users might avoid stations at times when they could not return a bicycle that they have rented before, or when they would not find a bike to rent. To achieve that, we apply the Random Forest algorithm to classify the status of the stations and improve the lifetime of the models using publicly available data, such as information about the weather forecast. Finally, we expect that the results of the predictions can be used to improve the quality of the service and make it more reliable for the users.},

abstract={It seems world organizations, because of Covid-19 disaster, are oriented considerably into smart cities quarantine capabilities, digital electronics interactions and digital economics.

Although we should not be pessimist about critical situations we're encountering in realization of smart cities, But we must be realist about serious dangers and high price of invasion of privacy in IoT systems. They could probably play major roles as command centers for organized international systematic crimes which will threaten human citizens. We should prepare ourselves technologically for this kind of conspiracy and how to solve this cultural problem. In this study Quantum Photonic Computers (QPC) are basically suggested as alternatives to defeat misusing of IoT -5G networks. It's directly related to our national security, specifically for non-anglophone nations. QPC, will work differently in comparison with classical digital computers. They work much more similar to human brain. Because physical properties of materials have been taken into account. We've used time-domain statistical dynamic Montecarlo method for our simulations of Photons' quantum switch behaviors. Errors in our estimations, compared with experiments, always are much less than or at most five percent. In contrast with classic computers that works symbolically, QPC will act physically according to quantum properties of real materials. In contrast with Digital computers that are human oriented, Quantum computers are nature oriented. For this nature friendly reason of QPC, they'll act as good alternatives in future 6G networks to avoid misusing 5GIoT revenues.},

abstract={Smart city infrastructure has a significant impact on improving the quality of humans life. However, a substantial increase in the urban population from the last few years poses challenges related to resource management, safety, and security. To ensure the safety and security in the smart city environment, this paper presents a novel approach by empowering the authorities to better visualize the threats, by identifying and predicting the highly-reported crime zones in the smart city. To this end, it first investigates the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to detect the hot-spots that have a higher risk of crime occurrence. Second, for crime prediction, Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is exploited in each dense crime region to predict the number of crime incidents in the future with spatial and temporal information. The proposed HDBSCAN and SARIMA based crime prediction model is evaluated on ten years of crime data (2008-2017) for New York City (NYC). The accuracy of the model is measured by considering different time scenarios such as the year-wise, (i.e., for each year), and for the total considered duration of ten years using an 80:20 ratio. The 80% of data was used for training and 20% for testing. The proposed approach outperforms with an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 11.47 as compared to the highest scoring DBSCAN based method with MAE 27.03.},

abstract={Typical cruise-line itineraries are planned more than a year in advance, so it is possible to know how many passengers arrive in advance months ahead, as well as when they leave and for how long they stay. Nevertheless, cruise passengers are often responsible of what is called “tourism crowding” that has a beneficial economic outcome for a destination, but often at the cost of increment of city traffic, overloading of the public transportation means and discomfort generated for residents. So, cruise tourism requires planning and management that takes into account also port city destinations factors. In this paper, we present a Deep Reinforcement Learning based planner for the onshore touristic itineraries and the intelligent distribution of cruise passengers in a city. The aim is to maximise the number of touristic attraction locations visited during a tour by avoiding the overcrowding of the touristic attraction locations. The planner is able to compose onshore touristic itineraries meeting the constraint given within the time window available for the cruise passengers, by taking into account the number of attraction locations available in the city together with dynamic parameters as their reception capacity and the time needed to go from one attraction to another.},

abstract={The article discusses the issues of models, tools and approaches to the smart cities subject area, which served as the basis for the standardization of the smart cities concept. Familiarity with these issues allows assess and understand the state of science in this field, which covers various aspects of the design, organization and operation of a smart city. As a result, the article gives presentation of different approach to smart cities creation. The authors urge to study in more detail certain aspects of the smart cities information technologies: digital economy, urban operating system, green energy, standards for transport movement, urban ecology. The article noted that today analysts are still discussing many proposed models and possible ways of transition to Smart City. The role of the Internet platforms in Smart Cities and various approaches to the implementation of the Smart City platforms themselves are shown. The paper compares various international approaches for smart cities creation and suggests that using project management methodologies is the best way for that goal. Project management allows maintain a balance between the total control of urban infrastructure and the right of residents for privacy. Meanwhile, many of us already live in a world of automated systems that manage urban infrastructure. The study emphasized ready-made information solutions exist that analyze large amounts of data using analytical forecasts and machine learning algorithms. In conclusion, it is noted that the main goal is that the introduction of the concept of smart cities should become a tool for the sustainable development of humankind while preserving the possibilities of freedom of choice and the inviolability of private life for a person, not transfer these functions to artificial intelligence.},

abstract={The research and development of autonomous vehicle has entered the era of commercialization. While the vehicle self-driving technology has been growing rapidly, the validation for autonomous vehicle in terms of driving model, human factor model and traffic model is still maturing. Most of previous infrastructures are mainly focused on validation of those three models separately resorting either on real driving test at physical infrastructure or software simulation in virtualized infrastructure. However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving. Furthermore, future autonomous transport in smart cities requires comprehensive validation. In order for autonomous vehicles to meet the autonomous transport in such complex traffic environment, an integrated testing and simulation infrastructure has been built targeting the systematic validation for autonomous vehicles: the Multi-User Environment for Autonomous Vehicle Innovation (MUEAVI). A preliminary investigation of a new autonomous vehicle validation infrastructure that can serve a multitude of research projects for smart city is presented.},

abstract={One of AI branch, Computer Vision-based recognition systems is necessary for security in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Traffic sign recognition systems are popularly used in AVs because it ensures driver safety and decrease vehicles accidents on roads. However, the inability of AVs to accurately detect road signs and pedestrian behaviour has led to road crashes and even death in recent times. Additionally, as cities become smarter, the traditional traffic signs dataset will change considerably, as theGoogle, 2020se vehicles and city infrastructure introduce modern facilities into their operation. In this paper, we introduce a computer vision based road surface marking recognition system to serve as an added layer of data source from which AVs will make decisions. We trained our detector using YOLOv3 running in the cloud to detect 25 classes of Road surface markings using over 25,000 images. The results of our experiment demonstrate a robust performance in terms of the accuracy and speed of detection. The results of which will consolidate the traffic sign recognition system, thereby ensuring more reliability and safety in AVs decision making. New algorithm using Deep Learning technology in Artificial intelligence (AI) application is implemented and tested successfully.},

abstract={In the world of human evolution, species with excellent physical and brain abilities do not survive, but only species with attributes that can adapt to the environment at each specific trend can survive. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the future smart city concept and structure, based on mechanism in human evolution. Our proposed platform consists of, 1) “the large archive which consists of many different AI models”, and 2) “various trials and update of AI models”. Then, we deploy these two functions into three hierarchy, i.e. cloud stratum, MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) stratum and Fog stratum. And these stratums should be nationwide common open platform. Consensus buildings are performed among the tracking and learning of Cloud stratum (wider & long-term in space-time zone), MEC (medium-term in space-time zone) and Fog (narrow & short-term in space-time zone) stratums. At the same time, according to the update of the currently used model, in cloud stratum, various trials are continuously operated in parallel, as background process. New AI models and modules are created, using the gathered historical data, the existing AI models and just finished AI modules. In addition, for this creation of new models, federated learning is carried out through AI, human control/knowledge and the social world. The federation/ensemble/transfer among the followings, bring about another mechanism of Human evolution: a) The large archive which consists of many different models, b) Various trials and update of models, c) Human knowledge/Intervention, and d) Social world (trend, opinion). If the existing models and modules can't cope with the big change, then the new model, which is the federation/ensemble/transfer of AI, human professional knowledge and social under the observed ongoing trend, appear. These federation/ensemble/transfer are effective for not only the adaptation to the new trend, but also the design of future smart city.},
