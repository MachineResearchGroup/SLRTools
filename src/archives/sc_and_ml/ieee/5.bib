abstract={Massive devices connected through fifth-generation (5G) networks constitute a ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT), providing diverse service applications in a smart city. A robust network topology structure against cyber-attacks is the foundation of highly reliable service quality, especially in next-generation networks or beyond 5G (B5G) networks. Existing methods apply neural networks with deep reinforcement learning methods to advance the network topology. However, the reduction of unique hardware resource constraints and the application of edge intelligent networking capability of terminal nodes are emerging challenges for robustness optimization of IoT with 5G and B5G networks. To address these problems, we design a distributed learning framework utilizing edge intelligence, improving smart terminal nodes' networking capability, which is deployed on ordinary computers instead of specialized hardware such as GPUs. The proposed framework leveraging multi-core CPU and intelligent edge methods decreases the training time and economic cost and takes full advantage of computer resources. Furthermore, the best performing framework considers the distributed communication model of edge computing and optimizes the network topology by taking advantage of smart terminal nodes' contributions. We show that the framework succeeds in various topologies and outperforms compared with other state-of-art algorithms in improving the robustness for IoT topology in smart cities.},

abstract={The emergence of a massive Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem is changing the human lifestyle. In several practical scenarios, IoT still faces significant challenges with reliance on human assistance and unacceptable response time for the treatment of big data. Therefore, it is very urgent to establish a new framework and algorithm to solve problems specific to this kind of fast autonomous IoT. Traditional reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have abilities of autonomous decision making, but time-consuming modeling and training procedures limit their applications. To get over this dilemma, this article proposes the broad reinforcement learning (BRL) approach that fits fast autonomous IoT as it combines the broad learning system (BLS) with a reinforcement learning paradigm to improve the agent's efficiency and accuracy of modeling and decision making. Specifically, a BRL framework is first constructed. Then, the associated learning algorithm, containing training pool introduction, training sample preparation, and incremental learning for BLS, is carefully designed. Finally, as a case study of fast autonomous IoT, the proposed BRL approach is applied to traffic light control, aiming to alleviate traffic congestion in the intersections of smart cities. The experimental results show that the proposed BRL approach can learn better action policy at a shorter execution time when compared with competing approaches.},

In this paper, the essential building blocks of the unified visual data management and analysis infrastructure that serve as the foundation for the economical visual system in the city brain, are introduced to facilitate the utilization of the visual signal in the artificial intelligence era. In particular, we start by the discussion of the front-end smart visual sensing in the context of economical communication and service with the heterogeneous network, and the functionalities and necessities of compact visual feature and deep learning model representations are detailed. Subsequently, the utilities of the infrastructure are demonstrated through two intelligent applications at the back-end, including vehicle re-identification and person re-identification. The standardizations regarding compact feature and deep neural network representations, which are regarded as the key ingredients in this infrastructure and greatly facilitate the construction of the visual system in the city brain, are also discussed.

abstract={With the modernization of smart cities and the technological advancement of the Internet of Things, we are now reaching a point where technology can be weaved into the fabric of our cities. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of using machine learning to recognize the profile of pedestrians based on their gait and silhouette with the use a thermal camera (FLIR Lepton) connected to a Raspberry Pi. We present the additional challenges faced by collecting gait data in a noisy environment, and by taking human identification a level of abstraction higher and recognizing categories of people. The far reaching implications of such a system in terms of accessibility, inclusivity and social participation of semi-autonomous populations are discussed. The hardware, software and cost of the handmade prototypes used for data collection are described. In an effort to take a step towards sustainable smart cities, the possibility of powering this system using solar panels is investigated. This paper aims to share the lessons learned throughout the creation and deployment of the system and to share the promising first results obtained by the team. We have reached an accuracy of 74.63% for binary age classification (adult, elder), 93.98% for mobility recognition (mobile subject, subject with reduced mobility), 85.77% for group size estimation (one subject, two subjects or more), and 77.29% for observed gender recognition (male, female) using a 2-layer CNN without any pre-processing on very low resolution thermal images.},

abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized today's Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services by introducing significant technological enhancements across a multitude of domains. With the deployment of the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication network, smart city visions of fast, on-demand, intelligent user-specific services are now becoming a reality. The concept of connected IoT is evolving into connected intelligent things. The advancements of both AI techniques, coupled with the sophistication of edge devices, is now leading to a new era of connected intelligence. Moving the intelligence toward end devices must account for latency demands and simplicity of selecting the type of AI technique to be used. Moreover, since most AI techniques require learning from big data sets and reasoning using a multitude of classification patterns, new simplified and collaborative solutions are now necessary more than ever. As such, the concept of introducing decentralized and distributed `Plug and Play' (PnP) AI tools is now becoming more attractive given the vast numbers in edge devices, data volume and AI techniques. To this end, this article envisions a novel general AI solution that can be adapted to autonomously select the type of machine learning (ML) algorithm, the data set to be used, and provide reasoning in regards to data selection for optimal features extraction. Moreover, the solution performs the necessary training and all the necessary parameter fine-tunings to achieve the highest level of generality and simplicity for AI at the edge. We explore several aspects related to PnP-AI and its impact in the smart city ecosystem.},

abstract={During the two sessions in 2020, the central government listed artificial intelligence as the core of a new round of industrial revolution. This paper systematically combs the artificial intelligence industry in Tianjin, divides the industry into three layers by weighted Bayesian classifier, and uses the grey correlation model to study the total output value of Tianjin and the industrial output value of related artificial intelligence in Tianjin from 2017 to 2019. From high to low, the correlation degree with the output value of Tianjin is: technology layer, foundation layer and application layer. The results of grey correlation analysis in this paper are consistent with the enterprise strategic cooperation and development focus led by Tianjin municipal government, but the correlation degree does not reach the expected level. The reason lies in the unbalanced development of artificial intelligence industry and insufficient development. Tianjin should establish a professional big data management department, focus on the introduction of professionals, further cooperate with university enterprises, establish a big data information monitoring and management department, and make reasonable planning for the introduced industries in the park, so as to become a first-class smart city in China.},

abstract={Surveillance videos are considered as a very important mechanism in a smart city project. In recent years, a method called deep learning was combined with reinforcement learning techniques to learn useful representations for the problems with high dimensional raw data input. In this paper, we develop a Deep Q Learning Network (DQN) to localize anomalies in videos by enabling the agent to learn how to detect and recognize the abnormalities in videos. Our idea is inspired by multiple instance learning (MIL) techniques based on common share features with reinforcement learning. We consider normal and abnormal videos as bags and the selection of videos clips as actions. In our DQN architecture we will design a fully connected layer, which compute probability for each video segment in both positive (anomalous) and negative(normal) bags indicating how likely a clip is containing an anomaly. Our method is applied to a new large-scale dataset of 128 hours of videos called UCF-Anomaly-Detection-Dataset, it is about of 1900 long and untrimmed real-world surveillance videos, with 13 cases of realistic anomalies.},

abstract={The prediction of traffic excesses (traffic congestions and traffic accidents) is become a very important topic for many cities and regions. The number of cars in cities and the total traffic volumes in cities are increasing over time, and solutions will be needed to eliminate traffic accidents and prevent secondary excesses. This will ideally lead to time savings for transport users and, above all, to an increase in the safety, fluidity and environmental performance of the transport itself. The article deals with a research activity that aims to develop a separate module in the form of a traffic application that will be able to predict traffic excesses. The neural networks were the main tool for the development of traffic applications for prediction, namely multilayer neural networks with activation function sigmoidou. With regard to the focus of the conference Smart City, the article does not focus on extensive development and testing of neural network, but primarily on the description of the functionalities of the result, including a critical commentary on the problems of the current state of the application.

abstract={Almost every larger city in Europe has ambitious smart city projects. This is particularly true for Hamburg, a Hanseatic city in the north of Germany. Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap. Active and non-destructive exploration is expected from an autonomous system to solve unexpected problems. Machine learning methods come into play which in turn have their own pitfalls. The author has built a specialized laboratory to investigate machine learning technology applied to autonomous systems. In this laboratory miniature autonomous vehicles are developed. The general idea of this experimental setup allows research on new methodologies for autonomous systems in a very small scale},

With their large amount of data, their ever changing multi-level dynamics, smart cities are too complex for a topdown approach. They prompt the need for a paradigm shift in computer science. Programs should be able to self-adapt on the fly, to handle unspecified events,, to efficiently deal with tremendous amount of data. To this end, bottom-up approach should become the norm.

year={2021},
volume={35},
number={4},
pages={176-183},
abstract={With the rapid development of smart city and 5G, user demand for Internet services has increased exponentially. Through collaborative content sharing, the storage limitation of a single edge server (ES) can be broken. However, when mobile users need to download the whole content through multiple regions, independently deciding the caching content for ESs in different regions may result in redundant caching. Furthermore, frequent switching of communication connection during user movement also causes retransmission delay. As a revolutionary approach in the artificial intelligence field, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has earned great success in solving high-dimensional and network resource management related problems. Therefore, we integrate collaborative caching and DRL to build an intelligent edge caching framework, so as to realize collaborative caching between cloud and ESs. In this caching framework, a fed-erated-machine-learning-based user behavior prediction model is first designed to characterize the content preference and movement trajectory of mobile users. Next, to achieve efficient resource aggregation of ESs, a user-behavior-aware dynamic collaborative caching domain (DCCD) construction and management mechanism is devised to divide ESs into clusters, select cluster heads, and set the re-clustering rules. Then a DRL-based content caching and delivery algorithm is presented to decide the caching content of ESs in a DCCD from a global perspective and plan the transmission path for users, which reduces redundant content and transmission delay. Especially when a user request cannot be satisfied by the current DCCD, a cross-domain content delivery strategy is presented to allow ESs in other DCCDs to provide and forward content to the user, avoiding the traffic pressure and delay caused by requesting services from cloud. The simulation results show that the proposed collaborative caching framework can improve user satisfaction in terms of content hit rate and service delay.},

abstract={Device authentication, encryption, and key distribution are of vital importance to any Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, such as the new smart city infrastructures. This is due to the concern that attackers could easily exploit the lack of strong security in IoT devices to gain unauthorized access to the system or to hijack IoT devices to perform denial-of-service attacks on other networks. With the rise of fog and edge computing in IoT systems, increasing numbers of IoT devices have been equipped with computing capabilities to perform data analysis with deep learning technologies. Deep learning on edge devices can be deployed in numerous applications, such as local cardiac arrhythmia detection on a smart sensing patch, but it is rarely applied to device authentication and wireless communication encryption. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight IoT device authentication, encryption, and key distribution approach using neural cryptosystems and binary latent space. The neural cryptosystems adopt three types of end-to-end encryption schemes: symmetric, public-key, and without keys. A series of experiments were conducted to test the performance and security strength of the proposed neural cryptosystems. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of this novel approach as a promising security and privacy solution for the next-generation of IoT systems.},

Smart transportation is one of the subsystems in a Smart city which consist of roads, vehicles, intersections, roadside units, traffic control systems, and so on. Many of these components needs to be connected to provide a smooth safe traffic in a smart city. The performance of these components largely depends on the computational latency of algorithms running on local or central processors. Hence, providing an optimized solution to minimize this delay is much needed. In this work, we propose a way to properly manage the flow of self-driving vehicle traffic at road junctions, taking into account pedestrian traffic. Self-driving vehicles are able to communicate with each other and smart devices along the road. However, surveillance cameras are needed to observe pedestrians” traffic at the intersection. Therefore, we use cameras, smart sensors, processors, and communication equipment embedded in self-driving vehicles and roadside smart devices to collect data, process it, and generate proper instructions to manage self-driving vehicles traffic flow at intersections. In this research we have used Simulation of Urban Mobility software to simulate traffic behaviors resulting from the use of the proposed solution. Although the simulation shows a smooth flow of traffic in a simple junction, a deep reinforcement learning approach is then proposed to manage traffic flow in multiple lane junctions. To decrease the risk of collision in intersections, a deep reinforcement approach that utilizes safety parameters for its reward function developed. The results illustrate noticeable decrease in collision at intersections.},

abstract={Edge Artificial Intelligence based traffic tracking and detecting sensors are very essential for smart cities, especially for smart transportation applications. These sensors are not only used to collect large amount of traffic data, but also reduce the bandwidth of the communication network to transfer and reduce the workload to process huge data on the cloud or server side. It is very necessary to process, store, and extract useful data at the edge of the Internet before transferring the data to central server which can be called Artificial Intelligence on The Edge. This research aims at studying, implementing and evaluating machine learning models which are suitable for running on limited computing embedded computers. Computer vision and real-time object detection techniques are applied on Nvidia Jetson Nano Embedded Computer to build an Edge-AI based traffic tracking and detecting sensor, two popular models (MobileNet-SSD and YOLOv4) have been studied and implemented to compare the performance on vehicle counting and license plate detection applications. There has been a new propose method to apply TensorRT engine for these two models to increase the processing speed. The data source used in this project is manually collected at actual traffic routes and parking lots in Vietnam with more than 11700 images of Vietnamese vehicles and license plates then trained on Google Colab. The performance evaluation results show that both models have high accuracy in real-time license plate detection and vehicle counting application when implemented on the Edge computer Jetson Nano with the mAPs of both model are higher than 90 percent during training session. The MobileNet-SSD model has good speed (40 FPS) which is very much faster than some previous works (25 FPS), this model is suitable for real-time applications. The YOLOv4 model, after being optimized by TensorRT engine, has a better speed (7.2 FPS) than the original version (1.7 FPS), although the YOLOv4 model has low speed than MobileNet-SSD model but can detect smaller size, this model is suitable for some applications that need to detect complicated objects with small sizes.},

In a Smart City, security aspects are going to be a major concern. Some drawbacks, such as vulnerabilities of a highly integrated system and information overload, must be considered. To overcome these downsides, an innovative predictive model for Smart City security risk assessment has been developed. Risk metrics and indicators are defined by considering data coming from a wide range of sensors. An innovative “what if” algorithm is introduced to identify critical infrastructures functional relationship.

abstract={A smart city is a collection of a variety of smart devices representing several disparate infrastructural verticals. The data gathered by these smart devices helps bring a strong integration of human, collective, and artificial intelligence within the city operation. With the advent and proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), the EV charge point is a relatively new addition to this plethora of smart devices. We believe that the EV charge point can acquire enhanced functionality if it can be seamlessly integrated with the rest of the smart city infrastructure. For example, charging services can be stopped if smart grid or smart fire alarms sense an electrical overload or fire hazard in the vicinity. However, the interaction of an EV charge point with the smart city infrastructure requires seamless information exchange across various verticals. This horizontal flow of information is enabled by making the charge point complaint with the oneM2M platform. To this end, we present the design and fabrication of an EV charge point based on the OCPP communication standard and complaint with the oneM2M platform. Further, we discuss various use cases showing an increased functional capability of the EV charger due to access to data from other IoT devices.},

Also, artificial intelligence (AI) is considered as a promising technology that will be applicable to numerous combined next generation applications including CPS, security, and communication in smart cities. However, cyber security based on AI technologies is still in its infancy and, in particular, the differential challenges or issues should be addressed for various AI-enabled applications and systems.

abstract={In the smart cities of the future, artificial intelligence will play significant role in enhancing efficiency of operations and utilization of city assets. The power grid is the preeminent asset of a city and consists of the cornerstone upon which residents' activities depend. In this paper, an intelligent control approach of energy consumption in smart cities is proposed. The intelligent controller integrates multiple kernel machines and fuzzy logic rules to optimize energy consumption within a city's infrastructure. The approach utilizes multiple pieces of information to define the percentage of the energy to be supplied at a specific area of the city. In particular, consumption control actions are driven by current as well predicted information. The kernel machines are utilized for prediction making while the fuzzy rules fuse information and provide the percentage of energy to be consumed. The proposed approach is tested on a set of simulated scenarios, where its applicability in smart cities is demonstrated.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to play a key role in intelligent transportation systems to complement the communication infrastructure in future smart cities. UAV-assisted vehicular networking research typically adopts throughput and latency as the main performance metrics. These conventional metrics, however, are not adequate to reflect the freshness of the information, an attribute that has been recently identified as a critical requirement to enable services such as autonomous driving and accident prevention. In this paper, we consider a UAV-assisted single-hop vehicular network, wherein sensors (e.g., LiDARs and cameras) on vehicles generate time sensitive data streams, and UAVs are used to collect and process this data while maintaining a minimum age of information (AoI). We aim to jointly optimize the trajectories of UAVs and find scheduling policies to keep the information fresh under minimum throughput constraints. The formulated optimization problem is shown to be mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and generally hard to be solved. Motivated by the success of machine learning (ML) techniques particularly deep learning in solving complex problems with low complexity, we reformulate the trajectories and scheduling policies problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the system state space considers the vehicular network dynamics. Then, we develop deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the vehicular environment and its dynamics in order to handle UAVs' trajectory and scheduling policy. In particular, we leverage Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for learning the trajectories of the deployed UAVs to efficiently minimize the Expected Weighted Sum AoI (EWSA). Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show the deployed UAVs adapt their velocities during the data collection mission in order to minimize the AoI.},

abstract={Traffic congestion is one of the common urban problems caused by increased traffic. Traffic congestion accelerates environmental pollution by wasting drivers’ time and fuel and generating more fumes. Therefore, traffic congestion is an important issue to be solved. Currently, as technologies develop, a smart city that efficiently manages data information collected is in the spotlight. The smart transportation system utilizes the infrastructure and network built in the smart city to analyze traffic flow and control traffic in real-time. Accordingly, traffic congestion can be effectively alleviated. This paper proposes a smart traffic signal control system using a Deep Q-network (DQN), a type of reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm distributes the optimal green signal time by collecting and learning information about the intersection situation. The proposed algorithm is designed to improve the performance in terms of throughput. As a result, the number of waiting vehicles also decreased. To validate the algorithm, we evaluate the performance in various traffic scenarios.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates information collected from multisources and is able to support various intelligent smart city applications, such as industrial manufacturing, power systems, and mobile healthcare. In the big data era, multisourced data are collected on a daily basis, whereas a large part of the data may be irrelevant, redundant, noisy, or even malicious from a machine learning perspective. Feature selection has been a powerful data cleaning technique to reduce data redundancy and improve system performance in machine learning. Inspired by reinforcement learning that learns from its experience, in this article, we propose a novel efficient deep $Q$ -network (DQN)-based feature selection method for multisourced data cleaning. In particular, we model the feature selection problem as a competition between an agent and the environment in dynamic states, which is solved by a DQN. Traditional DQN suffers from high computational complexity and requires a significant amount of time in order to converge in the training process. To tackle these challenges, we develop a space searching algorithm called SS to speed up the training process of the DQN agent. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various types of IoT data. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based feature selection algorithms achieve much better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, and are robust under data poisoning attacks.},

abstract={Recently, Combining communication technology with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been regarding as one of the promising techniques in the future network. Various services can be served through UAV, such as information collection in disaster area or traffic monitoring in smart city. However, on-board computation resource and the battery lifetime of UAV are limited. For that reason, there is a limit to perform analysis, such as, machine learning using collected data. In this situation, UAV can get help from an adjacent Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server that has computing resources. However, the closest MEC server does not always guarantee optimal computing performance and communication efficiency. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose the overall system of machine learning based UAV to MEC computation offloading for data analyzing. First, we define the problems into two. Firstly, we define two problems 1) matching UAV and task cluster in consideration of energy efficiency. 2) Finding optimal MEC server to offload the task to minimize the total processing time and energy consumption. Then, we apply a machine-learning algorithm to solve the two problems. In the simulation section, we analyze the proposed method and greedy method in terms of total energy consumption and total processing time. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism is efficient in total energy consumption of UAV and total processing time of tasks.},

abstract={Nowadays, enhancing the living standard with smart healthcare via the Internet of Things is one of the most critical goals of smart cities, in which artificial intelligence plays as the core technology. Many smart services, deployed according to wearable sensor-based physical activity recognition, have been able to early detect unhealthy daily behaviors and further medical risks. Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities. In this work, by revealing deep features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in fusion with conventional handcrafted features, we learn an intermediate fusion framework of human activity recognition (HAR). According to transforming the raw signal value to pixel intensity value, segmentation data acquired from a multisensor system are encoded to an activity image for deep model learning. Formulated by several novel residual triple convolutional blocks, the proposed DCNN allows extracting multiscale spatiotemporal signal-level and sensor-level correlations simultaneously from the activity image. In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Based on several experiments of performance evaluation, our fusion approach for activity recognition has achieved the accuracy over 96.0% on three public benchmark data sets, including Daily and Sport Activities, Daily Life Activities, and RealWorld. Furthermore, the method outperforms several state-of-the-art HAR approaches and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed intermediate fusion model in multisensor systems.},

abstract={Internet of Things(IoT) is one of the rapidly growing fields andn has a wide range of applications such as smart cities, smart homes, connected wearable, connected health-care, and connected automobiles, etc. These IoT applications generate tremendous amounts of data which needs to be analyzed to draw useful inferences required to optimize the performance of IoT applications. The artificial intelligence(AI) and machine learning (ML) play the significant role in building the smart IoT systems. The main objective of the paper is a comprehensive analysis of five well-known supervised machine learning algorithms on IoT datasets. The five classifiers are K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR). The feature reduction is performed using PCA algorithm. The performance of these five classifiers has been compared on the basis of six characteristics of IoT dataset such as size, number of features, number of classes, class imbalance, missing values and execution time. The classifiers have also been compared on various performance metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score, kappa, and accuracy.

abstract={Artificial Intelligence(AI) has become a global plat-form that allows objects in IoT to Interact and perform computations. The wide range of application areas of IoT are Smart Cities, Smart grids, Smart Supply chain and Ambient Assisted Living(AAL). These applications have challenges like tolerance to uncertainty,adaptiveness to the changing environment and improved trust among users. Thus, machine learning algorithms improve the performance of smart objects in various environment. The AAL environment deploys heterogeneous devices and sensors to capture various activities carried out through the daily by the individuals who resides in the smart home. In this work, an ensemble method using k-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Decision Tree(DT) and Logistic Regression(LR)is proposed by investigating the performance of existing conventional supervised machine learning algorithms and selecting best model by considering the sensors features and improves the performance metrics. The work is evaluated using the benchmark ARAS (Activity Recognition with Ambient Sensing) dataset. The results are analysed using different parameters. The comparative analysis show that the proposed ensemble method gives accuracy of 76.28%.},

abstract={We propose a cognitive healthcare framework that adopts the Internet of Things (IoT)-cloud technologies. This framework uses smart sensors for communications and deep learning for intelligent decision-making within the smart city perspective. The cognitive and smart framework monitors patients' state in real time and provides accurate, timely, and high-quality healthcare services at low cost. To assess the feasibility of the proposed framework, we present the experimental results of an EEG pathology classification technique that uses deep learning. We employ a range of healthcare smart sensors, including an EEG smart sensor, to record and monitor multimodal healthcare data continuously. The EEG signals from patients are transmitted via smart IoT devices to the cloud, where they are processed and sent to a cognitive module. The system determines the state of the patient by monitoring sensor readings, such as facial expressions, speech, EEG, movements, and gestures. The real-time decision, based on which the future course of action is taken, is made by the cognitive module. When information is transmitted to the deep learning module, the EEG signals are classified as pathologic or normal. The patient state monitoring and the EEG processing results are shared with healthcare providers, who can then assess the patient's condition and provide emergency help if the patient is in a critical state. The proposed deep learning model achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art systems.},

abstract={Urban resource scheduling is an important part of the development of a smart city, and transportation resources are the main components of urban resources. Currently, a series of problems with transportation resources such as unbalanced distribution and road congestion disrupt the scheduling discipline. Therefore, it is significant to predict travel demand for urban resource dispatching. Previously, the traditional time series models were used to forecast travel demand, such as AR, ARIMA and so on. However, the prediction efficiency of these methods is poor and the training time is too long. In order to improve the performance, deep learning is used to assist prediction. But most of the deep learning methods only utilize temporal dependence or spatial dependence of data in the forecasting process. To address these limitations, a novel deep learning traffic demand forecasting framework which based on Deep Spatio-Temporal ConvLSTM is proposed in this paper. In order to evaluate the performance of the framework, an end-to- end deep learning system is designed and a real dataset is used. Furthermore, the proposed method can capture temporal dependence and spatial dependence simultaneously. The closeness, period and trend components of spatio-temporal data are used in three predicted branches. These branches have the same network structures, but do not share weights. Then a linear fusion method is used to get the final result. Finally, the experimental results on DIDI order dataset of Chengdu demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional models with accuracy and speed.},

abstract={Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) will be a major component of tomorrow's smart cities. However, realizing the true potential of ITSs requires ultralow latency and reliable data analytics solutions that combine, in real time, a heterogeneous mix of data stemming from the ITS network and its environment. Such data analytics capabilities cannot be provided by conventional cloud-centric data processing techniques whose communication and computing latency can be high. Instead, edge-centric solutions that are tailored to the unique ITS environment must be developed. In this article, an edge analytics architecture for ITSs is introduced in which data is processed at the vehicle or roadside smart sensor level to overcome the ITS's latency and reliability challenges. With a higher capability of passengers' mobile devices and intravehicle processors, such a distributed edge computing architecture leverages deep-learning techniques for reliable mobile sensing in ITSs. In this context, the ITS mobile edge analytics challenges pertaining to heterogeneous data, autonomous control, vehicular platoon control, and cyberphysical security are investigated. Then, different deep-learning solutions for such challenges are revealed. The discussed deep-learning solutions enable ITS edge analytics by endowing the ITS devices with powerful computer vision and signal processing functions. Preliminary results show that the introduced edge analytics architecture, coupled with the power of deep-learning algorithms, provides a reliable, secure, and truly smart transportation environment.},

abstract={With the unprecedented advancement of sensing technology, smart city applications are now enriched with massive measurement data related to system states, patterns, and the behavior of its users. However, classic data analysis or machine learning tools ignore some unique characteristics of the multistream measurement data, in particular, the coexistence of strong temporal correlation and interstream relatedness. To this end, in this paper we discuss the problem of novelty detection with multiple coevolving time series data. To capture both the temporal dependence and the interseries relatedness, a multitask nonparametric model is proposed, which can be extended to family of data distributions by adopting the notion of Bregman divergence. Albeit convex, the learning problem can be hard as the time series accumulate. In this regard, an efficient randomized block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed. The model and the algorithm is tested with a real-world application, involving novelty detection and event analysis in smart city power distribution networks with high-resolution multistream measurements. It is shown that the incorporation of interseries relatedness enables the detection of system-level events, which would otherwise be unobservable with traditional methods. The experimental results not only justify the benefits of incorporating information from different sources, but also demonstrate the potential of the proposed multistream analysis tool as one of the core computational components to improve smart city observability, security, and reliability.},

And not using flexible languages and predictive models, pushing them towards a larger range of virtuous habits. On this regards, the main problems are the computation of user behavior via data analytic (semantic computing, machine learning), as well as the formalization of strategies via simple and well formalized language for producing engagements to the city users, which can be understood by city operators.

abstract={Age estimation is a difficult task which requires the automatic detection and interpretation of facial features. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made remarkable improvement on learning age patterns from benchmark datasets. However, for a face ``in the wild'' (from a video frame or Internet), the existing algorithms are not as accurate as for a frontal and neutral face. In addition, with the increasing number of in-the- wild aging data, the computation speed of existing deep learning platforms becomes another crucial issue. In this paper, we propose a high-efficient age estimation system with joint optimization of age estimation algorithm and deep learning system. Cooperated with the city surveillance network, this system can provide age group analysis for intelligent demographics. First, we build a three- tier fog computing architecture including an edge, a fog and a cloud layer, which directly processes age estimation from raw videos. Second, we optimize the age estimation algorithm based on CNNs with label distribution and K-L divergence distance embedded in the fog layer and evaluate the model on the latest wild aging dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that: 1. our system collects the demographics data dynamically at far-distance without contact, and makes the city population analysis automatically; and 2. the age model training has been speed-up without losing training progress or model quality. To our best knowledge, this is the first intelligent demographics system which has potential applications in improving the efficiency of smart cities and urban living.},

abstract={The acquisition of massive data on parcel delivery motivates postal operators to foster the development of predictive systems to improve customer service. Predicting delivery times successive to being shipped out of the final depot, referred to as last-mile prediction, deals with complicating factors such as traffic, drivers’ behaviors, and weather. This work studies the use of deep learning for solving a real-world case of last-mile parcel delivery time prediction. We present our solution under the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm and discuss its feasibility on a cloud-based architecture as a smart city application. We focus on a large-scale parcel data set provided by Canada Post, covering the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). We utilize an origin-destination (OD) formulation, in which routes are not available, but only the start and end delivery points. We investigate three categories of convolutional-based neural networks and assess their performances on the task. We further demonstrate how our modeling outperforms several baselines, from classical machine learning models to referenced OD solutions. We perform a thorough error analysis across the data and visualize the deep features learned to better understand the model behavior, making interesting remarks on data predictability. Our work provides an end-to-end neural pipeline that leverages parcel OD data as well as weather to accurately predict delivery durations. We believe that our system has the potential not only to improve user experience by better modeling their anticipation but also to aid last-mile postal logistics as a whole.},

abstract={Accurate traffic prediction can benefit many smart city applications. Existing works mainly consider traffic prediction on each individual road segment, and heavily rely on some statistical or machine learning models, which suffer from either poor prediction accuracy or high computation overheads for predictions of the whole road network. In this paper, we instead consider the region-level traffic prediction that is still useful for many applications. To describe the regional traffic conditions and capture their spatio-temporal dependencies, we present a deep learning based model - DeepRTP. Specifically, we use a novel metric called Traffic State Index (TSI) to measure regional traffic conditions, and carefully classify traffic data into three categories that are used to capture hourly, daily, and weekly traffic patterns. Furthermore, we employ the convolutional and residual neural networks to model both spatial and temporal dependencies. Experimental results from real-world traffic data demonstrate that DeepRTP outperforms five baseline methods and can achieve higher prediction accuracy.},

abstract={The grid denotes the electric grid which consists of communication lines, control stations, transformers, and distributors that aids in supplying power from the electrical plant to the consumers. Presently, the electric grid constitutes humongous power production units which generates millions of megawatts of power distributed across several demographic regions. There is a dire need to efficiently manage this power supplied to the various consumer domains such as industries, smart cities, household and organizations. In this regard, a smart grid with intelligent systems is being deployed to cater the dynamic power requirements. A smart grid system follows the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) model, in which Information Technology (IT) infrastructure is integrated with physical systems. In the scenario of the smart grid embedded with CPS, the Machine Learning (ML) module is the IT aspect and the power dissipation units are the physical entities. In this research, a novel Multidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (MLSTM) technique is being proposed to predict the stability of the smart grid network. The results obtained are evaluated against other popular Deep Learning approaches such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), traditional LSTM and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The experimental results prove that the MLSTM approach outperforms the other ML approaches.},

abstract={Smart cities, utilities, third-parties, and government agencies are having pressure on managing stochastic power generation from distributed rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays, such as predicting and reacting to the variations in electric grid. Recently, there is a rising interest to identify solar PV arrays automatically and passively. Traditional approaches such as online assessment and utilities interconnection filings are time consuming and costly, and limited in geospatial resolution, and thus do not scale up to every location. Significant recent work focuses on using aerial imagery to train machine learning or deep learning models to automatically detect solar PV arrays. Unfortunately, these approaches typically require Very High Resolution (VHR) images and human handcrafted solar PV array templates for training, which have a minimum cost of $15 per km2 and are not always available at every location.To address the problem, we design a new system—SolarFinder that can automatically detect distributed solar PV arrays in a given geospatial region without any extra cost. SolarFinder first automatically fetches regular resolution satellite images within the region using publicly-available imagery APIs. Then, SolarFinder leverages multi-dimensional K-means algorithm to automatically segment solar arrays on rooftop images. Eventually, SolarFinder employs hybrid linear regression approach that integrates support vector machine (SVM) modeling with a deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) approach to accurately identify solar PV arrays and characterize each solar deployment. We evaluate SolarFinder using 269,632 satellite images that include 1,143,636 contours from 13 geospatial regions in U.S. We find that pre-trained SolarFinder yields a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.17, which is 3 times better than the most recent pre-trained CNNs approach and the same as a re-trained CNNs approach.},

abstract={Low power wide area networks support the success of long range Internet of things applications such as agriculture, security, smart cities and homes.

To this end, smart spectrum decisions are needed and will be supported by wireless technology recognition to allow the networks to dynamically adapt to the ever changing environment where fair co-existence with other wireless technologies becomes essential. In contrast to existing research that assesses technology recognition using machine learning on powerful graphics processing units, this work aims to propose a deep learning solution using convolutional neural networks, cheap software defined radios and efficient embedded platforms such as NVIDIA's Jetson Nano. More specifically, this paper presents low complexity near-real time multi-band sub-GHz technology recognition and supports a wide variety of technologies using multiple settings. Results show accuracies around 99%, which are comparable with state of the art solutions, while the classification time on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano remains small and offers real-time execution. These results will enable smart spectrum management without the need of expensive and high power consuming hardware.},

abstract={Traffic prediction and analysis is an essential task towards intelligent mobility, particularly for path planning and navigation. When the traffic flow starts after the COVID-19 pandemic is subsided, the mobility patterns changes and may become unpredictable or challenging. This problem may be crucial, particularly if many people hurry to single occupancy transport mode. Notably, the rapid development in machine learning with new methods and the emergence of new data sources make it possible to evaluate and predict traffic conditions in smart cities more quickly and precisely. The proposed work is modeled in two-fold manner to investigate the impact of COVID shift in regular urban traffic movements given the particular period of the pre, during, and post lockdown phases. Firstly, the investigation is carried out for time series analysis considering the three phases of lockdown. Secondly, the real-time spatial information is analyzed for different time zones in a day. Notably, this requires a detailed analysis of the heterogeneous and complex input traffic data. Machine learning and advanced deep learning methodologies such as regression models, RNN, variants of LSTM, and GRU is used for analysis in this proposed traffic modeling. Significantly, the least error scores with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) loss of 1.82 is observed for the RNN and GRU models, and 0.058 with the Gradient Boosting regression analysis, respectively.},

abstract={As a significant issue in the development of Smart City, traffic light control is closely related to public transport. Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a feasible paradigm to control decentralized systems. In this work, we design a recurrent communication module for traffic light control systems. Aiming at lightweight decentralized learning, we decouple the interaction among entities, using an improved recurrent neural network to share messages. Regarding traffic lights as a partially observable Markov Decision Process, we develop a complete reinforcement learning model. Every light receives messages from its neighbors through the improved recurrent neural network. For the further lights, its neighbor lights can play the role of intermediation to transmit messages. By our communication framework, traffic lights can learn their control policies in a decentralized way, and distribution control can be executed through a communication channel. Several simulated experiments show that our method outperforms the fixed time method and the existing reinforcement learning-based frameworks under different traffic demands.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing in recent years with the improvements in several different applications in the military, marine, intelligent transportation, smart health, smart grid, smart home and smart city domains. Although IoT brings significant advantages over traditional information and communication (ICT) technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), these applications are still very rare. Although there is a continuous improvement in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in IoT, the road traffic accidents have been increasing over the last decades. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent traffic accident detection system in which vehicles exchange their microscopic vehicle variables with each other. The proposed system uses simulated data collected from vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) based on the speeds and coordinates of the vehicles and then, it sends traffic alerts to the drivers. Furthermore, it shows how machine learning methods can be exploited to detect accidents on freeways in ITS. It is shown that if position and velocity values of every vehicle are given, vehicles' behavior could be analyzed and accidents can be detected easily. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) are implemented on traffic data to develop a model to distinguish accident cases from normal cases. The performance of RF algorithm, in terms of its accuracy, was found superior to ANN and SVM algorithms. RF algorithm has showed better performance with 91.56% accuracy than SVM with 88.71% and ANN with 90.02% accuracy.},

abstract={With the application of mobile computing in the security field, security monitoring big data has also begun to emerge, providing favorable support for smart city construction and city-scale and investment expansion. Mobile computing takes full advantage of the computing power and communication capabilities of various sensing devices and uses these devices to form a computing cluster. When using such clusters for training of distributed machine learning models, the load imbalance and network transmission delay result in low efficiency of model training. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed machine learning parameter communication consistency model based on the parameter server idea, which is called the limited synchronous parallel model. The model is based on the fault-tolerant characteristics of the machine learning algorithm, and it dynamically limits the size of the synchronization barrier of the parameter server, reduces the synchronization communication overhead, and ensures the accuracy of the model training; thus, the model realizes finite asynchronous calculation between the worker nodes and gives full play to the overall performance of the cluster. The implementation of cluster dynamic load balancing experiments shows that the model can fully utilize the cluster performance during the training of distributed machine learning models to ensure the accuracy of the model and improve the training speed.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) applications have been deployed in several domains, including health care, smart cities, and agriculture. Because of the complex static and dynamic variability of the environment in which these applications are deployed, machine learning-based approaches have been used to support the design of IoT applications. In particular, an emergent approach involves using neural networks to enable IoT devices to learn to adapt their behavior based on the dynamics of the environment. Designing IoT systems is already challenging because of the autonomy and concurrency inherent in distributed physical systems. Moreover, neural networks systems have particular characteristics, such as dynamism, adaptability, and generalization, that make it necessary to adapt the traditional software development lifecycle to satisfy the requirements of these systems. In this paper, we describe our proposed approach to support the engineering of IoT neural network-based systems. Our approach considers a lifecycle supporting the integration of IoT system development tasks with particular ANN tasks, as model requirements and feature engineering.

Air pollution causes noticeable damage to the environment as well as to human health resulting into acid rain, global warming, heart diseases and skin cancer to the people. This paper addresses the challenge of predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI), with the aim to minimize the pollution before it gets adverse, using two Machine Learning Algorithms: Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.

Usually, such methods require high-complexity image processing techniques and algorithms. Hence, the design of low-complexity automated object detection algorithms becomes an important topic in this area. We consider a foreground extraction and deep learning to achieve these goals. A novel unified technique is proposed to detect a moving object from the surveillance videos based on CPU (central processing units). Unlike most of the existing methods that are relying on pixel information, we use a block-based texture and spatial-temporal information. We use this method to determine the area of the detected moving object(s) only. Furthermore, the area will be processed through a deep learning-based image classification in GPU (graphics processing units) in order to ensure high efficiency and accuracy. It cannot only help to detect object rapidly and accurately, but also can reduce big data volume needed to be stored in smart surveillance systems.},

For predicting the load profile the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and deep learning models such as recurrent neural network (RNN), long short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) model are considered in this paper.

abstract={Smart city is a key component in Internet of Things, so it has attracted much attention. The emergence of mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems enables many smart city applications. In an MCS system, sensing tasks are allocated to a number of mobile users. As a result, the sensing related context of each mobile user plays a significant role on service quality. However, some important sensing context is ignored in the literature. This motivates us to propose a context-aware multiarmed bandit (C-MAB) incentive mechanism to facilitate quality-based worker selection in an MCS system. We evaluate a worker's service quality by its context (i.e., extrinsic ability and intrinsic ability) and cost. Based on our proposed C-MAB incentive mechanism and quality evaluation design, we develop a modified Thompson sampling worker selection (MTS-WS) algorithm to select workers in a reinforcement learning manner. MTS-WS is able to choose effective workers because it can maintain accurate worker quality information by updating evaluation parameters according to the status of task accomplishment. We theoretically prove that our C-MAB incentive mechanism is selection efficient, computationally efficient, individually rational, and truthful. Finally, we evaluate our MTS-WS algorithm on simulated and real-world datasets in comparison with some other classic algorithms. Our evaluation results demonstrate that MTS-WS achieves the highest cumulative utility of the requester and social welfare.},

IoT sensors for detecting blocked gullies and drainages are notoriously hard to build, hence we propose a novel technique to utilise deep learning for building an IoT-enabled smart camera to address this need. In our work, we apply deep leaning to classify drain blockage images to develop an effective image classification model for different severity of blockages. Using this model, an image can be analysed and classified in number of classes depending upon the context of the image. In building such model, we explored the use of filtering in terms of segmentation as one of the approaches to increase the accuracy of classification by concentrating only into the area of interest within the image. Segmentation is applied in data pre-processing stage in our application before the training. We used crowdsourced publicly available images to train and test our model. Our model with segmentation showed an improvement in the classification accuracy.},

abstract={License plate recognition systems are widely used in modern smart cities, such as toll payment systems, parking fee payment systems and residential access control. Such electronic systems are not only convenient for people's daily life, but also provide safe and efficient services for managers. License plate recognition algorithm is a mature but imperfect technology. The traditional location recognition algorithm is easily affected by light, shadow, background complexity or other factors, resulting in the failure to meet the application of real scenes. With the development of deep learning, the license plate recognition algorithm can extract deeper features, thus greatly improving the detection and recognition accuracy. Therefore, this paper discusses the application of deep learning in license plate recognition, and the main work is as follows: 1) Introduce the most advanced algorithms from the three main technical difficulties: license plate skew, image noise and license plate blur; 2) According to the process, the deep learning algorithms are classified into direct detection algorithms and indirect detection algorithms, and the advantages and disadvantages of the current license plate detection algorithms and character recognition algorithms are analyzed; 3) The differences in data sets, workstation, accuracy and time of different license plate recognition systems are compared; 4) Compare and illustrate the existing public license plate datasets according to the number of pictures, resolution and environmental complexity, and make a prospect for the future research direction of license plate recognition.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities, more and more types of applications have been emerging. In fact, different applications have different features and different requirements on services. In order to satisfy users' Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, the application-awareness technique should be leveraged to distinguish different applications for providing the differentiated services. However, the traditional Internet only can obtain the local network view, which belongs to the offline awareness mode and cannot adapt to the dynamical network environment. At the right time, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been accepted as a new networking paradigm thanks to its network awareness on the global status information, which can greatly facilitate the online application-awareness. At present, three ways, i.e., port number, depth packet inspection and deep learning can be used for the application-awareness. To the best of our knowledge, the deep learning based application-awareness method is the most cutting-edge technique. In spite of this, the previous related schemes fail to effectively guarantee the correctness and stability. To this end, this paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning mechanism to do the application-awareness, including three phases, i.e., traffic collection, data pre-processing and application-awareness. The SDN environment is implemented based on the MiniNet and the simulation experiments are made based on the TensorFlow. The experimental results show that the proposed application-awareness mechanism outperforms three benchmarks on recall ratio, precision ratio, F value and stability.},

The infrastructure enables us to build smart environments for spectrum utilization, which we refer to as Smart Spectrum Utilization (SSU). This paper presents an integrated system consisting of SSU with IoV. However, the tasks of securing IoV and protecting it from cyber attacks present considerable challenges. This paper introduces an IoV security system using deep learning approach to develop secure applications and reliable services. Deep learning composed of unsupervised learning and supervised learning, could optimize the IoV security system. The deep learning methodology is applied to monitor security threats. Results from simulations show that the monitoring accuracy of the proposed security system is superior to that of the traditional system.},

abstract={Fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are designed to meet various end-user quality of service (QoS) requirements through high data rates (typically of gigabits per second) and low latencies. Coupled with fog and mobile edge computing, 5G can achieve high data rates, enabling complex autonomous smart city services such as the large deployment of self-driving vehicles and large-scale artificial-intelligence-enabled industrial manufacturing. However, to meet the exponentially growing number of connected IoT devices and irregular data and service requests in both low- and high-density locations, the process of enacting traditional cells supported through fixed and costly base stations requires rethought to enable on-demand mobile access points in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for diversified smart city scenarios. This article envisions a 5G network environment that is supported by blockchain-enabled UAVs to meet dynamic user demands with network access supply. The solution enables decentralized service delivery (drones as a service) and routing to and from end users in a reliable and secure manner. Both public and private blockchains are deployed within the UAVs, supported by fog and cloud computing devices and data centers to provide a wide range of complex authenticated service and data availability. Particular attention is paid to comparing data delivery success rates and message exchange in the proposed solution against traditional UAV-supported cellular networks. Challenges and future research are also discussed with highlights on emerging technologies such as federated learning.},

abstract={Timely and efficient analysis of big data collected from various gateways installed in a smart city is an intractable problem and requires immediate priority. Given the stochastic and massive nature of big data, the existing literature often relies on artificial intelligence techniques based on information theory. As a new approach, this paper presents a knowledge extraction method based on an analysis of Seoul Metro's 'untraceable' ridership big data. Without identification information, the untraceable ridership data only shows the hourly accumulation of station entry and exit information. To reconstruct the missing information in the data set, this study proposes a fluid dynamics model and adopts a heuristic genetic algorithm based on optimization theory as the problem solver. The result of our model presents the distribution of the elapsed time defined on an hourly basis taken until a passenger returns to the station they departed from. To validate our model, we acquired subway ridership data with passengers' identification with permission from Seoul Metro. This paper presents two novel aspects of subway ridership, namely the dependency on departure time and the discrepancy between weekend and weekday traffic. Our analytical approach contributes to solving the problem of extracting hidden knowledge from big collection of data missing critical information, e.g., constantly and autonomously gathered data fragments from numerous gateways in smart cities.},

Technologically-enabled `Smart Cities' are rising to meet these needs, which include smarter sustainability, cybersecurity, transportation, waste management, energy efficiency, education, among many other areas, all toward enhancing the quality of life of citizens. These cities leverage the capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and the service economy to infuse sensing and information delivery into everyday life through the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence. However, the size of a city and its population make it difficult to evaluate smart solutions. In this work, the `Smart Stadium' is proposed as a testbed to trial Smart City technologies in an environment small enough to facilitate user trials yet large enough to produce scalable outcomes. Our previous proof-of-concepts are summarized to highlight the potential of this approach.

abstract={America's critical infrastructure is becoming “smarter”and increasingly dependent on highly specialized computers called industrial control systems (ICS). Networked ICS components now called the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are at the heart of the “smart city”, controlling critical infrastructure, such as CCTV security networks, electric grids, water networks, and transportation systems. Without the continuous, reliable functioning of these assets, economic and social disruption will ensue. Unfortunately, IIoT are hackable and difficult to secure from cyberattacks. This leaves our future smart cities in a state of perpetual uncertainty and the risk that the stability of our lives will be upended. The Local government has largely been absent from conversations about cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, despite its importance. One reason for this is public administrators do not have a good way of knowing which assets and which components of those assets are at the greatest risk. This is further complicated by the highly technical nature of the tools and techniques required to assess these risks. Using artificial intelligence planning techniques, an automated tool can be developed to evaluate the cyber risks to critical infrastructure. It can be used to automatically identify the adversarial strategies (attack trees) that can compromise these systems. This tool can enable both security novices and specialists to identify attack pathways. We propose and provide an example of an automated attack generation method that can produce detailed, scalable, and consistent attack trees-the first step in securing critical infrastructure from cyberattack.},

Smart healthcare, as an important part of smart cities, constitutes one of the most essential pillars of social and economic stability. Despite all the possibilities offered by smart healthcare, how to handle the dark aspects of smart healthcare such as security, privacy and trust issues, and so on remains unsolved. In this paper, we focus on designing a human-in-the-loop-aided (HitL-aided) scheme to preserve privacy in smart healthcare. On the one hand, a block design technique is employed to obfuscate various health indicators from the hospitals and the smart wearable devices. On the other hand, human-in-the-loop (HitL) is introduced to enable a privacy access of the health reports from the smart healthcare platform. In addition, the performance analysis and case study indicate that the proposed HitL-aided scheme is effective in preserving privacy for smart healthcare.},

abstract={LoRa wireless networks are considered as a key enabling technology for next generation internet of things (IoT) systems. New IoT deployments (e.g., smart city scenarios) can have thousands of devices per square kilometer leading to huge amount of power consumption to provide connectivity. In this paper, we investigate green LoRa wireless networks powered by a hybrid of the grid and renewable energy sources, which can benefit from harvested energy while dealing with the intermittent supply. This paper proposes resource management schemes of the limited number of channels and spreading factors (SFs) with the objective of improving the LoRa gateway energy efficiency. First, the problem of grid power consumption minimization while satisfying the system’s quality of service demands is formulated. Specifically, both scenarios the uncorrelated and time-correlated channels are investigated. The optimal resource management problem is solved by decoupling the formulated problem into two sub-problems: channel and SF assignment problem and energy management problem. Since the optimal solution is obtained with high complexity, online resource management heuristic algorithms that minimize the grid energy consumption are proposed. Finally, taking into account the channel and energy correlation, adaptable resource management schemes based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), are developed. Simulations results show that the proposed resource management schemes offer efficient use of renewable energy in LoRa wireless networks.},

abstract={Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has been widely used as a cost-efcient way to collect data for smart cities, which typically starts with participant recruitment and task allocation. Previous work mainly focused on selecting a proper subset of humans for contributing sensing data. However, there often exist situations where humans are not able to reach the target areas, such as traffic jams or accidents. One solution is to complement manual data collection with autonomous data collection using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors. In this paper, we focus on the scenarios of UAV-assisted MCS and propose a highly efficient task allocation method, called UMA (UAV-assisted Multi-task Allocation method) to jointly optimize the sensing coverage and data quality. The method incentivizes and guides human participants to contribute high-quality sensing data. Meanwhile, the UAVs are employed to sense data from rarely sensed points of interest, and calibrate data contributed by human participants. The method leverages emerging deep reinforcement learning techniques for directing UAVs sensing and movement actions based on the human participants locations and tasks achievement. The results well justify the efficiency of UMA in terms of coverage completed ratio, calibrating ratio, task fairness and energy efficiency, compared with the state-of-the-art.},

abstract={With the recent trends of smart cities, the development in the sector of Smart Buildings has emerged tremendously which consists of multiple layers coordinating and interacting with each other with the help of a building management system (BMS). This interaction of different layers in the smart building with the help of a communication channel leads to exposure of layers to vulnerabilities (cyber attacks) which may lead to anomalies condition. This kind of anomalies can be avoided by proper prediction of data and coordination among different layers of the building operation. However, to develop the model for prediction of data is quite time consuming and hence, the paper proposes the concept of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for predicting data with help of past available data even in absence of system model. In this paper temperature profile of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in BMS is predicted with the help of available past data. Once the prediction of the temperature profile is achieved the machine learning algorithm is used to classify and identify the data as normal or anomalies condition. The two-fold contribution of the paper in the prediction of temperature using DMD where all system states may not be observable and classification of data using machine learning is validated considering different test scenarios and results show the effectiveness of the DMD method in the prediction of data as well as classification using a machine learning algorithm.},

abstract={The rapid development of the internet of things (IoT)promotes research in smart city and Fog computing. The vast volume of real-time visual data produced from the tremendous end devices in IoT is a big challenge for the network to transmit and for the data center to store. The typical case is the huge volume of visual data produced by the surveillance cameras in a smart city. In this paper, we consider the problem of how to allocate the calculation ability of the Fog node to handle the surveillance data to obtain low delay meanwhile maintain the video quality. To solve this challenge, we attempt to reduce the tremendous video data using deep learning models in the computational Fog node and optimize the transmission function for high efficiency. To reduce data, we extract video feature and keep salient zones with high resolution meanwhile leave the unavoidable distortion in less important areas. To obtain the least transmission delay under the dynamic bandwidth in Fog computing, we model the transmission delay function and solve it by Lagrangian dual decomposition. We make experiments on public dataset Cityscapes and 4G/LTE Bandwidth Log to evaluate our method. The experiment results show that our feature-based image processing method obtains around 68.7% higher average SSIM (structural similarity index)than the traditional HEVC in the salient zones, and our solution reduces the system delay by 71.02 % comparing with the plain transmission method. It proves our solution reduces the video transmission latency meanwhile keeps the SSIM of salient areas in the video.},

abstract={Nowadays, there are more cars used on the road. Traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%. In addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city. The project has created the learning environment and computational thinking for society through the process of STEM Education with using IoT and Artificial Intelligence.},

abstract={Many cities around the world are implementing a surveillance system in their streets. Commonly the system is a network of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) spread across the city. The number of mounted CCTV are varied, 150 cameras by “Bandung Command Center” to hundreds of thousands of cameras by the renowned “City of London Police”. This large gap of total cameras is very reasonable considering the difference in the amount of budget allocated by each city, where Bandung is a city in developing country while London is the capital of a developed country. Furthermore, the CCTV network is not a cheap technology. In 2014, Bandung's mayor allocates IDR 3.2 billion (about USD 222 thousand) just to put 80 cameras on streets. The cost structure alone can be a big wall hindering a city to be a smart city in the surveillance aspect. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient smart CCTV concept that designed with cheaper materials, implemented the concept of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and also enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI). By implementing the proposed concept, a same amount of budget as Bandung mayor in 2014 can be used to implement 300 cameras, an increase of 375 % compared to the original.},

abstract={Will we maintain our dominant position as a dominant species - is this a big fear for humanity about new technologies in the future? In other words, is there a chance that machines and artificial intelligence will displace people. These technologies are aimed at facilitating the lives of people and business organizations, supporting this statement is the current work. The article shows how to select smart city cadres, making it quick, easy and convenient for all stakeholders in the process. The benefits are reciprocal - for people and organizations - by implementing the idea of Smart People Recruiting, it will lead to a reduction in the negative economic phenomenon of unemployment. Technology will not only replace people but increase their standard of living.},

abstract={Society 5.0 refers to an advanced society based on big data, artificial intelligence, sensors, and robots to improve many aspects of life in a smart city. The role of sensors in Society 5.0 is critical. Sensors and the Internet of Things can be considered to work as a service system. Specifically, sensors can track millions of objects to support city security. This article considers the competitive sensor networks in terms of Quality of Service, which can be quantified by service price. The sensors are modeled as an $M/M/1/n$ queueing service system with a location on a secured grid area. A competitive admission fee is considered for tracking orders from society, which makes the arriving tracking demands price-sensitive. Moreover, a bi-level nonlinear program is developed wherein the first level maximizes the sensors’ revenue and social benefit revenue while also minimizing the wait time of tracking orders from society; in the second level, the expected damage cost is minimized from a disruptive scenario toward valuable infrastructure. Moreover, the second-level model is linearized, and it solves the problem by a branch and bound and enumeration algorithm. Finally, an illustrative example of the proposed model is presented.},

abstract={Railway safety is a tremendously essential aspect of urban management. The railway network is a highly sophisticated infrastructure comprising numerous devices, machines, networks, services, etc. Therefore, the Internet-of-things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be conceived as the crucial technologies for enabling ubiquitous data collection and unmanned decision-making, respectively. The exploitation of AI and IoT (AIoT) will ease the monitoring, fault detection, and decision-making in railway safety measures. Nonetheless, the AIoT may pose some new cyber threats to the railway infrastructure, such as unauthorized data modification and hijacking. An integral evaluation of IoT solutions is thus demanding. The IEEE Standards Working Group (WG) P2668 is developing a universal and objective standard to measure and quantify the maturity of IoT solutions. The IoT maturity index, namely the IDex, will be standardized to provide a comprehensive evaluation for all IoT objects pertinent to their performance and application requirements. The IEEE P2668 has conducted various case studies in different aspects, such as supply chain, mission-critical applications, Smart City development, etc. In this paper, the IDex case study on the AIoT-based railway safety measures will be presented and discussed.},

abstract={We compare the behavior of avatars in videogames with the expected behavior of humans in smart environments, particularly smart urban environments. As a result of this comparison we conclude that many aspects of controlling an avatar in a game environment will also be seen in controlling human behavior in smart urban environments. We predict a convergence of videogame environments with smart urban environments where the Artificial Intelligence (AI) of the game environment can be compared with the AI of the smart urban environment that is responsible for the functioning of the smart city. Game characteristics such as immediate rewards for good behavior can also be foreseen.},
