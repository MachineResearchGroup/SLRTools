abstract={Smart services are an important element of the smart cities and the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems where the intelligence behind the services is obtained and improved through the sensory data. Providing a large amount of training data is not always feasible; therefore, we need to consider alternative ways that incorporate unlabeled data as well. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained great success in several application domains. It is an applicable method for IoT and smart city scenarios where auto-generated data can be partially labeled by users' feedback for training purposes. In this paper, we propose a semisupervised DRL model that fits smart city applications as it consumes both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance and accuracy of the learning agent. The model utilizes variational autoencoders as the inference engine for generalizing optimal policies. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the first investigation that extends DRL to the semisupervised paradigm. As a case study of smart city applications, we focus on smart buildings and apply the proposed model to the problem of indoor localization based on Bluetooth low energy signal strength. Indoor localization is the main component of smart city services since people spend significant time in indoor environments. Our model learns the best action policies that lead to a close estimation of the target locations with an improvement of 23% in terms of distance to the target and at least 67% more received rewards compared to the supervised DRL model.},

abstract={In this paper we discuss the possibility of application of a Convolutional Neural Network for visual atmospheric visibility estimation. A system utilizing such a neural network can greatly benefit a smart city by providing real time localized visibility data across all highways and roads by utilizing a dense network of traffic and security cameras that exist in most developed urban areas. To achieve this, we implemented a Convolutional Neural Network with 3 convolution layers and trained it on a data set taken from CCTV cameras in South Korea. This approach allowed us achieve accuracy above 84%. In the paper we describe the network structure and training process, as well as some final thoughts on the next steps in our research.},

abstract={Citizen-centric methods leverage connectivity and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies to improve smart city services. Among these services, intelligent re-design of first responder services call for novel solutions that save city resources and result in faster response time. To this end, we propose to utilize sensory data in connected vehicles to capture contextual details that can be obtained through various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to determine which set of first responders should be called in the case of an accident. We use real images from a rich dataset of accidents involving different types of vehicles to train and test the CNNs. Through experimental results, we show that when ResNet-34 network is augmented with one fit cycle, image augmentation and hidden layer unfreezing methods can result in 88.9% accuracy in the prediction of the required first responder(s) in case of an accident solely based on the captured images.},

abstract={Due to the need to detect and track stolen and criminal vehicles and traffic monitoring, the development of license plate recognition systems on intersection monitors system is very urgent for the development of smart cities. Unlike the traditional license plate recognition technology applied to smart parking lots to identify a single license plate in a single lane, license plate recognition applied to intersection monitors must detect multiple license plates on multiple lanes. In addition, license plate recognition applied to intersection monitors faces many challenges, including too small license plates in the picture, unstable light sources, different shooting angles, blurred license plate characters in moving vehicles, and complex road conditions, advertising signs, traffic signs and road name indicator. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new two-stage methodology based on deep learning technology which first detects all the license plates in a picture and extracts the license plate images, and then performs character recognition on the license plate images using Convolutional Neural Networks. Through the two-stage approach, this method increases the proportion of characters in the picture, which in turn improves the character recognition accuracy. Experimental results show that the methodology achieves 98.23% of license plate detection rate and 97.38% of character recognition rate. The performance of the hierarchical methodology is about 25 fps. This methodology shows the superiority in both accuracy and performance in comparison with traditional license plate recognition systems.},

abstract={Intrusion detection is an important and challenging problem that has a major impact on quality and reliability of smart city services. To this extent, replay attacks have been one of the most common threats on smart city infrastructure, which compromises authentication in a smart city network. For example, a replay attack may physically damage smart city infrastructure resulting in loss of sensitive data, incurring considerable financial damages. Therefore, towards securing smart cities from reply attacks, intrusion detection systems and frameworks based on deep learning have been proposed in the recent literature. However, the absence of the time dimension of these proposals is a major limitation. Therefore, we have developed a deep learning-based model for replay attack detection in smart cities. The novelty of the proposed methodology resides in the adoption of deep learning based models as an application for detecting replay attacks to improve detection accuracy. The performance of this model is evaluated by applying it to a real life smart city dataset, where replay attacks were simulated. Our results show that the proposed model is capable of distinguishing between normal and attack behaviours with relatively high accuracy. In addition, according to the results, our proposed model outperforms traditional classification and deep learning models. Last but not least, as an additional contribution, this paper presents a real life smart city data set with simulated replay attacks for future research.},

abstract={The application of sensor networks in control and management of smart cities are increasing rapidly. The Internet of Things (IoT) platforms are becoming a major infrastructure component of the smart cities. The requirement for development of Web of Things (WoT) architectures and patterns have significant importance for optimal management and decision support in the smart city. Due to the fact that the sensor networks in even a small city produce a very large amount of data, manual interpretation of this data is not feasible. In recent years machine learning algorithms such as deep learning give the computer systems the ability to interpret and annotate this big data stream and to produce patterns which can help decision makers. This high-level interpretation is often presented in form of dashboards in the composition layers of the WoT. In this paper a deep learning based multisensor dashboard for decision support in the smart city is presented. The proposed dashboard is capable of interpretation and decision level fusion on sensor network data. Simulation results show that the proposed model is a suitable solution for making decisions in the IoT framework for the smart city.},

abstract={Increasing urbanization and rapid increase of the population in urban areas has led to varied issues, to which rendering the cities as a “smart” one has been identified as a solution. The sole motive behind the intent to come up with smart cities is to incorporate technological impulses into the usual routine chores of people in a particular area, so as to enhance the living standards as well. But there is a gap regarding considering environmental preservation as an indicator of achieving sustainability in the smart city concept. Beyond the current versions of technologies utilized, Artificial Intelligence (AI), is apparently the most promising recent advancement of ICT, which can deliver the motive of sustainable development through the advent of future smart cities. AI applications can actually transform the way civilizations respond to threats of varying degrees.

abstract={Today's world is the era of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Due to this the demands of people and industry is growing day by day. So quality of service in cities and urban area is greatly affected. Both Government and private organizations took initiatives to migrate traditional cities into Smart cities. Development of Smart cities is focused by parameters: Technology, Safety, Privacy, Education, Unemployment, Crime, Health, Social, Legal, Economic, Traffic and Sustainability. Smart cities are considered safer cities against non-smart cities. These cities utilizes ‘enterprise’ LTE (eLTE) technology, a private adaptation of the 4G/5G (LTE) networks, IoT technology, secure wireless broadband connectivity etc for their advancement. These Smart cities are providing best resources to the people but Women Safety, Crime and Violence is still a big challenge. Weather a city is smart or non-smart, the crime against women is never ended. However, in reality cases like rape, harassment, teasing, sexual assault, molestation, domestic violence etc. increases very rapidly. Many preventive laws and measures have been taken to stop these worst activities. Still the measures have not affected the growing rate of such crimes. India has entered into digital world, but still women are scared to employ safety measures that can help them in troubled situation. Many cities are now developed into Smart cities but safety of women safety is still a increasing concern. In this context, Government has developed various devices and applications but still there is a need to develop an efficient system using latest technology like Machine Learning, Data Science etc. The paper analysis various feature and dimensions of Women Safety and Smart city.},

abstract={This article focused on two main topics currently on among many agendas: smart cities and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The growing interest in the former is due to these cities’ multidimensionality and adaptability in terms of residents’ needs and the requirements of each municipality's reality. AI, in turn, currently plays a transformative, disruptive role in various areas by performing “smart” tasks, thereby facilitating the automation of processes and differentiation initiatives. Smart city strategic planning, especially in the long term, will most likely have to deal with adaptations to AI. Thus, research is needed that can contribute to a more holistic view of these topics and support decision-making processes in these areas. Based on the epistemological principles of the multiple-criteria decision analysis approach (MCDA), this article developed and tested a dynamic analysis system that allows smart city initiatives to address the challenges of adapting to AI. The proposed system highlights the cause-and-effect relationships in this context. The article included an application of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique. The procedural steps followed to implement this methodology were enhanced by close collaboration with an experienced decision maker, who has coordinated various projects in this research context. The proposed system's contributions and limitations were also analyzed in this article.},

abstract={This purpose of the research is to explore the construction status and prediction performance of intelligent transportation systems in the road network of smart cities based on 5G (5th Generation Mobile Communication Technology) network, and further intellectualize the smart city. Aiming at the diversity and complexity of regional traffic influencing factors of road network in the construction of smart city, this research carries out resource real-time load balancing scheduling from the perspective of 5G heterogeneous network. Meanwhile, CNN (convolutional neural network) in the introduced deep learning algorithm is improved, and finally an intelligent traffic prediction model is constructed based on 5G load balancing and AlexNet network. The model is simulated and its performance is analyzed. The results show that the algorithm proposed is compared with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN, RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), VGGNet (Visual Geometry Group Network), and BN (Bayesian network) models regarding Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1. It is found that the road network prediction accuracy of the algorithm proposed is 94.05%, which is at least 4.29% higher than that of the model algorithm proposed by other scholars. The analysis of network data transmission synchronization performance suggests that there are obvious performance improvements in access delay, access collision rate, reliability, and network throughput. Among them, the packet loss rate is lower than 0.1, the access collision rate is basically stable at about 0, the access time is stable at about 75ms, and the sending throughput is basically maintained at about 1, which is significantly better than the performance of other algorithms. Therefore, the intelligent transportation system can achieve better data transmission performance under the premise of ensuring high prediction performance, with prominent instantaneity, which can provide experimental basis for the intelligent development of transportation in smart cities.},

abstract={Deep learning has increasingly become an essential component of many Smart City functions including smart city lightings, emergency rescues, smart drainage, and smart parking. These functions operate continuously in real-time throughout the day. Thus, excessive energy usage of deep learning computation can negatively impact economic benefits and efficiency of smart cities. The situation can escalate when dealing with resource-constrained large-scale smart cities of huge Internet-of-Things and networks with large numbers and varieties of sensors. To effectively sustain, manage and protect smart cities from failures due to energy overload, the awareness of energy consumption by deep learning computation is unavoidably necessary. Most recent research in smart cities focuses on using deep learning to perform certain tasks but does not address energy issues. This paper presents a formal approach to estimating energy consumption of deep learning and illustrates its use in smart cities. In particular, we develop a fine-grained mathematical model that extends an existing model to include the quantification of MAC (multiply-and-accumulate) operations as well as data access from a memory hierarchy. This paper focuses on deep and convolutional neural networks. We describe the proposed approach and validate the results obtained from our model by comparing them against those of existing work. The proposed approach is applied to three (deep) neural systems in smart cities, namely smart drainage, smart transportation and smart parking systems, all of which yield promising results.},

It is necessary to improve the design of the energy infrastructure, the deployment and production of RE in order to face the multiple challenges that will affect the sector's growth and resilience.. In this research work we exploit the recent developments on the AI adoption for RE sector in European Union (EU). In this respect, we analysed (i) the efficiency of the transformation processes of the RE within the energy chain from Gross Inland Consumption to Final Energy Consumption, (ii) its implications on the structure of renewable energy by source (solar, wind, biomass etc.), (iii) the labour productivity in RE sector compared to the economy as a whole and its correlation with investments level, (iv) the implication of the adoption of AI for RE towards Future Smart Cities Research. The main contribution of this research is the development of a framework for understanding the contribution of AI in the RE sector in Europe. Another bold contribution of this work is the discussion of the implications for Future Smart Cities Research and future research directions.},

abstract={The concept of Smart Cities becomes paramount importance both to Government and Private Sectors. The increasing pressure of urbanization creates tremendous pressure to civic infrastructures like drainage, water system, electrical networks (Smart Grid), transportation etc [1] -- [3]. The use of Big Data Analytics is becoming a necessary tool to design and monitor Smart Cities. With the cost of sensors decreasing everyday, the flood of data is ubiquitous. We have designed a neural network based on cognitive algorithm for monitoring Smart Cities. Our algorithm is developed on the highly scalable distributed machine learning GraphLab Framework, embeds the deep learning features in the GraphLab Architecture to gain insight of the unstructured data through hierarchical abstraction. This is a scalable software architecture using Apache STORM. An Update Function (UF) is defined, which updates the scope of the data in the GraphLab. The Graph Rules, used by Graph Transformation, are defined to construct hidden layers in GraphLab to get more control over information flow. The "Update Function" and Graph Transformation trigger each other, which forms Hybrid GraphLab. The Hybrid GraphLab allows more flexible, fault tolerant, computational capabilities and possibilities to add more hidden multi-layers in tune with deep learning. Our algorithm can be extended to other applications like old age homes, hospitals etc for improved monitoring and management, with various sensors such as Gas Sensors, Light Sensors, Directionable Sensor Probes and Noise Sensors.},

Smart cities paradigm is a kind of answer to increased human density in urban areas, while the Public Food Network framework is a kind of improvement of urban gardening. The framework is based on the idea that city governments have to enable growing fruit and vegetables in public areas so citizens could take fruits and vegetables for free. City governments do not have to invest much money to achieve this goal. The provided framework is based on artificial intelligence that takes care of plants irrigation and plant disease control. Public Food Nodes that are the basis of the provided framework are based on Internet of Things technologies and standards. The project concerning the provided framework is in the early development phase, but the most significant value of this project is the idea of free food growing for citizens based on AI and IoT technologies with minimum servicing. Technology development makes this idea feasible and free public food stops being a subject of sociological analysis and becomes a technical problem.},

abstract={The major objective of a smart city is to provide ripest and rightest services to its residents with minimal human intervention. The data collected from various sensors, receptors and receivers can be stored in a reliable, cost effective and manageable cloud storage. Predictive analytics such as predictive modelling and machine learning can be used to analyze the latest and past data from the cloud to forecast the near and far future. The predictive analytics will immediately send notifications and the appropriate actions to be taken to the concerned system so that the residents can get equable life. Waste management such as sewage management and trash management are one of the major exertion in a smart city. In this paper, predictive analytics is applied on the cloud data collected from various sensors attached on the waste management resources such as trash bins and sewage pipes. Firstly, group of trash bins and sewage pipes are attached with radio wave sensors which in turn connected to an IoT enabled receiver to provide cost effective data collection. Secondly, the data from the receivers are stored in a cloud. Thirdly, predictive analytics are proposed for applying on the data in the cloud. Finally, actions like redirecting the trash collection truck and sewage clearing robot based on the priority can be done automatically and long term actions can be directed to the concerned authorities with notifications and alerts to take necessary actions. In this paper, designing of an immaculate smart city is proposed which can be achieved by developing IoT based trash collection and sewage cleaning system. For analysis purpose synthetic data is considered where levels for garbage cleaning bins at different time are represented with different numbers.},

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are integral parts of smart cities and critical to modern societies. Despite indisputable opportunities introduced by disruptor technologies, they proliferate the cybersecurity threat landscape, which is increasingly more hostile. The quantum of sensors utilised by ICS aided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables data collection capabilities to facilitate automation, process streamlining and cost reduction. However, apart from operational use, the sensors generated data combined with AI can be innovatively utilised to model anomalous behaviour as part of layered security to increase resilience to cyber-attacks. We introduce a framework to profile anomalous behaviour in ICS and derive a cyber-risk score. A novel super learner ensemble for one-class classification is developed, using overlapping rolling windows with stratified, k-fold, n-repeat cross-validation applied to each base-learner followed by majority voting to derive the best learner. Our approach is demonstrated on a liquid distribution sensor dataset. The experimental results reveal that the proposed technique achieves an overall F1-score of 99.13%, an anomalous recall score of 99% detecting anomalies lasting only 17 seconds. The key strength of the framework is the low computational complexity and error rate. The framework is modular, generic, applicable to other ICS and transferable to other smart city sectors.},

abstract={Predicting traffic flow plays an important role in reducing traffic congestion and improving transportation efficiency for smart cities. Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP) in the smart city requires efficient models, highly reliable networks, and data privacy. As traffic data, traffic trajectory can be transformed into a graph representation, so as to mine the spatio-temporal information of the graph for TFP. However, most existing work adopt a central training mode where the privacy problem brought by the distributed traffic data is not considered. In this paper, we propose a Federated Deep Learning based on the Spatial-Temporal Long and Short-Term Networks (FedSTN) algorithm to predict traffic flow by utilizing observed historical traffic data. In FedSTN, each local TFP model deployed in an edge computing server includes three main components, namely Recurrent Long-term Capture Network (RLCN) module, Attentive Mechanism Federated Network (AMFN) module, and Semantic Capture Network (SCN) module. RLCN can capture the long-term spatial-temporal information in each area. AMFN shares short-term spatio-temporal hidden information when it trains its local TFP model by the additive homomorphic encryption approach based on Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). We employ SCN to capture semantic features such as irregular non-Euclidean connections and Point of Interest (POI). Compared with existing baselines, several simulations are conducted on practical data sets and the results prove the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

Smart cities include internet-enabled devices that are used by applications like health care, power grid, water treatment, traffic control, etc to enhance its effectiveness. The expansion in the quantity of Internet-of-things (IoT) based botnet attacks is due to the growing trend of Internet-enabled devices. To provide advanced cyber security solutions to IoT devices and smart city applications, this paper proposes a deep learning (DL) based botnet detection system that works on network traffic flows. The botnet detection framework collects the network traffic flows, converts them into connection records and uses a DL model to detect attacks emanating from the compromised IoT devices. To determine an optimal DL model, many experiments are conducted on well-known and recently released benchmark data sets. Further, the datasets are visualized to understand its characteristics. The proposed DL model outperformed the conventional machine learning (ML) models.},

Recently, the term artificial intelligence service has been used more than the term intelligent service. However, it is still difficult to find examples of applying artificial intelligence services in the real world due to the minimal performance requirements to run the model smoothly. A technology for lightweighting intelligent models is being developed so that artificial intelligence models can operate even on low-performance devices. If a lightweight intelligent model can be freely used in low-performance devices, many intelligent services suitable for the IoT era will flourish. Therefore, we tried PoC service in a smart city using a lightweight intelligent model mounted on the Raspberry Pi, a low-performance device, and we confirmed the possibility.},

abstract={Increasing shares of renewable energy sources in combination with rising popularity of demand response applications and flexibility programs forces higher awareness for production and consumption balancing. Accurate models for forecasting are not just necessary for PV- or wind power sources in smart cities, but also the prediction of loads respectively consumption, which can be based on time series analysis or machine learning methods. Three of those methods, namely a linear regression (LM), a long short-term memory network (LSTM) and a neural network model (NN), have been selected to see their performance on predicting the load of a large smart city on the example of the Estonian electricity consumption data. Hourly data of the year 2019 was used as training data to predict the first 20 days of 2020. For this kind of prediction, the LM showed the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and had the lowest computational time. The neural network was slightly less accurate. The LSTM showed the worst performance in terms of accuracy and computational time. Thus, LSTM is not the preferred method for this kind of prediction and the recommendation for forecasting such loads would be a LM because the RMSE and computational effort needed are lower than for a NN.},

abstract={One of the major challenges faced by the humanity in the next century is the climate change and global warming. Climate change is caused by the rapid emission of greenhouse gases. Energy production industry is facing the challenge of providing the energy require by the rapidly expanding need of urbanized societies while reducing their emission. Clean and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy can gradually replace the energy sources with high emission. Smart cities can provide a major part of their energy requirements using these clean energy sources. The energy sector should be able to make decisions about the best scenarios for deployment and placement of clean energy production devices such as solar panels and wind turbines. In this paper,3D modelling of the urban environment is used for efficient placement of solar panels in the urban environment for optimum electricity production. Furthermore, a model for prediction of the speed of the wind using deep neural networks is proposed. The proposed solar panel placement framework is simulated on a part of the city of Tehran, Iran. The proposed wind energy production framework is simulated on 16 wind energy production stations in Iran. The experimental results show that the combined use of the solar and wind energy sources in the smart city environment can help the energy companies to be able to answer the energy demands of the cities while reducing their cost and emission.},

abstract={Smart city communication networks hold the promise of harnessing the Internet of Things, smart devices, intelligent energy grids, autonomous cars, and many other data architectures to improve quality of life for every citizen. As time and progress have gradually shifted this concept from an idea into a reality, the possibilities for what services a smart city might provide have exploded. Along with that expansion, the number of devices that may need to be supported across a communications network has multiplied enormously. However, existing congestion control protocols are not equipped to support this higher requirement for network performance. New protocols are needed to provide higher data throughputs, reduce queuing delays and packet loss, and maintain stable and reliable communications pathways. The end-to-end congestion control protocol presented in this article does all these things. Called high throughput congestion control (HTCC), the framework takes full advantage of reinforcement learning and a fast growth algorithm to adaptively control the bytes in flight across the network's links to suit the prevailing network conditions. The result is a protocol that not only finds the optimal tradeoff between throughput, latency, and packet loss, but also significantly speeds up the learning process to avoid wasting network resources, use all free bandwidth and maximize network utilization. A comprehensive set of experiments with HTCC and six state-of-the-art protocols-Copa, PCC Vivace, PCC-Allegro, TCP Cubic, TaoVA-100x, and FillP-Sheep-demonstrate that, in most conditions, HTCC is able to make the best tradeoff between throughput, delay, and loss rate.},

The need for such sensors is increasing; however, proliferation of technologies comes with various challenges. For example, how can IoT and its associated data be used to enhance waste management? In smart cities, an efficient waste management system is crucial. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and IoT-enabled approaches can empower cities to manage the waste collection. This work proposes an intelligent approach to route recommendation in an IoT-enabled waste management system given spatial constraints. It performs a thorough analysis based on AI-based methods and compare their corresponding results. Our solution is based on a multiple-level decision-making process in which bins’ status and coordinates are taken into account to address the routing problem.

The performance of the algorithms was assessed in terms of accuracy, trustworthy and speed. The data sets were provided by Transport for London (TfL) and the UK MetOffice. We employed a random sample of some 1,800,000 instances, comprising six individual datasets, which we analysed on the WEKA platform. The results revealed that there were a high degree of correlations between weather-based attributes and the Big Data being analysed. Notable observations were that, on average, the decision tree J48 algorithm performed best in terms of accuracy while the kNN IBK algorithm was the fastest to build models. Finally we suggest IoT Smart City applications that may benefit from our work.},

abstract={Smart cities endeavor to deliver safe and sustainable infrastructure services that enable individuals, organizations, and communities alike to be productive, healthy, informed, and actively involved in rapid urbanization. The widespread installation of closed-circuit television cameras and continuously generated video streams are a strategic data source that can contribute toward safety and sustainability through efficient surveillance of smart city assets and resources. Recent advances in deep learning methods are able to detect and localize salient objects in a video stream. However, a number of practical issues remain unaddressed, such as suboptimality, latency, predictive accuracy, and most importantly the contextualization of all detected salient objects for informed decisions that aligns with ethical surveillance. In this article, we propose a Generative Latent Space (GenLS) approach that overcomes these challenges, specifically in road surveillance. We demonstrate an adaptation of this approach for a prominent use-case in road surveillance, License Plate Detection. GenLS was evaluated for accuracy, robustness, computational cost, and cogency, using a state-of-the-art benchmark dataset on road traffic. Results from these experiments and the corresponding ablation study validate GenLS and confirm its suitability for real-time smart city road surveillance.},

abstract={Smart cities are on the rise and any component of such infrastructure would require reliable electrical power and hence reliable Synchronous generators. To reduce the down time of synchronous generators, it is necessary to implement an intelligent condition monitoring system. Stator inter turn fault is a critical fault as it is the beginning stage form many electrical faults in a Synchronous generator. Neural networks have proved their mettle in solving difficult classification problems. Here the stator interturn fault diagnosis problem has been cast as a multilabel, multiclass classification problem. It has been solved using neural networks using the Keras framework. The data for training the network was obtained from a Finite element model of a synchronous generator implemented in ANSYS Maxwell.},

abstract={In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) concept has become a promising research topic in many areas including industry, commerce and education. Smart cities employ IoT based services and applications to create a sustainable urban life. By using information and communication technologies, IoT enables smart cities to make city stakeholders more aware, interactive and efficient. With the increase in number of IoT based smart city applications, the amount of data produced by these applications is increased tremendously. Governments and city stakeholders take early precautions to process these data and predict future effects to ensure sustainable development. In prediction context, deep learning techniques have been used for several forecasting problems in big data. This inspires us to use deep learning methods for prediction of IoT data. Hence, in this paper, a novel deep learning model is proposed for analyzing IoT smart city data. We propose a novel model based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict future values of air quality in a smart city. The evaluation results of the proposed model are found to be promising and they show that the model can be used in other smart city prediction problems as well.},

abstract={Autonomous taxies are in high demand for smart city scenario. Such taxies have a well specified path to travel. Therefore, these vehicles only required two important parameters. One is detection parameter and other is control parameter. Further, detection parameters require turn detection and obstacle detection. The control parameters contain steering control and speed control. In this paper a novel autonomous taxi model has been proposed for smart city scenario. Deep learning has been used to model the human driver capabilities for the autonomous taxi. A hierarchical Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture has been utilized to train various driving aspects. In first level, the proposed DNN architecture classifies the straight and turning of road. A parallel DNN is used to detect obstacle at level one. In second level, the DNN discriminates the turning i.e. left or right for steering and speed controls. Two multi layered DNNs have been used on Nvidia Tesla K 40 GPU based system with Core i-7 processor. The mean squared error (MSE) for the detection parameters viz. speed and steering angle were 0.018 and 0.0248 percent, respectively, with 15 milli seconds of real-time response delay.},

Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) play a pivotal role in building smart cities. IoT is a pervasive network of objects where each object is connected, has a unique internet address, and is accessible from anywhere and at any time. IoT provides an ideal platform for collecting massive amounts of data and AI provides a mechanism to analyze data and make smart decisions. Almost every aspect of a smart city uses this approach and includes smart infrastructure, smart transportation, smart healthcare, smart energy, smart environment, smart governance, smart architectural planning, smart buildings, and much more. In this paper, we elaborate on the concept of smart cities and the factors that are influencing the emergence of smart cities. The world population is expected to be about 10 billion by the year 2050 and it is expected that 70% of the population will be living in the cities. It is also expected that energy use will grow by 40% by that time. We discuss challenges, intricacies, interdependencies, and opportunities as cities move forward to become smart cities.},

Ubiquitous computing involves the introduction of a significant number of technologies, including sensors, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, network robots. Since ubiquitous computing is based on the processing of data generated by different devices, the new solutions are needed to structure and ensure data compatibility. Such solutions are the distributed machine learning methods: stochastic gradient descent and K-means method.

abstract={In smart cities, violence event detection is critical to ensure city safety. Several studies have been done on this topic with a focus on 2d-Convolutional Neural Network (2d-CNN) to detect spatial features from each frame, followed by one of the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) variants as a temporal features learning method. On the other hand, the transformer network has achieved a great result in many areas. The bottleneck for transformers is the need for large data set to achieve good results. In this work, we propose a data-efficient video transformer (DeVTr) based on the transformer network as a Spatio-temporal learning method with a pre-trained 2d-Convolutional neural network (2d-CNN) as an embedding layer for the input data. The model has been trained and tested on the Real-life violence dataset (RLVS) and achieved an accuracy of 96.25%.

abstract={Cities around the world need to use advanced technology and foster innovation to provide better services to their citizens. One of the most evolving technological developments in recent years for analyzing the vast amount of information generated by billions of texts published by citizens in the Internet is Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially when used for text categorization, sentiment analysis and topic extraction. With the advent of NLP techniques, Artificial Intelligence has become applicable in different areas of science, business, and government. Although there have been advances in the application of Artificial Intelligence methods in societal problems, there is a strong lack of technologies for urban ser-vices management. This paper presents Daoura, a data intelligence platform for smart city management that transforms publications of citizens on the Internet into relevant insights, and its case on forecasting 2020 Chilean national plebiscite results for a new constitution, based on analyzing millions of citizens interactions in social media. The platform's projections reported an accuracy of 95.8% when compared to the final results, showing the importance of digital manifestations on understanding people's opinions and experiences in the society. We also discuss the significative impacts Daoura NLP skills can have on modernizing public management and creating environments that promote well-being and quality of life in cities.},

abstract={The smart city is an emerging concept which appears to be a promising approach not only in urban environment to accommodate the growing needs and to improve the quality of life, but also in military environment for installing and integrating network-connected sensors into the everyday operations. This demands the use of information technologies, digitization, and urban traffic planning for better mobility. Internet of Things (IoT) devices (wireless sensors, actuators, meters, etc.) come in handy to collect and analyze data. Because military bases share many of the same characteristics as small cities, this work in progress sets out to develop a machine learning model to predict the parking availability in IoT environment for smart cities. As IoT offers data nuances challenges, present work explores a recently introduced information theoretic technique, Chisini Jensen Shannon Divergence (CJSD), known for their utility to tease apart data classes with discernible differences. We found that while clustering methods were unable to detect visually identifiable clusters, family of CJSDs was able to capture underlying data regularity and give statistically significant improvement over deep learning model. This is the first application of information theoretic models in IoT environment in the research literature.},

License plate recognition system has three stages, including license plate localization, character segmentation, and character recognition. Although the license plate recognition system has been successfully applied to the environment-controlled smart parking system, it still faces many challenging in the surveillance system such as congested traffic with multiple plates, ambiguous signs and advertisements, tilting plates, as well as obscure images taken in bad weather and nighttime. In this paper, we propose an efficient license plate recognition system that first detects vehicles and then retrieves license plates from vehicles to reduce false positives on plate detection. Then, we apply convolution neural networks to improve the character recognition of blurred and obscure images. The experimental results show the superiority of the performance in both accuracy and performance in comparison with traditional license plate recognition systems.},

abstract={Today’s smart city infrastructure is predominantly dependant on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. IoT technology essentially facilitates a platform for service automation through connections of heterogeneous objects via the Internet backbone. However, the security issues associated with IoT networks make smart city infrastructure vulnerable to cyber-attacks. For example, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack violates the authorization conditions in smart city infrastructure; whereas replay attack violates the authentication conditions in smart city infrastructure. Both attacks lead to physical disruption to smart city infrastructure, which may even lead to financial loss and/or loss of human lives. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning model is developed for detecting replay and DDoS attacks in a real life smart city platform. The performance of the proposed hybrid model is evaluated using real life smart city datasets (environmental, smart river and smart soil), where DDoS and replay attacks were simulated. The proposed model reported high accuracy rates: 98.37% for the environmental dataset, 98.13% for the smart river dataset, and 99.51% for the smart soil dataset. The results demonstrated an improved performance of the proposed model over other machine learning and deep learning models from the literature.},

abstract={Smart cities aim for the optimization and enhancement of all domains of application, as well as strive for more sustainable ecosystems. Emerging and disruptive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence are transforming the way we uncover and bring value, making them optimal when it comes to building and maintaining a smart city. Artificial Intelligence has become a driving force behind many technological innovations and proved significant in different fields including medicine, education, marketing, food technology, banking, and green technology. Nowadays, people are more aware of pressing matters concerning the environment. They are more willing to opt for environmentally friendly solutions wherever possible. We aim to introduce a solution by which people's actions to limit environmental damage are not limited to merely purchasing ecofriendly products but extended to getting those products delivered in a way that is least harmful to the planet. Therefore, this paper proposes a CO2 emission predictive analysis using Artificial Intelligence that calculates and predicts the amounts of CO2 to be emitted from a cargo van in advance. The system takes into account the total distance to be traveled and the amount of gas needed to travel that distance and predict the emission accordingly. This paper proposes that such a system should also be embedded with self-driving cars, as in the smart cities of the future self-driving cars will become the norm. Relevant conceptual information used to develop the predictive analysis system is discussed. A discussion is also made on the development of the system as well as the preparation of the dataset. The system is analyzed based on the accuracy of the prediction. Finally, a future direction for the current approach of implementation is presented.},

abstract={In a smart city, effective and accurate real estate assessments governed by a local government is crucial for determining the property taxes. Such assessments have never been trivial, and inappropriate assessments may result in disputes between property owners and the local government. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning approach to smartly and effectively assessing real estate values. We propose a systematic method to derive a layered knowledge graph and design a structured Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on it. Neurons in a structured DNN are structurally connected, which makes the network time and space efficient; and thus, it requires fewer data points for training. The structured DNN model has been designed to learn from the most recently captured data points; therefore, it allows the model to adapt to the latest market trends. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we use a case study of assessing real properties in small towns. A structured DNN was designed to match with a layered knowledge graph for property assessments in the real estate domain, which results in a significant reduction of neurons and connections between them. The experimental results show that a structured DNN outperforms conventional multivariate linear regression models, fully-connected neural networks, and prediction methods used by the leading real estate companies.},

abstract={With the advent of the 4th Industrial Revolution and the superconducting era based on advanced information and communication technology, the world we live in is rapidly changing. As a result, Smart City has emerged as a new urban model. Smart City is a futuristic high-tech city that can freely use Information and Communication Technology and can solve urban problems that are occurring now. Energy, an essential element of the city, fuses with the Internet of Things technology, enabling efficient energy management in the Smart City. Since the Internet of Things is a technology that connects various objects through wireless communication, it is used in various fields such as industry, the public, and energy as well as daily human life. As an Internet of Things technology becomes commonplace, it deals with various industries and life data, and malicious cyber-attacks are frequent, which can destroy Smart City infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an energy data monitoring system based on artificial intelligence algorithms to prevent such risks and to optimize the infrastructure of Smart City. The proposed system will improve the safety and efficiency of Smart City, so it will be able to build and operate an optimized Smart City.},

abstract={Smart city is the prospect of current intellectual technology toward the ecological growth of urban technology and commercial expansion. In addition, the Internet of Things (IoT) based smart city services ensure the eminence of life and well-being to the smart citizens. In order to ensure quality services, each of city service gathers multidimensional data from abundant IoT nodes. Therefore, the centralized traffic management has become critically challenging for a large volume of multidimensional smart city network data. Consequently, in this research, we concentrate on solving this problem by introducing Software Defined Networks (SDN) based intelligent service fulfillment for dense smart city network to accomplish service requests from multiple smart citizens and service providers. First, we model a distributed software defined IoT network for smart city environment where introduce a fog-based SDN controller with an intelligent engine, fog unit, and virtual mesh topology module. Then, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based intelligent algorithm for IoT network, and that intelligent agent-based service fulfillment algorithm accomplishes the city service. We use fog based SDN controller unit to implement the learning model based on processing and waiting delay of the SDN switches that qualify the smart city services to the service providers. Finally, in the simulation, we have achieved higher performance gain for the proposed method in respect to the convergence and utility gain.},

abstract={Parking spaces are costly to build, parking payments are difficult to enforce, and drivers waste an excessive amount of time searching for empty lots. Accurate quantification would inform developers and municipalities in space allocation and design, while real-time measurements would provide drivers and parking enforcement with information that saves time and resources. In this paper, we propose an accurate and real-time video system for future Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities applications. Using recent developments in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and a novel vehicle tracking filter, we combine information across multiple image frames in a video sequence to remove noise introduced by occlusions and detection failures. We demonstrate that our system achieves higher accuracy than pure image-based instance segmentation, and is comparable in performance to industry benchmark systems that utilize more expensive sensors, such as radar. Furthermore, our system shows significant potential in its scalability to a city-wide scale and also in the richness of its output that goes beyond traditional binary occupancy statistics.},

abstract={The use of IoT devices is growing rapidly and it is playing a critical role in a diverse set of industries. It has been instrumental in the growth of smart cities. Smart cities have emerged as a paradigm for urban development which aims to be sustainable, efficient and improve accessibility. However, the limited processing power of IoT devices makes them susceptible to flood-based attacks. Denial of Service attacks can overwhelm the computing resources or network bandwidth of IoT networks. Since IoT devices power critical infrastructure like traffic management in smart cities, adequate defense of such networks from malicious actors is imperative. In this article, the authors propose a framework tailored for detection and mitigation of flood-based attacks in smart city infrastructure. The proposed smart city framework aims to reduce latency of attack detection by using fog computing for feature extraction and security maintenance. It allows scalability by utilizing SDN and fog infrastructure for mitigation of attacks. We have analysed and utilized packet-level features which are excellent for distinguishing between IoT and attack traffic. We have trained and quantitatively compared 5 state-of-the-art supervised machine learning models for attack detection in this paper. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 99.9% on our simulated dataset in attack detection.},

abstract={Technology is being adopted by many municipalities to improve their services and operations through so-called “smart city applications”. Development of these smart city applications are increasingly looking to leverage edge and cloud computing to support these initiatives. This approach brings a number of challenges, including the allocation of tasks to that process data from sensors to computing systems, dealing with the data that may be time sensitive, handling frequently starting and finishing tasks, dynamically changing resource utilization of computing elements, etc. This paper focuses on the challenge of allocating tasks to resources to try to ensure balanced loads on processing elements in dynamic environments. A reinforcement learning approach is introduced to address this problem. The reinforcement learning agent uses a novel Multi-Observation Single-State model based on observed features from multiple sources at a single step. A model of a smart city computational infrastructure is introduced and is used to define our reinforcement learning algorithm for task allocation. We illustrate the agent behavior through simulations.},

Recent advancement on Internet-of-Things (IoT) and machine learning enable new solutions and applications, such as smart energy systems and autonomous vehicles. In the past, most of the IoT systems report sensor data to the cloud and perform machine learning. However, this centralized approach causes high communication overheads and delay. In this paper, we present a distributed machine learning framework for IoT in smart cities. It enables machine learning algorithms to be run on heterogeneous nodes with different capabilities, including end devices, edge devices, and the cloud. We first describe a distributed machine learning-assisted framework for network management in IoT for smart cities. We then provide a case study of urban monitoring using vehicular sensor network. A secure and distributed information fusion scheme based on statistical machine learning is proposed. Finally, we discuss potential extensions on scalable computation and other distributed machine learning methods for large scale networks.},

abstract={Internet of Things applications can greatly benefit from accurate prediction models. The performance of prediction models is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the creation of a dynamic ensemble from distributed deep learning models by considering the spatiotemporal patterns embedded in the training data. Our dynamic ensemble does not depend on offline configurations. Instead, it exploits the spatiotemporal patterns embedded in the training data to generate dynamic weights for the underlying weak distributed deep learners to create a stronger learner. Our evaluation experiments using three real-world datasets in the context of the smart city show that our proposed dynamic ensemble strategy leads to an improved error rate of up to 33% compared to the baseline strategy even when using31of the training data. Moreover, using only 20% of the training data, the error rate of the model slightly increased by up to 2 in terms of mean square error. This increase is 82% less than the 11.3 increase seen in the baseline model. Therefore, our approach contributes to the reduced network traffic while not hindering the accuracy significantly.},

Also, timely prediction of pollutants level can help government agencies to take proactive measures to protect the environment. In this paper we have proposed the application of Internet of Things and Machine learning so that air pollution can be monitored within future smart cities. A high correlation between pollutants and weather parameters is determined by using Pearson correlation. In contrary to traditional sensor network, this work utilizes cloud-centric IoT middleware architecture that not only receives data from air pollution sensors but also from existing weather sensors. Thus provides two-fold reliability and reduce the cost substantially. The Artificial Neural Network has been used to predict the level of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Particular Matter (PM2.5). Promising results suggest that ANN is a reliable candidate that can be used in air pollution monitoring and prediction system.

pages={124337-124347},
abstract={Bike-sharing is adopted as a valid option replacing traditional public transports since they are eco-friendly, prevent traffic congestions, reduce any possible risk of social contacts which happen mostly on public means. However, some problems may occur such as the irregular distribution of bikes on related stations/racks/areas, and the difficulty of knowing in advance what the rack status will be like, or predicting if there will be bikes available in a specific bike-station at a certain time of the day, or if there will be a free slot to leave the rented bike. Thus, providing predictions can be useful to improve the service quality, especially in those cases where bike racks are used for e-bikes, which need to be recharged. This paper compares the state-of-the-art techniques to predict the number of available bikes and free bike-slots in bike-sharing stations (i.e., bike racks). To this end, a set of features and predictive models were compared to identify the best models and predictors for short-term predictions, namely of 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. The study has demonstrated that deep learning and in particular Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTM) offers a robust approach for the implementation of reliable and fast predictions of available bikes, even with a limited amount of historical data. This paper has also reported an analysis of feature relevance based on SHAP that demonstrated the validity of the model for different cluster behaviours. Both solution and its validation were derived by using data collected in bike-stations in the cities of Siena and Pisa (Italy), in the context of Sii-Mobility National Research Project on Mobility and Transport and Snap4City Smart City IoT infrastructure.},

abstract={Traffic prediction is one of the most important use cases for smart cities. Accurate traffic information is key to managing traffic issues. Many approaches that use traffic time series data to predict traffic flow have been proposed. In addition to traffic- specific parameters, some other features (called signatures) may be associated with road traffic, i.e., air and noise pollution. In this paper, we show how noise pollution and traffic time-series data were used to train Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which led to better traffic prediction on major roads in Madrid. This approach has already been used with pollution signatures. This work addresses a new potential investigation path closely related to the use of signature profiles and Artificial Intelligent techniques as a way to reduce the specialization of sensing infrastructure.},

abstract={With machine learning (ML) services now used in a number of mission-critical human-facing domains, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of ML models becomes all important. In this work, we consider the paradigm where cloud service providers collect big data from resource-constrained devices for building ML-based prediction models that are then sent back to be run locally on the intermittently connected resource-constrained devices. Our proposed solution comprises an intelligent polynomial-time heuristic that maximizes the level of trust of ML models by selecting and switching between a subset of the ML models from a superset of models in order to maximize the trustworthiness while respecting the given reconfiguration budget/rate and reducing the cloud communication overhead. We evaluate the performance of our proposed heuristic using two case studies. First, we consider Industrial IoT (IIoT) services, and as a proxy for this setting, we use the turbofan engine degradation simulation data set to predict the remaining useful life of an engine. Our results in this setting show that the trust level of the selected models is 0.49%-3.17% less compared to the results obtained using integer linear programming (ILP). Second, we consider smart cities services, and as a proxy of this setting, we use an experimental transportation data set to predict the number of cars. Our results show that the selected model's trust level is 0.7%-2.53% less compared to the results obtained using ILP. We also show that our proposed heuristic achieves an optimal competitive ratio in a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem.},

abstract={The upcoming IoE paradigm is taking the IoT era to a new shift, and that because of the natural inter-connection of processes, people, devices and stakeholders. From the smart city perspective, the main goal is to make well-informed decisions, on the base of a variable number of sensors and sources, exposing different data with different protocols and structures. The urban contexts may change, and with them, the number of sensors deployed. The novel smart city service must go beyond an integration strategy, it needs an exploitation model to optimally retrieve useful and highly contextualized information. In this paper we focus on the development of a model which fuses together the IoE potential and machine learning techniques for the cognitive smart city: retrive useful intelligent information, optimally exploiting the infrastructure the specific physical context may offer. We propose an approach and related techniques for realizing context agnostic services, namely services that do not depend on the enabling infrastructure beneath. The purpose is to create an IoE-based self-contextualizing service, which potentially consider the entire range of data that is being collected in smart cities and use such data to provide highly-personalized information about each environment, i.e., information that best suits the context of each Smart City. To prove the proposed context agnostic service, we take into account the air quality observation issue: we provide two high-contextualized informative services to leverage data related to two different physical environments, thus building location awareness for different geographic areas and stakeholders. But still managed by the same application which can adapts itself. Finally we present the evaluation of this prototype to illustrate the benefits of our solution and the future work.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the Cybersecurity challenges faced by smart cities in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the pandemic still there, cybercriminals and state-sponsored groups have taken advantage of attacking intelligent cities worldwide. This research primarily focuses on a correspondence between the increase in the attacks on different cyber-sectors in smart cities and the ongoing pandemic. When people are still adjusting to the new norm of working from home (WFH) and online classes, there had been many cases of cyber criminals trying to taking over some popular video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, and Google meet. Hijacking the sessions and displaying their agenda or demands are among the attacks which Cybercriminals have mounted on these platforms. There is a genuine concern regarding the cybersecurity of smart cities with the rise of cyber threats during the Corona virus pandemic. This paper studies the increase of cyber threats and issues on smart cities globally in the ongoing pandemic and different ways to confront them using technologies like Blockchain, Internet of Things, Software-defined networks, Artificial Intelligence, and data-driven security concepts.},

abstract={In smart cities and factories, robotic applications require high dexterity and security, which requires precise inverse dynamics model. However, the physical modeling methods cannot model the uncertain factors of the manipulator such as flexibility, joint clearance and friction, etc. As an alternative, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have become increasingly popular in robotics for smart cities and factories. In this paper, deep learning neural network based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is adopted to predict the manipulator inverse dynamics. This study aims to summarize the influence of the hyper-parameter settings on model performance and to explore the applicability of the LSTM model to joint torque prediction of multiple degrees of freedom series manipulator. Furthermore, the feasibility of using only joint position as input data for torque prediction is verified. Simulation result has shown that, for the proposed deep learning architecture, the effects of the number of maximum epochs on model performance should be prioritized. The effects of the number of hidden nodes on model performance are limited, while prediction accuracy will deteriorate as the number of hidden layers increases. It is proved that it is feasible to predict inverse dynamics when input data is joint position only. The experimental results show that the training time increases with the increase of hidden layers, neurons and epochs.},

abstract={Clean air is one of the most important needs for the well-being of human being health. In smart cities, timely and precise air pollution levels knowledge is vital for the successful setup of smart pollution systems. Recently, pollution and weather data in smart city have been bursting, and we have truly got into the era of big data. Ozone is considered as one of the most air pollutants with hurtful impact to human health. Existing methods used to predict the level of ozone uses shallow pollution prediction models and are still unsatisfactory in their accuracy to be used in many real-world applications. In order to increase the accuracy of prediction models we come up with the concept of using deep architecture models tested on big pollution and weather data. In this paper, a new deep learning-based ozone level prediction model is proposed, which considers the pollution and weather correlations integrally. This deep learning model is used to learn ozone level features, and it is trained using a grid search technique. A deep architecture model is utilized to represent ozone level features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for ozone level prediction has superior performance. The outcome of this study can be helpful in predicting the ozone level pollution in Aarhus city as a model of smart cities for improving accuracy of ozone forecasting tools.},

abstract={Smart cities and their applications have become attractive research fields birthing numerous technologies. Fifth generation (5G) networks are important components of smart cities, where intelligent access control is deployed for identity authentication, online banking, and cyber security. To assure secure transactions and to protect user's identities against cybersecurity threats, strong authentication techniques should be used. The prevalence of biometrics, such as fingerprints, in authentication and identification makes the need to safeguard them important across different areas of smart applications. Our study presents a system to detect alterations to biometric modalities to discriminate pristine, adulterated, and fake biometrics in 5G-based smart cities. Specifically, we use deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a hybrid model that combines CNN with convolutional long-short term memory (ConvLSTM) to compute a three-tier probability that a biometric has been tempered. Simulation-based experiments indicate that the alteration detection accuracy matches those recorded in advanced methods with superior performance in terms of detecting central rotation alteration to fingerprints. This makes the proposed system a veritable solution for different biometric authentication applications in secure smart cities.},

abstract={This paper proposes a platform, dubbed "Translational Visual Data Platform (TVDP)", to collect, manage, analyze urban visual data which enables participating community members connected not only to enhance their individual operations but also to smartly incorporate visual data acquisition, access, analysis methods and results among them. Specifically, we focus on geo-tagged visual data since location information is essential in many smart city applications and provides a fundamental connection in managing and sharing data among collaborators. Furthermore, our study targets for an image-based machine learning platform to prepare users for the upcoming era of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. TVDP will be used to pilot, test, and apply various visual data-intensive applications in a collaborative way. New data, methods, and extracted knowledge from one application can be effectively translated into other applications, ultimately making visual data and analysis as a smart city infrastructure. The goal is to make value creation through visual data and their analysis as broadly available as possible, thus to make social and economic problem solving more distributed and collaborative among users. This paper reports the design and implementation of TVDP in progress and partial experimental results to demonstrate its feasibility.},

Now with all technological advances, we are able to take advantage of artificial intelligence and cognitive services to provide a model in which the systems and devices will be scanned in an audit process to allow us to know if these are complaining at least of the minimum requirements of rules and regulations regarding data protection and privacy topics. A model that can be capable of audit using artificial intelligence and cognitive functions will be presented, as well as the architectural envision for implementing it in a smart city, where almost all of systems and devices will be audited.

abstract={In this paper, Artificial Neural Network(ANN) is used to solve the problems being faced by the farmers in Istanbul and to increase the productivity of farm produces. We implemented two methods in this research in order to classify the soil quality, namely; Curve fitting and Pattern classification. Curve-fitting method use the approach of representing an attempt for the neural network to identify and approximate an arbitrary input-output relation and once the relation has been modeled the necessary accuracy by the network, it can be used for a variety of tasks, such as series prediction, function approximation, and function optimization. Curve-fitting method has the objective of selection parameter values which minimizes the total error over the set of data points being considered, hence, the reason for its implementation in this research. Pattern classification involves building a function that maps the input feature space to an output space of two or more classes or more. The goal of pattern classification is to assign input patterns to one of a finite number of classes. And, it is a method that have been tested in previous research and gave positive results, hence, the reason for its implementation of this noble method in this study. Moreover, these models can predict the status of the soil and inform the farmers with the right decision to protect their fields. The simulation results showed that LevenbergMarquardt (LM) and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) methods are the best methods of the seven methods investigated. The accuracy of the networks studied ranged from 94.4 to 99.2%. Networks trained with LM algorithm were observed to be faster.},

abstract={Urban informatization applications are getting better and better, and smart cities are now taking shape because of the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, mobile Internet, and other new technologies. Smart cities allow information about a city's economic viability and culture to be shared and transmitted more rapidly. There is an increase in interconnection and communication using this method. People's living standards will rise because of the government's increased management and service capabilities. As smart cities become more common, new data sources, such as user behavior, preferences, and other insights, will be developed. A lot of data mining and analysis will be required. Urban informatization and industrialization will be achieved by implementing new information technology into a wide range of industries around the city. Efficiencies in urban management and the quality of life for residents will be enhanced by this reform. Many parts of city planning might be called “smart,” including transportation, health care, public safety, and education. Machine learning methods are being used to detect abnormalities in SMD Screen data, which includes information on all networking protocols. SMD LEDs used in LED displays are the subject of this research, which focuses on the most common causes of failure. When it comes to SMD LEDs' wet stress, antistatic capabilities, and hidden circuitry defects, we thoroughly inspect them. Following this research, we offer practical preventive solutions based on machine learning categorization models.},

Thus, to ensure the safety of its people, it is essential to conduct an efficient and real-time analysis of these data in order to receive timely responses in the event of catastrophic incidents. As a result, the process of transferring this vast data to the cloud for processing is relatively slow. In this paper, we present the software perspective to design and implement EFISS, a multilayer computing-based architecture for an intelligent, resource-efficient, and real-time surveillance system for smart cities. The framework, which is comprised of edge-fog computational layers, would help in the prevention of crime and the prediction of criminal incidents in smart cities.

abstract={Smart city applications covering a wide area such as traffic monitoring and pothole detection are gradually adopting more image machine learning algorithms utilizing ubiquitous camera sensors. To support such applications, an edge computing paradigm focuses on processing large amount of multimedia data at the edge to offload processing cost and reduce long-distance traffic and latency. However, existing edge computing approaches rely on pre-trained static models and are limited in supporting diverse classes of edge devices as well as learning models to support them. This research proposes a novel crowd-based learning framework which allows edge devices with diverse resource capabilities to perform machine learning towards the realization of image-based smart city applications. The intelligent retraining algorithm allows sharing key visual features to achieve a higher accuracy based on the temporal and geospatial uniqueness. Our evaluation shows the trade-off between accuracy and the resource constraints of the edge devices, while the model re-sizing option enables running machine learning models on edge devices with high flexibility.},

abstract={Finding a free space to park has become one of the main problems for drivers and urban mobility. Traffic congestion, usually caused by drivers looking for a free parking space, can increase energy consumption and air pollution. In this context, providing information regarding the availability of parking spots is crucial to help drivers find a free parking space faster, thus reducing parking search traffic. This paper proposes an approach based on GCNN and an LSTM model to forecast real-time future parking availability by capturing both the temporal occupancy patterns and the geospatial interactions in traffic flow. Different model configurations were evaluated by varying the information fed to the model (e.g., weather forecast, parking violations), the extent of historical data used, and the forecasting period. Experimental evaluation over historical parking data of the city of Tandil in Argentina showed that the proposed approach was able to outperform other state-of-the-art models significantly.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to dramatically change future intelligent transportation in smart cities. AVs are envisaged to evolve to a service rather than a product in the future. To provide best user experience of such services, three primary factors, namely, waiting time, travel time, and supply of AV services, are taken into consideration in a multiobjective optimization. Conventional optimization of services relies on traffic flow analysis over a queuing network model. However, due to the mobility of vehicles and the transfer uncertainty of road networks, the queuing network analysis is too complicated and practically intractable. For accuracy and convenient processing, network calculus (NC) is extended to model the queueing problem in this paper. The optimal number of available AVs can be identified by guaranteeing the waiting time of customers. The satisfaction of AV services can be viewed as a supply and demand problem, and optimized by bipartite graph matching. In order to reduce the average travel time, especially for rush hours with heavy traffic, we further propose a new online AVs fleet management scheme with congestion control for smart cities. It is shown that the intelligent management of AV fleet can be efficiently achieved, outperforming the cases of traditional vehicles. NC-assisted AI enables an efficient intelligent transportation paradigm in smart cities, while achieving substantial energy saving.},

abstract={Smart and green cities are hot topics in current research because people are becoming more conscious about their impact on the environment and the sustainability of their cities as the population increases. Many researchers are searching for mechanisms that can reduce power consumption and pollution in the city environment. This paper addresses the issue of public lighting and how it can be improved in order to achieve a more energy efficient city. This work is focused on making the process of turning the streetlights on and off more intelligent so that they consume less power and cause less light pollution. The proposed solution is comprised of a radar device and an expert system implemented on a low-cost platform based on a DSP. By analyzing the radar echo in both the frequency and time domains, the system is able to detect and identify objects moving in front of it. This information is used to decide whether or not the streetlight should be turned on. Experimental results show that the proposed system can provide hit rates over 80% promising a good performance. In addition, the proposed solution could be useful in kind of other applications such as intelligent security and surveillance systems and home automation.},

abstract={This work aims to conduct a comprehensive study on existing parking infrastructures and proposes intelligent parking solutions using novel Big Data Analytics with Deep Learning techniques. This research addresses the parking problems faced in most of the cities and growing colleges like University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). In this study, segmented images of parking spaces occupied by cars as well as available empty lots were extracted as spatial information and fed to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Deep Learning framework. We expect this incorporation of spatial-temporal information would enhance the classification performance of CNNs. For proof-of concept, performance will be validated on a free parking lot dataset-PKLot from Universidade Federal do Parana in Brazil. After desired classification performance is achieved, our robust CNN classification framework can be deployed on a cloud server to classify images in real-time. We also plan to release a parking-support mobile application (Android/IOS) that would display the real-time grid layout of empty and occupied parking spots using GPS information of the user. This app will be constantly updated based on parking information from the cloud-classifier. We expect that the outcome of this study will assist people in managing their time efficiently in finding their closest parking spot. It is also expected to ease the traffic flow and provide better parking management services.},

abstract={We propose a method for occupancy detection of parking space using background estimation and convolutional neural networks. To reduce the impact of ongoing traffic on the MIMO radar image, the moving objects in the scene are labeled as foreground and separated from static background. A convolutional neural network is trained to classify the images based on the occupancy of the parking spaces in the static images. Experimental measurements of real scenarios are presented showing very good performance after removing the foreground objects.},
