abstract={Emerging Edge Computing (EC) technology has shown promise for many delay-sensitive Deep Learning (DL) based applications of smart cities in terms of improved Quality-of-Service (QoS). EC requires judicious decisions which jointly consider the limited capacity of the edge servers and provided QoS of DL-dependent services. In a smart city environment, tasks may have varying priorities in terms of when and how to serve them; thus, priorities of the tasks have to be considered when making resource management decisions. In this paper, we focus on finding optimal offloading decisions in a three-tier user-edge-cloud architecture while considering different priority classes for the DL-based services and making a trade-off between a task’s completion time and the provided accuracy by the DL-based service. We cast the optimization problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) where the objective is to maximize a function called gain of system (GoS) defined based on provided QoS and priority of the tasks. We prove the problem is NP-hard. We then propose an efficient offloading algorithm, called PGUS, that is shown to achieve near-optimal results in terms of the provided GoS. Finally, we compare our proposed algorithm, PGUS, with heuristics and a state-of-the-art algorithm, called GUS, using both numerical analysis and real-world implementation. Our results show that PGUS outperforms GUS by a factor of 45% in average in terms of serving the top 25% higher priority classes of the tasks while still keeping the overall percentage of the dropped tasks minimal and the overall gain of system maximized.},

pages={20-23},
abstract={In modern cities, the number of vehicles is increasing day by day, which makes it difficult to find parking spaces during travel and takes a lot of time to drive at a slow speed. This not only causes local traffic chaos but also interferes with the driving efficiency of the entire roads. This phenomenon is a common problem faced by modern metropolitan areas. To reduce the time spent in finding parking spaces, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions, and to effectively improve overall driving efficiency, the systemization of urban roadside or off-street parking has become a key issue that needs attention and demonstration in so-called “smart” cities. In this paper, we have designed and applied an mm-Wave Radar to detect the presence or absence of available parking spaces, and the parking space data can be quickly uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, the status of the parking space can be updated in real-time. Based on this parking space status data, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to conduct deep learning. The input data of this model includes parking space location, parking space status, and parking time factors. Using mm-Wave radar experiment with the trained LSTM output provides parking space status prediction which enables drivers to obtain parking space status before they arrive at the destination. This can save half of the drivers' time wasted in finding parking spaces and head to the smart cities.},

abstract={Multimedia Internet of Things (IoT) devices, especially, the smartphones are embedded with sensors including Global Positioning System (GPS), barometer, microphone, accelerometer, etc. These sensors working together, present a fairly complete picture of the citizens' daily activities, with implications for their privacy. With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications. Therefore, this work proposed an optimal and light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical complex text-based CAPTCHAs simultaneously. The accuracy of the proposed CNN model has been accelerated based on Cyclical Learning Rates (CLRs) policy. The proposed CLR-CNN model achieved a high accuracy to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical text-based CAPTCHAs of 99.87% and 99.66%, respectively. In real-time, we observed that the speed of the model has increased, the model is lightweight, stable, and flexible as compared to other CAPTCHA solving techniques. The result of this current work will increase awareness and will assist multimedia security Researchers to continue and develop more robust text-based CAPTCHAs with their security mechanisms capable of protecting the private information of citizens in Smart Cities.},

abstract={A major challenge in urban cities is waste management, as the pace of urbanization is growing rapidly sustainable urban development strategies are therefore required. One of the main concerns with our environment has been improper garbage containment, unrepaired potholes, open manholes, and stagnant water which are harmful to the well-being of the residents. Since the idea of smart cities is very trendy these days and without a smart waste management system, smart cities can't be complete. Traditional manual monitoring is a cumbersome process and utilizes more effort, time, and cost which can easily be assisted with present technologies. Monitoring such tasks using IoT is one such solution, but incorporating IoT deals with the use of sensitive electronic devices which are difficult to maintain and hence add on some additional costs. Hence this paper describes the development of a system using deep learning techniques which can cut down huge costs in effectively monitoring the surroundings and lend a helping hand for a better, safer present and future.},

abstract={IoT systems are used for performing a variety of essential tasks in wide-ranging sectors, such as healthcare, smart cities, agriculture, and industrial automation. Most of these systems incorporate smartness for intelligent decision making using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. To reduce network bandwidth usage and load on the cloud server, there is a push to relegate most of these AI-related computations to edge IoT devices/systems. Hence, to ensure good performance, the edge devices must be systematically designed with an emphasis on the respective AI requirements from exploration to deployment. State-of-the-art IoT device and system design practices place little importance on the AI specifications during the early stages of the system development resulting in systems, which are unable to meet the AI specifications without additional re-designing and optimization efforts. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for AI-rooted IoT system design approach, where the AI specifications play a vital role in deciding the system components, design, and implementation from a very early stage of the design life cycle. The proposed framework employs an expert system and a machine-readable knowledge-base to automate the design process. Using a set of case studies, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework.},

abstract={Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) can be applied to find the most efficient route to travel between various nodes. The goal is to make smart cities to be created by heuristic algorithms on the real maps to perform some tasks through TSP. Therefore, Hill Climbing heuristic search algorithm which is generally used for mathematical optimization problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) field has been preferred in this study. This application takes a city from the OpenStreetMap (OSM), which is a real map as an input given to the algorithm, and calculates a path to visit all the nodes on the related route. The output was intended to be found in the shortest possible way and in the least possible time. On the market, there are some travelling, public transport and discovery applications or games on the smart maps. Also there are some publications about TSP and metaheuristic approaches in the literature but the sources are generally commercial products and for limited cities. There is no application that takes all the cities as a source and makes a travel plan for tourists. This study intended to create an open-source, location independent travel plan advisor and develop an indigenous product. Application was tested for Rome and Ankara as an instance but because a flexible working area OSM was used, application can be generated for all the routes and also various applications can be developed by researchers based on this study.},

Based on the OSCO (online stochastic combinatorial optimization) problem, it is presented a framework to operate such problem in a last-mile delivery system where customers requests from e-commerce (or food delivery) along an operations day. The deterministic calculation was realized using a permutational flowshop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing makespan. Experiments indicated convergence in the algorithm along the planning trials, and a satisfactory makespan prediction, before the orders are revealed, with accuracy. The probability distribution adheres with a bell-shaped (normal) distribution with its population parameters estimated using classical statistics inference theory. Incorporating uncertain in such type of mathematical modeling could open doors for a new era of systems in current days with cloud computing, big data, smart cities, and artificial intelligence.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted much interest due to its wide applications, such as smart city, manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare. Social and cognitive IoT is capable of exploiting social networking characteristics to optimize network performance. Considering the fact that the IoT devices have different Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements [ranging from ultrareliable and low-latency communications (URLLCs) to minimum data rate], this article presents a QoS-driven social-aware-enhanced device-to-device (D2D) communication network model for social and cognitive IoT by utilizing social orientation information. We model the optimization problem as a multiagent reinforcement learning formulation, and a novel coordinated multiagent deep-reinforcement-learning-based resource management approach is proposed to optimize the joint radio block assignment and the transmission power control strategy. Meanwhile, the prioritized experience replay (PER) and the coordinated learning mechanisms are employed to enable communication links to work cooperatively in a distributed manner, which enhances the network performance and access success probability. The simulation results corroborate the superiority in the performance of the presented resource management approach, and it outperforms other existing approaches in terms of meeting the energy efficiency and the QoS requirements.},

abstract={Device-to-device (D2D) communication is an emerging technology in the evolution of the 5G network enabled vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. It is a core technique for the next generation of many platforms and applications, e.g. real-time high-quality video streaming, virtual reality game, and smart city operation. However, the rapid proliferation of user devices and sensors leads to the need for more efficient resource allocation algorithms to enhance network performance while still capable of guaranteeing the quality-of-service. Currently, deep reinforcement learning is rising as a powerful tool to enable each node in the network to have a real-time self-organising ability. In this paper, we present two novel approaches based on deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, namely “distributed deep deterministic policy gradient” and “sharing deep deterministic policy gradient”, for the multi-agent power allocation problem in D2D-based V2V communications. Numerical results show that our proposed models outperform other deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of the network's energy efficiency and flexibility.},

abstract={The project aims to model implementation of an advanced Smart City system that consists of Smart Home equipped with security features, Smart Waste Management System and automated street lights. Because of the increasing instance of gun violence in the country as well as abroad, we have added the feature of detecting guns outdoors using neural networks, image classifier and object detection. The system is designed by merging the concept of the Internet of Things that control various components of the Smart City ranging from energy efficient Smart Home along with its security measures to identifying a gun from closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage to detect danger on streets of the city achieved by creating an image classifier by training a neural network. As there is no sensor currently available that can detect the presence of an object in a photo, an image classifier is used to detect guns in the photos taken by the CCTV camera.},

abstract={A community and a city in terms of energy are composed of residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. Besides, standards as ISO 37120 provide indicators that determine if the community is having a sustainable and quality of life. The energy indicator is used in this paper to analyze the level of energy consumption. Another element involved in a city is the user who lives in that place; there is an interaction between the community, buildings, users, and the software and hardware technology. Consequently, social interaction in users plays a primary role in understanding and knowing the user’s patterns and profile them and how they interact in the building, the community, and the city. Thus, creating a smart community or smart city goes beyond that only use one methodology, so this paper proposes to combine gamification, machine learning, and ISO standard to create a strategy that could promote in a better manner the transition to smart communities and cities. Therefore, this paper analyzes the Energy indicator of the ISO standard applied to Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus (Tec CCM) in a three-level structure: smart building, smart community, and smart city.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) in smart city consists of a diversity of public utility and vertical industry services with extremely different performance requirements. As a key technology of 5G networks, network slicing (NS) is featured to provide distinct virtual networks and differentiated QoS guarantees in a shared infrastructure. Therefore, it becomes necessary to employ intelligent NS management for IoT in smart city. This work proposes a machine learning (ML) driven automatic NS framework which can intelligently scale slice according to network state. The resource preservation and slicing implementation scheme is given to trade off robustness and resource efficiency.

abstract={Hanoi is the one of the fastest-growing cities in Vietnam, which sets the target to turn into a smart city in 2030. Nowadays, 3D city models are being increasingly employed for many domains and tasks beyond visualization, then it will take an important role in smart city. In order to develop 3D city models, 2D geographic data such as building footprint and building height attribute are required. However, the lack of the height attribute for various types of building and low performance of rendering and visualizing 3D city models are two big remaining problems. In this paper, available data from open sources is used to predict the building height. The prediction has carried out with machine learning techniques using the combination of different attributes. After that, the models will be created using 3D tiles specification to improve the visualization performance. The preliminary results of the proposed method highlight the potential of generation of massive 3D city models from the available data in Vietnam.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions to create a smart, connected city that is composed of ubiquitous environmental and user sensing along with distributed, low-capacity computing. This provides ample information regarding the citizens in various smart environments. We can leverage this people-centric information, provided by the smart city infrastructure, to improve “smart health” applications: user data from connected wearable devices can be accompanied with ubiquitous environmental sensing and versatile actuation. The state-of-the-art in smart health applications is black-box, end-to-end implementations which are neither intended for use with heterogeneous data nor adaptable to a changing set of sensing and actuation. In this paper, we apply our modular approach for IoT applications - the context engine - to smart health problems, enabling the ability to grow with available data, use general-purpose machine learning, and reduce compute redundancy and complexity. For smart health, this improves response times for critical situations, more efficient identification of health-related conditions and subsequent actuation in a smart city environment. We demonstrate the potential with three sets of interconnected context-aware applications, extracting health-related people-centric context, such as user presence, user activity, air quality, and location from IoT sensors.},

abstract={Advanced wireless communication network testbeds are now widely being deployed around European and cross-continental. This represents an interesting opportunity for vertical industry and academia to perform experimentation and validation before a real deployment.

On top of this platform, we designed and deployed a smart city safety system as a vertical use case, exploring 5G capabilities through a combination of NFV and machine learning to provide end-to-end communication and low latency smart city service. This safety system helps detecting criminals along the city and sending a notification to the security center. A Virtual Network Function (VNF) has been developed to enable video transcoding, face detection and recognition at the cloud or the edge of the network. The validation of the overall system is performed through the deployment of the use case indoor (Smart Internet Lab) and outdoor (Millennium Square Bristol).

abstract={When directly operated in an image, good results are always difficult to achieve via conventional methods because they have poor high-dimensional performance. Support vector machine (SVM) is a type of machine learning method with solid foundation that is developed based on traditional statistics. It is also a theory for statistical estimation and predictive learning of objects. This paper optimizes the structure of SVM classification tree with differential evolution (DE) and designs the corresponding DE algorithm to effectively solve the problem of image classification of complex background cases in smart city management systems. In the training process of SVM classification tree, it obtains an optimal two-class classification scheme in every node by means of DE, initially separates the classes that are easy to be separated and then the less easy ones, and finally adaptively generates the best classification tree. The simulation experiment proves that the proposed algorithm is effective when applied to smart city management systems.},

abstract={The cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) has attracted much interest recently in wireless networks due to its wide applications in smart cities, intelligent transportation systems, and smart metering networks. However, how to smartly schedule the packet transmission in CIoT systems is still a key challenge, that is, how to design a smart agent to realize the intelligent decision making and effective interoperability. In this paper, we model the system state transformation as a Markov decision process, and an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on a fuzzy normalized radial basis function neural network (called AC-FNRBF) is proposed to efficiently solve the intelligent transmission scheduling problem in CIoT systems under high-dimensional variables. The proposed AC-FNRBF algorithm can better approximate both the action function of the actor and the state-action value function of the critic without requiring the system prior knowledge, and a new reward function is established to maximize the system benefit, which jointly takes the transmission packet rate, the system throughput, the power consumption, and the transmission delay into account. Moreover, the AC-FNRBF has the ability to adjust its learning structure and parameters in dynamic environments. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves higher transmission packet rate and system throughput with lower power consumption and transmission delay, compared with other existing reinforcement learning algorithms.},

abstract={In recent years, computation offloading has become an effective way to overcome the constraints of mobile devices (MDs) by offloading delay-sensitive and computation-intensive mobile application tasks to remote cloud-based data centers. Smart cities can benefit from offloading to edge points in the framework of the so-called cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS), as for example in traffic violation tracking cameras. We assume that there are mobile edge computing networks (MECNs) in more than one region, and they consist of multiple access points, multi-edge servers, and N MDs, where each MD has M independent real-time massive tasks. The MDs can connect to a MECN through the access points or the mobile network. Each task be can processed locally by the MD itself or remotely. There are three offloading options: nearest edge server, adjacent edge server, and remote cloud. We propose a reinforcement-learning-based state-action-reward-state-action (RL-SARSA) algorithm to resolve the resource management problem in the edge server, and make the optimal offloading decision for minimizing system cost, including energy consumption and computing time delay. We call this method OD-SARSA (offloading decision-based SARSA). We compared our proposed method with reinforcement learning based Q learning (RL-QL), and it is concluded that the performance of the former is superior to that of the latter.},

This work presents a novel framework to improve patrol planning that precisely provides places and times that are likely to be more dangerous than short-term average using a portfolio of machine learning algorithms. Our approach follows an algorithm-as-a-service architecture (AaaS), providing insights to existing public safety systems and platforms. The service comprises the broader ROTA framework, a robust public safety platform devised for the ongoing smart cities initiative of Natal, Brazil. Results of an experimental evaluation provided insights about spatial granularity effects on the performance of the estimators adopted. Furthermore, an evaluation on algorithm selection demonstrates its outcomes on the hotspot detection task.},

abstract={Smart cities are a growing paradigm in the design of systems that interact with one another for informed and efficient decision making, empowered by data and technology, of resources in a city. The diffusion of information to citizens in a smart city will rely on social trends and smart advertisement. Online social networks (OSNs) are prominent and increasingly important platforms to spread information, observe social trends, and advertise new products. To maximize the benefits of such platforms in sharing information, many groups invest in finding ways to maximize the expected number of clicks as a proxy of these platform's performance. As such, the study of click-through rate (CTR) prediction of advertisements, in environments like online social media, is of much interest. Prior works build machine learning (ML) using user-specific data to classify whether a user will click on an advertisement or not. For our work, we consider a large set of Facebook advertisement data (with no user data) and categorize targeted interests into thematic groups we call conceptual nodes. ML models are trained using the advertisement data to perform CTR prediction with conceptual node combinations. We then cast the problem of finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes as an optimization problem. Given a certain budget $k$, we are interested in finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes that maximize the CTR. We discuss the hardness and possible NP-hardness of the optimization problem. Then, we propose a greedy algorithm and a genetic algorithm to find near-optimal combinations of conceptual nodes in polynomial time, with the genetic algorithm nearly matching the optimal solution. We observe that simple ML models can exhibit the high Pearson correlation coefficients w.r.t. click predictions and real click values. Additionally, we find that the conceptual nodes of “politics”, “celebrity”, and “organization” are notably more influential than other considered conceptual nodes.},

LoRa is one such technology, which provides energy efficiency and wide-area coverage. This article explores the use of intelligent machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines, spline models, decision trees, and ensemble learning, for received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based ranging in LoRa networks on a training dataset collected in two different environments: indoors and outdoors. The suitable ranging model is then used to experimentally evaluate the accuracy of localization and tracking using trilateration in the studied environments. Later, we present the accuracy of a LoRa-based positioning system (LPS) and compare it with the existing ZigBee, WiFi, and Bluetooth-based solutions. In the end, we discuss the challenges of satellite-independent tracking systems and propose future directions to improve accuracy and provide deployment feasibility.},

abstract={With the rise of smart cities, transportation systems are getting smarter every day. An Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) should be secure, autonomous, capable of discerning safeness levels at the roads, and provide services to improve human experience. To reach the gold standard, the ITS faces several issues such as centralization, trust, and data integrity. The Transportation System and the data generated from the vehicles can be intercepted, manipulated and corrupted with coordinated attacks. Moreover, every system might have bad actors who want to manipulate the system or data to his or her favor by exploiting the system. In order to guarantee data integrity, immutability, and availability for the ITS, we propose Blockchain based architecture with outlier detection to prevent malicious activity by the vehicles while preserving integrity in sharing information. The Outlier Detection is designed to reside before the consensus process, to identify and prevent participation of malicious vehicles in consensus process or block mining. In our proposed Blockchain based Intelligent Transportation system with Outlier Detection for Smart City (BITS), we used machine learning to detect the anomaly in the data.

The quality of life of people is positively affected by emerging this concept in recent years. Autonomous vehicles confront with the term of the smart city and have become even more popular in recent years. In this study, a system of traffic lights detection and recognition is performed in order to reduce the accidents caused by traffic lights. The proposed method has divided into two sections. Each of these parts requires hardware. The first part requires a camera to get the image. The other part requires a computer to process the received images. In the proposed method, images have been taken using CCD camera in the first step. Image processing techniques are performed step by step to detect the traffic lights in the received image through the computer. When traffic lights are detected, the received RGB image is converted into HSV format to perform chromatic separation from uniform and non-chromatic elements in the image. By performing a color based segmentation process on the obtained HSV format image, the locations of traffic lights in the image are easily detected. The color of the traffic light is easily determined through the SVM (Support Vector Machines) classification model, which is a machine learning algorithm prepared beforehand, after the location of the traffic lights is determined in the image.},

IP camera is one of the most important elements in In Internet of things (IoT) and smart cities, in this era. IoT Based Smart Surveillance provides resources over the Internet and allows a plethora of applications to be deployed to provide services for different applications. Traditional solutions to deal with the big video data would require a large amount of computing and storage resources. one of the major bottleneck being faced the computational cost of spatio-temporal deep neural networks making them run as fast as their 2D counterparts while preserving accuracy on video recognition benchmarks. To this end, we present the new model-based human action recognition design. In this method we use fixed dimensional representation for actions in video clips of varying lengths to decrees computational complexes. This representation, simplify clustering and comparing between videos. In addition, the methods based on CNN usually need manual annotation at the beginning and the meaning of characteristics is an abstract wonder and subjective phenomenon and hence a manual annotation of attributes is highly inconsistent [1]. Anyhow our proposed smart surveillance system is unsupervised and don't need inconsistent manual annotation of video clips attributes. Many researchers believe smart surveillance system is a critical component of smart cities and can be a solid foundation for future applications in intelligent surveillance systems focuses on human action Recognition.},

abstract={With the explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and various emerging network technologies, IoT-enabled smart cities are further refined into health smart cities. For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human–computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation. This can promote the deployment of our proposed MEC-enabled hierarchical emotion recognition system and defense mechanism in real-world scenarios.},

abstract={With the fluctuations of energy pricing, the electricity bills for many households is becoming an increasing burden in the monthly bills to be paid. Many households in many countries would appreciate Smart Electricity Monitors and Smart Electricity controllers that can be used both in Smart Cities and regular households. Weather conditions play a vital role in electricity consumption, for example, in a hot desert climate, the electricity bill is tripled or quadrupled due to the use of air conditioning in summer. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based technique to anticipate the electricity consumption using weather data. Using a dataset consisting of reading over 350 days of household appliances with weather condition, the proposed method is able to predict the electricity consumption with a correlation coefficient of 75.7% using Random Tree. The results obtained provide an excellent basis for the ultimate goal of setting up an accurate smart electricity consumption monitor to be used both in Smart Cities and even in regular households which could ultimately help households to reduce electricity by regulating the use of the most electricity consuming appliances according to weather conditions.},

abstract={Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) providing vehicle-related statistical data are one of the key components for future smart cities. In this context, knowledge about the current traffic flow is used for travel time reduction and proactive jam avoidance by intelligent traffic control mechanisms. In addition, the monitoring and classification of vehicles can be used in the field of smart parking systems. The required data is measured using networks with a wide range of sensors. Nevertheless, in the context of smart cities no existing solution for traffic flow detection and vehicle classification is able to guarantee high classification accuracy, low deployment and maintenance costs, low power consumption and a weather-independent operation while respecting privacy. In this paper, we propose a radiobased approach for traffic flow detection and vehicle classification using signal attenuation measurements and machine learning algorithms. The results of comprehensive measurements in the field prove its high classification success rate of about 99%.},

abstract={Smart cities should be built on harmonious relationships with the environment, with rational measures to use environmental resources in many ways. Resources essential to human life such as water and energy must have special attention. With the advance of technologies use, human being becomes one of the main promoters of information and solutions for smart cities. Stream machine learning is an approach where data becomes available sequentially, called data stream, which adapts the prediction model with fixed window-sized data stream. The objective of this work is to analyze the effectiveness of buildings energy consumption using stream learning. To achieve this goal, MOA11Massive Online Analysis tool was used to evaluate the performance of the selected stream learning algorithms on an an open database.

abstract={One of the major concerns of the environment that strongly impacts the health and well-being of society is the detection, monitoring, and management of solid wastes. Slowly the world is stepping towards smart systems enabling complete automation of societies. The concept of smart cities, which is heavily based on Internet of Things (IoT) systems makes human lives more comfortable and secure in every aspect. As a result, smart waste management systems form an essential part of the establishment of smart cities. The conventional method of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a tedious process and uses a lot of human effort, time, and cost which can easily be avoided with the current innovations. The garbage collection process is also highly redundant, inefficient, and can be vastly improved using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to use the powerful tools of IoT to completely automate the process of garbage monitoring using ultrasonic sensors and NodeMCU and provide an optimal route for garbage collection using the cluster first-route second ML algorithm.},

abstract={The Fifth Generation (5G) communication technology has paved the way for intelligent and diversified Internet of Connected Vehicles (IoCV) services that meet stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain are playing and will continue to play an imperative role in providing secure and decentralized resource sharing to solve complex and time-sensitive problems at the edge. The integration of both those techniques will enhance the performance of smart vehicular services, especially in beyond 5G (B5G) networks. Ensuring secure transactions in complex autonomous network architectures is an immense challenge. This article addresses computational, storage, connectivity and intelligence concerns using a collaborative approach to engage multiple Internet of Things (IoT) nodes such as connected- vehicles, drones and mobile devices for the provisioning of QoS-optimal complex service compositions in autonomous mobile networks. Continuous and fast compositions emerge using decentralized decisions and interactions with diversified neighboring nodes with the aid of reinforcement learning. Blockchain is used to ensure that nodes interact with each other verifiably and record transactions without the need for trusted intermediaries. We assess whether having an AI-enabled blockchain collaborative composition solution improves service availability and delivery of smart city vehicular services.},

abstract={Recently, smart cities, healthcare system, and smart vehicles have raised challenges on the capability and connectivity of state-of-the-art Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, especially for the devices in hotspots area. Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) can enhance the ability of emerging resource-intensive IoT applications and has attracted much attention. However, due to the time-varying network environments, as well as the heterogeneous resources of network devices, it is hard to achieve stable, reliable, and real-time interactions between edge devices and their serving edge servers, especially in the 5G ultradense network (UDN) scenarios. Ultradense edge computing (UDEC) has the potential to fill this gap, especially in the 5G era, but it still faces challenges in its current solutions, such as the lack of: 1) efficient utilization of multiple 5G resources (e.g., computation, communication, storage, and service resources); 2) low overhead offloading decision making and resource allocation strategies; and 3) privacy and security protection schemes. Thus, we first propose an intelligent UDEC (I-UDEC) framework, which integrates blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) into 5G UDEC networks. Then, in order to achieve real-time and low overhead computation offloading decisions and resource allocation strategies, we design a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (2Ts-DRL) approach, consisting of a fast-timescale and a slow-timescale learning process, respectively. The primary objective is to minimize the total offloading delay and network resource usage by jointly optimizing computation offloading, resource allocation, and service caching placement. We also leverage federated learning (FL) to train the 2Ts-DRL model in a distributed manner, aiming to protect the edge devices' data privacy. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of both the 2Ts-DRL and FL in the I-UDEC framework and prove that our proposed algorithm can reduce task execution time up to 31.87%.},

abstract={The massive growth of Smart City and Internet of Things applications enables safety and security. The data those are produced from surveillance cameras in aerial devices such as unmanned aerial networks (UAVs) are needed to be transferred to ground stations for secure data analysis. When the scale of network is relatively large compare to the wireless communication coverage of device, it is not always available to transmit the data to the ground stations, thus distributed and autonomous algorithms are essentially desired. Based on the needs, we propose a novel algorithm that is for collecting surveillance data under the consideration of mobility and flexibility of UAV networks. Due to the battery limitation in UAVs, we selectively collect data from the UAVs by setting rules under the consideration of distance and similarity. As a sequence, the UAV devices have to compete for a chance to get data processing. For this purpose, this paper designs a Myerson auction-based deep learning algorithm to leverage the UAV’s revenue compare to traditional second-price auction while preserving truthfulness. Based on simulation results, we verify that our proposed algorithm achieves desired performance improvements.},

abstract={Finding a parking space is a tedious and time-consuming task in a metropolitan city. Due to this problem, many researchers proposed an automatic parking lot occupancy detection system using a camera with a deep learning method to provide useful information in the smart city system. Since object detection for the parking lot is performed in real-time by utilizing CPU and GPUs while parking detection is working 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, therefore power saving is important to reduce the electricity cost. However, the energy-aware is not considered in most related works. In this paper, we proposed an energy-saving algorithm for parking lot availability detection using YOLO running on the TX2 machine. We experiment using small parking lot prototype and remote control cars. In the experiment, we compare our algorithm with the direct application of original YOLO for parking lot detection, the results show that it reduces power by 97 percent when there is no moving object in the parking lot area and 71 percent when there are moving objects in the parking lot area.},

After refinement, the building boundary needs regularization to reshape the irregular boundary into a regular building primitive. Finally, a 3D plane fitting is applied to shape the rooftop using lidar points inside building primitive. The test data was an urban area with the size of 1800m by 1200m.

abstract={Accurately predicting the urban spatio-temporal data is critically important to various urban computing tasks for smart city related applications such as crowd flow prediction and traffic congestion prediction. Existing models especially deep learning based approaches require a large volume of training data, whose performance may degrade remarkably when the data is scarce. Recent works try to transfer knowledge from the intra-city or cross-city multi-modal spatio-temporal data. However, the careful design of what to transfer and how between the multi-modal spatio-temporal data needs to be determined in advance. There still lacks an end-to-end solution that can automatically capture the common cross-domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Deep Attentive Adaptation Network model named ST-DAAN to transfer cross-domain Spatio-Temporal knowledge for urban crowd flow prediction. ST-DAAN first maps the raw spatio-temporal data of source domain and target domain to a common embedding space. Then domain adaptation is adopted on several domain-specific layers through adding a domain discrepancy penalty to explicitly match the mean embeddings of the two domain distributions. Considering the complex spatial correlation in many urban spatio-temporal data, a global attention mechanism is also designed to enable the model to capture broader spatial dependencies. Using urban crowd flow prediction as a demonstration, we conduct experiments on five real-world large datasets over both intra- and cross-city transfer learning. The results demonstrate that ST-DAAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

abstract={Obtaining a high-quality OCR output in smart cities, with human-in-the-loop, is an interesting problem for surveillance and other similar applications. Achieving high accuracy while reading license plates in the real world videos is cumbersome due to complexities like multiple vehicles, high-density traffic in spatial and temporal domains, varying camera angles and illumination, occlusions and multiple resolutions. We present a modular framework for OCR corrections in the chaotic Indian traffic videos that especially involve complex license plate patterns. Such patterns are obtained from a state-of-the-art deep learning model trained on video frames. Since such a model reads the text from videos (instead of images), we incorporate multi-frame consensus for generating suggestions in our framework. To ease the correction process, our human-interactive framework first breaks down the multi-vehicle videos into multiple clips, each containing a single vehicle from the video using an object detector and a tracker. Our framework then provides suggestions for an individual vehicle using multi-frame consensus. Our framework then selectively presents these extracted clips to the user to verify/correct the predictions with minimal human efforts via interactive suggestions. Such high-quality output can be used to continuously update a large database for surveillance and can be further used to improve the accuracy of deep models in the complex real-world scenarios.},

But this research area received less attention from computer vision enthusiasts due to the shortage of proper datasets. Earlier studies were mainly focusing on specific views (i.e., front/back), but these techniques are not effective in real-world scenarios, where the angle and visual appearance of the moving vehicle change for the camera. In this article, we propose a dual-stream Siamese network for vehicle re-identification by substitution of few traditional convolutional layers into dilated convolutional layers (DCL). In our proposed framework, both streams are utilizing baseline ResNet-50 model, where one is employed to extract features from registration plates while the next stream capture features from vehicles shape.

In this scenario, the communication is done between Vehicles to UAVs (V2U), subsequently transforming into a UAV-assisted VANET. UAV-assisted VANET allows users to access real-time data, especially the monitoring data in smart cities using current mobile networks. Nevertheless, due to the open nature of communication infrastructure, the high mobility of vehicles along with the security and privacy constraints are the significant concerns of UAV-assisted VANET. In these scenarios, Deep Learning Algorithms (DLA) could play an effective role in the security, privacy, and routing issues of UAV-assisted VANET. Keeping this in mind, we have devised a DLA-based key-exchange protocol for UAV-assisted VANET. The proposed protocol extends the scalability and uses secure bitwise XOR operations, one-way hash functions, including user's biometric verification when users and drones are mutually authenticated. The proposed protocol can resist many well-known security attacks and provides formal and informal security under the Random Oracle Model (ROM). The security comparison shows that the proposed protocol outperforms the security performance in terms of running time cost and communication cost and has effective security features compared to other related protocols.},

Graphs are a very important part of computer algorithms and data structures. Graph structures can find lost of mappings in natural world. It emphasizes the relationship between nodes and link, and this property is widely used in social network processing, risk control, cyber security, and smart cities. The traffic flow problem is an important factor that plagues urban development. Large cities need to consider many factors when planning new construction, such as the distribution of residential communities, natural topography, and even underground pipelines. The city construction process adjusts the current traffic flow, inevitably impacting the original urban transportation network. The uncertainty of such impact is one of the reasons why many urban construction schemes are difficult to advance. Here we propose a graph attention mechanism-based urban traffic flow prediction, and we propose a method that separates the urban grid layout and traffic calculation to handle remapping. Our model can accurately predict both global and local traffic in cities while achieving satisfactory results in regression evaluation metrics, and our model is also a lightweight model that provides a basis for future research on small-scale devices.},

abstract={A smart city is a sustainable and effective metropolitan hub, that offers its residents high excellence of life through appropriate resource management. Energy management is among the most challenging problems in such metropolitan areas due to the difficulty and key role of energy systems. To optimize the benefit from the available megawatt-hours, it is important to predict the maximum electrical power output of a baseload power plant. This paper explores the method of a deep extreme learning machine to create a predictive model that can predict a combined cycle power plant's hourly full-load electrical output. An intelligent energy management solution can be achieved by properly monitoring and controlling these resources through the internet of things (IoT). The universe of artificial intelligence has produced many strides through deep learning algorithms and these methods were used for data analysis. Nonetheless, for further accuracy, deep extreme learning machine (DELM) is another candidate to be investigated for analyses of the data sequence. By using the DELM approach, a high level of reliability with a minimum error rate is achieved. The approach shows better results compared to previous investigations since previous studies could not meet the findings up to the mark and unable to predict power plant electrical energy output efficiently. During the investigation, it is shown that the proposed approach has the highest accuracy rate of 98.6% with 70% of training (33488 samples), 30% of test and validation (14352 examples). Simulation results validate the prediction effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={Advanced artificial intelligence techniques, such as federated learning, has been applied to broad areas, e.g., image classification, speech recognition, smart city, and healthcare. Despite intensive research on federated learning, existing schemes are vulnerable to attacks and can hardly meet the security requirements for real-world applications. The problem of designing a secure federated learning framework to ensure the correctness of training procedure has not been sufficiently studied and remains open. In this paper, we propose VFChain, a verifiable and auditable federated learning framework based on the blockchain system. First, to provide the verifiability, a committee is selected through the blockchain to collectively aggregate models and record verifiable proofs in the blockchain. Then, to provide the auditability, a novel authenticated data structure is proposed for blockchain to improve the search efficiency of verifiable proofs and support a secure rotation of committee. Finally, to further improve the search efficiency, an optimization scheme is proposed to support multiple-model learning tasks. We implement VFChain and conduct extensive experiments by utilizing the popular deep learning models over the public real-world dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed VFChain system.},

abstract={Recently, various kinds of Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions and services are provided such as smart industry, smart city, smart factory, smart agriculture and etc. Those solutions and services generate large amount of data from various devices which are connected through networks while they communicate with each other. However, it is a difficult problem to process the fast and massively produced data efficiently. To solve the problems in the framework level, there are many open-source big data processing and analysis frameworks. To process large-scale data in a fast manner, those frameworks use a cluster consisting of multiple computing machines. However, to set the framework running on large-scale cluster properly is not simple and it is difficult to verify its performance in the distributed environment. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of Apache Spark which is one of the most popular big data processing and analysis frameworks. Especially, we conduct experiments by using a representative benchmark tool, called HiBench, and large-scale data in the cluster environment. From the experimental results, we can conclude that Spark is highly scalable for distributed machine learning as well as big data processing.},

abstract={The Internet of Moving Things (IoMT) takes a step further with respect to traditional static IoT deployments. In this line, the integration of new eco-friendly mobility devices such as scooters or bicycles within the Cooperative-Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) and smart city ecosystems is crucial to provide novel services. To this end, a range of communication technologies is available, such as cellular, vehicular WiFi or Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN); however, none of them can fully cover energy consumption and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Thus, we propose a Decision Support System (DSS), based on supervised Machine Learning (ML) classification, for selecting the most adequate transmission interface to send a certain message in a multi-Radio Access Technology (RAT) set up. Different ML algorithms have been explored taking into account computing and energy constraints of IoMT enddevices and traffic type. Besides, a real implementation of a decision tree-based DSS for micro-controller units is presented and evaluated. The attained results demonstrate the validity of the proposal, saving energy in communication tasks as well as satisfying QoS requirements of certain urgent messages. The footprint of the real implementation on an Arduino Uno is 444 bytes and it can be executed in around 50 μs.},

abstract={A smart home contains smart gadgets which are generating a huge amount of data. The utilization of IoT gadgets in smart homes is constantly expanding and for faster processing of data, appropriate resources will be required. This generated data is passed to the cloud for processing but there may be a delay in the processing of data. Edge devices reside at the edges of smart gadgets and perform quick processing of data. Computation speed can be increased if generated data is classified and assigned to the edge node. The classifier is commonly used in machine learning algorithms. It can also be used in smart city and smart home applications. Data classification helps in decision-making by finding outliers from data. Many algorithms are available for data classification and out of which the rule-based classifier [1] and k-means clustering [2] are the most commonly used classifier. In this paper, we attempted to analyze the performance of the rule-based classifier and k-means clustering based on evaluation parameters viz. average execution time, service latency, and resource utilization. From the simulation results, it is observed that k-means clustering performs better as compared to rule-based classifier.},

abstract={The IoT is the cornerstone of many innovating processes such as those behind Smart Cities and Smart Industries. As more and more wireless IoT devices are deployed, a newer, more congestion-resilient communication infrastructure is required to absorb the traffic from the 50 billion IoT nodes expected by the year 2020. Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. To allow hardware-constrained IoT nodes to use these ANNs, we have proposed the application of a quantization technique that reduces computation and memory requirements and have validated it by its implementation in a real IoT device. Finally, to evaluate the proposal, we have simulated a network of 1000 devices deployed in the city of Chicago. The obtained results are compared to those achieved with other intuitive policies to further highlight the benefits of our proposal.},

In particular, real-time object recognition has become an important technology in smart cities. To achieve this, low-cost network deployment and low-latency data transfer are the key technologies. In this paper, we focus on Time- and Wavelength-Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Network (TWDM-PON) based inference systems to deploy cost-efficient networks that accommodate many network cameras. A significant issue for a GPU-based inference system via TWDM-PON is optimally allocating upstream wavelength and bandwidth to enable real-time inference. However, it has not been considered to increase the batch size of arrival data at edge servers ensuring low-latency transmission. Therefore, this paper proposes a concept of an inference system in which a large number of cameras periodically upload image data to a GPU-based server via TWDM-PONe We also propose a cooperative wavelength and bandwidth allocation algorithm to ensure low-latency and time-synchronized data arrival at the edge. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified with computer simulation.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) technology is being utilized in endless applications nowadays and the security of these applications is of great importance. Image based IoT applications serve a wide variety of fields such as medical application and smart cities. Steganography is a great threat to these applications where adversaries can use the images in these applications to hide malicious messages. Therefore, this paper presents an image steganalysis technique that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect the infamous JPEG steganography technique: JPEG universal wavelet relative distortion (J-UNIWARD). Several experiments were conducted to determine the breaking point of J-UNIWARD, whether the hiding technique relies on correlation of the images, and the effect of utilizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) on the performance of the CNN. The results of the CNN display that the breaking point of J-UNIWARD is 1.5 (bpnzAC), the correlation of the database affects the detection accuracy, and DCT increases the detection accuracy by 13%.},

abstract={Recently, extensive research efforts have been devoted to developing beyond fifth generation (B5G), also referred to as sixth generation (6G) wireless networks aimed at bringing ultra-reli-able low-latency communication services. 6G is expected to extend 5G capabilities to higher communication levels where numerous connected devices and sensors can operate seamlessly. One of the major research focuses of 6G is to enable massive Internet of Things (mIoT) applications. Like Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax), forthcoming wireless communication networks are likely to meet massively deployed devices and extremely new smart applications such as smart cities for mIoT. However, channel scarcity is still present due to a massive number of connected devices accessing the common spectrum resources. With this expectation, next-generation Wi-Fi 6 and beyond for mIoT are anticipated to have inherent machine intelligence capabilities to access the optimum channel resources for their performance optimization. Unfortunately, current wireless communication network standards do not support the ensuing needs of machine learning (ML)-aware frameworks in terms of resource allocation optimization. Keeping such an issue in mind, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based, one of the ML techniques, a framework for a wireless channel access mechanism for IEEE 802.11 standards (i.e., Wi-Fi) in mIoT. The proposed mechanism suggests exploiting a practically measured channel collision probability as a collected dataset from the wireless environment to select optimal resource allocation in mIoT for upcoming 6G wireless communications.},

abstract={For an efficient energy management by residential users, monitoring and control of connected household appliances is required.

The data acquisition system corresponds to an-Internet of Things (IoT) platform that uses Automatic Meter Reading devices, connected to a IoT-gateway via Wi-Fi to send data to an application on the web. For the recognition of the patterns, machine learning techniques are used. Accuracy results on pattern identification are obtained about 91% after applying a backpropagation method in an Artificial Neural Network in time basis. Through this work, the prediction of consumer categories in household appliances, with high levels of reliability and under multiple operating states, is reached.

abstract={Video cameras are an important high-fidelity source of surveillance information. They are especially useful in traffic monitoring scenarios in smart cities to reduce congestion, regulate traffic and enforce regulations. Unfortunately, increasing the number of cameras at a specific location makes it harder to keep quality attention on the scene due to high amount of unstructured data mixed with privacy breaching non-essential data, like faces of pedestrians etc. In this paper, we propose a method for real-time merging of multiple surveillance video sources to extract the required information in a single, world coordinate-based, virtual traffic camera view. Such a composite view allows for future improvements in quality of critical details using techniques as super resolution, while at the same time removing unnecessary private information. The implementation is validated on real world traffic data using NVIDIA Jetson TX2 as an edge device and consists of perspective transformation, image merging and object detection/tracking using YOLOv4 machine learning model for the extraction of significant objects only.},

abstract={Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.},

In our work, we tackle the problem of characterizing people movements in a urban environment by using WiFi sensors connected to the cellular network. In particular, we leverage WiFi probe requests transmitted by people’s smartphones and a machine learning approach to detect people’s flows, while preserving users’ privacy. We validate our approach through a proof-of-concept testbed deployed in the proximity of our campus area. We consider two types of devices, namely, commercial, off-the-shelf WiFi scanners and ad-hoc designed scanners implemented with Raspberry PIs. They provide different levels of visibility of the captured traffic, preserving in different ways the privacy of the people’s movements. In our current work, we investigate the different trade-offs between mobility tracking accuracy and the level of provided people’s privacy.},

abstract={IoT networks continue to expand in various domains, from smart homes and campuses to smart cities and critical infrastructures. Due to the lack of appropriate security measures embedded in IoT devices, they are increasingly becoming the target of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Existing machine learning-based methods for monitoring and securing IoT networks are fragile, expensive, and inflexible, and hence unable to cost-effectively cope with the dynamic and complex nature of attacks. For my PhD thesis, the aim is to develop a robust, accurate, scalable, and cost-effective network monitoring solution for securing large IoT systems. To do so, we would require to dynamically measure and analyze certain portions of network traffic. Therefore, we employ programmable networking techniques to dynamically and selectively acquire necessary telemetry data (packets and/or flows of connected devices) fed to a collection of learning-based models (each specialized in certain protocols with specific granularity) to classify devices, monitor their activity, and detect malicious behaviors. Our preliminary results show that the signature analysis of selected signaling packets from 26 real IoT devices yields a reasonably accurate inference by progressively collecting telemetry data at manageable processing costs.},

abstract={Predicting taxi travel times throughout the city can help organize taxi teams and minimize waiting times for passengers and drivers, creating smart cities. In this paper, we propose to use the Gradient Lift Decision Tree (GBDT) learning model to predict the future travel time based on historical taxi trajectory information. Remembering past information is very important here because future taxi requests are related to information about past actions that took place. For example, someone needs to go to a shopping center and predict the time to better organize friends and follow-up schedules. We proposed a multidimensional feature method based on machine learning gradient enhancement decision tree model. This method uses the original data to construct multi-dimensional basic features and inputs it into the GBDT model to obtain high-level features and further improve the prediction accuracy.},

abstract={Air pollution prediction for smart city applications has been attracted in artificial intelligence research to overcome problems to the health of citizen. Conventionally, environmental IoT data is gathered from monitoring station sensors then is sent to servers for centralized predictive model training at a whole region. That causes latency issues in data transmission from IoT devices to cloud servers. This paper describes federated learning paradigm approach for air pollution prediction model training on environmental monitoring sensor data. In the research, we design distributed learning framework that assists cooperative training among participants from different spatial areas such as cities and prefectures. At each area, Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN) are trained locally aiming to predict local Oxidant warning level while aggregated global model enhances distilled knowledge from all areas of a region. The research illustrates that designed common parts of CRNN can be fused globally meanwhile adaptive structure at predictive part of the deep neural network model can capture different environmental monitoring stations configuration at local areas. Some experiment results also hint methods to keep balance between federated learning synchronous training rounds and local deep neural network training epochs to maximize accuracy of the whole federated learning system. The results also prove that new participating areas can train and quickly obtain optimized local models by using transferred common global model.},

abstract={Recent advances in artificial intelligence have driven increasing intelligent applications at the network edge, such as smart home, smart factory, and smart city. To deploy computationally intensive Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices, traditional approaches have relied on either offloading workload to the remote cloud or optimizing computation at the end device locally. However, the cloud-assisted approaches suffer from the unreliable and delay-significant wide-area network, and the local computing approaches are limited by the constrained computing capability. Towards high-performance edge intelligence, the cooperative execution mechanism offers a new paradigm, which has attracted growing research interest recently. In this paper, we propose CoEdge, a distributed DNN computing system that orchestrates cooperative DNN inference over heterogeneous edge devices. CoEdge utilizes available computation and communication resources at the edge and dynamically partitions the DNN inference workload adaptive to devices' computing capabilities and network conditions. Experimental evaluations based on a realistic prototype show that CoEdge outperforms status-quo approaches in saving energy with close inference latency, achieving up to 25.5% ~ 66.9% energy reduction for four widely-adopted CNN models.},

abstract={To create and maintain comfortable indoor environments, predicting occupant thermal sensation is an important goal for architects, engineers, and facility managers. The link between thermal comfort, productivity, and health is common knowledge, and researchers have developed many state-of-the-art thermal-sensation models from dozens of research projects over the last 50 years. In addition to these, the use of intelligent data-analysis techniques, such as black-box artificial neural networks (ANNs), is receiving research attention with the aim of designing building thermal-behavior models from collected data. With the convergence of the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), smart buildings now protect us and keep us comfortable while saving energy and cutting emissions. These types of smart buildings play a vital role in building smart cities of the future. The aim of this study is to help facility managers predict the thermal sensation of the occupants under the given circumstances. To achieve this, we applied a data-driven approach to predict the thermal sensation of occupants of an indoor environment using previously collected data. Our main contribution is to design and evaluate a deep neural network (DNN) for predicting thermal sensations with a high degree of accuracy regardless of building type, climate zone, or a building’s heating and/or ventilation methods. We used the second version of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Global Thermal Comfort Database to train our model. The hyperparameter-tuning process of the proposed model is optimized using the Bayesian strategy and predicts the thermal sensation of occupants with 78% accuracy, which is much higher than the traditional predicted mean vote (PMV) model and the other shallow and deep networks compared.},

Furthermore, several initiatives such as smart cities and autonomous vehicles utilize AI and ML computational engines. The current and emerging applications and the growing industrial interest in AI necessitate introducing ML algorithms at the undergraduate level. In this paper, we describe a series of activities to introduce ML in undergraduate digital signal processing (DSP) classes. These activities include a computational comparative study of ML algorithms for spoken digit recognition using spectral representations of speech. We choose spectral representations and features for speech as those concepts associate with the core topics in DSP such as FFT and autoregressive spectra. Our primary objective is to introduce undergraduate DSP students to feature extraction and classification using appropriate signal analysis and ML tools. An online module on ML along with a computer exercise are developed and assigned as a semester project in the DSP class. The exercise is developed in Python and also on the online JDSP HTML5 environments. An assessment study of the modules and computer exercises are also part of this effort.},

abstract={We observe two major revolutionary trends in net-work operations: democratization of cost-effective and flexible communication means for vertical players, such as public safety, by private mobile networking combined with edge computing, and automatic and autonomic network operations empowered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Further innovations are required for making private networking readily available for vertical players that are reluctant to acquire expertise in complex network operations. We propose Edge Concierge, of which concept is to democratize cost-effective and flexible network operations using network layer AI at private network edges. Edge Concierge assists smart network operations for private mobile network operators and energy saving by changing working state of AI-empowered anomaly detection applications by network layer AI. We also employ unsupervised machine learning using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for estimating contexts by solely observing net-work traffic at mobile edge computing (MEC) middle boxes. In detail, we design a system of real-time and self-learning context estimation by a multi-level probabilistic state transition model trained by unsupervised learning, which is implemented in a commodity PC. In order to evaluate our proposed system, we take public safety context of smart cities as an example use case and show the benefits.},

abstract={In the today's society we are growing towards a world where we are using different techniques to automate different daily life tasks to reduce human efforts also the automation of different daily life tasks always offers a lot of advantages like high efficiency and accuracy to do those tasks. Today we are not only focused on the creation of automated systems but also on creation of smart systems like smart homes, smart cities etc. This includes a lot of tasks to be done with the help of Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence etc. All these technologies are widely used in order to create a system which can be used to complete a task automatically with the need of any human effort. In such a technology driven society there is always a need to create a system which can be used to monitor the usage of water in different apartments of a building. The main problem here is that there is no way to know how much of water is used in different apartments of a building and the cost of installation of separate water meters is too high also it will need a lot of construction work to install it. Currently there is no system to which is efficient enough to complete this such type of task as it need human efforts at many stages. In this there is a need of creation a system which can be installed easily with very less or no construction also it should be able to collect data and then it should continuously stream whole data to server for processing and generate result in real time also, the overall cost should be low enough that it can be used commercially. In this paper we are focusing on creating a low-cost smart device which can be used to collect the data of water consumption. To achieve this, we have proposed to create a device with Arduino along with some sensors and modules to collect multiple data of water consumption from different apartments. After collecting this data this device will send this data to server with the help of a Wi-Fi module attached to the device. At the same time, we are using an Artificial Neural Network model for the analysis of this data for generating high accuracy results. Finally, these results will be shown on an Android App and Web App for better availability and better usability of the whole system which will allow the user to access it anywhere any time.},

abstract={Over the last few years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have expanded rapidly and tend to become the most typical form of online and distance higher education. As a result, a tremendous amount of data is generated and stored on MOOCs online learning platforms. In any case, this data should be effectively transformed into knowledge, thus providing valuable feedback to learners, and enhancing decision making practices in the educational field. Despite the benefits and learning prospects that MOOCs offer to learners, there is a considerable divergence between enrollment and completion rates. In this context, the main scope of this study is to exploit predictive analytics and explainable artificial intelligence for the early prediction of student certification in a 11-week MOOC for smart cities, namely DevOps. A plethora of Machine Learning models were built employing familiar classification algorithms. The experimental results revealed that the models based on Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression and Light Gradient Boosted Machine classifiers prevailed in terms of Accuracy, Area Under Curve, Recall, Precision, F1-score, Kappa, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient, getting a predictive accuracy of 94.41% at the end of the second week of the course. Therefore, students who are less likely to obtain a certificate could be envisaged at an early enough stage to provide sufficient support actions and targeted intervention strategies to them. Finally, the performance attributes (i.e., overall grades per week) proved to be the most important predictors for identifying students at risk of failure.},

abstract={Over the years, collaborative mobility proved to be an important but challenging component of the smart cities paradigm. One of the biggest challenges in the smart mobility domain is the use of data science as an enabler for the implementation of large scale transportation sharing solutions. In particular, the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) requires the combination of artificial intelligence and discrete simulations when exploring the effects of what-if decisions in complex scenarios with millions of users. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting an innovative data modelling framework that can be used for ITS related problems. We demonstrate that the use of graphs and time series in multi-dimensional data models can satisfy the requirements of descriptive and predictive analytics in real-world case studies with massive amounts of continuously changing data. The features of the framework are explained in a case study of a complex collaborative mobility system that combines carpooling, carsharing and shared parking. The performance of the framework is tested with a large-scale dataset, performing machine learning tasks and interactive realtime data visualization. The outcome is a fast, efficient and complete architecture that can be easily deployed, tested and used for research as well in an industrial environment.},

abstract={Currently available interactive technologies and infrastructure such as open source hardware, increased processing power, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Natural Language processing (NLP) and connectivity through the internet, have led to a new definition of human living. Smart homes, smart streets, smart cities and eventually a smarter planet, is what humans are progressing towards. The boon in things being smart is that it involves automation and interactive technologies, something that we as humans prefer over introvert and monotonous characteristic of machines. However, most present systems have a physical entity like a remote or a personal device assistant (PDA) which is used to control our homes. When the access to these physical devices is lost, you can no longer control them. This paper addresses this very issue and proposes a solution which eliminates the need for any physical device. It proposes a multi- functional `Smart Home Automation System' (SHAS) controlled using an interactive and humanoid central processing unit which is powered by features of AI and NLP. Voice-commands to control the devices of the house such as fans, lights, doors, etc. can be given by the residents. The system is also intelligent enough to search things which it doesn't quite understand using the internet. The system has a camera integrated for continuously monitoring the home and also uses image processing techniques to identify the people trying to access the house. The system also has an automated mailing system which e-mails photos captured by the camera based on valid/invalid users. The system is aimed at being easy, cost-effective and non-physical.},

abstract={With rapid advancements in renewable energy sources, billing mechanism (AMI), and latest communication technologies, the traditional control networks are evolving towards wise, versatile and collaborative Smart Grids (SG). The short term power load forecasting of individual as well as group of similar energy customers is critical for effective operation and management of SG. Forecasting power load of individual as well as group of similar energy customers is challenging compared to aggregate load forecasting of a residential community. The main reason is the high volatility and uncertainty involved for the case of individual and group of similar energy customers. Several machine/deep learning models have been developed in the recent past for forecasting load of individual energy customers, but such explorations are ineffective due to the requirement of one trained model for every energy customer, which is practically not feasible. We plan to build a deep learning model using convolutional neural network (CNN) layers in pyramidal architecture for effective load forecasting for a group of similar energy-profile customers. Initially, we grouped a subset of energy customers from database of Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) into clusters using DBSCAN approach. The CNN layers are used for extracting feature from historical load of each cluster. The extracted feature of similar energy-profile customers (grouped based on clustering) is combined to make training-databases for each cluster. We have used the power load data from SGSC project, which contain thousands of individual household energy customers data. The developed Pyramid-CNN model is trained based on these sets of databases. The trained model is evaluated on randomly selected customers from few clusters. We obtained significantly improved forecasting results for randomly selected user from different clusters. Our adapted strategy of clustering based model training resulted in upto 10 percent MAPE improvement for the energy customers. The essence of our work is that energy customers can be grouped into clusters and then representative model could be developed/trained, which can accurately forecast power load for individual energy-customer. This approach is highly feasible, as we do not need to train a model per energy customer and still achieve competitive forecasting results.},

abstract={The application of High-Definition map can realize centimeter-level position in urban scenes, the development of deep learning has made great breakthrough in the point cloud dynamic obstacle recognition. All these technologies make obstacle detection and tracking based on High-Definition map effectively realize in the modern smart city scene. It is different from the previous obstacle detection and tracking methods based purely on vision the using of High-Definition map can provide high-precision positioning and reduce the difficulty of point cloud classification. The using of lidar also solves the problem of up-to-scale in dynamic detection. In this paper, we put forward a new Multi-camera Lidar Point Cloud Map, we complete the map at normal speed on the highway and get a satisfactory result. At the same time, we also find a robust combination of traditional kalman filter, Hungary algorithm and current deep learning to solve dynamic obstacle tracking and detection. The experimental results show that our system can effectively complete the special problem of generating map and target tracking on urban scene.},

abstract={Nowadays, video surveillance cameras are widely used in many smart city applications for ensuring road safety. We can use video data from them to solve such tasks as traffic management, driving control, environmental monitoring, etc. Most of these applications are based on object recognition and tracking algorithms. However, the video image quality is not always meet the requirements of such algorithms due to the influence of different external factors. A variety of adverse weather conditions produce noise on the images, which often makes it difficult to detect objects correctly. Lately, deep learning methods show good results in image processing, including denoising tasks. This work is devoted to the study of using these methods for image quality enhancement in difficult weather conditions such as snow, rain, fog. Different deep learning techniques were evaluated in terms of their impact on the quality of object detection/recognition. Finally, the system for automatic image denoising was developed.},

abstract={Incorporation of the digital technologies in the surveillance of urban mobility such as monitoring the traffic density will help in improving the quantity of vehicles/arrangements to be provided for the public commutation, facility to be incorporated in reducing the traffic, infrastructure to be provided such as road widening, pedestrian path, over bridge, under pass etc., where traffic and transport is an issue. This can be implemented in the city, at which it is recognized to be developed as a smart city. The proposed research work analyzes the vehicle density using python-OpenCV and YOLOv3. Real time videos are recorded in four directions from Sony HD IP cameras in a designated area. Image frames from video sequence are used to detect moving vehicles. The background extraction method is applied for each frame which is used in subsequent analysis to detect and count all the vehicles. The blobs are detected for each vehicle which helps to track the vehicle in motion. The center of each vehicle with blob gives the count of vehicle based on the lanes considered. This work not only counts the vehicle in real time but also classifies the different vehicles using deep learning technique. YoloV3(You only look once) object detection system is used along with a pretrained model called darknet to classify the vehicle into different categories (bus, car, motorcycle etc). This deep learning method showed better classification and detection rate compared to blobs and morphological method used for counting the vehicles. Classification is shown for vehicle and also person classification is considered to analyze the percentage of people and vehicles. The analysis of percentage of vehicles is shown using pie chart.},
