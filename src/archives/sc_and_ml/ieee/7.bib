abstract={Crime situation forecasting has always been a challenging task for smart city security decision support system construction. Accurate crime dynamic capture can optimize the allocation efficiency of police resources to respond to various crime situations. Existing crime forecasting approaches mainly utilize some stochastic process modeling methods, some statistical learning models or some pixel-level deep learning models to capture spatio-temporal dynamic. Compared with traditional models, Graph Neural Network (GNN) obviously can better capture the spatial structural features other than Euclidean distance. In this paper, we address the crime situation forecast task with Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (T-GCN) approach, a graph deep learning approach for spatio-temporal dynamics capturing. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are combined in T-GCN model to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics respectively. In experimental studies, we evaluate T-GCN model on crime statistics dataset of San Francisco City and demonstrate effectiveness of T-GCN compared with some traditional state-of-art baseline models.},

abstract={The development of smart cities and deep learning technology is changing our physical world to a cyber world. As one of the main applications, the Internet of Vehicles has been developing rapidly. However, privacy leakage and delay problem for data collection remain as the key concerns behind the fast development of the cyber intelligence technologies. If the original data collected are directly uploaded to the cloud for processing, it will bring huge load pressure and delay to the network communication. Moreover, during this process, it will lead to the leakage of data privacy. To this end, in this article we design a data collection and preprocessing scheme based on deep learning, which adopts the semisupervised learning algorithm of data augmentation and label guessing. Data filtering is performed at the edge layer, and a large amount of similar data and irrelevant data are cleared. If the edge device cannot process some complex data independently, it will send the processed and reliable data to the cloud for further processing, which maximizes the protection of user privacy. Our method significantly reduces the amount of data uploaded to the cloud, and meanwhile protects the user's data privacy effectively.},

abstract={The advent of autonomous transportation systems is attracting attention in AI today. Despite how far this area has progressed, there are situations better handled by humans. One of these is distinguishing objects seen for the first time and making decisions accordingly. Hence, our focus in this paper is on object detection, which can potentially enhance autonomous driving and other types of automation in transportation systems. This impacts Smart Mobility in Smart Cities. We provide expanded analysis of recent object detection techniques including neural models, deep learning and related advances. We highlight a novel object detection system called YOLO (You Only Look Once) and conduct its performance evaluation on real-time data. We point out challenges in this field and then explore the use of Commonsense Knowledge (CSK) in object detection with neural models and deep learning, emphasizing the importance of CSK to capture intuitive human reasoning. We explain how this work would potentially enhance autonomous vehicles and transportation systems. This work thus constitutes an exploratory paper that embodies a vision in Smart Mobility.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most rapidly evolving technologies nowadays. It has its impact in various industrial sectors including logistics tracking, medical fields, automobiles and smart cities. With its immense potentiality, IoT comes with crucial security concerns that need to be addressed. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning technique for detecting attacks within the IoT network using Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (BLSTM RNN). A multi-layer Deep Learning Neural Network is trained using a novel benchmark data set: UNSWNB15. This paper focuses on the binary classification of normal and attack patterns on the IoT network. The experimental outcomes show the efficiency of our proposed model with regard to precision, recall, f-1 score and FAR. Our proposed BLSTM model achieves over 95% accuracy in attack detection.

abstract={Urban data is a imperative resource for urban computing, which can promote the establishment of urban knowledge, the collection of urban information and the construction of smart cities. Seen that the urban data collected through hardware sensors and crowdsourcing has the limitations of uneven information distribution, poor data comprehensiveness and high resource costs, we turn to the Internet resources of real-time updates and extensive information coverage. Therefore, we propose an approach to Sensing Urban text Data from Internet Resources (SUDIR). We put forward innovative work on two key issues: urban data recognition for Chinese context and urban data sensing for multi-source web resources. On one hand, we design a Chinese urban data recognition model based on Whole Word Masking for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT-WWM) embedding model and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory with a Conditional Random Field (BLSTM-CRF) sequence labeling model. We introduce Chinese Word Segmentaion (CWS) concept in BERT embedding model to make the text embedding effect better represent semantic information on Chinese context. BLSTM-CRF model based on deep learning is used to achieve high-quality coding and prediction. On the other hand, we propose a method of Extracting Urban text data based on Web page features and Clustering operation (EUWC). EUWC is used to correct the false negative samples labeled by BERT-WWM+BLSTM-CRF recognition model and enable SUDIR to sense more accurate and comprehensive city data from multi-source web resources. The experimental results show that our work outperforms the other baseline methods, and it also proves that SUDIR using Internet resources and deep learning technology has the advantages of low-cost, high-quality urban data sensing.},

abstract={It is estimated that over 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness at some point each year. With the emergence of smart cities, it would be beneficial to leverage the processing power of deep learning to assist in the planning and testing of different policies to address this issue. When examining a population of homeless individuals, one can view them as being distributed, at any one point in time, among several possible states: for example, the street or an emergency shelter. Our work aims to provide a means of simulating across these states, including no longer homeless, over time. The probability that an individual will transition from one state to another is called a transition probability. Thus, by creating a matrix of transition probabilities between all of the states, we have a transition probability matrix. If we simply approached this problem by using a mathematical model such as a Markov decision process, we run into the issue of how to accurately adjust the probabilities to produce realistic results. Ideally, we would have a model that can reasonably modify them based on real-life data. To do this, we introduce two modified deep learning algorithms; modified deep q-learning (MDQL) and modified neural fitted q-iteration (MNFQ). These algorithms dynamically produce a set of transition probability matrices for each week of the year. We discuss the modifications we made to these algorithms to adapt to the homelessness problem and create our simulation. After training our model on high resolution, weekly data, we will show that when running it on a low resolution data set that spans 3 years, our model is able to achieve a relative percent difference from the final population of 12.5%. The end result is a model that can be further improved over time with real world data to provide realistic results.},

abstract={The Internet of things is widely used to provide a lot of useful services such as human health care, security systems and green energy monitoring. It contributes to the sustainable development of smart cities in order to manage and integrate renewable energies. The swift growth of Home Solar Power Systems (HSPS) has enabled a large-scale collection of time series data. As advanced tools, smart meters can ensure the timely reading of HSPS data, automating metering and producing fine-grained data. However, to ensure the dynamic data management and a better understanding of HSPS operations, it is crucial to analyze and forecast these digital records for decision-making and smart control. Up to now, deep learning algorithms have only been applied sparsely in the field of renewable energy power forecasting. In this paper, we apply an auto-configurable middleware based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model for several forecasting time dimensions to choose the significant timescale for learning setting. The results show that our deep-learning model has good performances compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for the whole proposed learning timescale. However, the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) seems better than our proposed auto-LSTM algorithm, but it takes much execution time for 15 min and 30 min-ahead forecasting. Thus, the day-ahead forecasting is the most efficient timescale in our case.},

abstract={Multi-sensor based human activity recognition is one of the challenges in the ambient intelligent environments such as smart home and smart city. Ordinary people in their daily lives usually share a similar and repetitive life pattern, also known as life cycle. Smart home environment and its multi sensors can provide assistance to human by collecting the data sequence of human activities to predict the desired actions. Our goal is to analyze the sequence of activities recorded by a specific resident using deep learning with multiple sensor data. In this paper, we train the multiple sensor data collected by a smart home using several deep neural networks. According to the characteristics of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) structure, multiple sensor data of smart home is suitable for RNN because it has a sequence data in time. To support our assumption, we proposed the Residual-RNN architecture to predict future activities of a resident. Furthermore, we also utilized attention module to filter out the meaningless data to have more effective results than the one without. To verify our proposed idea, we used real resident activity in smart home using Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) dataset. After our experiments, our proposed model with attention mechanism outperform the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model in terms of predicting the desired activities of a smart home resident.},

abstract={The aim of this research is to improve municipal trash collection using image processing algorithms and deep learning technologies for detecting trash in public spaces. This research will help to improve trash management systems and help to create a smart city. Two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), both based on the AlexNet network architecture, were developed to search for trash objects in an image and separate recyclable items from the landfill trash objects, respectively. The two-stage CNN system was first trained and tested on the benchmark TrashNet indoor image dataset and achieved great performance to prove the concept. Then the system was trained and tested on outdoor images taken by the authors in the intended usage environment. Using the outdoor image dataset, the first CNN achieved a preliminary 93.6% accuracy to identify trash and non-trash items on an image database of assorted trash items. A second CNN was then trained to distinguish trash that will go to a landfill from the recyclable items with an accuracy ranging from 89.7% to 93.4% and overall 92%. A future goal is to integrate this image processing based trash identification system in a smart trash can robot with a camera to take real-time photos that can detect and collect the trash all around it.},

abstract={Smart City deployments typically have thousands to even hundreds of thousands of Surveillance cameras. Rapid advancements in computer vision techniques due to Deep Neural Networks enable using these camera feeds for performing non-trivial analytics. Tracking a moving object of interest using a large network of cameras, also known as object reidentification, is one such analytic that empowers city administration with capabilities such as finding missing people or prioritizing emergency vehicles.

Anveshak fills in the shortcomings of existing Big Data and Deep Learning frameworks by - exposing an intuitive and composable programming model; automating application deployment and orchestration across edge, fog and cloud resources and providing knobs to the user for managing the application performance. The knobs lend the application the ability to scale potentially to thousands of cameras. In this proposal we have designed two representative applications; missing person tracking and priority signalling for emergency vehicles. We empirically verify that the application scales to 1000 cameras on a Cloud-only deployment of 10 Azure VMs with 8 cores and 32GB RAM each. Alternatively, it scales to 500 cameras on a simulated setup of 100 edge, 30 fog, and 1 Cloud VM.

abstract={Predicting vehicle flows is of great importance to traffic management and public safety in smart cities, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, such as spatio-temporal dependencies with external factors (e.g., holidays, events and weather). Recently, deep learning has shown remarkable performance on traditional challenging tasks, such as image classification, due to its powerful feature learning capabilities. Some works have utilized LSTMs to connect the high-level layers of 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the spatio-temporal features, and have shown better performance as compared to many classical methods in traffic prediction. However, these works only build temporal connections on the high-level features at the top layer while leaving the spatio-temporal correlations in the low-level layers not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose to apply 3D CNNs to learn the spatio-temporal correlation features jointly from low-level to high-level layers for traffic data. We also design an end-to-end structure, named as MST3D, especially for vehicle flow prediction. MST3D can learn spatial and multiple temporal dependencies jointly by multiple 3D CNNs, combine the learned features with external factors and assign different weights to different branches dynamically. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework that utilizes 3D CNNs for traffic prediction. Experiments on two vehicle flow datasets Beijing and New York City have demonstrated that the proposed framework, MST3D, outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

In pedestrian detection, faces and backs of heads are separately detected to understand moving directions of pedestrians as well as their existence by applying CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory). Then, the trajectories of the detected bounding boxes are estimated based on location and color similarities with the knowledge about moving speeds of vehicles and pedestrians. Through the evaluation using real dashcam videos, we have confirmed that our method works well, showing within ±13.6% mean absolute error rate of bi-directional people low estimation.},

pages={12348-12361},
abstract={Most studies about the solar forecasting topic do not analyze and exploit the temporal and spatial components that are inherent to such a task. Furthermore, they mostly focus just on precision and not on other meaningful features, such as flexibility and robustness. With the current energy production trends, where many solar panels are distributed across city rooftops, there is a need to manage all this information simultaneously and to be able to add and remove sensors as needed. Likewise, robust models need to be able to cope with (inevitable) sensor failure and continue producing reliable predictions. Due to all of this, solar forecasting models need to be as decoupled as possible from the number of data sources that feed them and their geographical distribution, enabling also the reusability of the models. This article contributes with a family of Deep Learning models for solar irradiance forecasting complying with the aforementioned features, i.e. flexibility and robustness. In the first stage, several Artificial Neural Networks are trained as a basis for predicting solar irradiance on several locations at the same time. Thereupon, a family of models that work with irradiance maps thanks to Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory layers is presented, obtaining forecast skills between 7.4% and 41% (depending on the location and horizon) compared to the baseline. The latter family comes with flexibility and robustness features, which are required in large-scale Intelligent Environments, such as Smart Cities. Working with irradiance maps means that new sensors can be added (or removed) as needed, without requiring rebuilding the model. Experiments carried out show that sensor failures have a mild impact on the prediction error for several forecast horizons.},

abstract={The purpose is to explore the spatial-temporal dynamic prediction performance of urban road network traffic flow based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) of deep learning. A dynamic prediction model of road network traffic flow based on STGCN-BiLSTM (spatial-temporal graph convolution network Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory) is designed in view of the complex and highly nonlinear traffic data in the actual environment. Finally, the simulation experiment is conducted on the constructed model to verify its performance which is compared with that of the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, CNN model, RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model, AlexNet model and STGCN model. The results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error of the proposed algorithm model are 4.60%, 5.46% and 7.73%, respectively. The training time is stable at about 45s, the test time is stable at about 33s, and the delay is close to $1.86\times 10 ^{-4}\text{s}$ . Additionally, the traffic flow of the test section in the next 15 min, 30 min, 1 h and 2 h is further predicted. Compared with other algorithms, the predicted value of the proposed algorithm is the closest to the actual value, along with the best prediction effect. Therefore, the constructed dynamic prediction model of road network traffic flow can achieve high accuracy and better robustness under the premise of low error, which can provide experimental basis for the spatial-temporal dynamic digital development of transportation in smart cities.},

abstract={Smart cities are cyber-physical-social systems, where city data from different sources could be collected, processed and analyzed to extract useful knowledge. As the volume of data from the social world is exploding, social media data analysis has become an emerging area in many different disciplines. During crisis events, users may post informative tweets about affected individuals, utility damage or cautions on social media platforms. If such tweets are efficiently and effectively processed and analyzed, city organizations may gain a better situational awareness of the affected citizens and provide better response actions. Advances in deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance in many social media analyzing tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, fake news detection, crisis data classification, etc. However, deep learning models require a large amount of labeled data for model training, which is impractical to collect, especially at the early stage of a crisis event. To address this limitation, we proposed a BERT-based Adversarial Domain Adaptation model (BERT-ADA) for crisis tweet classification. Our experiments with three real-world crisis datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model over several baselines.},

abstract={With the emergence of smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as deep learning technologies have witnessed an increasing adoption. To support the requirements of such paradigm in terms of memory and computation, joint and real-time deep co-inference framework with IoT synergy was introduced. However, the distribution of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) has drawn attention to the privacy protection of sensitive data. In this context, various threats have been presented, including black-box attacks, where a malicious participant can accurately recover an arbitrary input fed into his device. In this paper, we introduce a methodology aiming to secure the sensitive data through re-thinking the distribution strategy, without adding any computation overhead. First, we examine the characteristics of the model structure that make it susceptible to privacy threats. We found that the more we divide the model feature maps into a high number of devices, the better we hide proprieties of the original image. We formulate such a methodology, namely DistPrivacy, as an optimization problem, where we establish a trade-off between the latency of co-inference, the privacy level of the data, and the limited-resources of IoT participants. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we introduce an online heuristic that supports heterogeneous IoT devices as well as multiple DNNs and datasets, making the pervasive system a general-purpose platform for privacy-aware and low decision-latency applications.},

abstract={Smart grid is an advanced concept of power systems which harmonizes electricity and communication in systems networks. It provides information for the producers, operators, and the consumers in real time. There is an extreme demand to efficiently conduct the power supplied to the consumption domains such as households, organizations, industries, and smart cities. In this respect, a smart grid with a stable system is being required to supply the dynamic power requirements. Predicting smart grid stability is still challenging due to the many factors which affect the stability of grid, one of these factors is customer and producer participation because identifying the participation can lead to the stability of smart grid. In this work, we propose a deep learning model based on Densely Connected Convolutional Network and Residual network structure to detect the stability of smart grids. The results of the proposed model are compared to other popular classifier models used in different studies. Those models are Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Multilayer neural network, Gated Recurrent Units, Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory and the proposed model outperforms the other models.},

abstract={With the rapid development of mobile cellular technologies and the increasing popularity of mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, timely mobile traffic forecasting with high accuracy becomes more and more critical for proactive network service provisioning and efficient network resource allocation in smart cities. Traditional traffic forecasting methods mostly rely on time series prediction techniques, which fail to capture the complicated dynamic nature and spatial relations of mobile traffic demand. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, graph attention spatial-temporal network (GASTN), for accurate citywide mobile traffic forecasting, which can capture not only local geographical dependency but also distant inter-region relationship when considering spatial factor. Specifically, GASTN considers spatial correlation through our constructed spatial relation graph and utilizes structural recurrent neural networks to model the global near-far spatial relationships as well as the temporal dependencies. In the framework of GASTN, two attention mechanisms are designed to integrate different effects in a holistic way. Besides, in order to further enhance the prediction performance, we propose a collaborative global-local learning strategy for the training of GASTN, which takes full advantage of the knowledge from both the global model and local models for individual regions and enhance the effectiveness of our model. Extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world mobile traffic dataset demonstrate that our GASTN model dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. And it reveals that a significant enhancement in the prediction performance of GASTN can be obtained by leveraging the collaborative global-local learning strategy.},

abstract={Monitoring traffic congestion in smart cities is a challenging problem of great importance in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Most previous works focused on developing machine learning models that can predict traffic congestion on a meshcode (i.e., a portion of an earth's surface) at a particular time instance. The key limitation of these studies is that they fail to provide holistic information regarding the sets of meshcodes in which regular congestion may happen in the forecasted data. This paper proposes a novel framework to address this problem. The proposed framework employs a 3DCNN multi-source deep learning model (hereafter, called Fusion-3DCNN) to predict traffic congestion on a particular meshcode at a particular time instance. The predicted traffic congestion data is later transformed into a temporal database and feed to the periodic-frequent pattern mining algorithm to identify the sets of meshcode in which regular congestions may happen in the predicted data. Experimental results on real-world traffic congestion data demonstrate that the proposed framework is efficient.},

abstract={Smart health is one of the most popular and important components of smart cities. It is a relatively new context-aware healthcare paradigm influenced by several fields of expertise, such as medical informatics, communications and electronics, bioengineering, ethics, to name a few. Smart health is used to improve healthcare by providing many services such as patient monitoring, early diagnosis of disease and so on. The artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning models, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN), are the most commonly used machine learning approaches where they proved to be performance in most cases. Voice disorders are rapidly spreading especially with the development of medical diagnostic systems, although they are often underestimated. Smart health systems can be an easy and fast support to voice pathology detection. The identification of an algorithm that discriminates between pathological and healthy voices with more accuracy is needed to obtain a smart and precise mobile health system. The main contribution of this paper consists of proposing a multiclass-pathologic voice classification using a novel multileveled textural feature extraction with iterative feature selector. Our approach is a simple and efficient voice-based algorithm in which a multi-center and multi threshold based ternary pattern is used (MCMTTP). A more compact multileveled features are then obtained by sample-based discretization techniques and Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) is applied to select features iteratively. These features are finally integrated with MCMTTP to achieve an accurate voice-based features detection. Experimental results of six classifiers with three diagnostic diseases (frontal resection, cordectomy and spastic dysphonia) show that the fused features are more suitable for describing voice-based disease detection.},

This study is launched as part of a project which aims to design an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) dedicated to highway supervisors to regulate traffic. This system needs to be supplied by continuous, real-time forecasting of short-term traffic congestions in order to make decisions accordingly.

abstract={In recent years, the emergence of blockchain technology (BT) has become a unique, most disruptive, and trending technology. The decentralized database in BT emphasizes data security and privacy. Also, the consensus mechanism in it makes sure that data is secured and legitimate. Still, it raises new security issues such as majority attack and double-spending. To handle the aforementioned issues, data analytics is required on blockchain based secure data. Analytics on these data raises the importance of arisen technology Machine Learning (ML). ML involves the rational amount of data to make precise decisions. Data reliability and its sharing are very crucial in ML to improve the accuracy of results. The combination of these two technologies (ML and BT) can provide highly precise results. In this paper, we present a detailed study on ML adoption for making BT-based smart applications more resilient against attacks. There are various traditional ML techniques, for instance, Support Vector Machines (SVM), clustering, bagging, and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) can be used to analyse the attacks on a blockchain-based network. Further, we include how both the technologies can be applied in several smart applications such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Smart Grid (SG), healthcare, and smart cities. Then, future research issues and challenges are explored. At last, a case study is presented with a conclusion.},

abstract={Forecasting taxi demand is of great significance to the intelligent transportation systems in a smart city. Traditional demand prediction methods mostly considered about inter-regional traffic, events, activities, and weather, while they overlooked the influence of other travel modes, such as metro. In this paper, we propose a Deep Taxi-Metro Spatial-Temporal Network framework, namely TMST-Net, to model the spatiotemporal relationships between the taxi demand and the metro crowd flows. In detail, we apply residual neural networks to model temporal (current, day, and week) properties of the taxi demand in each area. For each feature, we apply residual convolutional units to handle the spatial properties of taxi demand. Likewise, we apply the same method to model the metro crowd flows. TMST-Net learns to assign different weights between taxi and metro by aggregating the output of the three residual neural networks and the external factors to forecast the final taxi demand for each area in the next timestamp. Experimental results on real taxi trajectory and the automatic fare collection (AFC) data in Shanghai show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

LOF aims to forecast the imminent faults of an appliance in the IoT system, whose predictive performance greatly depends on the selection of its hyperparameters. The major challenge of hyperparameter tuning for unsupervised machine learning models including LOF in the context of IoT systems is that the incoming data may contain new types of anomaly that are unseen in the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel, heuristic methodology to tune the hyperparameters in LOF that accounts for this challenge. A tuned LOF model that uses the proposed method shows good predictive performance in both simulations and real data applications.},

abstract={Driven by the demand of artificial intelligent, high-performance computing, electric vehicle and smart city, semiconductor industry is building high performance and high integrated systems. To increase the energy efficiency of these complicated systems, particularly in power modules, reducing the power consumption is needed. Thinning the die is one of the solutions, which can provide a lot of advantages including faster heat dissipation, low junction temperature, low electrical resistance, etc. However, due to its sensitivity of stress, processing of thin die is a challenging, including die pick-up process. In this paper, we proposed a methodology using machine learning and finite element method (FEM) to optimize the pin designs with the objective to minimize the stress in the die during pick-up process. A dynamic numerical model was first built up to simulate the stress distribution in the die during pick-up process, and a Gaussian process regression was applied to generate the relationships between pin parameters and die stress. Meanwhile, a Bayesian optimization was used to optimize the parameters. The optimized pin designs using the above methodology was further validated by FEM. Compared with traditional DOE method, the proposed methodology using machine learning and FEM exhibits much higher effectiveness in parameter optimization with less testing cost and efforts.},

abstract={The distribution network operators (DNO) are the companies which bring electricity from the national transmission network to local homes and businesses. The essential primary duty of any DNO is to provide uninterrupted electricity supply to their customers. So, having a deep understanding of network faults has always been principal importance for reliable and sustainable power supply. The purpose of this study is to discover the relationship between population density and low voltage (LV) faults causes in an electricity distribution network using machine learning classification models. The study aims to use different classification models and comparing the results. The results of this study should outline the ideal classification model to use in understanding the relationship between population density and LV faults causes. In this study, the correlation method has been used for feature selection to select the most suitable variables to build the classification models. It should also give more insight into how the data should be prepared before being input into a machine learning classification models. Correlation analysis has revealed the multifaceted relationships that exist among the variables in multivariate fault data. From this study results and analysis, the shows that there is a new relationship between local population density and fault causes which suggest fault causes has a strong relationship with population density. These findings may help DNOs in policy-making and network design. Also, this research may assist Smart City planning projects.},

The forecast of traffic flow is indispensable for an efficient intelligent transportation system. The traffic flow forecast is a difficult task, due to its stochastic and non linear nature. Besides classical statistical methods, neural networks are a promising possibility to predict future traffic flow. In our work, this prediction is performed with various recurrent neural networks. These are trained on measurements of induction loops, which are placed in intersections of the city Hagen. We utilized data from beginning of January to the end of July in 2018. Each model incorporates sequences of the measured traffic flow from all sensors and predicts the future traffic flow for each sensor simultaneously. A variety of model architectures, forecast horizons and input data were investigated. Most often the vector output model with gated recurrent units achieved the smallest error on the test set over all considered prediction scenarios. Due to the small amount of data, generalization of the trained models is limited.},

However, due to sensor drifts or faults, carbon dioxide (CO2) does not present correlation to reference instrument. As a result, the LCS for CO2 is not feasible to be calibrated. Hence, to estimate the CO2 concentration,mathematical models are developed to be integrated in the calibrated LCS, known as a virtual sensor. In addition, another virtual sensor is developed to demonstrate the capability of estimating air pollutant concentrations, e.g. black carbon, when the physical sensor devices are not available. In our paper, calibration models and virtual sensors are established using corresponding reference instruments that are installed on two reference stations. This strategy generalizes the models of calibration and virtual sensing which then allows LCS to be deployed in field independently with a high accuracy. Our proposed methodology enables scaling-up accurate air pollution mapping appropriate for smart cities.},

abstract={The emergence of low latency and high bandwidth 5G networks, alongside localized computation and data storage of edge computing are enabling real-time applications in industrial settings, such as smart grid, smart cities, and smart factories. The resolution, frequency and variety of data streams generated by such applications are not effectively processed and analysed by contemporary machine learning algorithms. This challenge is further complicated by the unlabelled and non-deterministic nature of the data streams. Hardware accelerated machine learning has been proposed to address some of these challenges but limited work has been published on unsupervised learning from unlabelled data. In this paper, we extend the hardware accelerated Self Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm by optimizing the learning rule for computational efficiency, followed by a comparative empirical evaluation with two other variants, tri-state SOM and integer SOM. We have used two datasets representative of real-time industrial applications in 5G networks and smart grids, for this evaluation.},

abstract={With the IoT industry undergoing a boom, Location Based Services (LBSs) are playing an essential role in constructing smart cities. Since LBSs are in the process of being ubiquitous, it is essential to find a low-cost and low energy solution for localization. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for indoor localization is a smart choice for giving economical solutions to the industry with additional advantages like trouble-free connection to other gadgets. We propose an improved RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) based fingerprinting technique in which data is first augmented and then classified using Machine Learning algorithms. This indoor localization technique facilitates us to recognize the XY-position of the user node (UN) or tag, which receives signals from the anchor nodes (ANs). The fluctuations in the RSSI values were large, because they were affected by multipath propagation and other factors in the indoor positioning environment. The fingerprinting data was augmented to overcome these drawbacks, to decrease the computational cost, to guarantee the precision of the framework by increasing the accuracy and also to be equipped for Machine Learning calculation. The augmentation strategy was actualized by utilizing accessible RSSI esteems at one location, wherein Random Forest gave the highest test accuracy of 96% surpassing all existing methods.},

abstract={The accuracy of location information, mainly provided by the global positioning system (GPS) sensor, is critical for Internet-of-Things applications in smart cities. However, built environments attenuate GPS signals by reflecting or blocking them resulting in some cases multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception. These effects cause range errors that degrade GPS positioning accuracy. Enhancements in the design of antennae and receivers deliver a level of reduction of multipath. However, NLOS signal reception and residual effects of multipath are still to be mitigated sufficiently for improvements in range errors and positioning accuracy. Recent machine learning-based methods have shown promise in improving pseudorange-based position solutions by considering multiple variables from raw GPS measurements. However, positioning accuracy is limited by low accuracy signal reception classification. Unlike the existing methods, which use machine learning to directly predict the signal reception classification, we use a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based method to predict the pseudorange errors by considering the signal strength, satellite elevation angle and pseudorange residuals. With the predicted pseudorange errors, two variations of the algorithm are proposed to improve positioning accuracy. The first corrects pseudorange errors and the other either corrects or excludes the signals determined to contain the effects of multipath and NLOS signals. The results for a challenging urban environment characterized by high-rise buildings on one side, show that the 3-D positioning accuracy of the pseudorange error correction-based positioning measured in terms of the root mean square error is 23.3 m, an improvement of more than 70% over the conventional methods.},

abstract={Network security is one of the most important challenges in Smart cities networks. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a cyberattack that attempts to distribute the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network sending flood of Internet traffic. In this paper, Machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest are trained and tested to classify the DDoS attacked packets. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps to improve the performance of the algorithms. So, in this paper, the efficiency of the PCA is compared with the without PCA results. Initially, the dataset is passed to PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for feature selection and then implemented in different Machine Learning algorithms. The results of all the algorithms are evaluated using the parameters accuracy, precision, F1 score, and Recall. Again, the same dataset is tested and trained in all same ML algorithms using without PCA dataset. Then the results of PCA and without PCA are compared. This experimental analysis shows that by using PCA, the execution time of the algorithm reduces significantly with a smaller number of features and yields same result as that of without PCA. More over the Decision tree and Random Forest algorithms classifies the DDoS packets very accurately compared to SVM. The results are presented as graph using Matplotlib. The dataset taken for our experimental analysis is IoT-23 dataset.},

Trained models were tested in an online manner, where the models were used to detect drift fault in the sensor output in real-time.

abstract={In Internet of things (IoT) millions of devices are intelligently connected for providing smart services. Especially in indoor localization environment, that is one of the most concerning topic of smart cities, internet of things and wireless sensor networks. Many technologies are being used for localization purpose in indoor environment and Wi-Fi using received signal strengths (RSSs) is one of them. Wi-Fi RSSs are sensitive to reflection, refraction, interference and channel noise that cause irregularity in signal strengths. The irregular and anomalous RSS values, used in a Wi-Fi indoor localization environment, cannot define the location of any unknown node correctly. Therefore, this research has developed an outlier detection technique named as iF_Ensemble for Wi-Fi indoor localization environment by analyzing RSSs using the combination of supervised, unsupervised and ensemble machine learning methods. In this research isolation forest (iForest) is used as an unsupervised learning method. Supervised learning method includes support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF) classifiers with stacking that is an ensemble learning method. For the evaluation purpose accuracy, precision, recall, F-score and ROC-AUC curve are used. The evaluation of used machine learning method provides high accuracy of 97.8 percent with proposed outlier detection methods and almost 2 percent improvement in the accuracy of localization process in indoor environment after eliminating outliers.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly present in our daily activities, connecting the most varied types of physical devices present around us to the internet. IoT is the basis for smart cities, e-health, precision agriculture, among others. With this growth, the number of cyber-attacks against these types of devices and services has also increased. Each type of attack has its specific characteristics that allow its identification and prevention through machine learning techniques. However, classic machine learning techniques may have their performance compromised due to the non-stationary characteristics of these environments, together with the search for different types of vulnerabilities by attackers, attacks can suffer different types of mutations, in addition to the great possibility of new types of attacks arising over time. In this article, we propose an algorithm called Fuzzy Intrusion Detection System for IoT Networks (FROST) to identify cyber-attacks on IoT networks. FROST uses the concepts of fuzzy set theory to make the learning task more flexible, seeking to improve the performance in the classification of inaccurate data. In addition, FROST has a mechanism for identifying new types of intrusion online, during the classification of new instances. To evaluate our approach, we used the UNSW-NB15 data set and compared our method with another approach, very consolidated in the literature, which performs the same type of task. The results showed that FROST has a good performance in the classification of different types of attacks and that the fuzzy technique used helped to reduce errors and identify anomalies.},

abstract={Smart cities integrate data collection and communication technologies to operate more efficiently in order to provide better services to citizens, improved road traffic situation, better economic development, etc. However, safety still a main concern of road traffic as road crashes pose serious threats to road users causing death and injury all over the world. Road traffic safety is the process of implementing measures to reduce the number of crashes, death and severe injuries. In this paper, using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Off-line, we train and test the Intelligent and Dynamic Adaptation Model (IDAM) on the road traffic data collected for 14 years of car crashes in United Kingdom (UK). IDAM then on-line determines the optimal speed limit for each road segment based on many predictors such as weather, road type, light condition, and many others, stated later. We train and test IDAM using three different machine learning algorithms: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), and Linear Regression (LR) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Using the testing dataset, IDAM achieves prediction accuracy of around 96%. Implemented in an operation algorithm, IDAM can continuously adapt the road speed limit to an optimal value as the predictors change on-line.},

abstract={The autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - self-governing in the aerospace discipline has been a remarkable research area with the development of the advanced bespoke microcontrollers embedded with advanced AI techniques for the last several decades. The road forward about the operational environment is certain about the swarms of fully automated UAVs (FAUAVs), that is, urban areas. FAUAVs with self-learning and self-decision-making abilities by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy based on a set of rules, control loops and constraints using dynamic flight plans and trajectories are taking their indispensable parts within smart cities (SCs). Therefore, their integration with the SC components using real-time data analytics is urgent. This is mainly required to establish a better swarm intelligence along with a safer and optimised harmonious smart ecosystem that enables cooperative FAUAV-SC automation systems with collaborative automated intelligence engaging in the concepts of Internet of Everything (IoE) and Automation of Everything (AoE). Planning the future of cities with swarms of FAUAVs is explored in this paper to optimise the use of FAUAVs with a diverse range of applications and a contemporary methodology is proposed using a holistic framework - FAUAVinSCF equipped with various effective and efficient techniques along with a novel FAUAV routing technique customisable to the constraints of FAUAVs and urban areas. With the methodology, the components of SC and FAUAVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded together to make this inevitable transformation a harmonious part of the inhabitants contributing to the cities' liveability and sustainability. The framework consists of a decentralized agent-based control architecture that monitors and controls the swarms of resource-constraint FAUAVs for their real-time requirements in optimising their urban uses. The outcomes of the methodology suggest that the constraints of FAUAVs can be mitigated significantly in urban areas and consequently, their efficacy can be increased in realising their diverse range of missions.},

In these IoT-based systems, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are highly used to gather information needed by smart environments. However, due to huge heterogeneous data coming from different sensing devices, IoT-enabled WSNs face different challenges, such as high communication delay, low throughput, and poor network lifetime. In this article, a deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL)-based intelligent routing scheme is proposed for IoT-enabled WSNs that significantly reduce delay and increase network lifetime. The proposed algorithm divides the whole network into different unequal clusters depending on the current data load present in the sensor node that significantly prevents immature death of the network. An extensive experiment on the proposed algorithm is performed using ns3. The experimental results are compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of the number of alive nodes, packet delivery, energy efficiency, and communication delay in the network.},

abstract={Autonomous valet parking (AVP) is one of the main features of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous parking system is essential to reduce waiting time to search for available lot then parking, particularly in the smart city. One of the drawbacks is the inevitable control errors due to the vehicle non-linear dynamics. Hence, this brings the motivation to implement reinforcement learning into autonomous valet parking vehicles. A Proximal policy optimization with asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C-PPO) is proposed for autonomous valet parking. This system is simpler and can solve problems that has continuous state-action space which includes autonomous valet parking. For the agent to yield better final rewards, manual hyperparameter tuning is conducted which are mini-batch size tuning and generalized advantage estimate (GAE) factor tuning. A3C enable parallel computing and speed up the agent training.},

abstract={As an emerging technique, mobile-edge computing (MEC) introduces a new scheme for various distributed communication-computing systems, such as industrial Internet of Things (IoT), vehicular communication, smart city, etc. In this work, we mainly focus on the timeliness of the MEC systems where the freshness of the data and computation tasks is significant. First, we formulate a kind of age-sensitive MEC models and define the average Age-of-Information (AoI) minimization problems of interests. Then, a novel mixed-policy-based multimodal deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework, called heterogeneous multiagent actor–critic (H-MAAC), is proposed as a paradigm for joint collaboration in the investigated MEC systems, where edge devices and center controller learn the interactive strategies through their own observations. To improve the system performance, we develop the corresponding online algorithm by introducing the edge federated learning mode into the multiagent cooperation whose advantages on learning convergence can be guaranteed theoretically. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first joint MEC collaboration algorithm that combines the edge federated mode with the multiagent actor–critic RL. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed approach and compare it with popular RL-based methods. As a result, the proposed algorithm not only outperforms the baselines on average system age, but also promotes the stability of training process. Besides, the simulation outcomes provide several insights for collaboration designs over MEC systems.},

abstract={Autonomous navigation systems on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple sensors are essential to various applications in the smart city and intelligent transportation. However, the general autonomous navigation models are markedly influenced by the prior knowledge from training environments, which in turn are not applicable in unknown environments. To address this issue, we propose an online autonomous UAV navigation system named as multi-sensor data-fusion-based autonomous navigation (MDFAN) system for unknown flight environments, including the collision avoidance and path planning. Specifically, first, the newly MDFAN system formulates the navigation problem as a decision-making path planning problem to reduce the dependence of prior knowledge of the flight environment. Secondly, we develop a multi-sensor data-fusion-based method to extract more effective local environment information for mining the inherent inter-relationship between the local environment information and the current state of the UAV. Thirdly, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method for handling uncertain situations of the unknown environment. Finally, we validated our method both on the simulated and real-world environments.},

abstract={Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a method of data collection by recruiting mobile devices to accomplish various sensing tasks. The mobility and intelligence of mobile devices enable an efficient solution to large-scale sensing, e.g., smart city. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as mobile devices, can be used in MCS to perform many sensing tasks (e.g., monitoring). In addition, UAVs provide new business opportunities (e.g., package delivery) with its rapid increasing number. We aim to leverage the package delivery activities of UAVs to solve the task allocation problem of MCS. In the package delivery activities, UAVs must deliver the assigned packages to their destinations. During the package delivery, UAVs travel around to perform sensing tasks with time windows. In this case, the task allocation problem of MCS is considered as a trajectory design problem of UAVs. To plan the trajectories of UAVs, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach, specifically, double deep Q-network with prioritized experience replay (DDQN-PER). Finally, the results of our numerical simulations show that our proposed solution outperforms two baseline solutions in terms of profit and number of completed tasks.},

abstract={The Energy Internet is a fundamental infrastructure for deploying green city applications, where energy saving and job acceleration are two critical issues to address. In contrast to existing approaches that focus on static metrics with the assumption of complete prior knowledge of resource information, both application-level properties and energy-level requirements are realized in this paper by jointly considering energy saving and job acceleration during job runtime. Considering the online environment of smart city applications, the main objective is transferred as an optimization problem with a model partition and function assignment. To minimize the energy cost and job completion time together, a green workload placement approach is proposed by using the multi-action deep reinforcement learning method. Evaluations with real-world applications demonstrate the superiority of this method over state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={In this paper, we introduce a behavioral and labor economics based approach to address the challenge of citizens’ health data acquisition during a pandemic, in a smart city scenario consisting of the healthcare operator, multiple businesses, and citizens with wearable devices. Initially, a reinforcement learning approach is adopted in order for the citizens to select the business to visit, exploiting both social and physical characteristics of all involved entities. Subsequently, following the principles of behavioral economics, the problem of the citizens’ incentivization by the businesses to provide their health data via offering personalized rewards is studied. The solution of the corresponding optimization problem concludes to a contract between the business and each citizen associated with this business, containing the optimal reward and optimal portion of reported data. The process is completed by introducing an optimization framework, where the healthcare operator incentivizes the businesses to provide the collected health data to it, by providing them tailored rewards. This is founded on the principles of Contract Theory, where the healthcare operator aims at maximizing its benefit from the data acquisition process, while guaranteeing that the optimal determined contracts are acceptable by the respective businesses. Finally, through modeling and simulation, the performance, effectiveness, and robustness of the overall proposed framework is demonstrated, under various realistic scenarios.},

abstract={Data collection by mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is emerging as data sources for smart city applications, however how to ensure data freshness has sparse research exposure but quite important in practice. In this paper, we consider to use a group of mobile agents (MAs) like UAVs and driverless cars which are equipped with multiple antennas to move around in the task area to collect data from deployed sensor nodes (SNs). Our goal is to minimize the age of information (AoI) of all SNs and energy consumption of MAs during movement and data upload. To this end, we propose a centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution called "DRL-freshMCS" for controlling MA trajectory planning and SN scheduling. We further utilize implicit quantile networks to maintain the accurate value estimation and steady policies for MAs. Then, we design an exploration and exploitation mechanism by dynamic distributed prioritized experience replay. We also derive the theoretical lower bound for episodic AoI. Extensive simulation results show that DRL-freshMCS significantly reduces the episodic AoI per remaining energy, compared to five baselines when varying different number of antennas and data upload thresholds, and number of SNs. We also visualize their trajectories and AoI update process for clear illustrations.},

abstract={Route planning is an important service in the map navigation. However, most of commercial map applications provide an optimal path that only minimize a single metric such as distance, time or other costs, while ignoring a critical criterion: safety. When citizens or travellers walk in a city, they may prefer to find a safe walking route to avoid the potential crime risk and to have a short distance, which can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Many previous methods are proposed to solve the multi-objective route planning, however, most of them are not efficient or optimized in a large-scale road network. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based Multi-Objective Hyper-Heuristic (MOHH) approach to route planning in a smart city. We conduct experiments on the safety index map constructed based on the historical urban data of the New York city. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach is almost 34 and 1.4 times faster than the exact multi-objective optimization algorithm and the NSGA-II algorithm respectively. Moreover, it can obtain more than 80% Pareto optimal solutions in a large-scale road network.},

abstract={Traffic congestion on urban road networks has increased substantially during the last decade, characterized by slower speeds, longer travel times, increased vehicular queuing, and increased pollution. The main pain point in traffic management is the static nature of our city structures that cannot adapt to the traffic dynamics changing throughout the day. This work focuses on a futuristic smart city design where making structural changes to the city graph is possible. These changes include modifying number of lanes, opening or closing the ramps, and changing signal timings on road segments. We also assume the local observability of the system where sensors can provide all the data needed for decision making. Under these assumptions, we propose a multi agent reinforcement learning framework for improving traffic flow in city networks. Our learning agents observe their assigned environment and find the best structural changes based on a set of features that represent the recent traffic condition, dependent road segment characteristics, recent structural modifications, etc. Our results show that the proposed framework improves the total travel time (TTT) by 31.5% during rush hours in Salt Lake City area.},

We train the autonomous vehicles to coordinate with each other while crossing a roundabout in the presence of an adversary in simulation. The adversarial policy successfully reproduces the simulated behavior and incidentally outperforms, in terms of travel time, both a human-driving baseline and adversary-free trained policies.

Through the proposed online learning method, edge devices and center controller learn the interactive policies through local observations and carry out the model-wise communication. We build up a simulation platform for time sensitive MEC systems as a gym environment module and implement the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the comparisons with a popular MARL solution, MADDPG, show that the proposed approach achieves better performance in terms of data freshness and system stability.},

abstract={In recent years, the focus on reducing the delay and the cost of transferring data to the cloud has led to data processing near end devices. Therefore, fog computing has emerged as a powerful complement to the cloud to handle the large data volume belonging to the Internet of Things (IoT) and the requirements of communications. Over time, because of the increasing number of IoT devices, managing them by a fog node has become more complicated. The problem addressed in this study is the transmission rate of various IoT devices to a fog node in order to prevent delays in emergency cases. We formulate the decision making problem of a fog node by using a reinforcement learning approach in a smart city as an example of a smart environment and then develop a Qlearning algorithm to achieve efficient decisions for IoT transmission rates to the fog node. Although to the best of our knowledge, thus far, there has been no research with this objective, in this study two more approaches, random-based and greedy-based, are simulated to show that our method performs considerably better (over 99.8 percent) than these algorithms.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is considered as the enabling platform for a variety of promising applications, such as smart transportation and smart city, where massive devices are interconnected for data collection and processing. These IoT applications pose a high demand on storage and computing capacity, while the IoT devices are usually resource constrained. As a potential solution, mobile edge computing (MEC) deploys cloud resources in the proximity of IoT devices so that their requests can be better served locally. In this work, we investigate computation offloading in a dynamic MEC system with multiple edge servers, where computational tasks with various requirements are dynamically generated by IoT devices and offloaded to MEC servers in a time-varying operating environment (e.g., channel condition changes over time). The objective of this work is to maximize the completed tasks before their respective deadlines and minimize energy consumption. To this end, we propose an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to select the best edge server for offloading and allocate the optimal computational resource such that the expected long-term utility is maximized. The simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods.},

abstract={At present, the traditional heuristic method to solve the problem of virtual network embedding (VNE) is still the mainstream. In the environment of network virtualization (NV), a more efficient VNE algorithm is needed to serve the construction of smart city. Using heuristic algorithm to solve the problem of VNE does not meet its development requirements. In this paper, a VNE algorithm based on node probability is proposed by using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The algorithm extracts three attributes of each substrate node to form a feature matrix, which is used as the input of the policy network to train the agent. The purpose is to deduce the mapping probability of each node and rank the base nodes according to this probability, then embed the virtual nodes in this order. Finally, the breadth first search (BFS) strategy is used to map the links. Simulation results show that our algorithm is superior to a representative algorithm based on node ranking in terms of the acceptance rate of virtual network requests (VNR), long-term revenue consumption ratio and long-term average revenue.},

abstract={Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has been emerged an important component and widely adopted for the smart city as it overcomes the limitations of the traditional transportation system. Existing fixed traffic light control systems split the traffic light signal into fixed duration and run in an inefficient way, therefore, it suffers from many weaknesses such as long waiting time, waste of fuel and increase in carbon emission. To tackle these issues and increase efficiency of the traffic light control system, in this work, a Dynamic and Intelligent Traffic Light Control System (DITLCS) is proposed which takes real-time traffic information as the input and dynamically adjusts the traffic light duration. Further, the proposed DITLCS runs in three modes namely Fair Mode (FM), Priority Mode (PM) and Emergency Mode (EM) where all the vehicles are considered with equal priority, vehicles of different categories are given different level of priority and emergency vehicles are given at most priority respectively. Furthermore, a deep reinforcement learning model is also proposed to switch the traffic lights in different phases (Red, Green and Yellow), and fuzzy inference system selects one mode among three modes i.e., FM, PM and EM according to the traffic information. We have evaluated DITLCS via realistic simulation on Gwalior city map of India using an open-source simulator i.e., Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The simulation results prove the efficiency of DITLCS in comparison to other state of the art algorithms on various performance parameters.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will open up new application fields in smart city-based intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), e.g., traffic management, disaster rescue, police patrol, etc. However, the broadcast and line-of-sight nature of air-to-ground wireless channels give rise to a new challenge to the information security of UAV-to-vehicle (U2V) communications. This paper considers U2V communications subject to multi-eavesdroppers on the ground in urban scenarios. We aim to maximize the secrecy rates in physical layer security perspective while considering both the energy consumption and flight zone limitation, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, the transmit power of the UAV, and the jamming power sent by the roadside unit (RSU). This joint optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), considering time-varying characteristics of the wireless channels. A curiosity-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is subsequently utilized to solve the above MDP, in which the agent is reinforced by an extrinsic reward supplied by the environment and an intrinsic reward defined as the prediction error of the consequence after executing its actions. Extensive simulation results show that compared to the DRL without intrinsic rewards, the proposed scheme can have excellent performance in terms of the average reward, learning efficiency, and generalization to other scenarios.},

abstract={Network congestion will result in significant performance degradation or even failures of many bandwidth-hungry Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Accurate and efficient congested link identification has become a foundational issue to IoT applications like self-driving cars, digital health, smart city, and so on. However, directly monitoring the massive number of interior links often introduces high operation cost or even is infeasible in practice, giving rise to indirect monitoring techniques like network Boolean tomography. Nevertheless, in many networks, the number of their interior links is larger than their end-to-end paths, making it very challenging for network Boolean tomography to find a determined solution. To resolve this issue, most of current methods try to utilize some prerequisites, such as the link congestion probabilities. While these probabilities might be hard or even unable to be obtained accurately in dynamical networks, limiting the practical deployment. In this paper, we are motivated to design a framework of congested link identification without any prerequisite or assumption. We first novelly model the congested link identification procedures as a Markov decision processes (MDPs), and then employ a reinforcement learning technology, i.e., Q-learning, to solve this MDP. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can autonomously and efficiently explore the unknown network environment, and is able to achieve better adaptivity and correctness, without any prior knowledge comparing to existing methods.},

abstract={s- Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems are key to efficient traffic management in smart cities. While RADAR or inductive loop based systems are regularly used for the task in the developed world, financial and infrastructure constraints precludes use of sophisticated and expensive sensors in the developing countries. RGB cameras are cheap and easy to deploy, making their usage attractive for ATSC. However, unstructured driving scenarios, and the requirement to work 24×7 pose a significant challenge to the camera based systems. In this paper we propose to use traffic tailback length (TTL) for training a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent in an ATSC system. We show that TTL can be calculated by simply performing a `background subtraction' on the input video captured from an RGB camera. The background subtraction operation is well studied in computer vision and can be robustly performed in low illumination, and rainy, snowy, or hazy weather. The operation does not require detecting vehicles explicitly, thus making the proposed system applicable in unstructured driving conditions, involving unseen vehicles. We show, in a simulated environment using SUMO, that our technique outperform the state of the art, which uses explicit vehicle detection information as well as speed of the vehicle, in terms of vehicle throughput, queue length, and average delay.},

abstract={Advanced informatics technologies facilitate the construction of green smart cities, especially the Wi-Fi implementation and management, for rapidly increasing personal Wi-Fi devices in autonomous environments residing in nonoverlapped channels often result in low energy efficiency and severe cochannel interference. In this paper, a green Wi-Fi management framework is constructed in order to reduce the overall energy consumption through turning off a portion of access points (APs) and aggregating their users to the other active APs. A Tabu-search-assisted active AP selection algorithm is proposed to minimize the power consumption with a seamless wireless converge. For the active APs, based on our defined metric airtime cost that is integrated by the in-range interference and the hidden terminal interference, a reinforcement-learning-aided AP self-management algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust APs' channels in the partially overlapped channel space. Extensive simulations and field experiments demonstrate that the power consumption can be reduced by about 65%, and the airtime cost of APs can be reduced by 50% compared with the typical least congestion channel search algorithm.},

abstract={Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has emerged as a key component of smart cities. Connected vehicles are increasingly processing real-time data to respond immediately to user requests. However, the data must be sent to a remote cloud for processing. To resolve this issue, vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged as a promising paradigm that improves the quality of computation experiences for vehicles by offloading computation tasks from the cloud to network edges. Nevertheless, due to the resource restrictions of fog computing, only a limited number of vehicles are able to use it while it is still challenging to provide real-time responses for vehicular applications, such as traffic and accident warnings in the highly dynamic IoV environment. Therefore, in this article, we formulate the problem of allocating the limited fog resources to vehicular applications such that the service latency is minimized, by utilizing parked vehicles. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to efficiently find the solutions of the problem formulation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is combined with reinforcement learning to make more efficient resource allocation decisions, leveraging the vehicles' movement and parking status collected from the smart environment of the city. Our simulation results show that our VFC resource allocation algorithm can achieve higher service satisfaction compared to conventional resource allocation algorithms.},

However, 5G is not a perfect solution, thus providing IoT nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RATs) would allow them to exploit the various benefits offered by each RAT (such as lower power consumption or reduced operational costs). By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have formulated the problem of deciding which RAT should an IoT node employ when reporting events. These so-called transmission policies maximize a predefined reward closely related to classical throughput while keeping power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. A set of simulations are performed for IoT nodes provided with two RATs: LoRa and 5G. The results obtained are compared to those achieved under other intuitive policies to further highlight the benefits of our proposal.},

abstract={Mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) is now an important source of information for smart cities, especially with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and driverless cars. They are equipped with different kinds of high-precision sensors, and can be scheduled/controlled completely during data collection, which will make MCS system more robust. However, they are limited to energy constraint, especially for long-term, long-distance sensing tasks, and cities are almost too crowded to set stationary charging station. Towards this end, in this paper we propose to leverage emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for enabling model-free unmanned vehicles control, and present a novel and highly effective control framework, called “DRL-RVC.” It utilizes the powerful convolutional neural network for feature extraction of the necessary information (including sample distribution, traffic flow, etc.), then makes decisions under the guidance of the deep Q network. That is, UAVs will cruise in the city without control and collect most required data in the sensing region, while mobile unmanned charging station will reach the charging point in the shortest possible time. Finally, we validate and evaluate the proposed framework via extensive simulations based on a real dataset in Rome. Extensive simulation results well justify the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.},

abstract={For smart cities, ubiquitous user connectivity and collaborative computation offloading are significant for the ever-increasing information requirements to promote the quality of citizens’ life. In this article, we design an information prefetching architecture, which investigates a hierarchical data storage and selection strategy, including local to edge and edge to cloud. Building on collected data in the social media system or sensor networks, we specifically focus on analyzing mobile terminals’ behaviors to assure the precision of our prefetching strategy in different kinds of information streaming. To assemble edge agents (EAs) prefetching, we also consider the characteristics of wireless backhaul. This scheme is carried out to optimize the EAs prefetching framework by the independent and joint action modules that are based on the theory of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). It paves a better way of collaborative edge computing (CEC) that can be built by using an independent/joint edge-learning model to help and promote the algorithm efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, for hiding the information of data transmission between the cloud and the edge servers during data prefetching, this hierarchical scheme is designed as an implicit index maintained by edge servers. Our results show rationales on the obtainable performance of EAs architectures and their reciprocity with the dynamic change of mobile terminals’ requirements.},

abstract={The paper is motivated by the importance of the Smart Cities (SC) concept for future management of global urbanization and energy consumption. Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an efficient solution to utilize large amount of sensory data provided by the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure of the SCs for city-wide decision making and managing demand response. Conventional ModelFree (MF) and Model-Based (MB) RL algorithms, however, use a fixed reward model to learn the value function rendering their application challenging for ever changing SC environments. Successor Representations (SR)-based techniques are attractive alternatives that address this issue by learning the expected discounted future state occupancy, referred to as the SR, and the immediate reward of each state. SR-based approaches are, however, mainly developed for single agent scenarios and have not yet been extended to multi-agent settings. The paper addresses this gap and proposes the Multi-Agent Adaptive Kalman Filtering-based Successor Representation (MAKF-SR) framework. The proposed framework can adapt quickly to the changes in a multi-agent environment faster than the MF methods and with a lower computational cost compared to MB algorithms. The proposed MAKF-SR is evaluated through a comprehensive set of experiments illustrating superior performance compared to its counterparts.},

Various wireless technologies have been proposed for meeting the stringent requirements of platooning. 3GPP has initiated standardization work for LTE based V2V communication. It offers potential means to support transmission of safety critical messages among platoon vehicles with high reliability, security and ultra low latency. However, efficient resource allocation has been a challenge in LTE based networks. In this paper, we propose a Cooperative-Reinforcement Learning (C-RL) based resource selection algorithm for communication among connected vehicles utilizing LTE-Direct technology. The proposal outperforms the distributed resource selection scheme in terms of actual time required for Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) dissemination among vehicles forming the platoon and performance of other vehicular links sharing the similar Resource Blocks (RBs). Simulation results shows the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in terms of efficient resource utilization and faster dissemination of messages among the connected vehicles.},

abstract={Efficient urban mobility proved to be a major challenge for smart cities. A better use of the urban traffic infrastructure is key in the effort of mitigating the effects of traffic congestion. Popular approaches range from classical control and optimization to multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper follows the latter track. Challenges here are manifold. First, most of the literature assumes that either traffic lights learn (while drivers do not change their behaviors) or viceversa. Second, no matter what kind of class of learning agents is considered, their actions are highly coupled (thus making the learning task harder). Third, when both classes of agents co-learn, these learning tasks are of different nature (from the point of view of MARL). Finally, a microscopic modeling and simulation of the this problem is not trivial. Therefore, this paper not only proposes a co-learning approach in which agents act in a shared environment, but also argues that this task needs to be formulated asynchronously. Besides, driver agents are able to update the value of the available actions by receiving information from other drivers. Results show that the co-learning approach outperforms other policies in terms of average travel time of all vehicles. Moreover, when co-learning is used, a better distribution of the trips within the network is observed.},

abstract={5G is regarded as a revolutionary mobile network, which is expected to satisfy a vast number of novel services, ranging from remote health care to smart cities. However, heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of different services and limited spectrum make the radio resource allocation a challenging problem in 5G. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for radio resource slicing in 5G. We model each slice as an intelligent agent that competes for limited radio resources, and the correlated Q-learning is applied for inter-slice resource block (RB) allocation. The proposed correlated Q-learning based inter-slice RB allocation (COQRA) scheme is compared with Nash Q-learning (NQL), Latency-Reliability-Throughput Q-learning (LRTQ) methods, and the priority proportional fairness (PPF) algorithm. Our simulation results show that the proposed CO-QRA achieves 32.4% lower latency and 6.3% higher throughput when compared with LRTQ, and 5.8% lower latency and 5.9% higher throughput than NQL. Significantly higher throughput and lower packet drop rate (PDR) is observed in comparison to PPF.},

abstract={Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications require a distributed architecture for decision making either because of a lack of a centralized system, failure-prone connectivity to a centralized system or because the imposed latency to contact such a system is too high for real-time applications. Often, these IoT applications fall in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), e.g., autonomous robot navigation in smart factories and traffic signal control in smart cities. However, RL-based applications require a long learning time. To overcome this limitation and scale with the number of agents, parallel RL (PRL) algorithms run multiple RL agents in parallel and on distributed environments. However, deploying PRL algorithms in such environments entails a communication overhead that increases the (actual) execution time. The state-of-the-art PRL algorithms are designed for reducing the learning time while assuming no (or limited) communication overhead. In this article, we present a novel partitioning algorithm that minimizes the communication overhead in PRL running on IoT environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on solving the communication overhead of distributing PRL algorithms without requiring any a priori knowledge about the structure of the problem. The proposed algorithm intelligently combines a dynamic state partitioning strategy, which exploits the agent's exploration capabilities to build partition knowledge while learning, with an efficient mapping of agents to partitions, which reduces the communication among agents. Performance evaluations show that the proposed algorithm can achieve almost no communication among PRL agents at the converged state.},

abstract={The ever-increasing urban population and the corresponding material demands have brought unprecedented burdens to cities. To guarantee better QoS for citizens, smart cities leverage emerging technologies such as the Cognitive Radio Internet of Things (CR-IoT). However, resource allocation is a great challenge for CR-IoT, mainly because of the extremely numerous devices and users. Generally, the auction theory and game theory are applied to overcome the challenge. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to learn the optimal resource allocation strategy in the oligopoly market model. Firstly, we model a multi-agent scenario with the primary users (PUs) as sellers and secondary users (SUs) as buyers. Then, we propose the Q-probabilistic multi-agent learning (QPML) and apply it to allocate resources in the market. In the multi-agent learning process, the PUs and SUs learn strategies to maximize their benefits and improve spectrum utilization. The performance of QPML is compared with Learning Automation (LA) through simulations. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms other approaches and performs well.},

abstract={As a critical component in the concept of smart cities, autonomous vehicles are under extensive investigation. The need for intelligent fueling without human assistance stimulates the development of wireless charging. There are, however, several issues to be addressed to enhance the efficiency and reliability of charging. The vehicle battery exhibits varying resistance during the charging process. Additionally, the alignment and gap may change with external positioning, which affects the coupling coefficient of the transmitter and receiver coils. Thus, a data-driven control scheme is desired to tackle these environmental uncertainties. This paper adopts the control scheme of embedding a Buck converter at the receiver side. Different from state-of-the-art literature, a reinforcement learning-based data-driven control approach is employed to regulate the charging voltage. Stable charging voltage is attained regardless of the knowledge of the coupling coefficient, load variations, or component values. System simulations in Simulink have proved the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

In this paper, we consider the transmitter has some computational tasks to be computed, under the environments of intelligent attacker. Due to the limited computational capability, the sender needs to offload some tasks to the receiver. To address this problem, we propose a power allocation algorithm based on combining the technology of reinforcement learning and game theory, in order to achieve an optimal secure data rate and meanwhile reduce the whole task latency of the transmission and computation with Q learning and Nash equilibrium. Then, the Nash equilibrium and its existence conditions are derived and proven mathematically. Finally, we perform some simulations under Matlab platform, and the results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the secrecy data rate and reduce the whole system latency.},

abstract={Mobile Internet of things (MIoT) applications serving smart cities bring the promise of innovative and enhanced public services such as air pollution monitoring, enhanced road safety and city resources metering and management. These applications rely on a number of energy-constrained MIoT units (MUs) (e.g., robots and drones) to continuously sense, capture and process data and images from their environments to produce immediate adaptive actions. In this paper, we consider a scenario where a battery constrained MU executes a number of time- sensitive data processing tasks whose arrival times and sizes are stochastic in nature. We first formulate the problem of making optimal offloading decisions that minimize the cost of current and future tasks as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) that accounts for the constraints of the MU battery and the limited reserved resources on the MEC infrastructure by the application providers. Next, we show how the CMDP problem can be relaxed using Lagrangian primal-dual optimization. We then develop a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm to train the MU to solve the relaxed problem. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the achieved performance improvement.},

abstract={Recently, smart cities, smart homes, and smart medical systems have challenged the functionality and connectivity of the large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Thus, with the idea of offloading intensive computing tasks from them to edge nodes (ENs), edge computing emerged to supplement these limited devices. Benefit from this advantage, IoT devices can save more energy and still maintain the quality of the services they should provide. However, computational offload decisions involve federation and complex resource management and should be determined in the real-time face to dynamic workloads and radio environments. Therefore, in this work, we use multiple deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents deployed on multiple edge nodes to indicate the decisions of the IoT devices. On the other hand, with the aim of making DRL-based decisions feasible and further reducing the transmission costs between the IoT devices and edge nodes, federated learning (FL) is used to train DRL agents in a distributed fashion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the decision scheme and federated learning in the dynamic IoT system.},

abstract={High-quality data collection is crucial for mobile crowd sensing (MCS) with various applications like smart cities and emergency rescues, where various unmanned mobile terminals (MTs), e.g., driverless cars and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are equipped with different sensors that aid to collect data. However, they are limited with fixed carrying capacity, and thus, MT's energy resource and sensing range are constrained. It is quite challenging to navigate a group of MTs to move around a target area to maximize their total amount of collected data with the limited energy reserve, while geographical fairness among those point-of-interests (PoIs) should also be maximized. It is even more challenging if fully distributed execution is enforced, where no central control is allowed at the backend. To this end, we propose to leverage emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for directing MT's sensing and movement and to present a novel and highly efficient control algorithm, called energy-efficient distributed MCS (Edics). The proposed neural network integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and then makes decision under the guidance of multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method in a fully distributed manner. We also propose two enhancements into Edics with N-step return and prioritized experienced replay buffer. Finally, we evaluate Edics through extensive simulations and found the appropriate set of hyperparameters in terms of number of CNN hidden layers and neural units for all the fully connected layers.

Before the 1970s, various businesses and economics could affect and improve technologies, and humans' life. Since we reached the 70ies, and with the beginning of the 3rd wave or the post-industrial era, the new modern technologies such as Information Technology (IT), Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Business (IoB), Internet of Energy (IoE), Internet of Manufacturing (IoM), Internet of Health (IoH), the emerging digitization, and innovative smartness in addition, issues such as know-how, do-how, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and others could influence businesses, the economy, urban infrastructures, societies, social impacts and even human life. Wars, sanctions, sciences, technologies, IT, IoT, and smartness work together and have impacts on each other's, businesses, economy, and human life. Fundamentally, during humans' history inventions and innovations have been created through restrictions and challenges. Wars, sanctions, low sustainability, risks of contagion, recessions, climate pollution, environmental change, biodiversity collapse, urban sprawl, growing urbanizations, lack of infrastructure, gentrification, economic instabilities, and recently health crises are introduced as main restrictions. Wars and welfare integrate with human's life desirably or undesirably and make innovation. Improvement through such innovative digital technologies are so admirable because most of them have changed the world. Sustainability has an important role for societies and urbans to improve their quality of livability and life.

This pandemic throws a spotlight on the interdependencies among business, nature, society, economy, and education. It may be tempting right now, when it is hard to see beyond the next few weeks, to dismiss the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a distraction. But they have been described as a "crowd-sourced purchase order from the future" precisely because they offer a tremendous business opportunity. Based on SDGs all developed and developing countries in a global partnership have to go with CSR strategies and Hybrid Businesses for improving social cohesion and welfare, health, education, inequality, blue-green environmental sustainability, and economic efficiency.

Recently, since intelligent surveillance was applied in all kind of smart city services, object tracking attracted more attention. However, two serious problems blocked the development of visual tracking in real applications. The first problem is its lower performance under intense illumination variation, while the second issue is its slow speed. This paper addressed these two problems by proposing a correlation filter-based tracker. Fog computing platform was deployed to accelerate the proposed tracking approach. The tracker was constructed by multiple positions’ detections and alternate templates. The detection position was repositioned according to the estimated speed of target by an optical flow method, and the alternate template was stored with a template update mechanism, which is all computed at the edge. Experimental results on large-scale public benchmark data sets showed the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.},

Recent achievements in the field of artificial intelligence and the organization of the movement of autonomous vehicles today allow us to create concepts that may become ubiquitous in the near future. In this paper, the authors consider the possibilities for creating an intelligent transport infrastructure within the concept of a smart city using cyber-physical systems. The aspects of information security in the use of cyber-physical systems are considered, approaches to solving problems of intersection management are discussed. Intersections in cities loaded with traffic can be compared with bottlenecks - the trajectory of many vehicles overlap and congestion occurs. To increase the capacity of urban streets, the authors presented a model of the system that regulates the movement of vehicles at the intersection. To assess the feasibility of using the developed model, the authors developed a software simulator of two connected urban intersections. For comparison, a simulator of the intersections, regulated by a traffic lights, was also developed. The results of the experiments allow us to say that the developed model is more efficient than the traffic light in the framework of this study.},

As AI and IoT technologies are becoming mature, in this paper, we propose to apply AIoT technologies for traffic light control, which is an essential component for intelligent transportation system, to improve the efficiency of smart city's road system. Specifically, various sensors such as surveillance cameras provide real-time information for intelligent traffic light control system to observe the states of both motorized traffic and non-motorized traffic. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic light control solution by using distributed multi-agent Q learning, considering the traffic information at the neighboring intersections as well as local motorized and non-motorized traffic, to improve the overall performance of the entire control system. By using the proposed multi-agent Q learning algorithm, our solution is targeting to optimize both the motorized and non-motorized traffic. In addition, we considered many constraints/rules for traffic light control in the real world, and integrate these constraints in the learning algorithm, which can facilitate the proposed solution to be deployed in real operational scenarios. We conducted numerical simulations for a real-world map with real-world traffic data. The simulation results show that our proposed solution outperforms existing solutions in terms of vehicle and pedestrian queue lengths, waiting time at intersections, and many other key performance metrics.},

abstract={With the advance of artificial intelligence and communication technology in the smart city, various location-based data of users can be collected via location-based social networks (LBSNs). How to make full use of these data for accurate point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is challenging because POI selection is influenced by various factors. In this article, we propose a network representation learning-enhanced multisource information (MSI) fusion model for POI recommendation in the context of LBSNs. The proposed model jointly considers various factors, including user preference, geographical influence, and social influence for a recommendation. Specifically, the social influence is modeled by performing network representation learning methods on the constructed co-visiting user networks so that the hidden complex social relationships among users can be measured automatically. Moreover, considering the significance of user preference and geographical influence, a fusion model is designed to jointly consider user preference, social influence, and geographical influence for POI recommendation. Our method is evaluated based on two publicly available data sets and extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSI fusion model outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms for POI recommendation in terms of precision, recall, and F1.},

abstract={Semantic interoperability is the process of representing, editing, and transmitting semantic information in one context, and then receiving and interpreting it in another. It is an important research topic in semantic web, Internet of things, smart city, smart enterprise and artificial intelligence. The current research methods of semantic interoperability generally include standardization, ontology modeling and collaboration templates, each of which has its own internalized limitations. In this paper, a novel cross-context tabular document representation approach (Tabdoc) is proposed, where semantic documents used for cross-domain interaction can maintain the same syntax, concepts, and semantic relations. The new method is implemented under Sign Description Framework (SDF) and an editor is newly developed for semantic document creation. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on open datasets demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme. Experimental results indicate that Tabdoc approach can effectively identify, extract and consistently interoperate semantic components of tabular documents.},

abstract={The world today has become a competitive place, whether it is in sports, entertainment, or in the job market. Users need to allocate an extraordinary amount of time for their routine works with little distraction. It is a truism that time is in all works of life or all aspects, in all aspects of life. They found out that people generally spend one hour daily in front of the mirror. This paper introduces the Interactive Multimedia-futuristic Live Mirror by using the concept of Artificial Intelligence for commercial use as well as for the smart home environment. The data collection for this work is done by using the cloud with Arduino UNO. In one smart city, several live mirrors were attached in different smart homes and industries in different smart homes and industries as they all invariably collect data from the cloud and stay updated. Additional, information can be collected from home appliances such as deep freezer, air conditioner, and washing machine. The RFID, with a Master-Slave architecture, is used to construct a smart-home system, displaying all information on the Live Mirror. Our smart mirror is equipped with several digital devices such as speakers, microphone and Arduino, which enable it to provide essential standard services such as suggestion, calorie monitoring, activities, latest health habit updates, and current weather. Therefore, it makes it a new smart product with growing global recognition in recent years.},

abstract={The traditional natural gas Internet-of-Things (IoT) system has many problems, such as centralized management of resources, noncirculation of data between stations, insecurity of transaction information or account books, and lack of contract consensus. In order to ensure data security and reliable transaction, this article introduces artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology and constructs an AI-enabled and blockchain-powered natural gas IoT system in a smart city. In this article, the natural gas output prediction model based on temporal pattern attention-based LSTMs (TPA-LSTMs) is used to enable the system to sense the change of natural gas deliverability. In addition, we establish a blockchain-based secure natural gas transaction scheme, which dynamically matches the purchase contract and sale contract to maximize the interests of the buyer and the seller and obtain a transaction contract. The experimental results show that our model can predict the output value of natural gas in real time and select the appropriate transaction matching scheme according to the dynamic demand for sales.},

abstract={Smart city as a new paradigm for future city development leads to a large amount of computing workload and high network latency especially with artificial intelligence algorithms. Fog computing, as one of the mobile edge computing paradigms, deploys some servers at the edge of mobile networks to solve these problems. However, it still remains a challenging issue how to obtain the energy-effective cooperation policy among fog nodes (FNs) to enhance the users' quality of experience (QoE) under fairness, where the fairness ensures that FNs are willing to take part in cooperations. Therefore, we first build up a cooperative fog computing system to process offloading workload on the entire fog layer by data forwarding. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem of QoE and energy in integrated fog computing process with fairness. After that, we prove the convexity of the optimization problem and design a fairness cooperation algorithm (FCA) to obtain the optimal fairness cooperation policy of all FNs. Finally, numerical results show that our FCA can quickly converge to its solution compared with three traditional convex optimization approaches, and FCA can effectively reduce the time overhead and the energy consumption compared to baseline algorithm and distributed optimization algorithm.},

abstract={The conceptualisation of the sixth generation of mobile wireless networks (6G) has already started with some potential disruptive technologies resonating as enablers for driving the emergence of a number of innovative applications. Particularly, 6G will be a prominent supporter for the evolution towards a truly Intelligent Transportation System and the realization of the Smart City concept by fulfilling the limitations of 5G, once vehicular networks are becoming highly dynamic and complex with stringent requirements on ultra-low latency, high reliability, and massive connections. More importantly, providing security and privacy to such critical systems should be a top priority as vulnerabilities can be catastrophic, thus there are huge concerns regarding data collected from sensors, people and their habits. In this paper, we provide a timely deliberation of the role that promissory 6G enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence, network softwarisation, network slicing, blockchain, edge computing, intelligent reflecting surfaces, backscatter communications, terahertz links, visible light communications, physical layer authentication, and cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) will play on providing the expected level of security and privacy for the Internet of Vehicles.},

abstract={Although smart grid concept has recently become a subject of academic studies; impacts of this concept appear in many areas of engineering. Today, the smart grid concept involves many subjects from the efficient use of electrical energy resources to the planned and programmed consumption of energy, from the integration of distributed renewable energy sources into the system to the domestic productive consumers (prosumers), which are much related to local or regional development. Smart grid concept, which emerges a product of interdisciplinary studies ranging to many fields of engineering such as power systems, control, artificial intelligence and communication, can be briefly viewed as a development process towards the internet of energy. Especially in recent years, the decrease in reserves of fossil-fueled energy sources has led researchers to find out new energy sources, more efficient and ecological production and distribution methods. In these studies, the energy sources, which are renewable, sustainable, and economical have become major priorities due to reducing carbon emissions. However, the scope of smart grid studies has been continuously enriched and it has begun to include the fundamental components of production-centered sustainable development models, which are the providing of low-cost production supplies, continuity of these supplies, efficiency in production and consumption, generation based on renewable or recyclable resources, and applications of ecological generation and consumption methods. In this context, the positive effects of smart grids on the regional development are expected to occur in the following topics: Smart city applications, intelligent transportation, renewable and local energy generation, smart homes and building concepts, energy efficient cities, control of carbon footprint, automated electricity, gas, water and waste networks, loss and leakage control, application of demand side energy management system to reduce power consumption, self-healing electricity distribution, smart energy pricing, smart energy storage are some emergent topics that can contribute to sustainable regional development models. Because, modern grid components developed within the scope of smart grid are expected to support sustainable production models via smart energy management and increasing efficiency, reducing the energy costs, improving energy continuity. In this study, a projection for possible contributions of smart grid concept with its continuously expanding scope to the sustainable regional development is discussed under several major headings.},

abstract={With the rapid development of smart city and artificial intelligence technology, massive city-related information has been increased. The traditional storage strategy for big data can easily lead to hot nodes, which makes it difficult to meet requirement of big data storage efficiency. A Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) storage strategy for data based on the response time of data nodes (DNs) is proposed. Four parameters of memory utilization, network distance, bandwidth utilization and CPU utilization of DNs are token as evaluation indicators of the strategy. Then the master node evaluates the response time of each data node (DN) based on BP neural network. Finally, the DNs with shorter response time would be chosen for data storage. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy can realize the distributed storage for big data and avoid the emergence of hot nodes. Furthermore, the strategy can effectively improve the response time of DNs and the load balancing of cluster.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides the basic infrastructure for a hyper connected society where all things are connected and exchange information through the Internet. IoT technology is fused with 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for use various fields such as the smart city and smart factory. As the demand for IoT technology increases, security threats against IoT infrastructure, applications, and devices have also increased. A variety of studies have been conducted on the detection of IoT malware to avoid the threats posed by malicious code. While existing models may accurately detect malicious IoT code identified through static analysis, detecting the new and variant IoT malware quickly being generated may become challenging. This paper proposes a dynamic analysis for IoT malware detection (DAIMD) to reduce damage to IoT devices by detecting both well-known IoT malware and new and variant IoT malware evolved intelligently. The DAIMD scheme learns IoT malware using the convolution neural network (CNN) model and analyzes IoT malware dynamically in nested cloud environment. DAIMD performs dynamic analysis on IoT malware in a nested cloud environment to extract behaviors related to memory, network, virtual file system, process, and system call. By converting the extracted and analyzed behavior data into images, the behavior images of IoT malware are classified and trained in the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). DAIMD can minimize the infection damage of IoT devices from malware by visualizing and learning the vast amount of behavior data generated through dynamic analysis.},
