abstract={Immense urbanization is putting tremendous pressure on policy makers, city planners and managers to render sustainable plans and designs which ensures good quality of life for the residents of the smart cities. In order to achieve this goal, a city can be made smart with the ubiquitous development and usage in hardware and software technologies, vast advancement in information and communication technologies and speedy furtherance of connected devices. The newest style of smart city initiative, in turn makes the implementation arduous and challenging. Furthermore, the standards for the design and implementation of the smart city is yet to be released. Consequently, security in this ad-hoc technology is premature and overlooked. In this paper we propose security system that offers active and planned approach to protect the smart city in four spots. Firstly, the machine learning based security system should be placed at the data collection points that has IoT enabled devices. Secondly, the data must be protected by implementing complex cryptographic technique while travelling from the collection points to the intended storage location. Thirdly, the data at rest in the storage area for analysis should be conserved by applying some intelligent intrusion detection technique. Finally, the specific machine generated action should be ensured at the target.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a shifting paradigm that allows the integration of billions of devices with the Internet. With its wide range of application domains, including smart cities, smart homes, and e-health, the IoT has created new challenges, particularly security threats. Traditional security solutions, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, need amending to fit the new networking paradigm. Given the recent advances in machine learning, we investigated the use of deep learning algorithms for anomaly detection. The IoT collects a massive amount of data from the environment, and deep learning is based on a set of algorithms striving for the data. Intrusion detection systems are used to expose network threats and are an effective means of protecting network assets. Anomaly detection is a conventional intrusion detection approach that separates normal and abnormal network traffic using statistical, rule-based, or machine learning models. Of the machine learning models, deep learning is a neural network algorithm that has provided breakthroughs in domains such as object and voice recognition. However, there are limitations in applying deep learning to network anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection framework based on unsupervised deep learning algorithms for revealing network threats. Our research explores the applicability of deep learning to detect anomalies by evaluating the use of Restricted Boltzmann machines as generative energy-based models against Autoencoders as non-probabilistic algorithms. The study provides an in-depth analysis of unsupervised deep learning algorithms. The simulations studies show $\approx$ 99% detection accuracy, which is significantly improved compared to the closely related work.},

abstract={Air pollution in smart cities in the world has been drastically increasing lately and the increase in the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air is a threat for the country and citizens as it can out-turn unbearable consequences such as cardiovascular disease and worsen asthma. PM2.5 is a deadly air pollutant that is a mixture of solid and liquid coarse particles and has a diameter of 2.5 micrometres. In Malaysia, traffic congestion has been the main contributor to developing air pollution in smart cities such as Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru. The systemic way of air pollution prediction using machine learning has been widely studied globally over the years and many machine learning algorithms were studied and tested to find the solution to air pollution in their country. However, very few approaches were done in Malaysia to predict air pollution using machine learning methods. This study aims to implement machine learning algorithms to find the accuracy of the prediction of particulate matter, PM2.5 in air pollution in smart cities of Malaysia. To test the implementation of machine learning in this prediction, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Random Forest are chosen and compared between these two algorithms using the Malaysia Air Pollution dataset. The outcome of this research is that Random Forest gave the best accuracy in prediction of Particulate Matter, PM2.5 Air Pollution Index in smart cities of Malaysia than MLP.},

The implementation of the Smart City project is based on technologies such as the Internet of Things, great data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Many cities have formed unique smart city projects, applied visualization technologies, online offices and online training, transport logistics and so on. Thus, the benefits of smart cities have recently been widely used including to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic for example, the introduction of electronic vaccination certificates and QR codes.

abstract={We present a framework to secure Internet-of- Things (IoT) enabled Smart Cities using Black Networks and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to protect against a broad range of current and future cyber attacks. Smart city cyber systems carry critical data beginning with the simple sensor data captured by IoT devices up to and including providing the essential services and commands dependent upon that data. The broad reliance upon IoT in smart cities significantly increases the attack surface of the already large, complex, and heterogeneous smart city system by making each and every IoT device and its communications a potential entry point into the system. Our proposed framework utilizes Black Network protocols and key management to secure the most vulnerable, and typically unsecured, IoT communications. The framework utilizes a hierarchical, distributed architecture with pooled resources to prevent single points of failure and to sandbox attack impacts. This hierarchy allows AI enabled management tools to be placed both near the IoT edge using localized data and in the Big Data collections. Our analysis reveals that the proposed framework provides an adaptive health and security management framework that accounts for the dynamic, continuous, and ever-changing life in a smart city.},

abstract={With the rapid development of technologies, such as 5G, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, smart cities are gradually being implemented from a concept to actual development and deployment. A smart city integrates the management of multiple internet of things (IoT) terminals to improve urban development and to provide people with a better way of life. As a mobile and flexible terminal form of IoT, sensing fabric has been widely used in smart cities. In this article, a new generation of sensing fabric is combined with the smart city, and an emotion-guided interaction architecture of smart urban living is proposed. However, there is a lot of information redundancy in the spatiotemporal environment that is collected by the various sensing fabrics in a smart city. Therefore, an energy consumption optimization model for sensing fabrics based on the information redundancy in the spatiotemporal environment is also put forward. By recognizing the current data collection ability and residual energy of sensing fabric, an optimal data allocation strategy is obtained to further improve the user experience of the smart urban system. Simulation experiments were carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

abstract={Along with the unprecedented boom of 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence, smart cities are making a great clamor. When billions of IoT devices are streaming in the smart city, realizing low-latency and high-bandwidth services has a significant impact on the benefits of smart cities. Thus, managing resources efficiently and intelligently to meet various service requirements has become a challenge for smart cities. With the rapid development of machine intelligence, it can be considered that many machines constitute a machine society just like that of human beings. Inspired by the efficient and collaborative operation mechanism of human society, we propose a socialized learning scheme to address various needs in smart cities (e.g., reasonable resource allocation). Specifically, we present the socialized learning scheme from three perspectives. First, we design a cognitive paradigm of socialized learning to enlighten the long-term vision of applying learning-based resource management to smart cities, with comprehensive discussions of three dimensions consisting of architecture, decision, and knowledge. Second, we also probe the socialized learning methodology including socialized training and socialized inference. It highlights social relationships and introduces a series of technologies to realize social relations within and across layers. Finally, we give a socialized learning solution for solving the practical resource allocation problem in smart cities, thereby jointly improving decision accuracy and reducing training costs. Illustrative simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Internet of Everything (IoE) enables a smart city to power and monitor multiple geographically distributed IoE nodes to support a range of applications across various domains such as energy and resource management, intelligent transport systems and E-health to name a few. Due to unprecedented increase in the use of IoE technology and the volume of data it generates, there is need to develop a state-of-the-art architecture to support wide range of applications in order to manage smart city resources in an efficient and intelligent manner. In this work in progress article, we present a conceptual design to establish efficient task off-loading and resource allocation architecture for smart city environment.

Secondly, we build upon the conventional model to introduce the intelligence for task off-loading and resource allocation problem.

Today, many different organizations are being organized and supported for the development and acceleration of development. This study will examine what artificial intelligence based smart cities can provide for development, their contribution sand their impacts. These contributions and effects are seen from many different angles, not from a single angle. At the same time, these effects support both each other and development at the same time. It can be said that smart cities and intelligent city systems can help to evolve in many different ways. Smart cities will be able to plan and reduce current consumption with the regulation of old systems, electricity consumption forecasting, instant monitoring, smart meters and intelligent lighting systems. Besides, planned reconstruction, ecological buildings, safe and uninterrupted energy can provide prosperity. In this way, the cities become more economical, safe, livable and comfortable and at the same time they can contribute to development. In general, the economic development of intelligent cities is in the forefront. In fact, most of the intelligent urban planning work on Earth has been made because of economic concerns, and therefore the intelligent city system has been introduced. As a result of these passages, good results have been obtained from the examples. When old systems are organized and intelligent, electricity costs will decrease, instant follow-up will be possible and the user will be able to pre-purchase the required energy with electricity consumption estimation. At the same time, these systems can also facilitate management. Planned construction will result in a more modern city image that will reduce excavation, infrastructure work and similar costs. In addition to reducing air pollution, ecological buildings can contribute economically by producing some of their own energy. In summary; A smart city system with good planning can be a locomotive for development.},

The analytical material used was 381,362 Twitter data with the topic of Smart City by Drone Emprit. These tweets are grouped by region, province, and island. Drone Emprit has implemented several methods such as Machine Learning, Database Framework, Hadoop Framework, and Physical Hardware to visualize Smart City data spread throughout Indonesia. Seeing a tweet from an area indicates that the development of a Smart City has been implemented in that area. As a result, the islands of Sumatra and Sulawesi have achieved quite well, although they only cover 4 % and 2 % of the achievements of Java Island. Java Island has a dominance of 61 % with 2332 tweet data.

abstract={Smart Cities will create many benefits for society. One of the most significant will be real-time, active management of the systems making up a Smart City. Active management will be enabled by processing large amounts of real-time data, by machine learning to deliver timely insights and by large-scale simulation to create effective interventions. To realise active management of Smart Cities requires processing systems that can take in data at large volume and variety, and perform complex processing on these data, all in real-time. Digital twins are used to create a continuous, consistent view of the current state of the city, and simulation of the evolution of digitals twins is used to detect problems arising in the near future and to optimise the impact of interventions. In this paper we propose and validate a Smart City processing architecture that can deliver these benefits by building a digital twin of a city, combining real-time streamed data ingestion, simulation and analytics. Streamed data systems can deliver a real time response with large amount of incoming data but are not suited to time advancing simulations where the interaction between modelled objects is important. We propose a processing architecture that mitigates this limitation by separating object interactions from streamed data processing. Finally, we introduce DEDUCE-PT, a demonstration implementation of this Smart City processing architecture that is aimed at proactive management of public transport systems.},

abstract={A smart city can be defined as a city that uses distributed sensors to monitor and control the urban environment by collecting real-time information. Using such smart devices improves the quality of living and facilitates the process of decision making. Smart cities provide solutions to environmental issues such as amount of wastage, energy consumption, traffic congestion, and pollution. The traffic issue is a one important concern in any city due to the increasing number of populations using vehicles which lead to traffic congestions, accidents, and delays. Traffic issues can also cause a high level of pollution and fuel consumption. To solve such issues, roads should be managed by monitoring, analyzing and predicting the traffic flow. In this research, we propose a machine learning based model for traffic flow prediction in smart cities, particularly in the context of “NEOM” megacity that is born from Saudi Arabia's vision of 2030. The proposed model combines previous methods of traffic prediction to produce robust traffic prediction model that can be used in NEOM megacity to achieve better traffic management.},

With the advancement of technology, many smart city systems have been developed at a rapid rate of which Smart Parking is emerging as one of the core components. Smart Parking promises to automate the parking process, thereby saving time, resources and effort for searching an optimal parking space as well as reducing traffic congestion and population. As one of the newly emerging and disrupting technology, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning (AI/ML/DL) are being utilized in many aspects of developing a Smart Parking system. In this paper, we propose an solution for accelerating AI/ML/DL algorithms deployed on low-cost System-on-Chip platforms (SoCs), which are often used as edge devices in Smart Parking system. In particular, we leverage Binary Neural Network (BNN), one of the most advanced deep learning models, to build a heterogeneous algorithm for real-time identifying parking occupancy based on the integration of SoCs and existing surveillance systems. The proposed solution is implemented and evaluated in Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC with high accuracy (approx. 87%), low latency (avg. 16ms) and high frame per second (FPS) rate.},

abstract={Advanced communication and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies facilitate the development of green smart cities. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are crucial components, which are aware of the environment by collecting data from sensors and modeling through AI to realize automatic decision-making. Intelligence networking enables each CAV to train appropriate models locally to learn how to drive in different environments, which can make up for the lack of experience of single-vehicle. However, model training and intelligence networking consume a lot of energy, calling on high-energy-efficient solutions. In this paper, we propose a non-fungible token (NFT)-based green intelligence networking scheme (NGIN) for CAVs in smart cities. We use NFT to tokenize and describe intelligence by metadata, enabling applications to network intelligence efficiently, thereby reducing energy consumption. We present the architecture, modules, and efficient mechanisms of distributed intelligence networking. Moreover, we formulate the core problem as a discrete Markov decision process (MDP) and adopt the quantum-inspired reinforcement learning (QRL) algorithm to solve it. Also, the convergence rate and performance are evaluated. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={With the development of the Internet of things (IoT), energy consumption of smart buildings has been widely concerned. The prediction of building energy consumption is of great significance for energy conservation and environmental protection as well as the construction of smart city. With the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning technology has been introduced to energy consumption prediction. In this study, multiple learning algorithms including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF) are developed to perform energy consumption prediction. The most appropriate machine learning algorithm for energy consumption prediction has been investigated and found to be the random forest algorithm. Based on the developed machine learning models, studies on the sampling strategy for energy consumption prediction have been conducted. It is found that the variance of data has a significant effect on the prediction accuracy, and a better prediction result can be achieved by increasing the sampling density over the data with high variance. This result can be used to optimize the machine learning algorithm for building energy consumption prediction and improve the computational efficiency.},

However, in the process of smart city construction, the application of big data, IoT, artificial intelligence and other information technologies, it not only makes the city more convenient, but also brings new information security risks. In order to improve the security of information in the smart city environment, this paper starts with the physical perception layer, network communication layer, computing & storage layer, data & service support layer and application layer that constitute the smart city. This paper uses literature analysis method to make a statistical analysis of the attack cases of each layer of the basic architecture of smart city, and analyzes the information security risks of each layer, such as security risks at the physical perception layer, network communication layer, application layer, and cloud service layer. In the cloud service layer, starting from the security threats faced by the cloud system, through the study of network traffic analysis technology, network intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment methods, etc.it is proposed to improve the throughput rate of the cloud system by using four-stage fluidization PF_RING processing method when analyzing and evaluating the traffic in the cloud system. The neural network analysis is used to check the security of cloud system, and the best selection algorithm is used to evaluate the security of cloud system. Experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can handle real-time network traffic capture and vulnerability detection in cloud system.

abstract={Nowadays everything is becoming smart and intelligent with the help of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). One of the promising applications of the integration of IoT and AI is smart city. The typical design pattern of smart cities is to install cameras and various sensors as many spots as possible and connect them to data center servers that can make smart decisions based on the inputs from the cameras and sensors. In such structure, network bandwidth may hinder the real-time processing because sensory data should be sent to the servers in the remote location before making any decision. To solve this problem, recent a few studies demonstrated edge computing. In edge computing, IoT devices can handle basic recognition. Thus, only sophisticated inputs that are not handled by IoT devices are sent to remote servers. In this paper, we demonstrate that the edge computing can provide stand-alone processing power for handling one of the fundamental applications of smart city, which is street object detection. Correct detection of various street objects is the core function of traffic systems and public safety applications of smart cities. A convolutional neural network model is developed by training with traffic data captured at California and Nebraska. Our model detects 14 objects with 25% average accuracy on NVIDIA Jetson TX2.},

abstract={In ear of smart cities, intelligent medical image recognition technique has become a promising way to solve remote patient diagnosis in IoMT. Although deep learning-based recognition approaches have received great development during the past decade, explainability always acts as a main obstacle to promote recognition approaches to higher levels. Because it is always hard to clearly grasp internal principles of deep learning models. In contrast, the conventional machine learning (CML)-based methods are well explainable, as they give relatively certain meanings to parameters. Motivated by the above view, this paper combines deep learning with the CML, and proposes a hybrid intelligence-driven medical image recognition framework in IoMT. On the one hand, the convolution neural network is utilized to extract deep and abstract features for initial images. On the other hand, the CML-based techniques are employed to reduce dimensions for extracted features and construct a strong classifier that output recognition results. A real dataset about pathologic myopia is selected to establish simulative scenario, in order to assess the proposed recognition framework. Results reveal that the proposal that improves recognition accuracy about two to three percent.},

abstract={It is commonly assumed that in a smart city there will be thousands of mostly mobile/wireless smart devices (e.g. sensors, smart-phones, etc.) that will continuously generate big amounts of data. Data will have to be collected and processed in order to extract knowledge out of it, to feed users' and smart city applications. A typical approach to process such big amounts of data is to i) gather all the collected data on the cloud through wireless pervasive networks, and ii) perform data analysis operations exploiting machine learning techniques. However, according to many studies, this centralised cloud-based approach may not be sustainable from a networking point of view. The joint effect of data-intensive users' multimedia applications and smart cities monitoring and control applications may result in severe network congestions making applications hardly usable. To cope with this problem, in this paper we propose a distributed machine learning approach that does not require to move data in a centralised cloud platform, but processes it directly where it is collected. Specifically, we exploit Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL) to build a distributed machine learning framework. In our framework we train a series of partial models, each ''residing'' in a location where a subset of the dataset is generated. We then refine the partial models by exchanging them between locations, thus obtaining a unique complete model. Using an activity classification task on a reference dataset as a concrete example, we show that the classification accuracy of the HTL model is comparable with that of a model built out of the complete dataset, but the cost in term of network overhead is dramatically reduced. We then perform a sensitiveness analysis to characterise how the overhead depends on key parameters. It is also worth noticing that the HTL approach is suitable for applications dealing with privacy sensitive data, as data can stay where they are generated, and do not need to be transferred to third parties, i.e., to a cloud provider, to extract knowledge out of it.},

Smart cities operate in real-world time to promote ease and quality of life in urban cities. The network traffic of a smart city via IoT systems is growing exponentially and introducing new cybersecurity challenges since these IoT devices are being connected to sensors that are directly connected to massive cloud servers. In order to mitigate these cyberattacks, the developers need to enhance new techniques for detecting infected IoT devices. In this paper, to address the IoT cybersecurity threats in a smart city, we propose an Anomaly Detection-IoT (AD-IoT) system, which is an intelligent anomaly detection based on Random Forest machine learning algorithm. The proposed solution can effectively detect compromised IoT devices at distributed fog nodes. To evaluate our model, we utilized modern dataset to illustrate the model's accuracy. Our findings show that the AD-IoT can effectively achieve highest classification accuracy of 99.34% with lowest false positive rate.},

In recent years urban cities in India are facing a lot of challenges during the availability of parking areas for their citizens as it has not well organized like assign parking lot at people immediately when it is free, squeeze the parking space according to size of vehicles and many more. In this paper this proposed a model called DCTSPA (Data;Collect;Transmit;Storage;Process;Application) that would be undertaken for the city planner, government and citizen for providing smart parking system in urban cities.

We built ensemble machine learning models to track property ownership variance in Austin, TX, USA. Then, the study employed the long short term memory (LSTM) model as a deep learning approach to forecasting property value in the same area. For model validation, root mean squared errors were calculated in both models. To avoid underfitting or overfitting of LSTM, we experimented with specific parameters settings. Bagging-based random forest machine learning model outperformed other ensemble machine learning models. Regarding property ownership variance, the Random Forest model’s highest feature importance generally comprised the race, age of residents, land use and built environment factors, number of schools, and neighborhood location. Our LSTM model predicted Austin to retain a rising curve in housing prices and identified which part of Austin experiences an increase or decrease in property value. The predictive models may help city planners to quantify and gain insights on future impacts of developing neighborhoods.},

abstract={Demand response management in smart cities is one of the most challenging tasks to be performed due to the continuous changes in the load profile of the home users. The existing proposals in the literature fail to observe the hidden patterns in the load profile of these users. So, to fill these gaps, the concept of deep learning has been used in this paper for smart energy management in a smart city. The consumption data from smart homes (SHs) is gathered and taken as an input to the deep learning model, convolution neural network (CNN). The CNN model learns the hidden patterns in the data and outputs different load curves. These load curves are then used to train a support vector regression (SVR) model, which predicts the overall load consumption of all SHs in the smart city. This prediction is then compared with the power generation from the grid and consequently the demand response (DR) of the connected SHs is managed so as to minimize the gap between predicted demand and supply. The proposed scheme has been evaluated on the dataset collected from PJM and open energy information with respect to load demand prediction and DR management. The results obtained prove the efficacy of the proposed scheme. The prediction errors, i.e., root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error are observed less in comparison to the cases when CNN and SVR are used individually.},

abstract={Deep learning algorithms have recently gained traction in smart cities and societies, such as in healthcare, surveillance, and in a variety of artificial intelligence-based real-life applications. Person detection is a big challenging task in modern computer vision applications. Thus, human appearances can be difficult to judge, as there are major differences in human postures and appearances. This paper discusses the performances of YOLO algorithms, especially YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 for person detection as a tool to enhance the security of public places in smart cities. To evaluate the performances, a challenging dataset called Penn-Fudan is used. Experimental results reveal that YOLOv3 outperforms YOLOv5 in terms of speed. However, YOLOv5 had the best recognition accuracy.},

abstract={Urban issues become more complicated and complex as the city grows, requiring better management to create a comfortable, safe, sustainable, and sustainable city atmosphere. Implementing the concept of smart city is one solution that can be used to perform better management of the city. Many major cities have started the development of smart city, including Makassar. The development of infrastructure to support the implementation of smart city in Makassar has been going on at this time, such as the addition of Wifi Corner in several points of Makassar. The technology that can be applied in supporting smart city infrastructure is wireless sensor network. This research resulted a design of wireless sensor network by utilizing the wireless public infrastructure that has been available in the city of Makassar today. The design is simulated by involving 2 sensor nodes, 1 gateway sensor node, and public wireless network. Each sensor node obtains the environment values, such as temperature, humidity, CO2, and water level. The environment values are sent to the server by the sink node. The process of sending sensor data based on requests from the server automatically and periodically to avoid network congestion on the wireless public network. All data will be displayed to be a decision support for the Government of Makassar City in anticipating the problems of the city, such as traffic congestion and floods. The design of wireless sensor network is expected to become the main infrastructure as a supporting component of smart city in Makassar using public infrastructure. The obtained data from WSN are expected to be processed using artificial intelligence's algorithms to provide the useful information to users using the public infrastructure.},

abstract={Since the world wars, the world has not seen such a heavy and sustained negative impact on the people and economy, as is being caused by the pandemic COVID-19. Pandemic, like any other big change, is strongly disruptive, challenging authorities all over the world to reimagine services, logistics, people movement, and economic activities. For the national and local governments looking for resources to support traditional and novel solutions to mitigate, contain and control the pandemic's deleterious impact on the people and economy, Smart City's Intelligent Transportation System (SC-ITS) can be an important asset. Integration of the transportation advancements with artificial intelligence and information and communication technologies is interactively and dynamically empowering the ITS of Smart Cities. This integration has ushered in an era of smart city intelligent transportation services that are dynamic, adaptive and can be reconfigured to meet the smart city citizenry's changing needs in an inclusive, safe, greener, and more efficient way. We believe that by adapting and, in some cases repurposing the SC-ITS, the authorities can simultaneously increase the reach, impact, and efficacy of the solutions aimed at restarting economies while balancing both lives and livelihood concerns. This paper builds an understanding of the pandemic and then examines the SC-ITS through its components and related applications before diving deeper into the hood to examine how these components, both now and in the future, can be adapted, reconfigured and repurposed, to address the pandemic induced challenges individually and collectively. Finally, it attempts to put a perspective by evaluating the challenges and opportunities inherent in leveraging the ITS for the deployment.},

abstract={The excessive use of digital devices such as cameras and smartphones in smart cities has produced huge data repositories that require automatic tools for efficient browsing, searching, and management. Data prioritization (DP) is a technique that produces a condensed form of the original data by analyzing its contents. Current DP studies are either concerned with data collected through stable capturing devices or focused on prioritization of data of a certain type such as surveillance, sports, or industry. This necessitates the need for DP tools that intelligently and cost-effectively prioritize a large variety of data for detecting abnormal events and hence effectively manage them, thereby making the current smart cities greener. In this article, we first carry out an in-depth investigation of the recent approaches and trends of DP for data of different natures, genres, and domains of two decades in green smart cities. Next, we propose an energy-efficient DP framework by intelligent integration of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics. Experimental evaluation on real-world surveillance data verifies the energy efficiency and applicability of this framework in green smart cities. Finally, this article highlights the key challenges of DP, its future requirements, and propositions for integration into green smart cities.},

abstract={Flow prediction attracts intensive research interests, since it can offer essential support to many crucial problems in public safety and smart city, e.g., epidemic spread prediction and medical resource allocation optimization. Among all the models in flow prediction, deep learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks) are popular and outperform other statistics and machine learning models, since they can learn intrinsic structures and extract features from spatial–temporal (ST) data. However, most of them set strict temporal periods in the prediction or separate the interaction between spatial and temporal correlations. Therefore, the prediction accuracy is affected. To overcome the difficulties, we propose a flow prediction network attentive spatial–temporal convolutional network (ASTCN), which can effectively handle large-scale flow data and learn complex features. In ASTCN, we leverage an attention mechanism to overcome the previous problem of strict temporal periods, and can effectively fuse ST data with multiple factors from different time-series sources. Furthermore, we propose a causal 3-D convolutional layer based on temporal convolutional networks (TCNs). It can simultaneously extract both spatial and temporal features to improve the prediction accuracy. We comprehensively conducted our experiments based on real-world data sets. Experimental results show that ASTCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by at least 3.78% in root mean square error. Therefore, ASTCN is a potential solution to other large-scale ST problems.},

A preliminary study suggests the efficacy of using the framework in monitoring noticeable degradation and aging in large structures in periodically captured images. Our framework is dissimilar to computer vision techniques in which deformation patterns are recognized; instead, our framework is purposed as a long term observation application in which large structures in public video surveillance footage is monitored for changes that may suggest signs of aging or degradation of a structure over a long period of time.

abstract={In the era of big data, the applications/services of the smart city are expected to offer end users better QoE than in a conventional smart city. Nevertheless, various types of sensors will produce an increasing volume of big data along with the implementation of a smart city, where we face redundant and diverse data. Therefore, providing satisfactory QoE will become the major challenge in the big-data-based smart city. In this article, to enhance the QoE, we propose a novel big data architecture consisting of three planes: the data storage plane, the data processing plane, and the data application plane. The data storage plane stores a wide variety of data collected by sensors and originating from different data sources. Then the data processing plane filters, analyzes, and processes the ocean of data to make decisions autonomously for extracting high-quality information. Finally, the application plane initiates the execution of the events corresponding to the decisions delivered from the data processing plane. Under this architecture, we particularly use machine learning techniques, trying to acquire accurate data and deliver precise information to end users. Simulation results indicate that our proposals could achieve high QoE performance for the smart city.},

abstract={With the use of sensor networks and machine learning (ML) techniques in data analysis, the impact of the works for smart cities is getting greater. As a sub-field o f s mart cities, waste management, and related waste transformations study and plan waste collection, disposal, and recycling. Especially, waste to energy transformation composes the major part of waste disposal. Predicting the energy to be obtained from waste and planning the energy supply accordingly depend on estimating the amount of waste and knowing its content. However, energy prediction from solid waste suffers from weak forecasting models, which lead to misguided management strategies in smart cities. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies like low-power, wide-area networking protocol (LoRaWAN) offer new opportunities to collect, monitor, and analyze data in smart cities, including waste management. In this study, we propose the LoRaWAN-aided Waste-to-Energy Concept Model to build the waste-to-energy prediction model with the provided smart city use case using LoRa network as an underlying data collection step. Consequently, we benefit from the pre-trained Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) model whose process details are provided in our previous study, to predict municipal solid waste using daily data along with other relevant variables such as temperature.},

abstract={Intelligent vehicular systems and smart city applications are the fastest growing Internet-of-Things (IoT) implementations at a compound annual growth rate of 30%. In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), the fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.},

Aiming at the current emergency of traffic congestion and road congestion, the present work adds EC to the current vehicle network, and integrates a deep convolution random forest neural network (DCRFNN). Additionally, it implements a model for short-term traffic flow prediction of a 5G vehicle network based on EC and deep learning (DL), and analyzes its performance by simulation. The results reveal that the proposed algorithm has a lower average delay cost, and the average unloading utility is stable at approximately 70%. In the prediction performance analysis, the recognition accuracy of the proposed algorithm reaches 98.06%. It is at least 1.14% higher than that of the advanced convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm proposed by other scholars and achieves a faster convergence rate. Therefore, the constructed short-term traffic prediction model implemented has a high-quality prediction performance while also ensuring a better unloading performance.

Here, the data and the information are shared employing Knowledge Graphs, that are becoming a key enabler for large-scale processing of massive collections of interrelated facts.

Specifically, Knowledge Graphs provide the means of development of the newest methods for data management, data fusion, data merging, and graph and network optimization and modeling, serving as a source of high quality data and a base for information integration.In particular, Knowledge Graphs help to infer new relationships out of existing facts, giving context and meaning to the content, and can be used in applications. For example, the data generated by a computer vision system could be semantically represented and shared across numerous systems, taking into account the needs and requirements of these systems, as well as the context, provenance, licensing and consent aspects of the generated data.

abstract={Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have enabled many existing applications in smart cities, autonomous systems, and wearable devices. These applications often demand scalable real-time cognitive intelligence and on-the-spot decision making. Current computer systems have been customized for a cloud computing paradigm which often does not meet latency constraints and scalability requirements. To address the limitations of the cloud computing paradigm, the general trend is toward shifting the computation next to data producers at the edge. However, the edge computing paradigm is in the very early stages. Many system-level aspects of edge computing, including algorithms mapping and partitioning across edge computing resources (edge server, and edge nodes) are unknown. New research is required to understand and quantify design dimensions for edge computing.This paper presents a novel edge computing infrastructure for distributed real-time video analytics. This paper presents a holistic solution for co-designing application and edge infrastructure, including edge nodes and edge servers, to enable scalable real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Deep Learning (DL) video analytics across many cameras. For experimental results and evaluation, we focus on the case study of object re-identification across many cameras, which is composed of object detection/classification (TinyYOLOv3), feature extraction, local re-identification, and global re-identification kernels. We evaluate the edge system under three different task mapping and resource allocation configurations. The results present that with the edge nodes (video cameras) more than 32, the only scalable solution is to perform detection/classification (TinyYOLOv3), feature extraction, local re-identification on the edge nodes next to cameras, and execute global re-identification on edge server.},

abstract={The digital retina excels at providing enhanced visual sensing and analysis capability for city brain in smart cities, and can feasibly convert the visual data from visual sensors into semantic features. With the deployment of deep learning or handcrafted models, these features are extracted on front-end devices, then delivered to back-end servers for advanced analysis. In this scenario, we propose a model generation, utilization and communication paradigm, aiming at strong front-end sensing capabilities for establishing better artificial visual systems in smart cities. In particular, we propose an integrated multiple deep learning models reuse and prediction strategy, which dramatically increases the feasibility of the digital retina in large-scale visual data analysis in smart cities. The proposed multi-model reuse scheme aims to reuse the knowledge from models cached and transmitted in digital retina to obtain more discriminative capability. To efficiently deliver these newly generated models, a model prediction scheme is further proposed by encoding and reconstructing model differences. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed model-centric paradigm.},

abstract={The smart city landscape is rife with opportunities for mobility and economic optimization, but also presents many security concerns spanning the range of components and systems in the smart ecosystem. One key enabler for this ecosystem is smart transportation and transit, which is foundationally built upon connected vehicles. Ensuring vehicular security, while necessary to guarantee passenger and pedestrian safety, is itself challenging due to the broad attack surfaces of modern automotive systems. A single car contains dozens to hundreds of small embedded computing devices known as electronic control units (ECUs) executing hundreds of millions of lines of code; the inherent complexity of this tightly integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the key problems that frustrate effective security. We describe an approach to help reduce the complexity of security analyses by leveraging unsupervised machine learning to learn clusters of messages passed between ECUs that correlate with changes in the CPS state of a vehicle as it moves throughout the world. Our approach can help to improve the security of vehicles in a smart city, and can leverage smart city infrastructure to further enrich and refine the quality of the machine learning output.},

abstract={Many countries and organizations have proposed smart city projects to address the exponential growth of the population by promoting and developing a new paradigm for maximizing electricity demand in cities. Since Internet of Things (IoT)-based systems are extensively used in smart cities where huge amounts of data are generated and distributed, it could be challenging to directly capture data from a composite environment and to offer precise control behavior in response. Proper scheduling of numerous energy devices to meet the need of users is a demand of the smart city. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an emerging methodology that can yield successful control behavior for time-variant dynamic systems. This article proposes an efficient DRL-based energy scheduling approach that can effectively distribute the energy devices based on consumption and users' demand. First, a deep neural network classifies the energy devices currently available in a framework. The DRL then efficiently schedules the devices. Edge-cloud-coordinated DRL is shown to reduce the delay and cost of smart grid energy distribution.},

However, it becomes increasingly complicated to design routing strategies to meet the stringent and ever changing network requirements due to the dynamic distribution of the crowd in different sectors of smart cities. To alleviate the network congestion and balance the network load for supporting smart city services with dramatic disparities, we design a deep-reinforcement- learning-based smart routing algorithm to make the distributed computing and communication infrastructure thoroughly viable while simultaneously satisfying the latency constraints of service requests from the crowd. Besides the proposed algorithm, extensive numerical results are also presented to validate its efficacy.},

abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Artificial Intelligence revived in the last decade. The need for progress, the growing processing capacity and the low cost of the Cloud have facilitated the development of new, powerful algorithms. The efficiency of these algorithms in Big Data processing, Deep Learning and Convolutional Networks is transforming the way we work and is opening new horizons. Thanks to them, we can now analyse data and obtain unimaginable solutions to today’s problems. Nevertheless, our success is not entirely based on algorithms, it also comes from our ability to follow our “gut” when choosing the best combination of algorithms for an intelligent artefact. It’s about approaching engineering with a lot of knowledge and tact. This involves the use of both connectionist and symbolic systems, and of having a full understanding of the algorithms used. Moreover, to address today’s problems we must work with both historical and real-time data. We must fully comprehend the problem, its time evolution, as well as the relevance and implications of each piece of data, etc. It is also important to consider development time, costs and the ability to create systems that will interact with their environment, will connect with the objects that surround them and will manage the data they obtain in a reliable manner. In this keynote, the evolution of intelligent computer systems will be examined. The need for human capital will be emphasised, as well as the need to follow one’s “gut instinct” in problem-solving. We will look at the benefits of combining information and knowledge to solve complex problems and will examine how knowledge engineering facilitates the integration of different algorithms. Furthermore, we will analyse the importance of complementary technologies such as IoT and Blockchain in the development of intelligent systems. It will be shown how tools like “Deep Intelligence” make it possible to create computer systems efficiently and effectively. “Smart” infrastructures need to incorporate all added-value resources so they can offer useful services to the society, while reducing costs, ensuring reliability and improving the quality of life of the citizens. The combination of AI with IoT and with blockchain offers a world of possibilities and opportunities. The use of edge platforms or fog computing helps increase efficiency, reduce network latency, improve security and bring intelligence to the edge of the network; close to the sensors, users and to the medium used. This keynote will present success stories regarding specially smart cities. All these fields require the development of interactive, reliable and secure systems which we are capable of building thanks to current advances. Deepint.net, a tool developed by DCSc and BISITE will be presented. Several use cases of intelligent systems will be presented and it will be analysed how the different processes have been optimized by means of tools that facilitate decision-making.},

abstract={Given the escalating population across the globe, it has become paramount to construct smart cities, aiming for improving the management of urban flows relying on efficient information and communication technologies (ICT). Vehicular sensing networks (VSNs) play a critical role in maintaining the efficient operation of smart cities. Naturally, there are numerous challenges to be solved before the wide-spread introduction of VSNs, including the conception of an accurate topological analysis method and a beneficial cooperation mechanism during the process of city-wide information sharing. Hence, in this article, we construct a VSN-aided smart city model and appraise a range of intelligent applications in terms of both public services and urban flow management. Then, the information source selection algorithm of a complex network and a reinforcement learning based city information sharing mechanism are considered, complemented by a range of open challenges.},

The visual devices in smart cities produce large amount of real-time visual data, which challenges the ability of current transmission architecture in Cloud computing. We address how to improve the utilization of both computation and transmission resources for visual data processing through introducing the Fog computing technologies. We propose to use deep learning models and salient zones extraction method to decrease the data amount as well as maintaining important features of visual data. Furthermore, we develop how to arrange Fog nodes reasonably according to the location of the end devices and the data produced from the devices. Simulation results on public video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 48.85% in term of SSIM higher than that of HEVC. The proposed approach decreases the delay by around 75.93% than the traditional transmission without Fog nodes. The proposed method achieves a high compression ratio and guarantees the quality of the video.},

abstract={Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is promising to alleviate the computation and storage burdens for terminals in wireless networks. The huge energy consumption of MEC servers challenges the establishment of smart cities and their service time powered by rechargeable batteries. In addition, Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) technique cannot utilize limited spectrum resources fully and efficiently. Therefore, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-based energy-efficient task scheduling among MEC servers for delay-constraint mobile applications is important, especially in highly-dynamic vehicular edge computing networks. The various movement patterns of vehicles lead to unbalanced offloading requirements and different load pressure for MEC servers. Self-Imitation Learning (SIL)-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising machine learning technique to break through obstacles in various research fields, especially in time-varying networks. In this paper, we first introduce related MEC technologies in vehicular networks. Then, we propose an energy-efficient approach for task scheduling in vehicular edge computing networks based on DRL, with the purpose of both guaranteeing the task latency requirement for multiple users and minimizing total energy consumption of MEC servers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods.},

abstract={As smart cities evolve, artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly be used to manage decisions for how cities operate. For everything from incarceration sentencing, city pension appropriation, surveillance and infrastructure management, AI will play a role. The author argues that implementing AI for a smart city should be decided similarly to how cities decide on major infrastructural planning projects. For both, there are social and ethical implications of deployment. A protocol is proposed for smart city AI so that AI can be seen as an ethical and trustworthy city asset rather than an adversary fraught with controversy and bias. This is achieved through participatory AI - the marriage of a fully transparent data architecture, such as the blockchain, and the urban planning practice of participatory planning. The diversity of opinions that participatory AI affords enables cities to facilitate socially responsible AI outcomes.},

abstract={The idea of big data has gained extensive attention from governments and academia all over the world. It is especially relevant for the establishment of a smart city environment combining complex heterogeneous data with data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Big data is generated from many facilities and sensor networks in smart cities and often streamed and stored in the cloud storage platform. Ensuring the integrity and subsequent auditability of such big data is essential for the performance of AI-driven data analysis. Recent years has witnessed the emergence of many big data auditing schemes that are often characterized by third party auditors (TPAs). However, the TPA is a centralized entity, which is vulnerable to many security threats from both inside and outside the cloud. To avoid this centralized dependency, we propose a decentralized big data auditing scheme for smart city environments featuring blockchain capabilities supporting improved reliability and stability without the need for a centralized TPA in auditing schemes. To support this, we have designed an optimized blockchain instantiation and conducted a comprehensive comparison between the existing schemes and the proposed scheme through both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation. The comparison shows that lower communication and computation costs are incurred with our scheme than with existing schemes.},

abstract={Smart cities in the recent times follow transformation due to various factors like growth, population, advancement, awareness etc however these transformations should go in sync with the evolution in technology. Therefore, an unstoppable process of endless and effortless reinvention must be set in motion. Technology is a boon for reinventions & advancements like R&D in artificial intelligence, nano- and bio-technologies, virtual reality, are beginning to provide exciting solutions. Smart Materials are the core building block of a smart building and thus an integral part to build a smart city. Wall facades are often neglected for their inactive behavior in the surroundings, however they make a space functional and are a significant element of a building. Advanced and responsive (Smart) materials can be used to build smart wall facades for our buildings from both exterior and interior perspective. A detail study of three smart and intelligent materials applied on walls in the interior and the exterior facades of buildings has been done. This research investigates the role and functions of materials in creating smart buildings and their contribution to creating better interior spaces and better living experiences and will help to reduce the ecological impact to a greater scale in smart cities by reduced energy consumptions and pollution emission during their applications.},

By using hybrid sensors, the traffic light systems can be triggered depending on the measured volume of traffic, including temporary deactivation of the traffic lights when roads are quiet. The traffic data collected with the hybrid technology is then used to analyse and control traffic volumes. The radar technology for traffic monitoring applications include traffic light controls, speed enforcement, traffic monitoring and traffic classification. Therefore, this proposal suggests exploring design and prototype model and utilize the model for appropriate road traffic monitoring and management system. The objectives of the proposed system are to reduce traffic congestion, to count traffic flow, to classify the traffic, to provide green environment by reducing air-pollution generated by vehicles, to provide safety for stakeholders (pedestrians and driver and passengers) and to forecast traffic flow.},

abstract={Due to the flexible mobility and agility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be deployed as aerial base stations (BSs) in future air-ground integrated wireless networks, providing temporary and controllable coverage and additional computation capabilities for ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices with or without infrastructure support. Meanwhile, with the breakthrough of artificial intelligence (AI), more and more AI applications relying on AI methods such as deep neural networks (DNNs) are expected to be applied in various fields such as smart homes, smart factories and smart cities to improve our lifestyles and efficiency dramatically. However, AI applications are generally computation-intensive, latency-sensitive, and energy-consuming, making resource-constrained IoT devices unable to benefit from AI anytime and anywhere. In this paper, we study mobile edge computing (MEC) for AI applications in air-ground integrated wireless networks. Our goal is to minimize the service latency while ensuring the learning accuracy requirements and energy consumption. To achieve that, we take DNN as the typical AI application and formulate an optimization problem that optimizes the DNN model decision, computation and communication resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control, subject to the energy consumption, latency, computation and communication resource constraints. Considering the formulated problem is non-convex, we decompose it into multiple convex subproblems and then alternately solve them till they converge to the desired solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the system performance for AI applications.},

As we step into the era where ”data is termed as new oil”, there is a need for protocols with support for selling and buying data without giving up the data ownership to third-parties. In this demo, we present Streaming Data Payment Protocol (SDPP), which is an application layer protocol for selling and buying data. SDPP uses blockchain and distributed ledger technology for micropayments and immutable storage of transaction records. In addition, our protocol has a built-in mechanism to set data granularity since the bulk transfer of data between a seller and a buyer may lead to a loss for the seller if the buyer terminates the connection after receiving the data without making a payment. In this demo, we present SDPP and explain how it can contribute to the emerging data economy using a proof-of-concept implementation that uses TCP protocol for data communication and IOTA as both cryptocurrency and a distributed ledger.},

In this technology driven society there is a need of creation of a system to automate the process of irrigation of crops to help farmers.

We focus of creating a device with Arduino along with some sensors and modules to collect these data at different places in farm. After collecting this data this device will send this data to server with the help of a Wi-Fi module attached to the device.

IN next step a comparison of the extracted parameters is made with the templates in order to recognize the incoming command. The command recognition is achieved with a specifically developed voting based classifier. The classification algorithm is described. A method to characterize the developed classifier is also discussed. On the detection of a command the embedded controller is piloted by a specific flag.

abstract={Supply chain management (SCM) is a significant and complex system in smart city that requires advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and optimization techniques. The multiobjective supply chain configuration (MOSCC) in SCM is to set the optimal configurations for supply chain members to minimize both the cost of goods sold (CoGS) and the lead time (LT). Although some algorithms have been proposed for the MOSCC, they do not make the best use of the problem-related knowledge and cannot perform well on the large scale instances with many members and configuration options. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-population ant colony system with knowledge-based local searches (MPACS-KLS). Firstly, the multiobjective algorithm is based on the multiple populations for multiple objectives framework. Two ant colonies are used to separately minimize CoGS and LT, which helps to search in the bi-objective space sufficiently. Secondly, with the considerations of the problem-related knowledge, a priority-based solution construction method, a rank-based heuristic strategy, and an objective-oriented global pheromone updating strategy are proposed. Thirdly, to speed up the convergence, especially for large scale MOSCC instances, two knowledge-based local searches are designed to minimize CoGS and LT of solutions respectively. Exhaustive experiments are conducted on both the instances from the real life and the randomly generated instances with different problem scales. The results show that MPACS-KLS is superior to the contestant algorithms, especially on the large scale MOSCC instances, which significantly extends the AI and optimization techniques in practical applications of smart city.},

abstract={Governments around the world are actively pursuing research on smart cities as an attempt to pursue the city's sophistication and sustainability. In order to create a smart city, it is important to reduce energy and manage it efficiently. With the development of smart city, it is expected that a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will be installed in various buildings in the city, and a lot of energy usage information will be measured. When many IoT devices are connected to the internet, a large amount of data is generated. Therefore, when the existing cloud service is used, data is delayed in analyzing and transmitting data, and it becomes impossible to receive the analysis result quickly. With edge computing, you can process data directly in the edge environment where data is collected and apply the results quickly to the field. It can respond to data much faster than it can deliver data and wait for the results to be analyzed and reduce the load on the data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a system for predicting energy consumption using a deep learning (DL) algorithm in an edge computing environment. We have applied the proposed system to office environment by building testbed. We used the long short-term memory (LSTM) network which shows high accuracy in time series data analysis and obtained the energy prediction result per day. We check the state of the electronics through the energy consumption prediction data, detect the abnormality and provide the energy consumption pattern analysis service respectively.},

abstract={The next era of computing is the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Cities with development of the Internet of Simulation (IoS). The existing technologies of Cloud, Edge, and Fog computing as well as HPC being applied to the domains of Big Data and deep learning are not adequate to handle the scale and complexity of the systems required to facilitate a fully integrated and automated smart city. This integration of existing systems will create an explosion of data streams at a scale not yet experienced. The additional data can be combined with simulations as services (SIMaaS) to provide a shared model of reality across all integrated systems, things, devices, and individuals within the city. There are also numerous challenges in managing the security and safety of the integrated systems. This paper presents an overview of the existing state-of-the-art in automating, augmenting, and integrating systems across the domains of smart cities, autonomous vehicles, energy efficiency, smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0, and healthcare. Additionally the key challenges relating to Big Data, a model of reality, augmentation of systems, computation, and security are examined.},

abstract={Today's existing smart city research involves many overtly futuristic applications such as smart transportation, in which smart roads warn drivers of bad traffic conditions ahead, smart parking, which communicates the location of unoccupied parking spaces to drivers, and smart environment, which enables fully automated homes and workplaces to adjust their temperature to conserve energy. The realization of these applications hinges on a data acquisition structure that gathers its data from a countless number of sensors, either deployed for predefined tasks (hard sensing) or built into the mobile devices of smart city residents (soft sensing). At the core of this big data infrastructure lie the 5Vs: veracity, volume, velocity, variety, and value. The soft sensing component of a smart city sensing network is particularly affected by 3Vs: veracity, volume, and velocity. To address the unique challenges of big data, recommender systems, statistical reputation systems, and context analysis are used to ensure the veracity of acquired data, machine learning algorithms are applied to handle the data volume, and data analytics algorithms are implemented to manage data velocity. Despite its seemingly insurmountable size, the acquired data is highly redundant, and systematic use of machine intelligence and data analytics can facilitate processing by extracting only the relevant information; in this article, we study the role of these algorithms through the lens of the 3Vs in facilitating soft sensing within the framework of smart city applications.},

abstract={Most of the commercial navigation products provide route planning service for users. However, they only consider a single metric such as distance, time, or other costs, while ignoring a critical criterion: safety. In a smart city, people may prefer to find a safe walking route to avoid the potential crime risk as well as obtain a short distance. This problem can be specified as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). Many methods were proposed in the past to solve the multi-objective route planning, the multi-objective evolutionary approach (MOEA) is considered as the most popular one. However, MOEA is non-optimized when used in a large-scale road network and becomes computationally expensive when handling a large population size. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective hyper-heuristic (MOHH) framework for walking route planning in a smart city. In the search framework, we design a set of low level heuristics to generate new routes. Moreover, we adopt reinforcement learning mechanism to select good low-level heuristics to accelerate searching speed. We further improve the reinforcement learning-based multi-objective hyper-heuristic (RL-MOHH) algorithm and implement a parallel version (RL-PMOHH) on general purpose graphic process unit. Extensive experiments are conducted on the safety-index map constructed from the historical urban data of the New York city. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed RL-PMOHH is almost 173, 5.3, and 3.1 times faster than the exact multi-objective optimization algorithm, the RL-MOHH algorithm, and the parallel NSGA-II algorithm, respectively. Moreover, both RL-MOHH and RL-PMOHH can obtain more than 80% Pareto optimal solutions in a large-scale road network.},

abstract={Air and noise pollution are two major factors that determine the quality of life of the people living in cities. The prime reasons for the rise of air and noise pollution are due to imbalanced urbanization, unregulated increase in traffic and inorganic industrialization. These have resulted in compromising the well-being of the citizens. In this context, the concept of smart cities has been developed. They inherently have the ability to sense and respond to the challenges which characterizes regular cities with the help of embedded intelligence. It has become important to monitor the environmental parameters for policy-making, planning and for making smart cities livable and sustainable. In a bid to make a smart city, in this work, we have studied the spatio-temporal relationship between air and noise pollution in four different locations and have also evaluated the effect of noise in predicting Air Quality(AQ). Data acquisition has been done using customized, self-developed CO_2; NO_2; PM2:5, humidity, temperature and intensity of noise. To determine the relationship between air and noise pollution, we have used Pearson correlation. Results show a strong association between the two types of pollution. For predicting the air quality, the impact of noise pollution as a feature has been investigated using three different machine learning models which are Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors. When applicable, the results show that if noise pollution is used as a feature, we get a prediction accuracy of upto 95% which is an improvement of 5% on an average},

abstract={The threat of incendiary and often, catstrophical terrorist attacks is a major challenge for the urban administrators. The urban landscape is changing at a fast pace with the emphasis moving toward “smart cities”. Terrorists, for obvious reasons, prefer attacking cities compared to rural areas. Smart cities are expected to absorb larger populations of inhabitants in smaller area implying the damage inflicted by these attacks would be maximum unless some preventive mechanisms exist in the smart city ecosystem. There exist very few methodologies for attack forecasting due to lack of real-time data (confidentiality and reluctance of law enforement in sharing data). In this paper, we propose a way to predict future attacks, weapons used and likely targets using a class of powerful machine learning algorithms known as ensemble learning. The features used to train the model are location, attack type, weapon type and target type.},

abstract={Processing data generated at high volume and speed from the Internet of Things, smart cities, domotic, intelligent surveillance, and e-healthcare systems require efficient data processing and analytics services at the Edge to reduce the latency and response time of the applications. The Fog Computing Edge infrastructure consists of devices with limited computing, memory, and bandwidth resources, which challenge the construction of predictive analytics solutions that require resource-intensive tasks for training machine learning models. In this work, we focus on the development of predictive analytics for urban traffic. Our solution is based on deep learning techniques localized in the Edge, where computing devices have very limited computational resources. We present an innovative method for efficiently training of Gated Recurrent-Units (GRUs) across available resource-constrained CPU and GPU Edge devices. Our solution employs distributed GRU model learning and dynamically stops the training process to utilize the low-power and resource-constrained Edge devices while ensuring good estimation accuracy effectively. The proposed solution was extensively evaluated using low-powered ARM-based devices, including Raspberry Pi v3 and the low-powered GPU-enabled device NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and also compared them with Single-CPU Intel Xeon machines. For the evaluation experiments, we used real-world Floating Car Data. The experiments show that the proposed solution delivers excellent prediction accuracy and computational performance on the Edge when compared with the baseline methods.},

abstract={The success in transitioning towards smart cities relies on the availability of information and communication technologies that meet the demands of this transformation. The terrestrial infrastructure presents itself as a preeminent component in this change. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to become an integral component of future smart cities that provide seamless coverage for vehicles on highways with poor cellular infrastructure. Motivated by the above, in this paper, we introduce UAVs cell-free network for providing coverage to vehicles entering a highway that is not covered by other infrastructure. However, UAVs have limited energy resources and cannot serve the entire highway all the time. Furthermore, the deployed UAVs have insufficient knowledge about the environment (e.g., the vehicles' instantaneous location). Therefore, it is challenging to control a swarm of UAVs to achieve efficient communication coverage. To address these challenges, we formulate the trajectories decisions making as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the system state space considers the vehicular network dynamics. Then, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to propose an approach for learning the optimal trajectories of the deployed UAVs to efficiently maximize the vehicular coverage, where we adopt Actor-Critic algorithm to learn the vehicular environment and its dynamics to handle the complex continuous action space. Finally, simulations results are provided to verify our findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show that during the mission time, the deployed UAVs adapt their velocities in order to cover the vehicles.},

abstract={The growing popularity and penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) bring in challenges and opportunities to the power grid. They represent a huge aggregate electricity consumption from the city power grid, while it is possible to make use of their batteries for supporting vehicle-to-grid (V2G) regulation service. Besides, there is a need to coordinate a collection of EVs in an intelligent manner through the smart transportation system in a smart city. In this paper, we propose a novel smart cross-system framework to support V2G regulation service in a smart city. Specifically, by considering electric buses (EBs) as a particular group of EVs with large battery packs installed and predictable operation schedules, we jointly solve the problems of EB allocation and scheduling with V2G regulation service. First of all, by using the deep learning approach, the short-term city traffic conditions can be predicted via the gated recurrent units (GRUs) neural network. With the predicted traffic conditions, we then formulate the EB allocation and V2G scheduling as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. In order to solve this problem effectively, we utilize the Lagrangian dual decomposition method to decouple the main problem into subproblems for EBs and devise a distributed algorithm to solve each subproblem. The simulation results show that our proposed approach is effective in EB allocation and V2G scheduling for the regulation service. Through efficient EB routing strategies under accurate predicted traffic conditions, the power fluctuations of the city power grid can be well flatten by providing the V2G regulation service.},

abstract={With the rapid development of technologies such as mobile payment, deep learning, and cloud computing, the transformation of traditional retail models has become possible. Research on deep learning algorithms has become a hot direction in computer vision. Deep learning techniques have been widely used in face recognition, intelligent transport system, smart city, etc. At present, smart unmanned vending machines (UVMs) are of one of the representative carriers of unmanned retail business models. Compared with traditional vending machines, they have greatly improved user experience and saved implementation costs. One core issue of smart UVMs is how to quickly and accurately identify which and what kind of items a user is taking. In this paper, deep learning is used to solve the problem of object recognition in smart UVMs. To accurately obtain the information of products that a user may take from a UVM, an object detection-based method is used. Specifically, an object detection model, namely DrtNet, is proposed and designed under the smart UVM scenario. The backbone network of DrtNet adopts deformable convolution and group normalization layers. The used loss function contains focal loss function and balance Ll loss function, which can largely improve the recall rate of beverage detection. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the deep learning model to smart UVMs.},

abstract={According to the current unprecedented pandemic, we realise that we cannot respond to every contagion novel virus as fast as possible, either by vaccination or medication. Therefore, it is paramount for the sustainable development of antiviral urban ecosystems to promote early detection, control, and prevention of an outbreak. The structure of an antivirus-based multi-generational smart-city framework could be crucial to a post-COVID-19 urban environment. Humanitarian efforts in the pandemic's framework deployed novel technological solutions based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI). We aim to contribute by improving real-time detection using data mining in collaboration with machine learning techniques through our research work. Initially, for detection, we propose an innovative system that could detect in real-time virus propagation based on the density of the airborne COVID-19 molecules-the proposal based on the detection through the isothermal amplification RT-Lamp [1]. We also propose real-time detection by spark-induced plasma spectroscopy during the internal airborne transmission process [17]. The novelty of this research work, called characteristic subset selection, is based on identifying irrelevant data. By deducting the unrelated information dimension, machine learning algorithms would operate more efficiently. Therefore, it optimises data mining and classification in high-dimensional medical data analysis, particularly in effectively detecting COVID-19. It can play an essential role in providing timely detection with critical attributes and high accuracy. We elaborate the teaching-learning method optimisation to achieve the optimal set of features for the detection.},

abstract={Sustainable development of smart cities is a new trend of urban development in the world. The regional development of urban agglomerations is not balanced, which makes it difficult to achieve sustainable development of smart cities. The railway network plays an important role in building bridges between cities. In this paper, the emerging big data and deep learning methods are used to conduct in-depth analysis on the distribution data of enterprises in the Yangtze River Delta region during the past 40 years. What’s more, the connection and influence of railway development on urban agglomerations and among cities was explored. Such technologies as data capture, analysis, modeling and prediction can also be used for the sustainable development of other smart cities.},

abstract={This article investigates the distributed fault-tolerant time-varying formation control problem for multiple unmanned airships (UAs) against limited communication ranges and input saturation to achieve the safe observation of a smart city. To address the strongly nonlinear functions caused by the time-varying formation flight with limited communication ranges and bias faults, intelligent adaptive learning mechanisms are proposed by incorporating fuzzy neural networks. Moreover, Nussbaum functions are introduced to handle the input saturation and loss-of-effectiveness faults. The distinct features of the proposed control scheme are that time-varying formation flight, actuator faults including bias and loss-of-effectiveness faults, limited communication ranges, and input saturation are simultaneously considered. It is proven by Lyapunov stability analysis that all UAs can achieve a safe formation flight for the smart city observation even in the presence of actuator faults. Hardware-in-the-loop experiments with open-source Pixhawk autopilots are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract={Power grids are transforming into flexible, smart, and cooperative systems with greater dissemination of distributed energy resources, advanced metering infrastructure, and advanced communication technologies. Short-term electric load forecasting for individual residential customers plays a progressively crucial role in the operation and planning of future grids. Compared to the aggregated electrical load at the community level, the prediction of individual household electric loads is legitimately challenging because of the high uncertainty and volatility involved. Results from previous studies show that prediction using machine learning and deep learning models is far from accurate, and there is still room for improvement. We herein propose a deep learning framework based on a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model uses CNN layers for feature extraction from the input data with LSTM layers for sequence learning. The performance of our developed framework is comprehensively compared to state-of-the-art systems currently in use for short-term individual household electric load forecasting. The proposed model achieved significantly better results compared to other competing techniques. We evaluated our proposed model with the recently explored LSTM-based deep learning model on a publicly available electrical load data of individual household customers from the Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) project. We obtained an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 40.38% for individual household electric load forecasts in comparison with the LSTM-based model that obtained an average MAPE of 44.06%. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed model on different time horizons (up to 3 h ahead). Compared to the recently developed LSTM-based model tested on the same dataset, we obtained 4.01%, 4.76%, and 5.98% improvement for one, two, and six look-forward time steps, respectively (with 2 lookback time steps). Additionally, we have performed clustering analysis based on the power consumption behavior of the energy users, which indicate that prediction accuracy could be improved by grouping and training the representative model using large amount of data. The results indicated that the proposed model outperforms the LSTM-based model for both 1 h ahead and 3 h ahead in forecasting individual household electric loads.},

abstract={With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and 5G technology, the development process of smart city has been greatly accelerated. An important part of the development of smart city is to improve the ability of video monitoring equipment to analyze the content of the video. This paper is to identify the specific abnormal behaviors in the video, including climbing, fighting and falling. The identification of these abnormal behaviors is helpful to find out the danger in time and intervene to ensure personal safety and social stability. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning method based on edge extraction. In the first step, the video is decomposed into several frames, and the canny edge detection algorithm is used to extract the edge of the images. In the second step, the extracted edge information is used as the input of the 3D convolutional neural network, and the 3D convolutional neural network model is trained iteratively to recognize the abnormal behaviors. Through a large number of experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified.},
