abstract={Estimation of energy efficiency is one of the major issues in smart city planning. Although, there are some papers about estimation of energy efficiency of the buildings, there is still a requirement of an effective method that can be used in all climatic zones. Therefore, extreme learning method (ELM), which is a training method for single hidden layer neural network, was employed in the dataset that contains the properties of buildings such as shape, area and height and cooling and heating loads were calculated. Achieved results by ELM were compared with the results in the literature and the results obtained by some popular machine learning methods such as artificial neural network, linear regression, and etc. Obtained results by ELM found acceptable.},

abstract={Complex Event Process (CEP) is very essential in Semantic Web of Things (SWoT) that deploy a large number of sensor devices, like smart traffic and smart city. CEP mainly solves heterogenous problems of stream data processing, where streaming data is connected to internet by a mass of wireless sensor devices. The core work of CEP is rule updating. Existing researches of rule updating are designed for static environments, and it is quite laborious to transplant those rules for dynamic environments. To enhance the portability of event rules, a method of automatic rule updating based on machine learning is proposed to learn the rules of a dynamic environment. Experimental results reveal that the proposed methods are effective and efficient.},

abstract={The application of information and communications technology to support urban operational decision makers has received vast interest from industry and academia. This has helped to mature several fields of research within the smart city domain, such as the internet of things, cybernetics, and informatics. However, these fields of research remain siloed, which leads to a clear gap in the literature. The paper recognizes the mentioned gap manifesting in a new smart urban area in Wales, UK, and presents a platform which intends to demonstrate the benefits of exploiting the synergies between these fields of research. Following consultation with various stakeholders at the pilot site, the platform utilizes advanced sensing, analytics, interoperability, and visualization components to provide valuable human-machine interactions to facility managers in the district. Delivering this high value knowledge in a timely, engaging, and accessible manner through advanced decision support interfaces. The paper presents the platform's software architecture, before discussing the decision support interface, intelligent web services, and interoperability components in more detail. The solution's key contributions beyond existing internet of things platforms are the use of a 3D game engine, machine learning and optimization web services, and the integration across the knowledge value chain. This knowledge integration is achieved through semantic modelling of the buildings, urban environment, socio-technical systems, and smart devices in the district.},

abstract={Nowadays, urban mobility plays an important role in modern cities for city planning, navigation, and other mobility services. Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).},

abstract={As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications increases, the capacity of the IoT access networks is considerably stressed. This can create significant performance bottlenecks in various layers of an end-to-end communication path, including the scheduling of the spectrum, the resource requirements for processing the IoT data at the Edge and/or Cloud, and the attainable delay for critical emergency scenarios. Thus, it is required to classify or predict the time varying traffic characteristics of the IoT devices. However, this classification remains at large an open challenge. Most of the existing solutions are based on machine learning techniques, which nonetheless present high computational cost while non considering the fine-grained flow characteristics. To this end, in this paper we design a two-stage classification framework that utilizes both the network and statistical features to characterize the IoT devices in the context of a smart city. We firstly perform the data cleaning and preprocessing of the data and then analyze the dataset to extract the network and statistical features set for different types of IoT devices. The evaluation results show that the proposed classification can achieve 99% accuracy as compared to other techniques with Mathews Correlation Coefficient of 0.96.},

abstract={Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon networks are a popular infrastructure for IoT and smart city applications due to their scalability and affordability, as well as the proliferation of Bluetooth-enabled devices. However, BLE beacon networks suffer from short battery lifetime, inducing additional maintenance costs. Previous works have tackled this problem by proposing a more energy-efficient BLE beacon firmware that will change its operating configuration based on user existence information. However, previous efforts could not adapt to varying user traffic conditions and therefore was impractical. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel neural network-driven framework, User-P, that extends beacon lifetime by changing its operating configuration by predicting user traffic conditions. Furthermore, the paper also presents a novel machine learning method tailored for user traffic prediction. Last but not least, the effectiveness of the proposed framework and methods are proven through a set of simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can extend the beacon lifetime by 180% in comparison to that of the state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract={Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is a principal part of smart city, and traffic status evaluation is an essential role in intelligent transportation management. Nowadays, a number of models and algorithms based on traffic flow theories and machine learning were applied to evaluate the traffic status. However, the evaluation results of the two types of methods either take high computational cost or will be easily affected by noise. To overcome these drawbacks, a new traffic status evaluation model based on possibilistic fuzzy c-means (PFCM) is proposed in this paper. The dataset from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) is used in experiments. The PFCM algorithm is compared with fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm to validate its accuracy and anti-noise capabilities. Experiment results show that the proposed model can evaluate traffic status more efficiently.},

abstract={Urban areas host more than 50% of the world's populations, are responsible for 75% of energy consumption in the world, and they emit almost 80% of global carbon dioxide. There is an urgent need to develop "low carbon" cities that are smart and efficient and use renewable energy to foster the growth of the green economy. Smart grids are being developed to tackle these challenges through integration of renewable and green energy as well as energy efficiency. They are moving toward a concept of networked microgrids. Microgrids will enable the integration of distributed renewable energy such as roof top solar panels within smart city communities. For these microgrids to operate reliably and efficiently, prediction algorithms are a significant because of the fluctuation of solar energy and its dependence on weather. Prediction of energy is a component of microgrids energy management systems to optimize their operation. This paper presents a machine learning based algorithm, which learns a regression tree model with time of the day and humidity as main parameters. The regression tree model presents a promising accuracy. This work shows that solar panel prediction in Houston is heavily dependent on humidity of the region.},

abstract={“Smart city” is one of the concepts within which modern scientific and technical areas are actively developing. This concept defines the tasks associated with the organization of various infrastructure objects' continuous monitoring to optimally divide resources and ensure security. One of these tasks is to ensure road safety involving autonomous vehicles. The solution to this problem involves various technologies, including computer vision technologies. One of the approaches in this area is based on machine learning methods. These methods consider objects models in images represented as attribute vectors. Boundary attributes are often used here. The formation of these attribute comes down to two steps the boundaries detection and their description in the form of descriptors. This paper describes an approach to the objects' boundaries detection in images in intelligent systems of autonomous vehicles, which is based on the use of wavelet transform. The method is based on determining the significance of the brightness change magnitude at some point at a certain level of the wavelet decomposition. For that, it is necessary to evaluate the contribution to the total image energy of the detailed coefficients corresponding to this point. The method determines the sequential refinement of boundaries, which is as follows: as the brightnesses of the original image's copies at different levels are interconnected, we assume that the boundary points at different levels correspond to each other. The proposed method is simple to implement, has a relatively high speed and the ability to flexibly configure for real operating conditions.},

Instead, a hybrid of feature detection and region matching approach is suggested in this article, which helps in estimating vehicle trajectory over consequent frames. Later, the tracked path is monitored for the occurrence of any specific event while the vehicle passes through an intersection. The proposed scheme is found to work promisingly on the real world dataset and is able to detect the occurrence of an accident between two vehicles.},

It promotes the idea of a bus shelter and connected buses. The former is equipped with IoT technologies like smart lights and information kiosk, for the benefit of both stakeholders and commuters. The latter deals with bus schedule information wherein the passengers are made aware of the bus schedule, thereby minimizing the waiting time in the shelter which in turn will lead to the minimization of the crowd density in shelters and as well as buses. The bus shelter is equipped with Zigbee Receiver, Raspberry Pi and other IoT modules which sends data to a cloud periodically. The data is then analysed against the bus schedule for the ease of operations in real-time. Machine learning (ML) algorithm is applied to predict the crowd density well in advance. In addition to all this, an android mobile application and a website have been developed for educating the commuters on bus information and crowd density and help them plan their travel accordingly.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used in many smart city sectors, where a huge amount of data is gathered from various (IoT) devices. As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts. Extensive experiments demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={The diffusion of the Internet of Things paradigm, in the last few years, has led to the need of deploying and managing large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), composed by a multitude of geographically distributed sensors, like the ones needed for Smart City applications. The traditional way to manage WSNs is not suitable for this type of applications, because manually managing and monitoring every single sensor would be too expensive, time consuming and error prone. Moreover, unattended sensors may suffer of several issues that progressively make their measures unreliable and consequently useless. For this reason, several automatically techniques have been studied and implemented for the detection and correction of measurements from sensors which are affected by errors caused by aging and/or drift. These methods are grouped under the name of self-calibration techniques. This paper presents a distributed system, which combines an incremental machine learning technique with a non-linear Kalman Filter estimator, which allows to automatically re-calibrate sensors leveraging the correlation with measurements made by neighbor sensors. After the description of the used model and the system implementation details, the paper describes also the proof-of-concept prototype that has been built for testing the proposed solution.},

abstract={In developing smart city, the growing popularity of machine learning (ML) that appreciates high-quality training data sets generated from diverse Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices raises natural questions about the privacy guarantees that can be provided in such settings. Privacy-preserving ML training in an aggregation scenario enables a model demander to securely train ML models with the sensitive IoT data gathered from IoT devices. The existing solutions are generally server aided, cannot deal with the collusion threat between the servers or between the servers and data owners, and do not match the delicate environments of IoT. We propose a privacy-preserving ML training framework named Heda that consists of a library of building blocks based on partial homomorphic encryption, which enables constructing multiple privacy-preserving ML training protocols for the aggregation scenario without the assistance of untrusted servers, and defending the security under collusion situations. Rigorous security analysis demonstrates the proposed protocols can protect the privacy of each participant in the honest-but-curious model and guarantee the security under most collusion situations. Extensive experiments validate the efficiency of Heda, which achieves privacy-preserving ML training without losing the model accuracy.},

Since the Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in different domains to improve the quality life for people by connecting multiple sensors in different places, it also makes the air pollution monitoring more easier than before. Traditional way of using fixed sensors cannot effectively provide a comprehensive view of air pollution in people's immediate surroundings, since the closest sensors can be possibly miles away. Our research focuses on modeling the air quality pattern in a given region by adopting both fixed and moving IoT sensors, which are placed on vehicles patrolling around the region. With our approach, a full spectrum of how air quality varies in nearby regions can be analyzed.

Some of the barriers in successful deployment of ITS have been its reliability, scalability, interoperability and security. Communication plays a big role in ITS and Wi-Fi/ cellular technologies have been used to facilitate Car-to-Server (C2S) and Server-to-Server (S2S) type communication. Car-to-Car (C2C) communication emerges as a more resource constrained and challenging model. Due to strict real-time, low delay and high security requirements, C2C presents several avenues for research. In this work, we investigate the network and security concerns of C2C architecture of ITS. Based on our study, we propose an effective approach for C2C communication using event-triggered broadcast of information. We use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based sender authentication for information verification. Furthermore, we provide Machine Learning based solutions to some common problems encountered during C2C communication.},

abstract={Upcoming Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) will transform roads from static resources to dynamic Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) in order to satisfy the requirements of future vehicular traffic in smart city environments. Up-to-date information serves as the basis for changing street directions as well as guiding individual vehicles to a fitting parking slot. In this context, not only abstract indicators like traffic flow and density are required, but also data about mobility parameters and class information of individual vehicles. Consequently, accurate and reliable systems that are capable of providing these kinds of information in real-time are highly demanded. In this paper, we present a system for the classification of vehicles based on their radio-fingerprints which applies cutting-edge machine learning models and can be non-intrusively installed into the existing road infrastructure in an ad-hoc manner. In contrast to other approaches, it is able to provide accurate classification results without causing privacy-violations or being vulnerable to challenging weather conditions. Moreover, it is a promising candidate for large-scale city deployments due to its cost-efficient installation and maintenance properties. The proposed system is evaluated in a comprehensive field evaluation campaign within an experimental live deployment on a German highway, where it is able to achieve a binary classification success ratio of more than 99% and an overall accuracy of 89.15% for a fine-grained classification task with nine different classes.},

abstract={Thanks to the advances in wireless communication and machine learning technologies, we can envision a novel AIoT (AI + IoT) service platform that collects video data from the individuals' edge devices. Then, it transforms the video data into useful information, providing services to IoT or smart city applications. However, collecting raw video data directly to the cloud server is merely possible due to network bandwidth limitations and data privacy concerns. One possible solution is to adopt federated learning, which enables edge devices to collaboratively train a shared model without sending the raw data to the cloud. Unfortunately, this scheme cannot directly be applied to the targeted scenario since it assumes labeled data for training, and only at the cloud, we have the human power and time to label the video data. Thus, to tackle those issues, we propose an edge learning system based on semisupervised learning and federated learning technologies. The system trains AI models at edge devices using an improved semisupervised learning scheme and periodically uploads the training results to the cloud server to form a single model by adapting the federated learning technology. Then, we observe that in the real world, the data on the end devices are nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) such that it may cause weight divergence during training and result in a considerable decrease in the model performance. Therefore, we propose a new operation called federated swapping (FedSwap) to replace partial federated learning operations based on a few shared data during federated training to alleviate the adverse impact of weight divergence. We evaluate our system on both image classification using the state-of-the-art benchmark data and object detection using real-world video data. The experimental results show that the proposed system can have up to 5.9% higher accuracy of object detection for the video analysis applications by fully utilizing unlabeled data, compared with the situation that only labeled data are used. Moreover, the proposed FedSwap can improve the accuracy of image classification by 3.8% and the object detection task by 1.1%.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has become the backbone of current and future emerging applications both in the public and the private, industrial sector. The IoT paradigm, enhanced with intelligence and big data analytics, has found applications in a wide range of solutions such as smart home, smart city, industrial IoT etc. Even though IoT implies that cheap motes can conduct a specific task, thus a large number of them can be deployed, we aim to minimize the installed hardware while we still have a high level of quality of service. Machine Learning algorithms can support this challenge by generating virtual data via utilization of real data from a smaller subset of sensors. The generated data can replicate sensor behavior which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to track. It is also possible to use simulation models for data analysis model validation, by generating new data under varying conditions. In this paper, we propose a concept of an IoT testbed which allows virtual IoT resources to be immersed and tested in real life conditions, which are met in everyday life. Additionally, the features of the implemented testbed prototype are discussed while taking into account specific use cases, regarding luminosity scenarios in industrial environments.},

abstract={The recent SARS-CoV-2 virus global spread and the Covid-19 pandemic that resulted from that has increased the focus on hygienic and contactless safety measures. The wide use of masks, that are essential for the reduction of the spread of the virus, has been declared mandatory by several institutions and countries. Given the circumstances, masked facial recognition has gained an increased attention by the research community. Mask identification for healthcare reasons, face recognition and identification for public safety in a smart city environment and security reasons proved to be a challenging problem with most algorithms having limitations. The vast amount of data, of people with masks, that has been generated in the recent months will be helpful in tackling some of the major issues. The main issues most methodologies face are occlusion, illumination, non-frontal characteristics and pose variation. This paper focuses on the preliminary results of a novel rule based hybrid masked face recognition algorithm. We use the MaskedFace-net dataset and we detect the covered face using the Viola-Jones algorithm. Through the use of Statistical Region Merging (SRM) we detect the ocular region in the cropped face image, and we achieve eye detection for our preprocessing. Through this process we manage to get a clearer and sharper version of the original input eye image. Finally, we generate the attributed graph of the detected facial features, whose labeled arcs represent the computed distance rations between them. This algorithm will act as input into a machine learning prediction model moving forward.},

abstract={Recent advances in technology have led to an increasing degree of automation and optimization in most areas of the parcel logistics process. However, this trend has not been widely adopted in one critical part of the process, which is the actual delivery (also often referred to as “last mile”). One critical task in the last mile delivery process is the computation of a set of optimal delivery tours for a set of given delivery locations. This task is commonly known as the vehicle routing problem. In this work, we propose an extended version of the vehicle routing problem that aims to increase the degree of automation in the last mile delivery process by leveraging on the current advancements in the area of autonomous driving. Furthermore, we study the application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods to solve the proposed problem. We show that such a set up can reduce the overall time needed for delivering parcels compared to the conventional method, in which the delivery agent manually drives the delivery vehicle to each delivery address. In addition, the proposed model is computationally cheap which is essential to support close to real time analysis of context changes (e.g., traffic situation) and decision making, which is critical for an application in the context of highly dynamic Smart City environments.},

abstract={Smart city environments, when applied to healthcare, improve the quality of people's lives, enabling, for instance, disease prediction and treatment monitoring. In medical settings, case prioritization is of great importance, with beneficial outcomes both in terms of patient health and physicians' daily work. Recommender systems are an alternative to automatically integrate the data generated in such environments with predictive models and recommend actions, content, or services. The data produced by smart devices are accurate and reliable for predictive and decision-making contexts. This study main purpose is to assist patients and doctors in the early detection of disease or prediction of postoperative worsening through constant monitoring. To achieve this objective, this study proposes an architecture for recommender systems applied to healthcare, which can prioritize emergency cases. The architecture brings an ensemble approach for prediction, which adopts multiple Machine Learning algorithms. The methodology used to carry out the study followed three steps. First, a systematic literature mapping, second, the construction and development of the architecture, and third, the evaluation through two case studies. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposal. The predictions are promising and adherent to the application context for accurate datasets with a low amount of noises or missing values.},

abstract={The development of sensors and their integration with the environment enables us to build smarter applications that suit modern city needs. A Road network is the backbone of any country’s development structure. The free flow of traffic on the highways is vital for better mobility and transportation. These problems necessitate the development of smarter technologies focused on the Internet of Things, which recognize real-time data in the monitored area and analyze urban transportation flow in a smart city road. For a variety of road users, including commuters, private vehicle drivers, and the public transportation system, reliable traffic flow information is critical. This data would aid passengers in choosing the best mode of transportation, improving road flows, reducing noise, and reducing traffic congestion. The proposed system provides solutions to these problems partly. This system predicts the congestion in the road traffic and provides information ahead of time. The importance of traffic congestion prediction has grown in tandem with the rapid development of Smart Transportation Networks for convenient transportation. This paper illustrates a smart traffic management infrastructure based on Internet of Things (IoT), traffic is predicted using KNN algorithm and information is projected to smart devices through Android application. The outcome is smart predictive system with suggested alternates. The system can be further enhanced by installing display panels integrated with cloud computing at key places that shows alternate routes with time constraints. Also the performance and accuracy of application can be tested with different machine learning algorithms.},

abstract={Many smart city applications rely on machine learning; however, adversarial perturbations can be injected into training data to cause models to return skewed results. Jangseung is a preprocessor limits the effects of poisoning attacks without impeding on accuracy. Jangseung was created to guard support vector machines from poisoned data by utilizing anomaly detection algorithms. The preprocessor was tested through experiments that utilized two different datasets, the MNIST dataset and the UCI breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset. With both datasets, two identical models were trained and then attacked using the same adversarial points, one with Jangseung protecting it and the other unguarded from attack. In all cases, the protected model out-performed the unprotected model and in the best case scenario, the Jangseung-protected model outperformed the unguarded model by 96.2%. The under-trained, undefended MNIST models had an average accuracy of 53.2%. When Jangseung was present, their identical counterparts had a drastically higher average accuracy at 91.1%. Likewise, in the UCI-Cancer dataset, attack sequences lowered the accuracy of the model to as low as 75.51%, but Jangseung-defended models performed with 88.18% accuracy or better. Jangseung was an effective defense against adversarial perturbations for SVMs using different datasets and anomaly detection algorithms.},

abstract={Most of the research on Federated Learning (FL) has focused on analyzing global optimization, privacy, and communication, with limited attention focusing on analyzing the critical matter of performing efficient local training and inference at the edge devices. One of the main challenges for successful and efficient training and inference on edge devices is the careful selection of parameters to build local Machine Learning (ML) models. To this aim, we propose a Particle Swarm optimization (PSO)-based technique to optimize the hyperparameter settings for the local ML models in an FL environment. We evaluate the performance of our proposed technique using two case studies. First, we consider smart city services, and use an experimental transportation dataset for traffic prediction as a proxy for this setting. Second, we consider Industrial IoT(IIoT) services, and use the real-time telemetry dataset to predict the probability that a machine will fail shortly due to component failures. Our experiments indicate that PSO provides an efficient approach for tuning the hyperparameters of deep Long short-term memory (LSTM) models when compared to the grid search method. Our experiments illustrate that the number of client-server communication rounds to explore the landscape of configurations to find the near-optimal parameters are greatly reduced (roughly by two orders of magnitude needing only 2%-4% of the rounds compared to state of the art non-PSO-based approaches). We also demonstrate that utilizing the proposed PSO-based technique to find the near-optimal configurations for FL and centralized learning models does not adversely affect the accuracy of the models.},

abstract={Efficient parking lot automation continues to be a focal point of smart city initiatives. Most existing unattended parking lots suffer from a lack of seamless automation, instead deploying ticketing and payment at ingress and egress points or other systems with heavy user involvement that often form bottlenecks. Similarly, many lots use per-space sensing with expensive networking and power requirements simply to determine space occupancy. Parking solutions that are free from the delay caused by this user burden and infrastructure could experience faster occupancy turnover with lower cost. An ongoing challenge in developing seamless parking experiences is the detection and identification of vehicles in parking spaces without the need for complex and expensive per-space occupancy detection technology. We develop a smart parking solution that uses a single low-power wireless radio technology to seamlessly perform parked vehicle localization and transport of sensor data for use by a central management system. Our solution uses a sparse, self-forming network of dual-mode Bluetooth sensors within a parking area to observe the presence of customized authenticated Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacons placed in vehicles parked in the lot. Our localization technique is based on radio fingerprinting using Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values from the beacon, and a random forest machine learning classifier that predicts where the vehicle is parked based on its fingerprint. We implemented our solution in Python on commodity Internet of Things (IoT) hardware and deployed it to a 105 space outdoor parking lot. There, we conducted fingerprinting and prediction experiments. Our results show that our exact-space prediction model evaluates with a high accuracy using radio training data (90.7% correctly identified), and our in-vehicle tests show a promising result (69.17% accurate up to and including 3 spaces away), even without employing tuning and data filtering techniques. This encouraging result shows that localization using Bluetooth is a viable means of managing parked vehicles, with great promise for a variety of future parking management applications.},

abstract={With the widely used Internet of Things, 5G, and smart city technologies, we are able to acquire a variety of vehicle trajectory data. These trajectory data are of great significance which can be used to extract relevant information in order to, for instance, calculate the optimal path from one position to another, detect abnormal behavior, monitor the traffic flow in a city, and predict the next position of an object. One of the key technology is to cluster vehicle trajectory. However, existing methods mainly rely on manually designed metrics which may lead to biased results. Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space. To address these challenges, we propose to employ network representation learning to achieve accurate vehicle trajectory clustering. Specifically, we first construct the k-nearest neighbor-based internet of vehicles in a dynamic manner. Then we learn the low-dimensional representations of vehicles by performing dynamic network representation learning on the constructed network. Finally, using the learned vehicle vectors, vehicle trajectories are clustered with machine learning methods. Experimental results on the real-word dataset show that our method achieves the best performance compared against baseline methods.},

abstract={Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is a significant part of smart city, and short-term traffic flow prediction plays an important role in intelligent transportation management and route guidance. A number of models and algorithms based on time series prediction and machine learning were applied to short-term traffic flow prediction and achieved good results. However, most of the models require the length of the input historical data to be predefined and static, which cannot automatically determine the optimal time lags. To overcome this shortage, a model called Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) is proposed in this paper, which takes advantages of the three multiplicative units in the memory block to determine the optimal time lags dynamically. The dataset from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) is used for building the model and comparing LSTM RNN with several well-known models, such as random walk(RW), support vector machine(SVM), single layer feed forward neural network(FFNN) and stacked autoencoder(SAE). The results show that the proposed prediction model achieves higher accuracy and generalizes well.},

abstract={To enable the intelligent management of Smart City and improve overall social welfare, it is desirable for the status of infrastructures detected and reported by intelligent devices embedded in them to be forwarded to the data centers. Using “SCmules” such as taxis, to opportunistically communicate with intelligent devices and collect data from the sparse networks formed by them in the process of moving is an economical and effective way to achieve this goal. In this paper, the social welfare data collection paradigm SWDCP-SCmules data collection framework is proposed to collect data generated by intelligent devices and forward them to data centers, in which “SCmules” are data transmitters picking up data from nearby intelligent devices and then store-carry-forwarding them to nearby data centers via short-range wireless connections in the process of moving. Because of the storage limitations, “SCmules” need to weigh the value of data and select some less valuable data to discard when necessary. To quantify the value of data and find a well-performed selection strategy, the concept of priority is introduced to the SWDCP-SCmules scheme, and then, the simulated annealing for priority assignment SA-PA algorithm is proposed to guide the priority assignment. The SA-PA algorithm is a universal algorithm that can improve the performance of SWDCP-SCmules scheme by finding better priority assignment with respect to various optimization targets, such as maximizing collection rate or minimizing redundancy rate, in which priority assignment problem is converted into an optimization problem and simulated annealing is used to optimize the priority assignment. From the perspective of machine learning, the process of optimization is equal to automatically learn social-aware patterns from past GPS trajectory data. Experiments based on real GPS trajectory data of taxis in Beijing are conducted to show the effectiveness and efficiency of SWDCP-SCmules scheme and SA-PA algorithm.},

Consequently, upcoming 5G communication networks will be confronted with massive increases in Machine-type Communication (MTC) and require resource-efficient transmission methods in order to optimize the overall system performance and provide interference-free coexistence with human data traffic that is using the same public cellular network. In this paper, we bring together mobility prediction and machine learning based channel quality estimation in order to improve the resource-efficiency of car-to-cloud data transfer by scheduling the transmission time of the sensor data with respect to the anticipated behavior of the communication context. In a comprehensive field evaluation campaign, we evaluate the proposed context-predictive approach in a public cellular network scenario where it is able to increase the average data rate by up to 194% while simultaneously reducing the mean uplink power consumption by up to 54%.},

abstract={Urban areas tend to be warmer than their rural surroundings, well-known as the “urban heat island” effect. Higher nocturnal air temperature (Tair) is associated with adverse effects on human health, higher mortality rates, and higher energy consumption. Prediction of the spatial distribution of Tair is a step toward the “Smart City” concept, providing an early warning system for vulnerable populations. The study of the spatial distribution of urban Tair was thus far limited by the low spatial resolution of traditional data sources. Volunteered geographic information provides alternative data with higher spatial density, with citizen weather stations monitoring Tair continuously in hundreds or thousands of locations within a single city. In this article, the aim was to predict the spatial distribution of nocturnal Tair in Berlin, Germany, one day in advance at a 30-m resolution using open-source remote sensing and geodata from Landsat and Urban Atlas, crowdsourced Tair data, and machine learning (ML) methods. Results were tested with a “leave-one-date-out” training scheme (testingcrowd) and reference Tair data (testingref). Three ML algorithms were compared-Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and Model Averaged Neural Network. The optimal model based on accuracy and computational speed is RF, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) for testingcrowd of 1.16 °C (R2 = 0.512) and RMSE for testingref of 1.97 °C (R2 = 0.581). Overall, the most important geographic information system (GIS) predictors were morphometric parameters and albedo. The proposed method relies on open-source datasets and can, therefore, be adapted to many cities worldwide.},

abstract={With almost every new vehicle being connected, the importance of vehicle data is growing rapidly. Many mobility applications rely on the fusion of data coming from heterogeneous data sources, like vehicle and "smart-city" data or process data generated by systems out of their control. This external data determines much about the behaviour of the relying applications: it impacts the reliability, security and overall quality of the application's input data and ultimately of the application itself. Hence, knowledge about the provenance of that data is a critical component in any data-driven system. The secure traceability of the data handling along the entire processing chain, which passes through various distinct systems, is critical for the detection and avoidance of misuse and manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism for establishing secure data provenance in real time, demonstrating an exemplary use-case based on a machine learning model that detects dangerous driving situations.

abstract={Efficient residential load power management represents, on one hand, a cornerstone towards Smart City Grids while, on the other hand a multifaceted challenge. The identified interplay between multiple parameters concerning both power consumption as well as generation, call for novel design approaches such as Fuzzy Logic, machine learning and AI regarding respective algorithms. Furthermore, aiming to propose highly reliable and practical solutions, respective implementations much be undertaken and evaluated in the context of real-world prominent communication and power control infrastructures. Driven, by such observations this paper presents a complete, efficient and feasible proposal able to tackle respective requirements. Specifically, a comprehensive multimodal Fuzzy Logic Inference (FIS) design is proposed able to incorporate heterogeneous factors pertaining both to residential power consumption and generation. Additionally, proposed designed is implemented in the context of a fully functional KNX based infrastructure monitoring and controlling power consumption of a real residence. Respective performance evaluation, firstly, serve as FIS implementation validation indicating convergence between Matlab based and KNX based performance. Secondly, it highlights the benefits the end-user can anticipate using such a system. Finally, an estimated projection is attempted based on actual performance results and Europe wide statistics concerning residential power consumption as well as CO2 omissions.},

abstract={The sixth-generation (6G) wireless technology contributes to the establishment of the Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, the IoT has become popular because of its smart architectures and various applications. Among these applications, intelligent urban surveillance systems for smart cities are becoming more and more important. Therefore, designing a robust visual tracking method has become an urgent task. Deep Siamese convolutional neural networks have been applied to visual tracking recently because of their advantageous abilities to learn a matching function between the template and the target candidate. Unlike traditional Siamese networks, which separately treat the two branches, we propose deep Siamese cross-residual learning to entangle the two branches from the beginning to the end of the Siamese network. This strategy can make the two branches exchange instance-specific information at different nodes of the network and learn a more compact representation of the target. In addition, we propose a combined loss function, which consists of two complementary tasks. One task is to learn a matching function directly and the other one is to learn a classification function. Moreover, our model does not need to load any pretrained weights and is trained with limited sequences from scratch. Plenty of experiments show that our tracker performs favorably against many state-of-the-art tracking methods.},

abstract={The ubiquity of smartphones and their rich set of on-board sensors has created many exciting new opportunities, where smartphones are used as powerful computing platforms to sense and analyze pervasive data. One important application of mobile sensing is activity recognition based on smartphone inertial sensors, which is a fundamental building block for a variety of scenarios, such as indoor pedestrian tracking, mobile health care, and smart cities. Although many approaches have been proposed to address the human activity recognition problem, several challenges are still present: 1) people's motion modes are very different for different individuals; 2) there is only a very limited amount of training data; 3) human activities can be arbitrary and complex, thus handcrafted feature engineering often fails to work; and 4) the recognition accuracy tends to be limited due to confusing activities. To tackle those challenges, in this paper, we propose a human activity recognition framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with two convolutional layers using the smartphone-based accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. To solve the confusion between highly similar activities like going upstairs and walking, this paper presents a novel ensemble model of CNN to further improve the identification accuracy. The extensive experiments have been conducted using 235 977 sensory samples from a total of 100 subjects. The results have shown that the classification accuracy of the proposed model can be up to 96.11%, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Currently, many monitoring approaches focus on video-processing techniques using traffic surveillance cameras.

To overcome these difficulties, we designed and evaluated a real-time vehicle counting system using deep neural networks in an embedded device.

abstract={Many studies deal with the problem of ensuring safety and increasing the capacity of signal-controlled junctions of the road network (RN). The use of innovative developments in the field of computer vision to model intelligent transport systems (ITS) has been a steady trend in the framework of the development of smart cities. One of the less-studied issues is the optimal respecting the interests of drivers and pedestrians within pedestrian crossings when turning right. In our work, we focused on the problem of ensuring the minimum time of waiting and crossing signal-controlled intersections by pedestrians. We proposed to solve this problem based on adaptive traffic light control through the use of computer vision. To solve the problem, we trained two configurations of YOLOv3 neural networks based on the Darknet framework with additional modifications. The SORT tracker was used to track objects. In the zones adjacent to pedestrian crossings, we used a neural network to search for pedestrians intending to cross a section of the carriageway, which conflicts with turning vehicles. Based on the data on the presence of pedestrians and the information on the composition of the vehicle queue, we calculated the optimal time-sharing of the permissive traffic light interval.},

abstract={Edge computing technology is an important computer operating system in China. It plays a key role in multi-system fusion and intelligent manufacturing, and can play a key role in training and testing of deep neural networks. The purpose of this paper is to study the application of edge computing technology in the collaborative optimization of intelligent transportation systems based on information and physical fusion. This article sets up monitoring points at different traffic intersections, and applies long-term and short-term memory networks to collect data at each traffic intersection. The DBN-SVR method model was used to detect the traffic flow of some intersections, and the edge computer technology was used to process the information signals generated by the intersections. The other portions of the intersections used traditional monitoring systems. By comparing the work efficiency and utility under the two methods, fitting data is performed, and mathematical statistics and mathematical analysis methods are used to verify the fitted data. The experimental data show that the edge computing technology can help the processing of traffic conditions in the intelligent transportation system integrated with information and physics, which has greatly improved the overall work efficiency of each system. Experimental data shows that intelligent transportation systems that integrate edge computing technology with information physics have improved transportation efficiency by about 20% and urban security by about 35%, which has a great effect on building smart cities and safe cities.},

This configuration proves to be practical for videos as it is selective in its analysis of an input frame. City surveillance and public safety is a critical issue in smart cities and the deployment of Smart Video Surveillance systems is the need of the hour. Typically, the problem at hand will be person identification which is the association of a biometric trait with a particular human being. FAST key points can be generated and analyzed in near real-time and that data can be used to extract and process faces in the background. The CNNs were trained using a combination of datasets of labelled faces, videos and trivial objects. The results obtained upon analyzing the performance of the system on the ChokePoint dataset proved very insightful. This configuration leads to a very effective face recognition system.},

In order to support the wide range of services and applications that are being offered by SCWNOS, spectrum leasing could be considered as an alternative solution to achieve improved Quality of Service (QoS). We consider a situation whereby in order to satisfy the QoS requirements, SCWNOs can decide to lease a certain part of the TVWS spectrum that is referred to as high priority TVWS channel (HPC) for a certain period and pay a fee depending on the duration of HPC spectrum usage. We develop an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based online algorithm to determine the optimal transmission decision per time slot that would minimise the overall HPC leasing cost of the SCWNOs while satisfying the QoS constraints. The simulations results shows that our proposed ANN based online algorithms outperforms the Lyapunov based online algorithm while its performance is very close to the optimal offline solution with 99% accuracy.},

abstract={Indoor location-based services (LBS) have exhibited large commercial and social values in smart cities, and urgent demands of which have spurred many localization techniques. Existing indoor localization approaches mostly rely on fingerprint techniques, leveraging either spatially discrete fingerprints or temporally consecutive ones for localization. However, these approaches often suffer from large errors or high time overhead in practice due to signal ambiguities or long input sequences. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a framework utilizing multiple adaptive representations of signal sequences for localization, where each representation indicates a corresponding signal structure with underlying location clues. As an example, the proposed approach takes geomagnetic signal sequences as input and infers location features from two intuitive representations, e.g., spatial and temporal ones. With adaptive signal representations, the proposed approach takes specifically optimized neural networks to extract corresponding location clues respectively and fuses them to generate more distinguishing features for more accurate localization. Furthermore, the ensemble learning mechanism is adopted in the approach and a weighted k-NN based location estimation algorithm is devised to enhance the robustness. Extensive experiments in three different trial sites demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art competing schemes by a wide margin, reducing mean localization error by more than 46%.},

abstract={In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as drones, smartphones, and smart vehicles have increased, and Smart Vehicular Networks (SVNs) have formed. SVN are one of the vital components in smart cities and improves their functionality and efficiency. Despite the many applications that SVN have shown, they have security vulnerabilities issues, and there are many reports of them being hacked. Most attacks on SVN occur due to wireless communications and information sharing between vehicles. Also, due to the communication among vehicles, failures can spread from the victim device to the entire network and cause widespread damages. SVN features include mobility, decentralization, resource constraints that make traditional security solutions unsuitable for it. We propose a secure framework using blockchain and Deep Neural networks (DNN) to address these challenges. In this framework, we consider cluster-based architecture that vehicles in each cluster can securely communicate using the blockchain. Also, DNN is adopted to detect abnormal vehicles that have been attacked using their network traffic analysis in each zone. We assess blockchain impacts on throughput using different miners with multiple block sizes in our proposed framework. The experimental result indicates the throughput improvement with an increase in miners and block size. In addition, we evaluated the DNN performance for abnormal vehicle detection, which represents 99.82% in terms of accuracy.},

abstract={This study aims to explore the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for estimating the relationship between accidents and other variables with a small dataset. ANNs have not been used to explore relationships between variables, especially for road accidents which have small datasets. Analysis of road traffic accidents is often hampered due to insufficient datasets. Especially, for the cases when specific highway facilities are considered. This issue is also gaining importance for analyzing traveler behavior with the advent of new technologies and implementation of concepts of smart cities. The accident sites selected for this study comprise of unsignalized intersections in Penang State of Malaysia. Accidents in Malaysia have become a major concern for the authorities. However, the data collection is a major issue hindering its analysis because of limited datasets. The safe operation of traffic on unsignalized intersections mainly depends on drivers' judgement and decision making. Hence, the safety considerations on such locations are peculiar in comparison to other facilities. These facts led to carrying out the study for these sites. Two types of ANNs were used i.e. Multilayer Feedforward (MLFF) and linear. In addition, regression model and Mann-Whitney test were also used to compare the results from ANNs. It was found that regression model as well as Mann-Whitney test gave inconclusive results for the available dataset. On the other hand, ANNs were able to approximate the relationship in conformity to the previous studies. It was found that major road width and near-to-far-volume ratio increases the accidents while near-to-far-gap ratio reduces the accidents. The accuracy of ANNs was also better than regression model with an average error of less 40% for ANNs compared to 46% by regression model. However, larger datasets are expected to give better accuracies for regression as well as ANNs.},

abstract={Machine-to-Machine (M2M) develops as a next-generation communication system that allows data to be ex-changed without human interaction either wirelessly or through cables between large numbers of connected devices. Different standards, such as 3GPP, ETSI, and oneM2M, have provided M2M system architecture for data communication. This paper focuses on oneM2M standard for M2M and Internet of Things (IoT)-based services and applications, such as home area net-works, smart cities and intelligent automation systems. This article explains how oneM2M standard enables data flow in M2M communication, the solutions it offers and the issues it faces in terms of data security and data management. Raw data collected by M2M devices can be concluded as information using data mining and machine learning approaches which are employed in a variety of industries and organizations help to make better decisions.

abstract={The bright future of smart cities relies on an effective deployment of IoT technologies. Machine-type communications (MTC) is a major backbone technology that supports connectivity for the Internet of things (IoT). Cellular networks are known to be cost-effective, with ubiquitous coverage that ease the deployment of MTC. However, cellular networks were originally designed for human-centric services with high-cost devices and ever-increasing rate requirements. In contrast, MTC services need to support low-cost, low-energy, massive number of devices. This poses a number of challenges toward the adaptation of current cellular networks to accommodate MTC. This article gives an overview of the conventional random access (RA) scheme of cellular networks and its variants in the literature. However, without discounting the efforts of optimizing the RA scheme, we show that due to the increased collisions and prohibitive overhead, it falls short to support MTC with reduced latency and guaranteed reliability. Alternatively, we discuss different uplink access techniques that are found promising in tackling massive connectivity while avoiding the shortcomings of the conventional RA. Moreover, we discuss how to utilize different future 5G and beyond technologies to efficiently handle massive MTC while pointing out the promising role of machine learning techniques.},

Besides the large amount of real time data generated to extrinsic systems (considering Big Data, AI, Smart Cities and Industry 4.0 applications), there is a plethora of data that could be used intrinsically to diagnose an IoT system. A Test Driven Development (TDD) approach for automatic module assessment based on ESP32 IoT Module and unsupervised machine learning is proposed to classify an IoT module status as bad or good based on memory, temperature and WiFi level metrics. An automatic test case using the trained classifier is presented as a result of the proposed approach validation with real testbed data.

abstract={Research and developments in the newly emerging vehicular applications such as driving monitoring systems, driving behavior and style analysis, driving intension modeling and vehicle telematics, have greatly contributed in the fields of road safety analysis, intelligent transportation systems and microscopic traffic simulation for smart cities. Identification and classification of driving events represents a fundamental necessity for all these systems and in fact they represent the backbone module for any successful application. In recent years, the use of smartphones has grown significantly due to the increase in their computational capabilities and the integration of advanced sensor technologies. This prevalence of smartphones and advances in machine learning techniques have rapidly transformed the field of vehicular applications to be easily accessible, widely available, and implemented at low cost. This paper presents a simple but an effective approach for the identification and classification of driving events. The approach is based on separating events identification process from the classification process. The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) technique is used for the identification, while statistical and time metrics features are used for the classification.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging business model aimed to connect many low-power embedded devices with internet. IoT has many applications in building smart cities, smart environment, e-health care, etc. Due to the presence of unreliable internet and new routing protocols for low-power devices, IoT requires innovative security solutions. In this paper, we present three new Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for IoT: 1) K-means clustering unsupervised learning based IDS; 2) decision tree based supervised IDS; and 3) a hybrid two stage IDS that combines K-means and decision tree learning approaches. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first machine learning based IDSs (together called as ML-IDS) for IoT. All the three IDS are centralized and scalable approaches. The K-means approach achieves 70-93% detection rate for varying sizes of random IoT networks. Decision tree based IDS achieves 71-80% detection rate and the hybrid approach attains 71-75% detection rate for the same network sizes. Although the hybrid IDS obtains lower detection rate, it is more accurate than the other two approaches. The hybrid approach eliminates the false positives significantly, while the other two IDS suffer from a higher number of false positives. Similar results are also obtained for regular mesh, star and ring topologies of IoT networks, each comprising 16 nodes.},

The development of highly accurate machine learning models is yet harder when considering the optimization of hyperparameters, which is an expensive computational task. To tackle these challenges this work proposes the Distributed Evolutionary Hyperparameter Optimization (DEHO) for the Weighted Multivariate Fuzzy Time Series method (WMVFTS), a simple and non-parametric forecasting method with high scalability and accuracy, comprising a sequential training and forecasting procedure and a MapReduce extension for distributed processing. The proposed methods were evaluated using a cluster with commodity hardware and two big time series, showing increasing speed up for training and test times as new CPU cores are added to cluster. Then the DEHO method was executed in the computational cluster, achieving fast convergence and feasible processing time and generating highly accurate WMVFTS models.},

abstract={The use of machine learning modeling techniques enables smart IoT applications in geo-distributed infrastructures such as in the areas of Industry 4.0, smart cities, autonomous driving, and telemedicine. The data for these models is continuously emitted by sensor-equipped devices. It is usually unlabeled and commonly has dynamically-changing data distribution, which impedes the learning process. However, many critical applications such as telemedicine require highly accurate models and human supervision. Therefore, online supervised learning is often utilized, but its application remains challenging as it requires continuous labeling by experts, which is expensive. To reduce the cost, active learning (AL) strategies are used for efficient data selection and labeling. In this paper we propose a novel AL framework for IoT applications, which employs data selection strategies throughout the multiple layers of distributed IoT architectures. This enables an improved utilization of the available resources and reduces costs. The results from the evaluation using classification and regression tasks and synthetic as well as real-world datasets in multiple settings show that the use of multilayer AL can significantly reduce communication, expert costs, and energy, without a loss in model performance. We believe that this study motivates the development of new techniques that employ selective sampling strategies on data streams to optimize the resource usage in IoT architectures.},

We present, in this paper, a multi-criteria journey planner that incorporates train load predictions as criteria. To this end, on the one hand, we enrich the proposed routes with predictive indicators of passenger flow such as the load on board the trains. These indicators are computed for each section of the itinerary using machine learning algorithms.

abstract={Railway transportation systems are the backbone of smart cities. With the rapid increasing of railway mileage, the energy consumption of train becomes a major concern. The uniqueness of train operations is that the geographic characteristics of each route is known a priori. On the other hand, the parameters (e.g., loads) of a train varies from trip to trip. Such a specialty determines that an energy-optimal driving profile for each train operation has to be pursued by considering both the geographic information and the inherent train conditions. The solution of the optimization problem, however, is hard due to its high dimension, nonlinearity, complex constraints and time-varying characteristics of a control sequence. As a result, an energy-saving solution to the train control optimization problem has to address the dilemma of optimization quality and computing time. This work proposes an energy-efficient train control framework by integrating both offline and onboard optimization techniques. The offline processing builds a decision tree based sketchy solution through a complete flow of sequence mining, optimization and machine learning. The onboard system feeds the train parameters into the decision tree to derive an optimized control sequence. A key innovation of this work is the identification of optimal patterns of control sequence by data mining the driving behaviors of the experienced train drivers and then apply the patterns to online trip planning. The proposed framework efficiently find an optimized driving solution by leveraging the training results derived with a compute-intensive offline learning flow. The framework was already testified in a smart freight train system. It was demonstrated an average of $9.84$ percent energy-saving can be achieved.},

In addition to personalized monitoring, community-wide temporal and spatial monitoring are also possible in this approach. A custom smartphone app is developed that has the ability for collection of body sensor data via Bluetooth, loading machine learning algorithms dynamically from the webserver, computing disease severity in real-time, sharing of anonymous data, and visualization of community health status via the webserver. The framework has been tested for online monitoring of OSA, COPD, and flu severity. An accuracy of ± 1°F has been achieved for flu measurement and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.27 AHI has been achieved for OSA severity estimation using heart rate variability and SpO2. The app has a power consumption of 218 mW when active, uses a memory of 7 MB, and requires a total storage space of 9.36 MB. This framework aims to improve community health, reduce waste in healthcare spending, and facilitate early treatment in case of disease exacerbation.},

abstract={IoT networks continue to expand in various domains, from smart homes and campuses to smart cities and critical infrastructures. It has been shown that IoT devices typically lack appropriate security measures embedded, and hence are increasingly becoming the target of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Also, these devices are heterogeneous in their network communications that makes it difficult for operators of smart environments to manage them at scale. Existing monitoring solutions may perform well in certain environments, however, they do not scale cost-effectively and are inflexible to changes due to their static use of models. In this paper1, we use SDN to dynamically monitor a selected portion of IoT packets or flows, and develop specialized models to learn corresponding traffic signatures. Our first contribution develops a progressive inference pipeline, comprising a number of machine-learning models each is specialized in certain features of IoT traffic. Our inference engine dynamically obtains selected telemetry, including a subset of traffic or flow counters, using SDN techniques. Our second contribution develops three supervised multi-class classifiers, two are protocol specialists trained by packet-based features and one is flow-based model trained by behavioral characteristics of ten unidirectional flows. Our third contribution evaluates the performance of our scheme by replaying real traffic traces of 26 IoT devices on to an SDN switching simulator in conjunction with three trained Random Forest models. Our system yields an overall accuracy of 99.4%. We also integrate our system with an off-the-shelf IDS (Zeek) to flag TCP flood and reflection attacks by inspecting only the suspicious device network traffic.},

With many papers in the literature focusing on parking spot detection and optimization for centralized parking reservation systems, we study how to make smart parking decisions from the perspective of a driver. Our research is motivated by the fact that centralized parking assignment may be either unavailable or suboptimal to the driver. In this paper, we let the driver come up with the best parking strategies using real-time parking and traffic information, and machine learning algorithms trained by historical data. Specifically, we propose a Q-learning based approach and also an artificial neural network based greedy algorithm. We run simulation to verify the performance of the proposed mechanisms.},

In such networks, having energy-efficient routing protocols is necessary in order to maximize the network lifetime. However, many factors may influence the energy consumption in IoT low power networks. These factors include the transmission power of devices, the data routing strategy, etc. In this paper, we address the effect of the transmission power on energy consumption in RPL networks (RPL : IPV6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) and propose a new solution based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, to estimate the optimal transmission range of dynamic IoT low power networks deployed following a 3D topology.

abstract={In smart cities, the business location is an important component of the complex decision process for the entrepreneurs. If a business such as shopping center, restau-rant, coffee shop, hospital, clothing etc. is opened in optimal location; not only the satisfaction level of the customers are enhanced with increased life quality and convenience, but also it maximizes the profit of the entrepreneurs. However, it is complex and long-term decision to find optimal location for a business. Therefore; we propose a smart business application that uses machine learning techniques to estimate the location of a business. The proposed system collects key feature values for a specific business and learns a prediction model for future data. It estimates features and suggests clusters of districts that have optimal locations for that specific business. The proposed system is evaluated on a use case that estimates the best possible locations of a restaurant according to main characteristics taken as inputs from entrepreneurs via a Web based application. These characteristics are Meal Price per customer, HouseHold Type, Gender, and Age. The first phase of decision process is estimating mentioned features such as House Price per district and local population belonging to different HouseHold type, Gender, and Age with less error rates for the consecutive years. Here; we determine an optimal regression model choosing from SMORegression (SMOReg), MultiLayerPerceptron (MLP), and multivariate Linear Regression (Linear) according to Relative Absolute Error (RAE %) parameter, for each feature. The second phase clusters districts according to these estimated features by using hierarchical tree. As a result; the estimated best suggestions for restaurant locations which have similar features, are shown to entrepreneurs via our Web based application. It should be noted that, the application can produce generic solution for the needs of entrepreneurs.},

These tests showed that it is much more difficult to recognize ciphertext generated with the Catalan method than one made with the DES algorithm. System reliability depends on the quality of the key, therefore, statistical testing proposed by National Institute of Standards and Technology was also performed. Twelve standard tests, the approximate entropy measurement, and random digression complexity analysis are applied in order to evaluate the quality of the generated Catalan key. A proposal for applying this method in e-Health IoT is also given. Possibilities of applying this method in the IoT applications for smart cities data storage and processing are provided.},

abstract={Recently self-driving vehicles have attracted tremendous attention from all walks of life. A problem facing self-driving vehicles is when to stop for gas. In this paper, we study the autonomous refueling strategies using vehicle-to-infrastructure communication in smart cities. We set three goals for our strategies: not to stop too late, nor too early, and get relatively cheap gas. To satisfy these goals, we relate our problem to the Gusein-Zade's version of the secretary problem and provide a solution framework where we divide the distance a vehicle can travel from a full tank to an empty tank into Density Observation Section, Secretary Section, and the Critical Section. To predict the number of gas stations a vehicle will encounter in the future, we use the Constant Density Approximation (CDA) method and the Machine Learning (ML) method. Simulation results comparing the proposed CDA and ML algorithms with the ground truth algorithm show that both perform nearly as well as the ground truth in satisfying all three goals.},

abstract={Cyber-attacks are becoming a very common problem we face in IoT networks nowadays. These attacks mainly target the comparatively less powerful IoT and gateway devices so that the attacker can compromise the device much faster. As the IoT infrastructure is getting exponential growth recently, the attacks are also getting the same pace. Based on various studies, almost 90% of attacks targeting IoT networks are Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). So, like any other aspect, security is an inevitable part of IoT networks and devices because this is now deployed in highly critical areas like space technology, healthcare, smart cities, etc. Understanding these attacks, their behavior pattern, and their defense mechanisms will help to implement a highly safe and secure IoT infrastructure. The system proposed here is a prototype model for detecting the most common DoS attacks at the gateway device itself using the Machine Learning approach. ML approaches can recognize the behavior pattern of the attacks based on the previously trained data and can make efficient predictions with a high accuracy factor. This will help us to take proper countermeasures to protect our IoT network from such potential attacks. The need for a safe and secure IoT ecosystem is an important need for today and especially in the future.},

abstract={Edge computing (EC) is a promising technology capable of bridging the gap between Cloud computing services and the demands of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Most EC-based solutions, from wearable devices to smart cities architectures, benefit from Machine Learning (ML) methods to perform various tasks, such as classification. In these cases, ML solutions need to deal efficiently with a huge amount of data, while balancing predictive performance, memory and time costs, and energy consumption. The fact that these data usually come in the form of a continuous and evolving data stream makes the scenario even more challenging. Many algorithms have been proposed to cope with data stream classification, e.g., Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) and Strict VFDT (SVFDT). Recently, Online Local Boosting (OLBoost) has also been introduced to improve predictive performance without modifying the underlying structure of the decision tree produced by these algorithms. In this work, we compared the four-way relationship among time efficiency, energy consumption, predictive performance, and memory costs, tuning the hyperparameters of VFDT and the two versions of SVFDT with and without OLBoost. Experiments over 6 benchmark datasets using an EC device revealed that VFDT and SVFDT-I were the most energy-friendly algorithms, with SVFDT-I also significantly reducing memory consumption. OLBoost, as expected, improved the predictive performance, but caused a deterioration in memory and energy consumption.},

abstract={Smart cities (SCs), as a novel solution built on top of large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems, experiences a rapid growth worldwide, in which, a synergetic orchestration among objects, data, and services is emphasized for innovative solutions to elevate the intelligence of cities based on the fusion of multisource and multimodal data. To enable such orchestration, this article proposes a smart service orchestration architecture (SSOA) to coordinate ubiquitous objects, create interlinked data, and implement versatile smart services. As a proof of concept of SSOA, an informed design platform (IDP) is presented to demonstrate how a smart service system can be designed and how a synergetic orchestration can be implemented to support an informed place design. Moreover, two dedicated mechanisms, namely, place utilization analysis mechanism (PUAM) and ensemble-based activity detection mechanism (EADM), are implemented in a multisource data processing flow to illustrate how massive geo-referenced data can be analyzed effectively and efficiently by machine learning algorithms to extract key information for a comprehensive data fusion required in using multimodal IoT systems. As evaluated, PUAM running in a distributed environment can dramatically improve the performance of geospatial clustering about 11 times from the baseline 53.6 to 4.7 s, and EADM with an ensemble activity classifier achieves the highest accuracy about 87.7% and also the highest f-score per activity category. Finally, various insights about the project testbed Jurong East, Singapore, are discussed to reveal its place design context.},

volume={8},

pages={124624-124632},
abstract={The Type-2 fuzzy set (T2 FS) is widely used for efficient control uncertainties, such as noise sensitivity in the fuzzy set. In addition, unsupervised machine learning requires a clustering parameter value in advance, and may affect clustering performance according to prior information such as the number and size of clusters. In this case, the fuzzifier value m to be applied is the most important factor in improving the accuracy of data. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to perform clustering to automatically acquire the determination of m1 and m2 values that depended on existing repeated experiments. To this end, in order to increase efficiency on deriving appropriate fuzzifier value, we used the Interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy C-means (IT2PFCM), clustering method to classify a given pattern. In Efficient IT2PFCM method, used for clustering, we propose an algorithm that derives suitable fuzzifier values for each data. These values also extract information from each data point through the histogram approach and Gaussian Curve Fitting method. Using the extracted information, two adaptive fuzzifier value m1 and m2 are determined. Obtained values apply the new lowest and highest membership values. In addition, it is possible to form an appropriate fuzzy area on each cluster by only taking advantage of the characteristics of IT2PFCM, which reduces uncertainty. This doesn't only improve the accuracy of clustering of measured sensor data, but can also be used without additional procedures such as data labeling or the provision of prior information. It is also efficient at monitoring numerous sensors, managing and verifying sensor data collected in real time such as smart cities. Eventually, in this study, the proposed method is to improve IT2PFCM performance on accurate and quick clustering of large amount of complex data such as Internet of Things (IoT).},

abstract={We introduce a new parallel computing and communication architecture, Reflex-Tree, with massive sensing, data processing, and control functions suitable for future smart cities. The central feature of the proposed Reflex-Tree architecture is inspired by a fundamental element of the human nervous system: reflex arcs, the neuromuscular reactions and instinctive motions of a part of the body in response to urgent situations. At the bottom level of the Reflex-Tree (layer 4), novel sensing devices are proposed that are controlled by low power processing elements. These "leaf" nodes are then connected to new classification engines based on machine learning techniques, including support vector machines (SVM), to form the third layer. The next layer up consists of servers that provide accurate control decisions via multi-layer adaptive learning and spatial-temporal association, before they are connected to the top level cloud where complex system behavior analysis is performed. Our multi-layered architecture mimics human neural circuits to achieve the high levels of parallelization and scalability required for efficient city-wide monitoring and feedback. To demonstrate the utility of our architecture, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of a prototype Reflex-Tree. City power supply network and gas pipeline management scenarios are used to drive our prototype as case studies. We show the effectiveness for several levels of the architecture and discuss the feasibility of implementation.},

Consequently, researchers in academia, industry and government continue to leverage on emerging technologies like software defined networking (SDN), blockchain, cloud computing and machine learning (ML) to improve the overall efficiency of these intelligent systems. Recently, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been used to enhance content caching and efficient resource allocation and therefore advance the development of data-intensive and delay-constrained applications that improve the driving experience in VCPS. Security and privacy concerns that endanger the safety of lives and infrastructure necessitate the need to use federated learning (FL), a distributed ML algorithm that employs learning at the edge to ensure that data remains at the different vehicles and thus enhance greater efficiency. In this paper therefore, we propose the use of FL, together with differential privacy to improve the resiliency of VCPS to adversarial attacks in connected vehicles.},

In this paper, we propose a clustering method to analyze textual data employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithms k-means and hierarchical clustering. We assess different vector representation methods for text, similarity metrics, and the number of clusters that best matches the data. We evaluate the methods using a real database of a public record service of security occurrences. The results show that the k-means algorithm using Euclidean distance extracts non-trivial knowledge, reaching up to 93% accuracy in a set of test samples while identifying the 12 most prevalent occurrence patterns.},

abstract={A vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) consists of moving and stationary vehicles, along with supporting infrastructure, which communicate with each other through a wireless medium. VANETs are an essential component of an Intelligent Transportation System, which aims to reduce road accidents and traffic congestion and provide additional services for drivers in future smart cities. VANET communication is vulnerable to various attacks and cryptographic techniques are used for message integrity and authentication of vehicles in order to ensure security and privacy for vehicular communications. Such approaches have been shown to be effective for outside attacks, where attackers do not have the credentials to participate in the network. However, if there is an inside attacker additional measures are necessary to ensure the correctness of the transmitted data. Position falsification is an attack where the attacker broadcasts a false position, which can lead to increased traffic congestion or even accidents. Therefore, it is imperative to detect such attacks quickly to ensure safety of all participants in the network. Several trust-based models have been proposed for this in the past. This paper proposes a novel and efficient data-centric approach to detect location spoofing, using machine learning algorithms. We have compared our proposed approach with several existing techniques using the VeReMi dataset and shown that its results improved performance in terms of detection accuracy and other key metrics.},

abstract={This work considers the use of a passive WiFi radar (PWR) to monitor human activities. Real-time uncooperative monitoring of people has numerous applications ranging from smart cities and transport to IoT and security. In e-healthcare, PWR technology could be used for ambient assisted living and early detection of chronic health conditions. Large training datasets could drive forward machine-learning-focused research in the above applications. However, generating and labeling large volumes of high-quality, diverse radar datasets is an onerous task. Therefore, we present an open-source motion capture data-driven simulation tool, SimHumalator, that can generate large volumes of human micro-Doppler radar data at multiple IEEE WiFi standards(IEEE 802.11g, n, and ad). We qualitatively compare the micro-Doppler signatures generated through SimHumalator with the measured signatures. To create a more realistic training dataset, we artificially add noise to our clean simulated spectrograms. A noise distribution is directly learned from real radar measurements using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We observe improvements in the classification performances between 3 to 8%. Our results suggest that simulation data can be used to make adequate training data when the available measurement training support is low.},

abstract={A map-matching algorithm outputs a vector per GPS point, projecting the moving object on one of the segments of the transportation network. Although developing more sophisticated map-matching algorithms for vehicle and pedestrian navigation systems have been the focus of research in this field, reusability of the historical information already provided by map-matching algorithms has not been addressed yet. In other words, although researchers have been attempting to improve the accuracy of the aforementioned vector to correctly project GPS points on the transportation network, no research has exploited the spatial-temporal pattern in the arrangement of these projection vectors. This pattern, if properly detected, can be used as a rough surrogate for map-matching algorithms, in addition to other applications that require better positional accuracy for moving objects in smart cities. This paper detects and validates the spatial-temporal pattern in projection vectors produced by map-matching algorithms via machine learning. Projection vectors showed a strong spatial-temporal pattern in Chicago, IL, USA, which was captured best via a local nonlinear regressor, K-nearest neighbors, and helped double the positional accuracy of unseen GPS points. While a global nonlinear regressor, multilayer Perceptron was able to slightly improve the positional accuracy of GPS points, the linear least squares had an exacerbating effect on the positional accuracy.},

abstract={Big data is an important factor almost in all nowadays technologies, such as, social media, smart cities, and internet of things. Most of standard classifiers tends to be trapped in local optima problem when dealing with such massive datasets. Hence, investigating new techniques for dealing with such massive data sets is required. This paper presents a novel imbalanced big data mining framework for improving optimization algorithms performance by eliminating the local optima problem consists of three main stages. Firstly, the preprocessing stage, which uses the LSH-SMOTE algorithm for solving the class imbalance problem, then it uses the LSH algorithm for hashing the data set instances into buckets. Secondly, the bucket search stage, which uses the GWO for training bidirectional recurrent neural network BRNN and searching for the global optimum in each bucket. Lastly, the final tournament winner stage, which uses the GWO+BRNN for finding the global optimum of the whole data set among all global optimums from all buckets. Our proposed framework LSHGWOBRNN has been tested over 9 data sets one of them is big data set in terms of AUC, MSE, against seven well-known machine-learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Tree, Decision Table, and AdaBoostM1, WOA+MLP, GWO+MLP, and WOA+BRNN), then, we tested our algorithm over four well-known data sets against GWO+MLP, ACO+MLP, GA+MLP, PSO+MLP, PBIL+MLP, and ES+MLP in terms of classification accuracy and MSE. Our experimental results have proved that our proposed framework LSHGWOBRNN has provided high local optima avoidance, and higher accuracy, less complexity and overhead.},

abstract={Smart cities should use computational systems to reduce human intervention in repetitive tasks as much as possible. Typically, solutions use adaptive applications to continuously and ubiquitously improve intelligent environments' services, optimizing the use of resources such as electricity or water. This letter evaluates different machine learning algorithms to detect occupancy in smart spaces in the presence of anomalous readings. Additionally, it presents a low-cost wireless sensor network (WSN) to collect the data and give the occupancy inference. We collect the environment data, with the presented WSN, in our university's laboratory. To verify the robustness of algorithms, we randomly insert anomalous sensor readings in the collected data through a Bernoulli distribution process. These anomalies represent different environment events or sensor failures. With these data, we evaluate the random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (Cart), and K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithms. The best performing algorithms were RF and k-NN, presenting close to 99% of accuracy in data without anomalies and 97% in data with 10% of anomalies. However, we observe an average execution time of 2.34 s to k-NN against 25.65 s to RF. Thus, considering our evaluated scenarios, we elect the k-NN as the best algorithm to detect occupation in smart spaces.},

abstract={The utility of the deployment of IoT sensor nodes in Smart Cities is mainly dependent on the accurate data generated by the sensors. Hence, automatic detection of sensor faults and self-calibration of the faulty sensors is essential for the uninterrupted operation of Sustainable IoT. This paper presents the sCalib technique for this purpose, considering the temperature sensors in a warehouse as an example. Suppose one of the sensors in the warehouse becomes inaccurate due to drift or similar reasons; in that case, sCalib can identify the fault and automatically calibrate the faulty sensor using another non-faulty sensor, which is placed nearby, as a standard sensor. The fault identification module was trained using several Machine Learning algorithms, among which the K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) produced highest accuracy results. The calibration module uses a straightforward algorithm, has low computational complexity and is capable of calibrating the sensor in a few minutes. This mechanism uses edge as a service for automatic fault detection and self-calibration and ensures that the deployed sensors can work for a long time without external interference.},

The driver and occupants of the vehicle access Internet, and different intelligent transportation system (ITS) related services such as real-time traffic information, parking space availability, downloading the map, etc., in a vehicle to infrastructure communication (V2I) mode. In a highly dynamic network environment like vehicular network, software-defined networking (SDN) promises to be an ideal solution. However, it also opens doors for various distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. An attacker can easily flood short-lived spoofed flows and exhaust network resources. This motivates us to find a solution to detect the attacks in a V2I communication under SDN. In this paper, we propose a machine learning (ML) based DDoS attack detection. The proposed system uses various ML schemes, and few of them found to be accurate with a high detection rate and a relatively low false alarm rate.},

abstract={The growth in low-cost, low-power sensing and communication technologies is creating a pervasive network infrastructure called the Internet of Things (IoT), which enables a wide range of physical objects and environments to be monitored in fine spatial and temporal detail. The detailed, dynamic data that can be collected from these devices provide the basis for new business and government applications in areas such as public safety, transport logistics and environmental management. There has been growing interest in the IoT for realising smart cities, in order to maximise the productivity and reliability of urban infrastructure, such as minimising road congestion and making better use of the limited car parking facilities. In this work, we consider two smart car parking scenarios based on real-time car parking information that has been collected and disseminated by the City of San Francisco, USA and the City of Melbourne, Australia. We present a prediction mechanism for the parking occupancy rate using three feature sets with selected parameters to illustrate the utility of these features. Furthermore, we analyse the relative strengths of different machine learning methods in using these features for prediction.},

abstract={Augmented Reality (AR) applications provide major opportunities for healthcare. Mental health rehabilitation in particular is an area that stands to gain from innovations in this field. Debilitating medical conditions related to traumatic brain injuries, aging, and drug abuse, can take advantage from the benefits that these applications provide. Coupled with IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) sensors and machine learning, effective system implementations that predict mental rehabilitation outcomes can be built. This can help in administering better treatment protocols. The collective use of these technologies for therapeutic approaches to alter patient behaviour at a physiological level falls in the emerging field of Digital Therapeutics (DT). In this paper, the current state of AR for mental health rehabilitation is described and used to motivate the implementation of a proof of concept mental DT rehabilitation system developed by us. Similar AR-IoMT systems can reduce inpatient counts in smart cities where an increase in aging populations is already a concern, and existing healthcare resources may be clogged up due to minor inpatient health checkups. In addition, the paper discusses the deployment challenges of the implemented system, which include the lack and need thereof of a standardized protocol for IoMT data collection and analysis for cross interoperability across different healthcare providers and vendors.},

In this context, we study a novel and complex traffic data set and explore the potential to apply big data and machine learning analysis. We evaluate several hypotheses and find that the availability of big data is able to facilitate more accurate predictions. Furthermore, we find that spatial aspects have more influence than temporal ones and that careful choice of thresholding parameters is crucial for high performance classification.},

abstract={Agriculture is the most fundamental and essential occupation for every human being. Without agriculture there is no living being, au are chained through web of life. In India agriculture is the main occupation, around 67% of people involving in agriculture. Inventors release many smart technologies in all the field like health sector, automobiles, education, etc. to improve our life styles and make our work easy. In the same way farmers also started to use smart technologies in the field of agriculture to improve the cultivation productivity. Recently the cities are transformed to smart cities through advanced technologies, similarly agriculture also turns slowly into technology enabled farming. Many farmers practicing green farming technologies to improve the production rate. In this regards, this paper proposes a model to select the appropriate crop for cultivation and predict the production rate using the weather parameters which are very much influencing the agriculture. Random Forest algorithm is the widely used machine learning algorithm for classification and prediction. The outcome of Random Forest is compared with Support Vector Machine algorithm The authors concluded that the proposed model works on average accuracy of 90%.},

abstract={VLC based indoor positioning system is a natural choice thanks to LED technology and future trend. We can reuse existing LED lighting installations to design an appropriate scheme to provide indoor localization. By receiving basic information such as the light intensity and knowing the position of the transmitters for example through Visible Light Communication (VLC), one can estimate its position with the potential of high accuracy. In this paper, we use a multi-color sensor and build an indoor localization system based on the light fingerprint, which is suitable for smart cities and homes, health-care centers, hospitals or similar. There are, however, several practical problems that make it a technology that is not yet sufficiently developed to be used in our everyday life. In this paper, a new perspective is given by looking into indoor localization using multi-color fingerprinting and different machine learning methods. Experiment results have shown its effectiveness and potentials with mean localization errors of around ten centimeters.},

abstract={The Internet of Things [IoT] promises to revolutionize the way we interact with our surroundings. Smart cars, smart cities, smart homes are now being realized with the help of various embedded devices that operate with little to no human interaction. However these embedded devices bring forth a plethora of security challenges as most manufacturers still assign higher importance to the three Ps (prototyping, production and performance) than security. This inherent flaw has manifested itself in the form of various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks orchestrated with the help of unsolicited IoT devices on the Internet. We are even seeing massive throughputs without the need for amplifications affecting large scale infrastructures on the Internet. Thus, understanding the nature of these attacks and quickly identifying infected devices becomes imperative to combat this situation. In this paper we present a model to classify unsolicited IoT devices in enterprises using machine learning (ML). Namely IP header information from darknet data is collected for analysis. We then consider multiple supervised ML algorithms to classify these Layer 3 headers. We evaluate these algorithms and compare their performances in terms of accurately identifying activities of malicious IoT devices on the Internet. Our results show that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting have high recall and precision scores whereas NaiveBayes has the worst performance. We believe our model can be used by enterprises as a part of their intrusion detection system to quickly identify infected IoT devices within their own environment as well as identify scanning activities directed towards them.},

In this work, we present a cloud-based system architecture for advanced electric metering in smart cities, whose purpose is to achieve better management of electric energy use by consumers and an efficient balance between demand and consumption by utilities. In our approach, in addition to energy consumption data (kilowatt-hour), other electrical parameters (e.g., current, power factor, active and reactive power) are collected in real-time from smart meters for storage and deeper analyses in a big data ecosystem. Moreover, we introduce the smart gateway (sGateway), a component of the system architecture to provide local processing and to simplify the communication between smart meters and the cloud processing system.},

abstract={Intelligent transportation is a cornerstone of smart cities' infrastructure. Its practical realisation has been attempted by various technological means (ranging from machine learning to evolutionary approaches), all aimed at informing urban decision making (e.g., road layout design), in environmentally and financially sustainable ways. In this paper, we focus on traffic modelling and prediction, both central to intelligent transportation. We formulate this challenge as a symbolic regression problem and solve it using Genetic Programming, which we enhance with a lag operator and transfer learning. The resulting algorithm utilises knowledge collected from other road segments in order to predict vehicle flow through a junction where traffic data are not available. The experimental results obtained on the Darmstadt case study show that our approach is successful at producing accurate models without increasing training time.},
