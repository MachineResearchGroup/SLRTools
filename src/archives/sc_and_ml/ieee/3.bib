abstract={In the recent scenarios, the application of new technologies, tools and computers plays a prominent role in the learning as well as teaching. E-learning (Electronic learning) is considered as the most important mechanism for knowledge sharing in various application domains, especially in the education field. Accessibility of learning materials at their users own comfortable time, space independent, mode of study and feedback options are the major benefits that makes students to learn conveniently in the e-learning environment. From different sources, it is understood that, there is a remarkable digital divide among urban and rural areas education in Morocco, this issue is taken as field of interest. The main challenges affecting the school education in rural areas are accessibility of educational resources, security for girl children and offers cultural aspects. Moreover, education in rural areas is more gendered than in urban areas due to cultural practices and beliefs especially within rural areas of the African continent. This further restriction to education for girls and women highlights the complicated nature of tackling the issue on a worldwide scale. The objective of this research is to propose an electronic learning (e-learning) portal using open source technologies to provide digital learning platform that motivate rural women participation in learning and empower human development in the rural areas. A framework of intelligent e-learning model based on Intelligent Decision Tree (ID3) algorithm is introduced to conduct a qualitative analysis on the student's online learning behaviors in the e-learning portal. It offers e-learning services to promote modern education in the remote areas of Morocco within the framework of e-douar project and frugal Inclusive Social Collaborative Smart City Casablanca in collaboration with Avinashilingam University for Women, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.},

abstract={Thanks to advances in Internet of Things and crowd-sensing, it is possible to collect vast amounts of urban data, to better understand how citizens interact with cities and, in turn, improve human well-being in urban environments. This is a scientifically challenging proposition, as it requires new methods to fuse objective (heterogeneous) data (e.g. people location trails and sensors data) with subjective (perceptual) data (e.g. the citizens’ quality of experience collected through feedback forms). When it comes to vast urban areas, collecting statistically significant data is a daunting task; thus new data-collection methods are required too. In this work, we turn to artificial intelligence (AI) to address these challenges, introducing a method whereby the objective, sensor data is analyzed in real-time to scope down the test matrix of the subjective questionnaires. In turn, subjective responses are parsed through AI models to extract further objective information. The outcome is an interactive data analysis framework for urban environments, which we put to test in the context of a citizens’ well-being project. In our pilot study, each new entry (objective or subjective) is parsed through the AI engine to determine which action maximizes the information gain. This translates into a particular question being fired at a specific moment and place, to a specific person. With our AI data collection method, we can reach statistical significance much faster, achieving (in our city-wide pilot study) a 41% acceleration factor and a 75% reduction in intrusiveness. Our study opens new avenues in urban science, with potential applications in urban planning, citizen’s well-being projects, and sociology, to mention but a few cases.},

abstract={This paper introduces a work in progress, where we intend to investigate the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and online Supervised Learning (SL) to achieve energy optimization in District-Heating (DH) systems. We believe RL is an ideal approach since this task falls under the control-optimization problem where RL has yielded optimal results in previous work. The magnitude and scale of a DH system complexity incurs the curse of dimensionalities and model, hereby making RL a good choice since it provides a solution for the problem. To assist RL even further with the curse of dimensionalities, we intend to investigate the use of SL to reduce the state space. To achieve this, we shall use historical data to generate a heat load sub-model for each home. We believe using the output of these sub-models as feedback to the RL algorithm could significantly reduce the complexity of the learning task. Also, it could reduce convergence time for the RL algorithm. The desired goal is to achieve a realtime application, which takes operational actions when it receives new direct feedback. However, considering the dynamics of DH system such as large time delay and dissipation in DH network due to various factors, we hope to investigate things such as the appropriate data sampling rate and new parameters / sensors that could improve knowledge about the state of the system, especially on the consumer side of the DH network.},

abstract={Air pollution seriously damages human health on a large scale. Although earlier works have improved a variety of predictive models of air pollution, the ability to accurately predict air pollution indices remains elusive. Time series prediction plays an important role in many fields. Some predecessors have experimented with artificial neural networks (NNs), combining linear autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models with nonlinear NN models. The typical assumption is that time series has a long signal with no white noise. However, a real-time short signal with white noise is common. The methods in the literature also do not guarantee that the prediction error of an NN model is minimized. Therefore, we propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to predict future PM2.5 values. First, we use the Q-learning algorithm in RL based on its state characteristics on the NN model. Second, we select the input with different input dimensions and values of time delay, calculate the best strategy, and evaluate the computational complexity of our RL algorithm. Finally, we show that we effectively reduce the prediction error of the NN models.},

abstract={As an alternative means of convenient and smart transportation, mobility-on-demand (MOD), typified by online ride-sharing and connected taxicabs, has been rapidly growing and spreading worldwide. The large volume of complex traffic and the uncertainty of market supplies/demands have made it essential for many MOD service providers to proactively dispatch vehicles towards ride-seekers. To meet this need effectively, we propose STRide, an MOD coordination learning mechanism reinforced spatio-temporally with capsules. We formalize the adaptive coordination of vehicles into a reinforcement learning framework. STRide incorporates spatial and temporal distributions of supplies (vehicles) and demands (ride requests), customers’ preferences and other external factors. A novel spatio-temporal capsule neural network is designed to predict the provider’s rewards based on MOD network states, vehicles and their dispatch actions. This way, the MOD platform adapts itself to the supply-demand dynamics with the best potential rewards. We have conducted extensive data analytics and experimental evaluation with five large-scale datasets ($\sim$∼27 million rides from Uber, NYC/Chicago Taxis, Didi and Car2Go). STRide is shown to outperform state-of-the-arts, substantially reducing request-rejection rate and passenger waiting time, and also increasing the service provider’s profits.},

abstract={Information and communication technologies have been widely used to achieve the objective of smart city development. A smart air quality sensing and forecasting system is an important part of a smart city. One of the major challenges in designing such a forecast system is ensuring high accuracy and an acceptable computation time. In this paper, we show that it is possible to accurately forecast fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations with low computation time by using different clustering techniques. An Internet of Things framework comprising of Airbox devices for PM2.5 monitoring has been used to acquire the data. Our main focus is to achieve high forecasting accuracy with reduced computation time. We use a hybrid model to do the forecast and a grid based system to cluster the monitoring stations based on the geographical distance. The experiments and evaluation is done using Airbox devices data from 557 stations deployed all over Taiwan. We are able to demonstrate that a proper clustering based on geographical distance can reduce the forecasting error rate and also the computation time. Also, in order to further evaluate our system, we have applied wavelet-based clustering to group the monitoring stations. A final comparative analysis is done for different clustering schemes with respect to accuracy and computational time.},

abstract={In many developing countries, rapid urbanisation of cities coupled with the lack of proper urban planning has made various streets susceptible to waterlogging during heavy rains. This severely affects the traffic movement across an entire city and leads to disruption in work. Since an important component of smart cities is developing an efficient urban mobility system, the authors have developed a method which helps in detection of areas prone to waterlogging and prediction of severity of waterlogging in these areas in the future. The areas susceptible to waterlogging are detected with the help of elevation of the area and the past travel time data. Elevation of an area is an indicator of the level or height of an area, so the low-lying areas are more prone to accumulation of water when it rains. Similarly, the past travel time data of an area also serves as a measure to find out the intensity of water logging as the larger the accumulation of water in an area, the more is the travel time. The past data pertaining to waterlogging severity in an area with respect to parameters such as the amount of rainfall and day of the week is used to train a neural network, which is then used to predict the possibility of waterlogging and its intensity in that area in the future.},

abstract={In developing effective public security policies, two aspects are essential: intelligence and information. In this context, the classification of Macrocauses can help governments better understand some aspects of public security related to the analysis of violent crimes in a state. In the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), these analyses are currently done by analyzing raw data done by an expert without any specific auxiliary system, known as traditional approaches. It is a time-consuming task, and different experts may have different views on the same case. With this in mind, in this work, we intend to assist these criminal experts by providing a predictive model that classifies the Macrocauses of crimes into a set of pre-defined types to guide the work of the experts and, as a consequence, to speed up the analysis and management processes. Thus, a feature preprocessing was performed in which three different classification techniques are analyzed. The results show that when using XGBoost, the model accuracy reached 0.932378, which is considered excellent for this application.},

pages={76728-76740},
abstract={Posted road speed limits contribute to the safety of driving, yet when certain driving conditions occur, such as fog or severe darkness, they become less meaningful to the drivers. To overcome this limitation, there is a need for adaptive speed limits system to improve road safety under varying driving conditions. In that vein, a visibility range estimation algorithm for real-time adaptive speed limits control in intelligent transportation systems is proposed in this paper. The information required to specify the speed limit is captured via a road side unit that collects environmental data and captures road images, which are then analyzed locally or on the cloud. The proposed analysis is performed using two image processing algorithms, namely, the improved dark channel prior (DCP) and weighted image entropy (WIE), and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to produce a visibility indicator in real-time. Results obtained from the analysis of various parts of highways in Canada, provided by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, show that the proposed technique can generate credible visibility indicators to motorists. The analytical results corroborated by extensive field measurements confirmed the advantage of the proposed system when compared to other visibility estimation methods such as the conventional DCP and WIE, where the proposed system results exhibit about 25% accuracy enhancement over the other considered techniques. Moreover, the proposed DCP is about 26% faster than the conventional DCP. The obtained promising results potentiate the integration of the proposed technique in real-life scenarios.},

Specifically, it describes our research on mining urban ordinances or local laws and the public reactions to them expressed on the social media site Twitter. We mine ordinances and tweets related to each other through their mutual connection with Smart City Characteristics (SCCs) and conduct sentiment analysis of relevant tweets for analyzing opinions of the public on local laws in the given urban region. This helps assess how well that region heads towards a Smart City based on (1) how closely ordinances map to the respective SCCs and (2) the extent of public satisfaction on ordinances related to those SCCs. The mining process relies on Commonsense Knowledge (CSK), i.e., knowledge that is obvious to humans but needs to be explicitly fed into machines for automation. CSK is useful in filtering during tweet selection, conducting SCC-based ordinancetweet mapping and performing sentiment analysis of tweets. This paper presents our work in mapping ordinances to tweets through single or multiple SCCs and opinion mining of tweets along with an experimental evaluation and a discussion with useful recommendations.},

abstract={With rampant urbanization and industrialization, the quest to become a Smart City is in vogue. Elaborate designs, ideas, and solutions to existing problems are being devised. However, in this race, city planners often neglect the most critical factor related to one’s existence on the Earth, i.e., Sustainability. Designing smart and sustainable cities is a challenge whose solutions are not easy. Also, developing a proposed smart city is a time-consuming process as it involves its foundations, analyzing the needs, latest technology, infrastructure, and topography. This paper aims to analyze the patterns followed by cities worldwide in the quest to make smart cities. This shall also show how newer cities can become innovative based on the work already done by the existing cities through the concept of Inheritance. In order to do this, a dataset comprising 102 cities is analyzed based on six metrics. A combination of the Principal Component Analysis and K-means Clustering technique is used to assist with the analysis of this unlabeled dataset. It is thereby shown that these 102 cities can be identified as belonging to 4 clusters and the cluster properties can then be inherited by any new city poised to become a future smart city.},

The external factors and internal factors influencing the heat load in substations are parameters used as our model's input. Short-term forecast models are generated using four supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Regression Tree, Feed Forwards Neural Network (FFNN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Performance comparison among these ML methods was carried out. The effects of combining the internal and external factors influencing heat load at substations was studied. The models are evaluated with varying horizon up to 24-hours ahead. The results show that SVR has the best accuracy of 5.6% MAPE for the best-case scenario.},

The system uses deviations in the Wi-Fi signals strength to predict the presence of a vehicle on the road and its type (car, bus). The study further systematically compares six analytical techniques for the classification of detected vehicles. The methods were tested with data from three road scenarios in the city of Münster, Germany. Vehicle classification accuracy ranged from 83% up to 100% in our study. We also observed that a higher Wi-Fi frequency (5 GHz) was superior to the 2.4 GHz for improving the overall vehicle detection and the results of the classification algorithms.

abstract={Cities are facing increasingly significant sustainability issues in the face of growing populations and climate change. At the center of many cities plans to address sustainability issues, are plans for urban canopy development (i.e. increases the number of trees in cities). In this paper, we propose an approach to educate residents about the environmental and socio-economic benefits of trees in urban settings and incentivize tree growth in cities. In addition to environmental benefits, trees have been shown to have many significant socio-economic benefits (e.g. real estate values, pedestrian traffic, motor traffic, and many other aspects of urban life) [1], [2], [3]. Our approach can also be leveraged to encourage resident participation in city tree development programs, such as Free Tree Programs [4]. By quantifying and displaying tree environmental and economic benefits at the selected locations on an interactive map, citizens and policymakers can determine the best locations to plant trees in the city. The system aggregates data from the distributed city sensors to model tree benefits and provide an overall score which quantifies the benefit of planting a tree(s) at a given location(s). The system models tree benefits by taking historical data from the pedestrian, environmental, and traffic sensors to predict the potential impacts (e.g. carbon reduction, evapotranspiration, average pedestrian traffic, and average vehicular traffic, property values, ) of a tree(s) at a given location(s) [1], [2], [3], [5]. By using the system, citizens learn about the positive effects of having trees in their neighborhood and policy makers may also better conduct city planning and develop urban policies/strategies to maximize the impact of trees in their communities. Results show moderate to strong correlations between a sample of key socio-economic parameters and trees.},

abstract={As sensors are adopted in almost all fields of life, the Internet of Things (IoT) is triggering a massive influx of data. We need efficient and scalable methods to process this data to gain valuable insight and take timely action. Existing approaches which support both batch processing (suitable for analysis of large historical data sets) and event processing (suitable for realtime analysis) are complex. We propose the hut architecture, a simple but scalable architecture for ingesting and analyzing IoT data, which uses historical data analysis to provide context for real-time analysis. We implement our architecture using open source components optimized for Big Data applications and extend them, where needed. We demonstrate our solution on two real-world smart city use cases in transportation and energy management.},

abstract={IoT is quickly becoming a popular field of IT and the digital world, presenting new research prospects in the ambit of devices and applications connected via internet. Several academics have previously proved their work in this field by employing Machine Learning techniques and algorithms as a subset of AI to fully implement large volumes of data. IOT is considered as a platform where devices are connected together through internet as a medium and by using sensors, data is captured which adds digital intelligence. Data can be access anytime and from anywhere. The need for such devices that can not only store data but also analyzeit and take quick action is growing by the day. Machine learning which makes smart system after adding intelligence to it, makes IOT more smart, responsive and action oriented. Using machine learning we can detect the slightest changes and warn against any type of malfunctioning. Predictive Analysis is added advantage which acts as gift from Machine learning to IOT. This analysis is done in real-time and the results can be displayed on the Smartphone in a few seconds. Though IOT and Machine leaning are powerful tools as an alone but combination of both the technologies is much more which is yet to be explored.},

abstract={Cities are growing and, therefore, the primary needs, such as the energy resources. Hence, managing them in the proper way becomes essential for a sustainable growth. This paper proposes a data-driven tool based on IoT data with the aim of reducing the gap between demand and consumption, minimizing the energy losses. Smart and efficient energy planning is the ultimate objective, where the final energy usage is fitted into the predicted demand. One day time horizon is used in order to provide energy managers, ESCOs or urban planners with an accurate forecast about the required energy. This service will be available on the urban platform of Vitoria under the context of the SmartEnCity project (GA # 691883). However, the training data has been captured from CITyFiED project (GA # 609129), which is energetically speaking similar. The city elements included in the training model have been characterized based on data from combined static and dynamic data to adapt the context through machine-learning techniques.},

abstract={Power Grid failures have the potential to drastically affect the population be it a localized outage or a large-scale blackout. Pre-event planning currently consists of preparation for all scenarios and some enthusiastic prognoses, leading to most resources spreading thin. Focus on a specific area of concern typically follows large scale power grid failures as post event analysis and does not include an overall analysis. In this study, a neural network is used to conduct “pre-event” analysis of a power grid to determine if it is susceptible to failure. This research study demonstrates that overall “pre-event” analysis can be beneficial with the use of a machine learning agent. The agent can also be used to determine areas that need the most attention. Future work with larger number of constraints and additional machine learning algorithms will be explored to further improve power grid analysis and performance.},

abstract={We propose in this paper an outdoor positioning system based on Wi-SUN FAN network, the goal of which is to protect the elderly, young children and even pets via estimating their locations in a city. In order to achieve long-term portability and network-side positioning, the system does not directly rely on GPS receiver mounted on terminals but use machine learning for location estimation via the received signal strength indication (RSSI) measurements. In particular, the system consists of Wi-SUN beacons, Wi-SUN base-stations and vehicular devices. A beacon, attached to the one to be positioned, broadcasts wireless signal periodically so that its location can be estimated using machine learning algorithms from the RSSIs measured at multiple base-stations that are densely deployed over a city to construct an ad hoc network. Using the mobility of vehicles that roam over a city routinely, such like garbage collection trucks, buses and taxies. Vehicular devices containing both a Wi-SUN beacon and a GPS are used to collect RSSIs and the corresponding GPS coordinates to train the estimation models. We develop a prototype system consisting of 9 base-stations and deploy it to our university campus to conduct a field experiment to validate the proposed approach. Offline analysis on the data collected from the experiment showed that a RandomForest learner performs best among four selected learning algorithms using the default parameters of Weka 3.8, which achieves a mean absolute error of 35.43m and a root mean squared error of 44.21m, respectively. Evaluation on network performance is also conducted.},

The proposed day-ahead forecasting approach is based on a hybrid model consisting of Imperialistic Competitive Algorithm (ICA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is built using two years (2015 - 2016) of hourly data from various buildings in the Otaniemi area of Espoo, Finland. Day-ahead forecast models are also developed using Persistence and four other AI based techniques. Comparative forecasting performance analysis among these techniques was performed. The proposed ICA-SVM heat demand forecasting model is tested and validated using an out-of-sample one-year (2017) hourly data of the buildings' district heat consumption. The prediction results are presented for the out-of-sample testing days in a one-hour time interval. The validation results demonstrate that the devised model is able to predict the buildings' heat demand with an improved accuracy and short computation time. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates outperformed prediction accuracy improvement, compared to the other five evaluated models.},

abstract={Road transportation is the backbone of modern societies, yet it costs annually over a million deaths and trillions of dollars to the global economy. Social media such as Twitter have increasingly become an important source of information in many dimensions of smart societies. Automatic detection of road traffic events using Twitter data mining is one such area of a great many applications and enormous potential, albeit facing major challenges concerning the management and analysis of big data (volume, velocity, variety, and veracity). Various approaches on the subject have been proposed in recent years, but the methods and outcomes are in their infancy. This paper proposes a method for automatic detection of road traffic related events from tweets in the Saudi dialect using machine learning and big data technologies. Firstly, we build and train a classifier using three machine learning algorithms, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and logistic regression, to filter tweets into relevant and irrelevant. Subsequently, we train other classifiers to detect multiple types of events including accident, roadwork, road closure, road damage, traffic condition, fire, weather, and social events. The results from the analysis of one million tweets show that our method is able to detect road traffic events, as well as their location and time, automatically, without any prior knowledge of the events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on traffic event detection from Arabic tweets using machine learning and the Apache Spark big data platform.},

abstract={Fuel poverty has a negative impact on the wellbeing of individuals within a household; affecting not only comfort levels but also increased levels of seasonal mortality. Wellbeing solutions within this sector are moving towards identifying how the needs of people in vulnerable situations can be improved or monitored by means of existing supply networks and public institutions. Therefore, the focus of this research is towards wellbeing monitoring solution, through the analysis of gas smart meter data. Gas smart meters replace the traditional analogue electro-mechanical and diaphragm-based meters that required regular reading. They have received widespread popularity over the last 10 years. This is primarily due to the fact that by using this technology, customers are able to adapt their consumption behaviours based on real-time information provided by In-Home Devices. Yet, the granular nature of the datasets generated has also meant that this technology is ideal for further scalable wellbeing monitoring applications. For example, the autonomous detection of households at risk of energy poverty is possible and of growing importance in order to face up to the impacts of fuel poverty, quality of life and wellbeing of low-income housing. However, despite their popularity (smart meters), the analysis of gas smart meter data has been neglected. In this paper, an ensemble model is proposed to achieve autonomous detection, supported by four key measures from gas usage patterns, consisting of i) a tariff detection, ii) a temporally-aware tariff detection, iii) a routine consumption detection and iv) an age-group detection. Using a cloud-based machine learning platform, the proposed approach yielded promising classification results of up to 84.1% Area Under Curve (AUC), when the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was utilised.},

The DSS leverages advanced analytics of electric smart meter (ESM) network communication-quality data to improve cost predictions for smart meter field operations and provide actionable decision recommendations regarding whether to send a technician to a customer location to resolve an ESM issue. The model is empirically evaluated using data sets from a commercial network. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach with a complete Bayesian network prediction model and compare with three machine learning prediction model classifiers: 1) Naïve Bayes; 2) random forest; and 3) decision tree. Results demonstrate that our approach generates statistically noteworthy estimations and that the DSS will improve the cost efficiency of ESM network operations and maintenance.},

abstract={Twitter is a social network, which contains information of the city events (concerts, festival, etc.), city problems (traffic, collision, and road incident), the news, feelings of people, etc. For these reasons, there are many studies, which use tweet data to detect useful information to support the smart city management. In this paper, the ways of finding citizen problems with their locations by using tweet data is discussed. Tweets in Turkish language from the Aegean Region of Turkey were used for the study. It is aimed to form a smart system, which detects problems of citizens and extracts the problems' exact locations from tweet texts. Firstly, the collected data was analyzed to get information of any city event, citizen's complaint or requests about a problem. After the possibility of detecting tweets, which have any city problem, was ensured, two datasets were created. The first one consists of the tweets that have an event information or a problem and the second one has the tweets, which have other information not related to our study. Then Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the annotated tweets and was tested on a separate set of tweets. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure of the classifier is given. A location recognizer, which finds the Turkish place names in a text, is created and applied on the tweets that are marked as information-containing by the classifier to detect the location of the problem precisely. The first findings of the project is promising. The high accuracy, which is obtained by the classifier, shows that it is proper to use this classifier for our study. The location recognizer is planned to be improved and place names on the real-time tweet data is to be detected.},

abstract={The development of sensor technologies and an explosion of the inexpensive electronic circuit, the Internet of Things (IoT) is emergent as an encouraging innovation to comprehend sustainable smart city.

However, security is one of the critical problems of a smart city. These emerging smart infrastructure and applications based on IoT can benefit users only if vital private and secure features are guaranteed. Hence, in this paper, Blockchain-enabled Privacy-Preserving Access Control System (BPACS) has been suggested for IoT data in a smart city environment. This study utilizes blockchain methods to construct a reliable and secure data-sharing policy between numerous data providers, where IoT information is encoded and then verified on disseminated ledgers. Furthermore, this study design protected construction blocks, like secure comparison and secure polynomial multiplications, by retaining cryptosystems and build a secure Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) training algorithms. Hard security analysis proves that the suggested model guarantees the privacy of the sensitive information for every data provider and the SVM and PCA model variables for data analysts.},

abstract={Popularity of smart devices has led to increasing use of social networking services for various purposes. Despite its benefits, the ubiquity of social network services introduces vulnerabilities to malicious behavior such as Sybil attacks or identity theft. As the 5G Era leads to the convergence of social, wireless, and mobile networks by enabling synergistic interplay between these networks, it is possible to take advantage of mobile edge computing in the detection of compromised social profiles in mobile and online social network platforms. In this paper, we propose a framework for participatory detection of identity theft on social networking platforms which would exploit the computing power of the user equipment. The proposed framework empowers the connections of a user in a social platform to cooperate on the verification of a social profile. Through a proof-of-concept study, we show that the proposed framework can detect anomalous behavior in the social profile by having each connection work on a different feature subset without semantic analysis. Our numerical results show that if the initial matching threshold in a decision tree is set properly, compromised accounts can be identified by the mobile platforms of the connections without undergoing heavy central processing.},

abstract={Our paper aims to build a classification-model which delineates the typical motion-related activities performed at a metro station using smart phone sensors. We focus on typical movements, such as climbing the stairs or moving in the lift, waiting at security, waiting at the turnstile to check out and, moving on platform while waiting for a train. Such a classifier estimates crowd levels in a metro-station (and metro trains in an indirect sense), thereby adding towards the vision of efficient metro travel. However, building such a classification-model is challenging due to non-trivial decision boundaries among the classes of interest. Our experiments revealed that the best accuracy that a traditional multi-class classifier could obtain was 0.58, for a four-class classifier. To this end, we proposed a hierarchical approach of classification which divides the multi-class problem at hand into a set of manageable two-class classification problems. These two-class classifiers are then put together, in a hierarchy, to give an end-to-end solution which takes sensors values from the phone and predicts the class of motion being observed. Our model obtained an accuracy of around 0.75, a significantly higher value, on the real-data collected at Delhi Metro stations. The same classifiers can potentially be applied to detect crowd levels at train stations and bus depots, which will make transportation efficient in smart cities.},

For achieving that, in this work is presented the implementation of a fully integrated system capable to handle and process streaming data in order to generate an alert response for each generated event. The deployment stated are composed by a simulated wireless sensor network for generating environmental values, a centralized Kafka server for data segmentation and a machine learning model deployed in a Spark cluster for generating the emergency alerts. Also, a simulation was conducted assuming that a fire had affected the simulated scenario in order to determine and evaluate the system's behavior.

abstract={This paper represents an overview on activities done in real Smart Cities scenarios using IoT Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Nowadays, there are several use cases related to IoT for ITS, such as connected and autonomous vehicles, cooperative transportation networks and smart roads in order to improve data propagation, create heterogeneous connectivity and low latency applications in high capacity environments. ITS techniques can be also applied on logistics, so accuracy on delivery and timing can be improved consider all the involved ecosystems, baseline and standardized architectures in interconnected Smart Cities for future development and integration. Secure correlations between vehicles and smart roads can optimize road safety and traffic flow, reduce incidents, avoid congestions etc. These technologies comprise also V2X (Vehicle to Everything). In this scenario, the cloud-based LoRa (Long Range) and mesh networks technologies, can play an important role for the propagation of intelligent sensed data and localization. The Smart Roads scenario is considered as one of the most attractive field in a Smart City environment. The right choice on technology, delay and frequency represents an important factor to be considered for standardization and engineering activities.},

abstract={This paper addresses vehicle tracking using an approach based on the $\mathbf{DAB }+$ standard, which is becoming increasingly popular in private vehicles as an alternative to the old FM radio standard. The digital standard allows the use of different contents useful to the driver. On the other hand, the bidirectional channel of the $\mathbf{DAB }+$ standard could allow the vehicle to transmit generic information. The aim of this work is to transmit some parameters of the radio channel to allow the identification and tracking of vehicle position. By means of a neural network it is possible to reconstruct the path of the vehicles through a maximum likelihood comparison between data contained in a data-set and the information offered by the vehicles in real time. Experimental tests conducted on the road have shown how it is possible to obtain a high accuracy of vehicle traffic in a transparent manner and with respect for the processing of personal data in accordance with current European legislation.},

pages={110-115},
abstract={Meeting user demand is one of the most challenging problems arising in public bicycle sharing systems. Various factors, such as daily commuting patterns or topographical conditions, can lead to an unbalanced state where the numbers of rented and returned bicycles differ significantly among the stations. This can cause spatial imbalance of the bicycle inventory which becomes critical when stations run completely empty or full, and thus prevent users from renting or returning bicycles. To prevent such service disruptions, we propose to forecast user demand in terms of expected number of bicycle rentals and returns and accordingly to estimate number of bicycles that need to be manually redistributed among the stations by maintenance vehicles. As opposed to traditional solutions to this problem, which rely on short-term demand forecasts, we aim to maximise the time within which the stations remain balanced by forecasting user demand multiple steps ahead of time. We propose a multi-input multi-output deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory networks to forecast user demand over long future horizons. Conducted experimental study over real-world dataset confirms the efficiency and accuracy of our approach.},

abstract={Can we inspect the road condition at a low cost? City infrastructures, such as roads are very important for citizens to their city lives. Roads require constant inspection and repair due to deterioration, but it is expensive to do so with manual labor. Meanwhile, there are official city vehicles, especially garbage trucks that run through the entire area of a city every day and have cameras to record their driving. When we use these cameras, we can watch roads conditions anytime, anywhere. In our study, we focus on these cameras and attempt detecting the road damage, such as road marking blur. To achieve our goal, we explore the new system in this paper. This system adopts the object detection approach that is end-to-end learning and based on deep neural networks, which propose the blur region candidate and detect whether the road markings are blurred or not all at once. In our experiment, first, we obtain the drive recorder video from sanitation engineer and then annotate them. After annotation, we trained our models and calculate the mean average precision to evaluate our models. As a result, our model performs on our collected dataset.},

abstract={Estimating the 3D position and orientation of objects in the environment with a single RGB camera is a critical and challenging task for low-cost urban autonomous driving and mobile robots. Most of the existing algorithms are based on the geometric constraints in 2D-3D correspondence, which stems from generic 6D object pose estimation. We first identify how the ground plane provides additional clues in depth reasoning in 3D detection in driving scenes. Based on this observation, we then improve the processing of 3D anchors and introduce a novel neural network module to fully utilize such application-specific priors in the framework of deep learning. Finally, we introduce an efficient neural network embedded with the proposed module for 3D object detection. We further verify the power of the proposed module with a neural network designed for monocular depth prediction. The two proposed networks achieve state-of-the-art performances on the KITTI 3D object detection and depth prediction benchmarks, respectively.},

abstract={Exploiting multi-scale features has shown great potential in tackling semantic segmentation problems. The aggregation is commonly done with sum or concatenation (concat) followed by convolutional (conv) layers. However, it fully passes down the high-level context to the following hierarchy without considering their interrelation. In this work, we aim to enable the low-level feature to aggregate the complementary context from adjacent high-level feature maps by a cross-scale pixel-to-region relation operation. We leverage cross-scale context propagation to make the long-range dependency capturable even by the high-resolution low-level features. To this end, we employ an efficient feature pyramid network to obtain multi-scale features. We propose a Relational Semantics Extractor (RSE) and Relational Semantics Propagator (RSP) for context extraction and propagation respectively. Then we stack several RSP into an RSP head to achieve the progressive top-down distribution of the context. Experiment results on two challenging datasets Cityscapes and COCO demonstrate that the RSP head performs competitively on both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation with high efficiency. It outperforms DeeplabV3 [1] by 0.7% with 75% fewer FLOPs (multiply-adds) in the semantic segmentation task.},

abstract={Urban commerce and its distribution have always been an important part of urban research. However, most previous studies were based on statistical data and did not reflect real street experience. Thanks to the Street View image and deep learning technology, researchers are able to carry out large scale studies from real human visual experience. In this article, we aim at sensing the commercial spaces in cities. In order to achieve this ultimate goal, deep learning is applied to process the raw data of Street View image. We disassemble the goal into three tasks: firstly, obtaining all the Street View images in a specific area; then classifying the Street View images according to the commercial facilities in it; and finally creating a visualization of the detected data into a map. For the first task, we get the road network coordinate information from the openstreetmap (OSM) website, set the sampling point on the road, and then download the Street View images of the sampling points' coordinate through the API provided by Baidumap. For the second task, we adopt a two-level learning strategy rather than directly using Deep Convolutional Neural Network for classification. For the final task, we choose the heat map as the expression of the results and draw the map by the existing GIS software. Furthermore, the results from this study can be conveniently combined with other data because of the use of street-network-based data structure. An application of this method combines with street-network data, the calculation of a city's 15-minute commercial service circle coverage is also shown in this study.},

abstract={In this paper, we study how to model taxi drivers' behavior and geographical information for an interesting and challenging task: the next destination prediction in a taxi journey. Predicting the next location is a well-studied problem in human mobility, which finds several applications in real-world scenarios, from optimizing the efficiency of electronic dispatching systems to predicting and reducing the traffic jam. This task is normally modeled as a multiclass classification problem, where the goal is to select, among a set of already known locations, the next taxi destination. We present a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approach that models the taxi drivers' behavior and encodes the semantics of visited locations by using geographical information from Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs). In particular, the RNNs are trained to predict the exact coordinates of the next destination, overcoming the problem of producing, in output, a limited set of locations, seen during the training phase. The proposed approach was tested on the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge 2015 dataset-based on the city of Porto-, obtaining better results with respect to the competition winner, whilst using less information, and on Manhattan and San Francisco datasets.},

abstract={Automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technology is a powerful technology enabling more efficient and effective law enforcement, security, payment collection, and research. A common license plate standard was adopted by the member states of the Mercosur trading bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and consequently requires an upgrade to the ALPR software used by law enforcement and industry. Due to the scarcity of real license plate images, training state-of-the-art supervised detectors is unfeasible unless data augmentation techniques and synthetic training data are used. This paper presents an accurate and efficient automated Mercosur license plate detector using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained exclusively with synthetic imagery. In order to obtain the synthetic training data, Mercosur license plates were faithfully reproduced. Digital image processing techniques were employed to reduce the domain gap and a CNN with basic image manipulation was used to embed the artificial licensed plates in to realistic contexts. The trained model was then validated on real images captured from a parking lot and a publicly available traffic monitoring video stream. The results of experiments suggest detection accuracy of about 95% and an average running time of 40 milliseconds.},

We implemented and tested our algorithm on a large baseline dataset, and also tested on video feeds from web-accessible parking-lot cameras. Our detection method improved the state of the art AUC by 8.13%. It also showed robust performance in different testing scenarios including tests on public cameras.

abstract={The smart parking industry continues to evolve as an increasing number of cities struggle with traffic congestion and inadequate parking availability. For urban dwellers, few things are more irritating than anxiously searching for a parking space. Research results show that as much as 30% of traffic is caused by drivers driving around looking for parking spaces in congested city areas. There has been considerable activity among researchers to develop smart technologies that can help drivers find a parking spot with greater ease, not only reducing traffic congestion but also the subsequent air pollution. Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device. Through the intelligent algorithm, we can significantly reduce the cost of existing systems, while achieving a more adaptable solution. For example, our system can automatically detect when a car enters the parking space, the location of the parking spot, and precisely charge the parking fee and associate this with the license plate number.},

abstract={The estimation of crowd count in images has a wide range of applications such as video surveillance, traffic monitoring, public safety and urban planning. Recently, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches have been shown to be more effective in crowd counting than traditional methods that use handcrafted features. However, the existing CNN-based methods still suffer from large number of parameters and large storage space, which require high storage and computing resources and thus limit the real-world application. Consequently, we propose a deeply-recursive network (DR-ResNet) based on ResNet blocks for crowd counting. The recursive structure makes the network deeper while keeping the number of parameters unchanged, which enhances network capability to capture statistical regularities in the context of the crowd. Besides, we generate a new dataset from the video-monitoring data of Beijing bus station. Experimental results have demonstrated that proposed method outperforms most state-of-the-art methods with far less number of parameters.},

abstract={Smart cities are based on connected devices generating large quantities of data every instant. These data can be stored at a nearby edge location for initial processing but later sending the data to the backend data centers for storage and further analysis consumes considerable network bandwidth. In this article, we propose a large-scale data migration framework using vehicles. The framework uses a neural network to identify suitable vehicles as data mules, ones moving toward the data destination, potentially reducing the load from backend networks in terms of bandwidth usage and overall energy consumption. We compare the framework with data transfers using the traditional Internet and an approach without machine intelligence. The proposed framework performs well in terms of data loss, transfer time, energy, and CO2 emissions. From experiments, we demonstrate that the approach achieves a 67% success rate with data transfers $193\times $ faster than the average Internet bandwidth of 21.28 Mb/s. Moreover, the resulting CO2 emissions for 30-TB data transfers stood at 6.403 kg, which is significantly lower compared to 1172.8 kg for the Internet.},

abstract={Estimating land prices is useful for assessing values of sites. Several works study estimating land prices from land features that are extracted from geodetic data. However, the estimation accuracy is not high enough yet because it is difficult to thoroughly collect geodetic data that affects land prices. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the satellite images to estimate land prices for the first time. To verify effectiveness of satellite images, we estimate land prices by using three deep neural network models: multilayer perceptrons (MLP) model only with geodetic data, convolution neural network (CNN) model only with satellite images, and concatenation model that concatenates the MLP with the CNN models. We demonstrate through experiments using real land prices, geodetic data, and satellite images in Japan that the simultaneous use of satellite images and geodetic data improves the estimation accuracy of land prices.},

The authors propose an evolutionary approach to this problem, according to which digital twins of individual elements of the urban environment are consistently built on a single hardware and software platform. These digital twins are linked in a single cooperative system that allows one digital twin to use data produced by other digital twins. The article gives the definition and architecture of such a system. It describes the classes of models that can be used to create digital twins.

abstract={With the massive deployment of 5G cellular infrastructures, traffic prediction has become an indispensable part of the cellular resource management system in order to provide reliable and fast communication services that can meet the increasing quality-of-service requirements of smart city. A promising approach for handling this problem is to introduce intelligent methods to implement a highly effective and efficient cellular traffic prediction model. Meanwhile, integrating the multiaccess edge computing framework in 5G cellular networks facilitates the application of intelligent traffic prediction models by enabling their implementation at the network edge. However, the data shortage and privacy issues may still be obstacles for training a robust and accurate prediction model at the edge. To address these issues, we propose a data-augmentation-based cellular traffic prediction model (ctGAN-S2S), where an effective data augmentation submodel based on generative adversarial networks is proposed to improve the prediction performance while protecting data privacy, and a long-short-term-memory-based sequence-to-sequence submodel is used to achieve the flexible multistep cellular traffic prediction. The experimental results on a real-world city-scale cellular traffic dataset reveal that our ctGAN-S2S model achieves up to 48.49% improvement of the prediction accuracy compared to four typical reference models.},

abstract={Smart cities are a complicated blend of Information and communications technology (ICT) as well as Internet of Things (IoT) from physical (such as sensors and actuators) and non-physical (such as external databases) data sources. The smart physical data sources contribute to developing the level of safety and security of citizens' daily life through different smart solutions such as optimization for autonomous power grids and human health applications. Those physical devices generate a massive amount of data that is necessary for analytic applications to be applied in user services. Cloud computing technologies utilize as a centralized ICT architecture to collect the massive amount of data from all scale of the city and build the citizens' services by developers. However, several challenges in cybercrime and cybersecurity exist in Cloud computing technologies as well as large scale IoT environments and smart cities. Those challenges are i) the new generation of the attack on an IoT network is to create a problem with the availability of IoT data for the Cloud applications by overwhelming devices with information requests; ii) complex communication and computation resource constraints has a big concern to moving forward to detect attack at the edge of networks. Therefore, heading off the threat of cybercrime in large scale IoT and smart cities calls for a new study on designing cybersecurity models for ICT architecture. In this paper, we first present our fully hierarchal Distributed-to-Centralized ICT (D2C-ICT) architecture for the Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZEN) center in the context of the smart cities. Second, we propose two different novel anomaly detection models by using the contribution of Fog to cloudlet and Cloud technologies through our presented D2C-ICT Architecture in the context of the smart city. Finally, we discuss two different use cases for attack detection. We envisage that we can enhance the level of attack detection techniques through different technologies of the D2C-ICT from edge to Cloud networks.},

The IoT devices solve real-world problems by providing real-time connections, data and information. Besides this, the attackers can tamper with sensors, add or remove them physically or remotely. In this study, we address the IoT security sensor tampering issue in an office environment. We collect data from real-life settings and apply machine learning to detect sensor tampering using two methods. First, a real-time view of the traffic patterns is considered to train our isolation forest-based unsupervised machine learning method for anomaly detection. Second, based on traffic patterns, labels are created, and the decision tree supervised method is used, within our novel Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning (AD-ML) system. The accuracy of the two proposed models is presented. We found 84% with silhouette metric accuracy of isolation forest. Moreover, the result based on 10 cross-validations for decision trees on the supervised machine learning model returned the highest classification accuracy of 91.62% with the lowest false positive rate.},

abstract={Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and other smart-city technologies are increasingly advancing in capability and complexity. While simulation environments continue to improve, their fidelity and ease of use can quickly degrade as newer systems become increasingly complex. To remedy this, we propose a hardware- and software-based traffic management system testbed as part of a larger smart-city testbed. It comprises a network of connected vehicles, a network of intersection controllers, a variety of control services, and data analytics services. The main goal of our testbed is to provide researchers and students with the means to develop novel traffic and vehicle control algorithms with higher fidelity than what can be achieved with simulation alone. Specifically, we are using the testbed to develop an integrated management system that combines model-based control and data analytics to improve the system performance over time. In this paper, we give a detailed description of each component within the testbed and discuss its current developmental state. Additionally, we present initial results and propose future work.},

abstract={In smart cities equipped with cameras, one desirable use-case is to detect and track objects. While object detection has been implemented using various methods, object tracking poses a different problem; to track an object requires object permanence to be established between each frame of video. While many technologies have been proposed as a solution for problem, an implementation with scalability in mind has not been developed and poses many new challenges. This paper proposes e-SORT, a solution for scalable object tracking using an enhanced version of the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm. Beyond its scalability, e-SORT stores a mapping of each objects' locations such that the full path of each object is available and several metrics (such as velocity and acceleration) can be calculated. Both e-SORT's abilities and our proposed solution to scalable object tracking are tested and evaluated on Chattanooga Tennessee's live urban testbed.},

abstract={Accurate and real-time short-term traffic flow forecasting is an important prerequisite for traffic guidance and control. A single forecasting method is difficult to handle all the periodicity, nonlinearity, and randomness of traffic flow. The traditional machine learning algorithm is difficult to achieve parallel computing. In this paper, a traffic flow forecasting method based on wavelet denoising and XgBoost hybrid model is proposed. The discrete wavelet denoising algorithm is first employed to preprocess the traffic flow data. Then, the XGBoost algorithm is fed by the denoised historical traffic flow data to predict traffic flow. It not only keeps the trend of traffic flow in each sampling period but also reduces the impact of noise. The proposed traffic flow forecasting method is evaluated on four benchmark dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art models. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the algorithm is much higher than that of control models.},

Input features for the classification models are built aggregating packet generation and access collisions from the eNodeB on which failures are being detected, as well as from its closest neighbors, by computing statistics for each time-bin. Given that network service providers generally process real-time data to produce periodic aggregated summaries, we explore the effect of different levels of granularity in data aggregation and their effect on our ability to detect failures. The M2M traffic data was gathered from a simulated LTE network that uses publicly available geographic databases from the city of Montreal. With Linear Support Vector Machines (L-SVMs) and Bagged Decision Trees (BDT), failure detection rates above 97.5 % were achieved, with false positive rates under 2.8 %, showing that, even with 30 minutes aggregations, it is feasible to extract meaningful failure information.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing (CC) technologies are becoming critical requirements to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). ITSs generally rely on captured images to evaluate the status of traffic and perform vehicle statistics. However, such images may contain confidential information, and thus, securing such images is paramount. Therefore, we propose in this paper an efficient framework for improving the security of CC-IoT based ITSs. The proposed framework allows extracting particular vehicle information without revealing any sensitive information. Towards this goal, a convolutional neural network is used to classify encrypted images, based on the vehicle type in real-time, obtained by cameras integrated into road-side units that are part of an ITS leaving sensitive information in all images hidden. Within the proposed framework, we develop a new image classification architecture that never fully decrypts the captured images, thus protecting drivers' personal information, such as location, license plate, and vehicle contents. In addition, the system does not require a fully decrypted image, which increases the system computational efficiency as compared to conventional systems. The obtained results show that the proposed partial decryption classification technique presents up to 18% reduction in average computational complexity when compared with a fully decrypted system.},

abstract={The following work is an application proposal based on machine learning algorithms for a possible solution for the public safety problem in a South American city. The aim of this application is to reduce the threat risk of the physical integrity of pedestrians by geolocating, in real-time, safer places to walk. In this context for a city, San Isidro, a business district of Lima, has been established as study case. The district has been divided into map sectors and subsectors, so that by using the GPS location service integrated in mobile devices, it is possible to identify areas that have the highest incidence of different types of incidents. This functionality will allow users to choose safer routes by taking into account the information provided for each sector. The data used in this application has been obtained from an Open Data platform managed by the San Isidro municipality. In this application, we have processed the data enabling the easy and friendly access to the information by the end user. The importance of this work is how we have used the machine learning algorithm for incident rates in real and future time, trying to make predictions that can not only provide safe routes to users, but also predict disasters and allow public authorities to act in advance, thus minimizing the impact of future incidents.},

The system operation of active reconfiguration is treated as a unit commitment problem through optimizing the total operational cost of the system. State recognition and prediction are performed by Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network for the smart operation. The effectiveness of the active reconfiguration operation is validated experimentally over an electrical system model. Furthermore, the methodology of the active reconfigurable operation in microgrids presents an energy construction scheme for the future “green smart cities”.},

abstract={With the increase of the number of the elderly, healthcare systems to support the daily life and wellbeing of the elderly attracted attention. Especially, frailty syndrome is one of the most significant challenges faced by many countries because of its high association with mortality and hospitalization. Recently, with the progress of ICT (Information and Communication Technology), many frailty detection models which use sensors were proposed. However, many of them require very high costs caused by the installation and management of sensors. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a machine learning-based frailty detection model using only electric power consumption data from smart meter, which uses no other devices such as sensors. Also, we examined the feasibility of our model through a case study, in which we have conducted on 24 elderly people. As a result of a cast study, we could detect frailty with 82% accuracy, 77% precision, 84% recall, and 80% f-score for a 2-class classification problem (frailty or non-frailty). The results of our study show that more elderly people can receive frailty diagnoses through smart meters. Moreover, since frailty is a reversible condition that could be restored to a healthy status with early and appropriate intervention, our model has potential to extend the healthy expectancy of the elderly.},

abstract={Nowadays, the massive usage of mobile and IoT applications generate large amounts of data. Due to several reasons, including latency and bandwidth, it is not practical to send all generated data to the cloud. Recent standardization efforts, namely, Fog computing and the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), provide an extension of Cloud computing storage and network resources placed in a geographically distributed manner at the edge of the network closer to mobiles and IoT devices. These paradigms allow low latency, high bandwidth, and location-based awareness. In this paper, we present an infrastructure to support distributed Machine Learning (ML) by enabling edge devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping local knowledge stored at the edge of the network. In addition, we claim the possibility of improving the model through the cloud that acts as a supervisor of the system that contains the global knowledge of the entire system through the integration of local edge models. We describe our architectural proposal and analyze a case study, namely video streaming processing for face recognition, deployed in a collaborative edge network. Finally, we report experimental results that show the potential advantages of using our approach instead of ML algorithms completely expected at the cloud infrastructure.},

abstract={Recycling waste is valuable waste due to its potential to be used as raw material. According to our observation and data collection at the Bangsaen Beach, Saensuk City, Chon Buri Province, Thailand, a lot of valuable waste is being thrown away instead of being collected and separated properly. This leads to not only the raw material problem but also the environmental pollution. We found out that the 2 main reasons cause people do not litter their waste appropriately are 1) they lack of basic knowledge how to separate the valuable waste correctly, and 2) they lack of motivation to separate the valuable waste. From this point of view, we designed a holistic waste management system that tries to tackle these problems using modern Information Technology. The system consists of 2 parts; the first one is the software design and implementation including web-based waste management application and mobile-application-based rewarding system; whereas the second one is the hardware design and implementation based on Internet of Things and Machine Learning technology. This part can recognize and separate 3 kinds of waste automatically, namely glass bottles, plastic bottles, and metal cans. The system is tested and it functions as expected. It can separate the mentioned 3 kinds of waste with good results. The rewarding system on mobile application allows the people to collect the points and get rewarded. This motivates them to litter their waste properly.},

abstract={The widespread implementation of smart meters (SM) and the deployment of the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) provide large amounts of fine-grained data on prosumers. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are used in different techniques, e.g. non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), to extract useful information from collected data. However, the use of ML algorithms to gain insight on prosumer behavior and characteristics raises not only numerous technical but also legal concerns. This paper maps electricity prosumer concerns towards the AMI and its ML based analytical tools in terms of data protection, privacy and cybersecurity and conducts a legal analysis of the identified prosumer concerns within the context of the EU regulatory frameworks. By mapping the concerns referred to in the technical literature, the main aim of the paper is to provide a legal perspective on those concerns. The output of this paper is a visual tool in form of a table, meant to guide prosumers, utility, technology and energy service providers. It shows the areas that need increased attention when dealing with specific prosumer concerns as identified in the technical literature.},

abstract={Looking for available parking slots has become a serious issue in contemporary urban mobility. The selection of suitable car parks could be influenced by multiple factors-e.g., the walking distance to destination, driving and waiting time, parking prices, availability, and accessibility-while the availability of unused parking slots might depend on parking location, events in the area, traffic flow, and weather conditions. This paper presents a set of metrics and techniques to predict the number of available parking slots in city garages with gates. With this aim, we have considered three different predictive techniques, while comparing different approaches. The comparison has been performed according to the data collected in a dozen of garages in the area of Florence by using Sii-Mobility National Research Project and Km4City infrastructure. The resulting solution has demonstrated that a Bayesian regularized neural network exploiting historical data, weather condition, and traffic flow data can offer a robust approach for the implementation of reliable and fast predictions of available slots in terms of flexibility and robustness to critical cases. The solution adopted in a Smart City Apps in the Florence area for sustainable mobility has been welcomed with broad appreciation or has been praised as successful.},

In Graffiti detection, we aim to build a model to detect graffiti on walls which can help navigate the UAV to the correct coordinate and estimate the area of the graffiti. The data set which contain graffiti images are trained using machine learning techniques which will be used for the detections of the graffiti patterns. This will automate the process of detecting the location of the graffiti based on the edge detection technique and the model will be able to estimate the area of the graffiti. To achieve obstacle detection, and collision, a smart navigation approach is also proposed with the help of LiDAR and external camera. The overall graffiti cleanup system contains hardware and software that allow the user to use spray enamel with the reach and scale of an autonomous UAV.},

The traditional computer vision techniques are unable to analyze such a huge amount of visual data generated in real-time. So, there is a need for visual big data analytics which involves processing and analyzing large scale visual data such as images or videos to find semantic patterns that are useful for interpretation. In this paper, we propose a framework for visual big data analytics for automatic detection of bike-riders without helmet in city traffic.

abstract={We develop a novel end-to-end trainable feature selection-forecasting (FSF) architecture for predictive networks targeted at the Internet of Things (IoT). In contrast with the existing filter-based, wrapper-based and embedded feature selection methods, our architecture enables the automatic selection of features dynamically based on feature importance score calculation and gamma-gated feature selection units that are trained jointly and end-to-end with the forecaster. We compare the performance of our FSF architecture on the problem of forecasting IoT device traffic against the following existing (feature selection, forecasting) technique pairs: Autocorrelation Function (ACF), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Recurrent Feature Elimination (RFE) and Ridge Regression methods for feature selection, and Linear Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), 1 Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Logistic Regression for forecasting. We show that our FSF architecture achieves either the best or close to the best performance among all of the competing techniques by virtue of its dynamic, automatic feature selection capability. In addition, we demonstrate that both the training time and the execution time of FSF are reasonable for IoT applications. This work represents a milestone for the development of predictive networks for IoT in smart cities of the near future.},

abstract={In our joint research with the Kobe City Fire Department, we have been studying the effective use of emergency resources. In our previous research, we developed a prediction model for the number of heat stroke victims in Kobe City by applying machine learning to past weather observation data and emergency dispatch records. It takes a certain period of time to prepare the necessary emergency measures in the field. Therefore, it is necessary to make medium-term forecasts for the next week or so, and the accuracy of such forecasts is not known. In addition, conventional models refer to items of past weather data, which are difficult to obtain from current weather forecasts. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a new method for predicting the number of heat stroke victims in the medium term by using past weather forecast data. From the proposed method, we know that it is possible to predict the number of heat stroke victims in 7 days by utilizing the actual weather forecast data in Kobe City.},

abstract={Urban living in modern large cities has significant adverse effects on health, increasing the risk of several chronic diseases. We focus on the two leading clusters of chronic diseases, heart disease and diabetes, and develop data-driven methods to predict hospitalizations due to these conditions. We base these predictions on the patients' medical history, recent and more distant, as described in their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). We formulate the prediction problem as a binary classification problem and consider a variety of machine learning methods, including kernelized and sparse Support Vector Machines (SVMs), sparse logistic regression, and random forests. To strike a balance between accuracy and interpretability of the prediction, which is important in a medical setting, we propose two novel methods: K -LRT, a likelihood ratio test-based method, and a Joint Clustering and Classification (JCC) method which identifies hidden patient clusters and adapts classifiers to each cluster. We develop theoretical out-of-sample guarantees for the latter method. We validate our algorithms on large data sets from the Boston Medical Center, the largest safety-net hospital system in New England.},

abstract={The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technology enables smart building management and operation to improve building energy efficiency and occupant thermal comfort. In this paper, we perform data analysis using the IoT generated building data to derive accurate thermal comfort model for smart building control. Deep neural network (DNN) is used to model the relationship between the controllable building operations and thermal comfort. As thermal comfort is determined by multiple comfort factors, a fine-grained architecture is proposed, where an exclusive model is trained for each factor and accordingly the corresponding thermal comfort can be evaluated. The experimental results show that the proposed fine-grained DNN outperforms its coarse-grained counterpart by 3.5× and is 1.7×, 2.5×, 2.4×, and 1.9× more accurate compared to four popular machine learning algorithms. Besides, DNN's performance promotes with deeper network topology and more neurons, and a simple topology with the same number of neurons per network hidden layer is sufficient to achieve high modeling accuracy. Finally, the derived thermal comfort model reveals a linear relationship between comfort and air conditioning setpoint. The linear property helps quickly and accurately search for the optimal controllable setpoint with the desired comfort.},

The person is detected using You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) and tracked using Simple Online Real-time Tracking with a deep association matrix (DeepSORT). From the trajectory analysis, once the time and displacements thresholds are satisfied, the person is treated as a loiterer. When the loiterer moves one camera to another, then the algorithm is switched to the appropriate camera feed as per the proposed camera switching algorithm to minimize the computational cost. Subsequently, the loiterer is reidentified in the switched camera feed by comparing the features of the loiterer extracted by the MobileNets with that of the other detected persons based on the triplet loss criteria. The proposed system provides an enhanced accuracy of 96 % on average fps of 33 (without ReID) and 81.5 % at average fps of 30 (with ReID).},

Effective processing and analysing tweets in real time can help city organisations gain situational awareness of the affected citizens and take timely operations. With the advances in deep learning techniques, recent studies have significantly improved the performance in classifying crisis-related tweets. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which may be imperceptible to the human, but can lead to model's misclassification. To process multi-modal data as well as improve the robustness of deep learning models, we propose a multi-modal adversarial training method for crisis-related tweets classification in this paper. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in improving the robustness of tweet classification.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose Federated Deep Learning (FDL) for intrusion detection in heterogeneous networks. Local Deep Neural Network (DNN) models are used to learn the hierarchical representations of the private network traffic data in multiple edge nodes. A dedicated central server receives the parameters of the local DNN models from the edge nodes, and it aggregates them to produce an FDL model using the Fed+ fusion algorithm. Simulation results show that the FDL model achieved an accuracy of 99.27 ± 0.79%, a precision of 97.03 ± 4.22%, a recall of 98.06 ± 1.72%, an F1 score of 97.50 ± 2.55%, and a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 2.40 ± 2.47%. The classification performance and the generalisation ability of the FDL model are better than those of the local DNN models. The Fed+ algorithm outperformed two state-of-the-art fusion algorithms, namely federated averaging (FedAvg) and Coordinate Median (CM). Therefore, the DNN-Fed+ model is preferable for intrusion detection in heterogeneous wireless networks.},

pages={1817-1826},
abstract={We attempt to intelligently identify violations of throwing waste from vehicles (TWV) in real-time traffic surveillance videos. In addition to polluting the environment, TWV easily causes injury to sanitation workers responsible for cleaning roads by passing vehicles. However, manual inspection is still the commonest way to recognize such uncivilized behavior in videos with very high time and labor-consuming. In answer to these challenges, we design a novel 20-layer residual network (Nov-ResNet-20) for training the vehicle-thrown-waste identification model (VTWIM). Then, incorporating Nov-ResNet-20, Selective Search, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), we propose the deep-residual-network-leveraged vehicle-thrown-waste identification method (DRN-VTWI). Our method first splits one video frame into several regions matching suspected objects marked with location boxes via Selective Search. Then, in terms of the VTWIM trained by Nov-ResNet-20 our method identifies the regions containing TWV. Last, our method removes the redundant location boxes for each recognized, vehicle-thrown waste and only keeps the best one. The significance of our work is four-fold: 1) Nov-ResNet-20 has a moderate depth: 6 convolutional layers, 7 residual layers, and in total 20 weight layers. Due to the joint contribution of the residual, batch normalization, dropout, and cross-entropy loss, it is eligible to identify TWV using a small quantity of manually-annotated training samples. 2) Selective Search diversely marks all possible, suspected objects in video frames, whereas NMS keeps the best location box for each recognized vehicle-thrown waste, removing all redundancies. In this way, DRN-VTWI finds potential violations of TWV as many as possible and optimally annotates vehicle-thrown wastes in frames as well. 3) Combining the power of Nov-ResNet-20, Selective Search, and NMS, DRN-VTWI well solves the challenging, intelligent identification of vehicle-thrown wastes for real-time traffic surveillance. Experimental studies conducted on real-time traffic surveillance videos demonstrate the effectiveness as well as superiority of our efforts.},

abstract={IoT devices enable a massive amount of data to be aggregated and analyzed for anomaly detection. The nature of heterogeneous devices introduces the challenge of collecting and handling these massive datasets to perform data analyses to discover cyber attacks in near real-time. However, the traditional IDS cannot deal with such a problem due to scalability limitations and insufficient storage and processing capabilities. Moreover, issues such as network bandwidth, real-time support, and security limit the power of cloud server-based IDSs. This paper presents an edge-cloud deep IDS model in Lambda architecture for IoT security to address these challenges. Our system decreases the training phase's time compared to traditional machine learning algorithms and increases the accuracy of true positive detected attacks. Furthermore, neural network layers lead deep learning to achieve better performance and flexibility compared to conventional machine learning. Our solution enables the detection of suspicious activities in real-time and allows to classify them by analyzing historical data in a batch process.},

It is one of the most recent Deep Learning approaches primitively built using single shot detection proposal. Unlike the double stage region-based object detection schemes this technique do not follow semantic segmentation, it does not undergo loss of the object information such as disappearance of the gradients and it does not require pre-defined anchors. This technique comprises strong feature extractors and reinforce multi scale object detection and it is very quick in the multi-threaded GPU environments. Since our fundamental research is concentrated on object classification related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, as a first step we choose to detect the humans from thermal dataset. Therefore, we used thermal images and videos possessed from thermal cameras of UAV 1m to 50m above ground level as our dataset in building the model and testing. The YOLO v4 uses ground truth bounding boxes to extract the features like Weighted Residual Connections (WRC), Cross Stage Partial Connections (CSP), Cross mini Batch Normalization (CmBN), Self-Adversarial Training (SAT), Mish Activation (MA), Mosaic Data Augmentation (MDA) and Drop Block Regularization (DBR). Finally, the performance analysis of these model in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) indicates that the modelling using YOLO v4 performs in a promising way and it can be used in automatic human detection systems.},

abstract={Currently, the world is in a period of urbanization that will accelerate the processes of land-use cover and ecological change. Thus, establishing a land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) prediction and simulation model is of great significance for understanding the process of urban change and assessing its ecological impact. In previous studies, LUCC prediction models have been mainly based on cellular automata structures that calculate a future state pixel by pixel through transition rules. Because these transition rules are usually based on the global state and each pixel is calculated according to these fixed rules, the results of these methods have room for improvement in terms of generating details and heterogeneity. In this article, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based LUCC prediction model using multiscale local spatial information is proposed. The model is based on a pix2pix GAN and an attention structure that predicts future land use through multiscale local spatial information. To validate our model, Shenzhen, a region that is experiencing rapid urbanization, was chosen as the source of the experimental data. The results indicate that the proposed method achieved the highest accuracy in both short-time interval and long-time interval scenarios. In addition, the results of the proposed method were also closest to the ground truth from the perspective of the landscape pattern.},

abstract={The urban road traffic flow condition prediction is a fundamental issue in the intelligent transportation management system. While extracting the high-dimensional, nonlinear and random features of the transportation network is a challenge, which is very useful to improve the accuracy of traffic prediction. In this paper, we propose DeepSense, a novel deep temporal-spatial traffic flow feature learning mechanism, with large scale Taxi GPS traces for traffic prediction. Deep-Sense includes two switchable feature learning approaches. DeepSense exploits a temporal-spatial deep learning approach for traffic flow prediction with the sufficient spatial and temporal taxi GPS traces in dynamic pattern. Meanwhile, Deep-Sense takes advantage of a supplementary temporal sequence segment matching approach with the temporal transformation of traffic flow state for a given road segment when there are not enough traffic traces. Experimental results show that DeepSense can achieve higher prediction accuracy with nearly 5% improvements compared with existing methods.},

abstract={Modern cities are equipped with various information and communications technology (ICT) resources including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, computing platforms, and data storage media. Data are one of the most valuable ICT resources in smart cities. Data management strategies play a vital role in managing the requirements of user and business models in a city. Using the benefits of data makes an agile, creative, and smart city via the widespread use of appropriate city services. Centralized and distributed-to-centralized data management (D2CDM) architectures are recommended to organize the large-scale produced city data in smart city networks, including physical data resources (e.g., sensor data) and nonphysical data sources (e.g., city consumer personal databases). In this article, we explain two different ICT technology management solutions for smart city networks in which the ICT resources in a city can be managed and delivered: centralized and distributed-to-centralized. We also describe two main strategies for data management in smart cities, and the advantages of D2C-DM are discussed based on two ongoing case studies. We also mention there is much room for future works and development of this study, such as developing software services in smart cities based on edge-to-cloud orchestration and enhancing the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques through multilevel ICT architecture.},

abstract={A smart city involves critical infrastructure systems that have been digitally enabled. Increasingly, many smart city cyber-physical systems are becoming automated. The extent of automation ranges from basic logic gates to sophisticated, artificial intelligence (AI) that enables fully autonomous systems. Because of modern society's reliance on autonomous systems in smart cities, it is crucial for them to operate in a safe manner; otherwise, it is feasible for these systems to cause considerable physical harm or even death. Because smart cities could involve thousands of autonomous systems operating in concert in densely populated areas, safety assurances are required. Challenges abound to consistently manage the safety of such autonomous systems due to their disparate developers, manufacturers, operators and users. A novel network and a sample of associated network functions for autonomous systems is proposed that aims to provide a baseline of safety for autonomous systems in a smart city ecosystem. A proposed network called the Assured Autonomous Cyber-Physical Ecosystem (AACE) would be separate from the Internet, and enforces certain functions that enable safety through active networking. Each smart city could dictate the functions for their own AACE, providing a means for enforcing safety policies across disparate autonomous systems operating in the city's jurisdiction. Such a network design sits at the margins of the end-to-end principle, which is warranted considering the safety of autonomous systems is at stake as is argued in this paper. Without a scalable safety strategy for autonomous systems as proposed, assured autonomy in smart cities will remain elusive.},

abstract={With the continuous development of technology in the artificial intelligence era, smart city applications based on high-performance servers in large data centers have penetrated all walks of life. However, the current mainstream smart city application model is only data collection on the device side, and then calculations and inferences in the data center. Data transmission is difficult to achieve the real-time performance of the system, resulting in poor effects in many smart city applications. The intelligent perception for smart city is required to perceive the whole urban environment comprehensively. Among them, small-size pixel target detection and recognition is particularly critical. To this end, a real-time small-size pixel target perception algorithm based on embedded system for smart city is proposed, which uses lightweight neural networks and model pruning optimization to realize terminal intelligence for smart city applications, and integrates traditional machine learning filtering algorithms for improving the detection speed and the accuracy. The experimental results of the method show that the real-time performance and the accuracy of detection are greatly improved for different sizes of small-size pixel targets.},
