abstract={There have been many recent developments in integrating the Cloud with the Internet of T hings (IoT) which comprise of up and coming technologies such as Smart Cities and Smart devices. This federation has resulted in research being directed towards further integration of Big Data with the Cloud, as IoT devices consisting of such technologies generate a continuous stream of sensor data. Thus, in this paper, we seek to present a predictive approach to task scheduling with the aim of reducing the overhead incurred when Big Data is processed on the Cloud. Subsequently, we wish to increase both the efficiency and reliability of the Cloud network while handling Big Data. We present a method of using classification in Machine Learning as a tool for scheduling tasks and assigning them to Virtual Machines (VMs) in the Cloud environment. A comparative study is undertaken to observe which brand of classifiers perform optimally in the given scenario. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to generate the dataset which is used to train the classifiers. A number of classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest and K Nearest Neighbor are then used to predict the VM best suited to a task in the test dataset.},

abstract={The modern world is constantly in a state of technological revolution. Everyday new technological ideas, inventions, and threats emerge. With modern computer software and hardware advancements, we have the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT). In conjunction, modern car companies have a push from public demand for a fully-autonomous car. To accomplish autonomy, small, and secure Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) it is necessary to ensure that the systems that rely on connected vehicle data is reliable and accurate. In the event there is a malicious actor manipulating the data through replica and injection attacks or there is a hardware failure yielding inaccurate location information, it is necessary to explore efficient methods for predicting connected vehicles locations such that these systems, which rely on accurate information are not impacted. This study analyzes multiple clustering and prediction models to discover how effectively a multi-layered machine learning approach is able to meet the real-time requirement of future generation smart cities.},

abstract={The protection of data processing is emerging as an essential aspect of data analytics, machine learning, delegation of computation, Internet of Things, medical and financial analysis, smart cities, genomics, non-disclosure searching, among others. Often, they use sensitive information that cannot be protected by traditional cryptosystems. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) schemes and secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) are considered suitable solutions for privacy protection. In this paper, we propose and analyze the performance of three homomorphic Logistic Regression (LR) models with Gradient Descent (GD) algorithms based on the Residue Number System (RNS). We compare their performance with four traditional non-homomorphic versions, one homomorphic algorithm based on RNS with Batch GD, and two state-of-the-art homomorphic algorithms. To validate our approach, we consider six public datasets of different medicine domains (diabetes, cancer, drugs, etc.) and genomics. We use a 5-fold cross-validation technique for a fair comparison in terms of the solution quality and training time. The results show that propose homomorphic solutions have similar accuracy with non-homomorphic algorithms, increased classification performance, and decreased training time compared with the state-of-the-art HE algorithms.},

abstract={Finding free parking space is a common problem in cities nowadays, both in streets and parking lots. This problem causes traffic congestion and influence in the delay of people to get to their jobs. With the advent of smart cities and buildings, research in this area is increasingly relevant. This work proposes a distributed architecture of a real time system for the detection of vacant space in parking lots, using computerized vision and machine learning. The proposed architecture seeks to minimize the search time for a parking space, as well as reduce the congestion resulting from having to maneuver in small spaces with pedestrians. The expected benefits are mainly the reduction of delays in reaching the position of work and study, and the risk reduction of pedestrians circulating in the parking areas, all this with a minimum investment.},

abstract={In the coming years, the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) will have relevance for transport, environment, health care, smart cities and also multimedia services (Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT)). Nowadays, many ISP (Internet Service Provider) encrypt the data to make it secure during the transmission. However, it imposes some obstacles for the NSP (Network Service Provider) because of the lack of visibility for operators into network traffic. To resolve these issues, we proposed the Quality Estimation Framework for Encrypted Traffic (Q2ET) containing a classification module and a QoE assessment module. The first module inherited from our previous research works to classify the encrypted network traffic using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). The second one applies the objective and subjective methods based on the statistical analysis and machine learning methods that combine application and network parameters to calculate user's QoE (Quality of Experience) in terms of MOS (Mean Opinion Score). The Q2ET allows the NSP to monitor the user's QoE to take the appropriate decisions when the QoE degradation happens in the network systems.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) impact in our daily life quickly evolves from recording basic data to process and take decisions based on complex data. Data provided by various sources (Health Care IoT, life quality, smart cities etc) came in many formats and will be used for statistical analysis and decision making, often based on data evolution and machine learning. Decisions involving data analysis over a huge database can be very time consuming. In critical time situations, system response time needs to be highly improved. This paper discusses a proposed architecture, suitable to improve the response time on systems using data analysis and decision based on data evolution. Simulation results for a system using sensors, gateways and persistence layers are presented and discussed. Considering all sensor data is sent to a non-relational database (NoSQL) suitable to store various data formats, this paper discusses the particularities of using IoT programmable gateways to send data used in critical time analysis to a fast relational database (SQL) database. In such databases, queries are very fast and, as a result, the decisions based on data evolution have an improved time response. Analysis to detect critical data patterns is triggered when data is inserted in SQL database or based on a time interval. Both strategies are discussed and analysed.},

abstract={Automating traffic monitoring and management can materially contribute to the realization of Smart Cities, but this demands detailed, accurate and timely characterization of traffic flows. Current methods employ video capture (high installation and operating costs), pneumatic-tube-based counters (limited detail about vehicle types and often only installed temporarily), or manual data capture (high human cost).We have developed an intelligent, inexpensive, pavement-mountable device capable of collecting information about vehicle types and speeds using an embedded, power-optimized neural network. The device is designed to fit within a raised pavement marker (RPM). RPMs are deployed throughout the world as lane markers. Packaging our sensing technology into RPMs offers the potential to significantly improve the spatial and temporal resolution of traffic flow information across a city.We outline our methodology for energy-optimized machine learning on a small, resource-constrained sensor device. We present the results of our work in terms of accuracy (96% classifying vehicle type and 89% classifying vehicle speed) and battery life (three years).},

abstract={Among the novel IT paradigms, cloud computing and the Internet of Things (CloudIoT) are two complementary areas designed to support the creation of smart cities and application services. The CloudIoT not only presents ubiquitous services through IoT nodes but it also provides virtually unlimited resources through services composition. The services composition problem aims to find a set of services among functionally equivalent services with different Quality of Service (QoS) concerning users' constraints. To this aim, previous studies calculate QoS values through service logs without considering the presence of anomalies in the existing QoS values; however, the dynamicity of distributed service environments and communication networks in CloudIoT environments causes anomalies in the QoS values. Therefore, existing approaches fail to model QoS values accurately that leads to service-level agreement (SLA) violation and penalties for service broker. To address this challenge, we propose a scalable anomaly-aware approach (SAIoT) including two main components: the first component models QoS values based on a machine learning anomaly detection technique, to remove the existing abnormal QoS records, and the second component finds a near-optimal composition by using an effective and efficient metaheuristic algorithm. The experimental results based on real-world data sets show that our approach achieves 30.64% of the average improvement in the QoS value of a composite plan with equal or even less price compared to the previous works, such as information theory-based and advertised QoS-based methods.},

In this paper, we will propose a framework for policy analytics for Rail and Air connectivity and discuss how big data can play a key role to analyze the existing datasets like routes, schedules, booking information, benchmark studies, economic characteristics, and passenger demographics. Big data tools are very useful in processing unstructured data sets by analyzing them and providing meaningful visualizations. Policy analytics can combine the power of information technology, operations research, statistical modeling and machine learning to modernize and equip policy makers for better data-driven decisions while drafting policies.

abstract={Nowadays, Illegal dumping of garbage in residential area is a troublesome problem for both inhabitants and civic administration. So, government authorities are struggling to solve this issue in efficient way. The automatization of garbage collection process is an essential requirement and one of the major needs to proceed toward smart cities. The atomization of garbage collection requires the detection and localization of garbage automatically. The stated task is not an easy work as to train any machine learning system; it is needed corresponding dataset with its ground truth. The ground truth acquisition is a tedious task as it is needed to annotate every pixel in the image with its corresponding class. This needs a lot of manual work which is expensive in term of time and money both. In this paper, a garbage detection and localization system is proposed based on Convolutional Neural Network, which is trained on images labeled as garbage or non-garbage. The labeling of images in two classes as garbage or non-garbage is a simple and relatively fast task. The system yields better results in comparison to existing weekly-supervised methods; it also produces competitive results with respect to supervised learning method. The performance of the system is evaluated with pixel level of accuracy and it is also evaluated qualitatively by human experts.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has transpired as a fascinating technology for smart cities, smart homes, and smart grids by using a vast amount of IoT data. A smart grid is one of the core components where transport, generation, delivery, and electricity consumption are enhanced in terms of protection and reliability. The existing power grid is suffering from many problems such as outages and unpredictable power disturbances, inflexible energy rates, unnoticeable customer fraud, and many other disadvantages. These problems lead to the ever-rising demand for fossil fuel and service costs. For example, the peak hour demand needs to be overestimated and more energy generated to minimize the risk of an outage. The main problem of the smart grid is the tremendous amount of data needs to be collected from the IoT devices, and processing the data is a challenge. Using and predicting a large amount of data in smart Grid and IoT is still in its infancy. To remedy this problem, we propose a hybrid solution by using the Cloud and Edge Computing to process the data. Processing and predicting at the edge that is close to the embedded devices and homes to save in latency and storage compared to putting all the processing in the Cloud. In this paper, we define a hybrid solution where we use the edge computing for the smart grid information processing where the microgrids are located on the edge of the IoT network, and on the Cloud to use for the power grid that distributes power to the microgrids. We proposed a machine learning engine that used the decision tree to establish the communication between the edge layer, failover between edges, and the Cloud layer.},

abstract={Short-term traffic prediction in transportation net-work is a hot topic for next generation smart cities. Despite several research efforts, there is still a lack of consensus about the most effective way to predict traffic network-wide. Also, the majority of existing studies rely on either small data sets or limited portions of the transportation network. This paper presents the results of a forecasting study related to on-board units data of heavy-goods vehicles in the Brussels-Capital Region. The analysis, enabled by deployment of a big data infrastructure, concerns the short horizon (one hour ahead) forecasting of trucks flow (vehicles/hour) and mean speed (km/hour) over Brussels-Capital Region's network. Both parametric and non-parametric (notably machine learning) models are designed and assessed along with different strategies (simple and linear forecasts combination, individual model selection). The paper shows the potential of large amounts of real-time data obtained from moving sensors where forecasting techniques are applied network-wide. In particular, simple combination schemes (notably the simple median combination forecasts) appear to outperform the other methods in terms of prediction accuracy.},

abstract={The forthcoming generations of wireless networks have a high demand for reliable and enhanced data rate transmissions which are crucial for emerging smart cities. Thus, there is a need to develop efficient Link Adaptation (LA) for the last hop between end-users and the base stations in order to mitigate the severe interference resulting from the dense heterogeneous networks. We develop a Machine Learning (ML) based last-mile link adaptation method for a 5G wireless communication network. Dynamic selection of MCS for Resource Block (RB) allocation is efficient in terms of better network throughput and reduced BER which is verified through simulations for 5G New Radio (NR). We assume perfect channel estimation in our analysis. We have used a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model that dynamically selects the appropriate Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) ensuring 10 percent Bit Error Rate (BER) and maximizes the system spectral efficiency. Further, we evaluate the Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) corresponding to varied channel states for different frequencies of operation and the DNN model selects the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) corresponding to the optimal MCS available at the corresponding base stations for the end -users. This results in seamless connectivity for mobile users adapting to the last-mile link efficiently and achieving a higher downlink network throughput.},

abstract={Currently, there is a wide variety of low-cost radio technologies being used to enable wireless communication in some important emerging applications such as smart grids, smart cities and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, easy access to these new radio technologies brings a security problem due to the fact that it is very easy for a malicious user to perform passive wireless signal scanning on these networks and use this information to launch identity-based attacks. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning based strategy to detect spoofing attacks in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Based on detailed analytical models for the mobile radio channel, the proposed algorithm combines two classifiers to process and analyze the instant samples of received signal strength to detect attacks. The algorithm is optimized for scenarios where the legitimate node and the attacking node are at the same distance or at a very close distance from each other in relation to the landmark, what is the worst case scenario. The results show that the proposed strategy improves the performance of the attack detection in about 10% regarding a similar approach in the literature.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) enables connected objects to capture, communicate, and collect information over the network through a multitude of sensors, setting the foundation for applications such as smart grids, smart cars, and smart cities. In this context, large scale analytics is needed to extract knowledge and value from the data produced by these sensors. The ability to perform analytics on these data, however, is highly limited by the difficulties of collecting labels. Indeed, the machine learning techniques used to perform analytics rely upon data labels to learn and to validate results. Historically, crowdsourcing platforms have been used to gather labels, yet they cannot be directly used in the IoT because of poor human readability of sensor data. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a framework for sensor data analytics which leverages the power of crowdsourcing through gamification to acquire sensor data labels. The framework uses gamification as a socially engaging vehicle and as a way to motivate users to participate in various labelling tasks. To demonstrate the framework proposed, a case study is also presented. Evaluation results show the framework can successfully translate gamification events into sensor data labels.},

abstract={Mining traffic accident data is necessary for accident free smart cities, as traffic accidents causes harmful injuries, loss of lives and damages properties of people. N5 National Highway in Bangladesh is the largest highway, where a large number of accidents occur in every year. In this paper, we have analyzed and found the traffic accident patterns of N5 National Highway in Bangladesh using several decision tree induction algorithms. Decision tree is one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning and data mining. We have analyzed total 892 traffic accidents. The traffic accidents data of N5 National Highway of Bangladesh was collected from Modular Accident Analysis Program version 5, Accident Research Institute, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. We have extracted the informative features from the traffic accident data and generated several classifiers using different decision tree algorithms. In the experimental analysis, we have compared the performance of 12 decision tree classifiers and find the best classifier. Finally, we have extracted rules for the trees to avoid traffic accidents in the N5 National Highway of Bangladesh.},

abstract={Nowadays, more than half the world's population live hand-in-hand with technology. From smart watches to smart phones to smart cities, the embodiment of technology in all of our day-to-day activities no longer looks like a distant dream. Lectures in classrooms have also advanced to the extent of using smart-boards and smart-classrooms; the developments in jotting down notes in such scenarios has, however, not advanced at the same pace. In the problem statement being tackled, based on similar lines, the target audience includes the attendees of any seminar, presentation or lecture, be it students, or the public in general, attending important conferences and talks. More often than not, complete undivided attention proves to be difficult at these seminars as the attendee may be preoccupied with the objective of jotting down pointers and making notes for future reference. It is during this process that several essentials in the speaker's delivery are missed out. Keeping this forethought in mind, this paper delves into the implementation of an audio-visual summarizer that achieves the aforementioned motive. With audio evidence on the speaker's delivery, paired with visual images of PowerPoint slides or handwritten material that is presented in the seminars, this device provides a smart solution of summarizing the entire presentation and logging the summary to a remote database server from where it is accessed through a user-end software application. The prototype comprises a Raspberry Pi coupled with a camera and a microphone. The prototype uses a fast RCNN model for text detection, Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV) for text extraction, Google Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing concepts for generating the summarized data. The proposed solution is very effective, in terms of feasibility and cost cutting factors. The novelty aspect of the proposed solution lies in the consolidation of ideas of Internet of Things (IOT) and machine learning, to deliver a product capable of providing a smooth and potent solution to the problem statement.},

pages={4815-4830},
abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) plays an increasingly significant role in our daily activities, connecting physical objects around us into digital services. In other words, IoT is the driving force behind home automation, smart cities, modern health systems, and advanced manufacturing. This also increases the likelihood of cyber threats against IoT devices and services. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in application protocols, including Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) that interact directly with backend database systems and client-server applications to store data of IoT services. Successful exploitation of one or more of these protocols can result in data leakage and security breaches. In this paper, an ensemble intrusion detection technique is proposed to mitigate malicious events, in particular botnet attacks against DNS, HTTP, and MQTT protocols utilized in IoT networks. New statistical flow features are generated from the protocols based on an analysis of their potential properties. Then, an AdaBoost ensemble learning method is developed using three machine learning techniques, namely decision tree, Naive Bayes (NB), and artificial neural network, to evaluate the effect of these features and detect malicious events effectively. The UNSW-NB15 and NIMS botnet datasets with simulated IoT sensors' data are used to extract the proposed features and evaluate the ensemble technique. The experimental results show that the proposed features have the potential characteristics of normal and malicious activity using the correntropy and correlation coefficient measures. Moreover, the proposed ensemble technique provides a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate compared with each classification technique included in the framework and three other state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract={The measurement and provision of precise and up-to-date traffic-related key performance indicators is a key element and crucial factor for intelligent traffic control systems in upcoming smart cities. The street network is considered as a highly-dynamic Cyber Physical System (CPS) where measured information forms the foundation for dynamic control methods aiming to optimize the overall system state. Apart from global system parameters like traffic flow and density, specific data, such as velocity of individual vehicles as well as vehicle type information, can be leveraged for highly sophisticated traffic control methods like dynamic type-specific lane assignments. Consequently, solutions for acquiring these kinds of information are required and have to comply with strict requirements ranging from accuracy over cost-efficiency to privacy preservation. In this paper, we present a system for classifying vehicles based on their radio-fingerprint. In contrast to other approaches, the proposed system is able to provide real-time capable and precise vehicle classification as well as cost-efficient installation and maintenance, privacy preservation and weather independence. The system performance in terms of accuracy and resource-efficiency is evaluated in the field using comprehensive measurements. Using a machine learning based approach, the resulting success ratio for classifying cars and trucks is above 99%.},

In this paper, we analyze the impact of 5G on both traditional and emerging technologies and project our view on future research challenges and opportunities. With a predicted increase of 10-100× in bandwidth and 5-10x decrease in latency, 5G is expected to be the main enabler for smart cities, smart IoT and efficient healthcare, where machine learning is conducted at the edge. In this context, we investigate how 5G can help the development of federated learning. Network slicing, another key feature of 5G, allows running multiple isolated networks on the same physical infrastructure. However, security remains the main concern in the context of virtualization, multi-tenancy and high device density. Formal verification of 5G networks can be applied to detect security issues in massive virtualized environments. In summary, 5G will make the world even more densely and closely connected. What we have experienced in 4G connectivity will pale in comparison to the vast amounts of possibilities engendered by 5G.},

The usage of deep learning techniques is becoming more and more widespread and needs to be properly incorporated into pervasive and distributed computing and communication architectures, in order to foster a fully connected environment of intelligent systems. The great development of Internet of Things devices and applications is fostering more and more pervasive communication paradigms, but smart devices and gateways need further capabilities to become fully connected intelligent things. What is still lacking is an in-depth study of the modalities and technologies to properly integrate all deep learning aspects and algorithms in all possible distributed and pervasive systems, making them actual intelligent distributed systems. The main aim is to support fast and on-the-field DL-based computations that may foster novel and fast services in the near future contexts, such as smart cities, smart agriculture, smart health, smart distance education, smart automotive, industry 4.0, and many more. On the other hand, DL could help in finding out better distributed and parallel configurations to increase the performance of pervasive computing itself.

It has opened new horizons in thinking, research and development and it will guide us into another half century of progress. In actually, fuzzy optimization is an approximation of nonlinear optimization, which has formed a systematic but not yet unified theory of fuzzy systems and other fuzzy-set based methodologies. Fuzzy optimization along with decision making is an interdisciplinary area, which focuses on extracting useful knowledge with data technology and employing it.

abstract={In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the ability of embedded devices, sensors, and actuators to communicate, and create a ubiquitous cyber-physical world. The growth of the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid development of technologies such as short range mobile communication and improved energy-efficiency is expected to create a pervasive connection of “things.” This will inevitably result in the generation of enormous amount of data, which have to be stored, processed, and accessed. Cloud computing has long been recognized as a paradigm for big data storage and analytics. The combination of cloud computing and IoT can enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual things, thus stimulating innovations in both fields. For example, cloud platforms allow the sensing data to be stored and used intelligently for smart monitoring and actuation with the smart devices. Novel data fusion algorithms, machine learning methods, and artificial intelligence techniques can be implemented and run centralized or distributed on the cloud to achieve automated decision making. These will boost the development of new applications, such as smart cities, grids, and transportation systems. New challenges, however, arise when IoT meets cloud—there is an urgent need for novel network architectures that seamlessly integrate them, and protocols that facilitate big data streaming from IoT to the cloud.

abstract={Machine learning (ML) is nowadays embedded in several computing devices, consumer electronics, and cyber-physical systems. Smart sensors are deployed everywhere, in applications such as wearables and perceptual computing devices, and intelligent algorithms power our connected world. These devices collect and aggregate volumes of data, and in doing so, they augment our society in multiple ways; from healthcare, to social networks, to consumer electronics, and many more. To process these immense volumes of data, ML is emerging as the de facto analysis tool that powers several aspects of our Big Data society. Applications spanning from infrastructure (smart cities, intelligent transportation systems, smart grids, and to name a few), to social networks and content delivery, to e-commerce and smart factories, and emerging concepts such as self-driving cars and autonomous robots, are powered by ML technologies. These emerging systems require real-time inference and decision support; such scenarios, therefore, may use customized hardware accelerators, are typically bound by limited resources, and are restricted to limited connectivity and bandwidth. Thus, near-sensor computation and near-sensor intelligence have started emerging as necessities to continue supporting the paradigm shift of our connected world. The need for real-time intelligent data analytics (especially in the era of Big Data) for decision support near the data acquisition points emphasizes the need for revolutionizing the way we design, build, test, and verify processors, accelerators, and systems that facilitate ML (and deep learning, in particular) implemented in resource-constrained environments for use at the edge and the fog. As such, traditional von Neumann architectures are no longer sufficient and suitable, primarily because of limitations in both performance and energy efficiency caused especially by large amounts of data movement. Furthermore, due to the connected nature of such systems, security and reliability are also critically important. Robustness, therefore, in the form of reliability and operational capability in the presence of faults, whether malicious or accidental, is a critical need for such systems. Moreover, the operating nature of these systems relies on input data that is characterized by the four “V’s”: velocity (speed of data generation), variability (variable forms and types), veracity (unreliable and unpredictable), and volume (i.e., large amounts of data). Thus, the robustness of such systems needs to consider this issue as well. Furthermore, robustness in terms of security, and in terms of reliability to hardware and software faults, in particular, besides their importance when it comes to safety-critical applications, is also a positive factor in building trustworthiness toward these disrupting technologies from our society. To achieve this envisioned robustness, we need to refocus on problems such as design, verification, architecture, scheduling and allocation policies, optimization, and many more, for determining the most efficient, secure, and reliable way of implementing these novel applications within a robust, resource-constrained system, which may or may not be connected. This special issue, therefore, addresses a key aspect of fog and edge-based ML algorithms; robustness (as defined above) under resource-constraint scenarios. The special issue presents emerging works in how we design robust systems, both in terms of reliability as well as fault tolerance and security, while operating with a limited number of resources, and possibly in the presence of harsh environments that may eliminate connectivity and pollute the input data.},

Since the earliest of times, transportation has changed and revolutionized society and industry. Many of technology advances were focused on transportation and their means (road, rail, air, water, etc.) even, today there exist several areas of the knowledge that are focused on it. As time goes by, new terms have been established where technology is present as well, for instance, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Smart Cities, Smart Territory, Blockchain, Internet of Things, virtualization, Cloud computing, Intelligent Vehicles, embedded computing, Deep learning, etc. For that reason, with this special section in the ITS magazine, we want to continue showing new advances that will allow to people every day to find new services inside of the cities or even outsides of them, it means that, through the presented papers it will be possible to harmonized how the concepts in the digital world should be oriented in order to generate a best scenario to live.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing many industries by enabling machines to directly work with each other without human intervention, and communication and networking technologies are fundamental to enabling it. IoT systems are also creating a significant amount of new data which can now be processed to analyze and learn from using novel machine-learning techniques. However, the requirements for communications can vary significantly depending on the target applications, and they can range from ultra-low power for enabling a vast deployment of sensors with multi-year battery life to ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) for smart factories and remote robot control. 5G, as an example, is expected to deliver a number of enhancements to support massive IoT deployments as well as URLLC capabilities for new verticals such as Smart Cities, Industrial IoT, E-Health, Public Safety, and Autonomous Vehicles (V2V, V2X). The purpose of this Special Issue is to provide researchers and practitioners working on Connectivity and Networking technologies for IoT systems a means to share experiences and disseminate successful applications of IoT technologies and identify recent trends and opportunities poised to revolutionize the IoT industry. },

abstract={The impending Internet of Things (IoT) wave is promising to affect every aspect of our daily lives, ranging from smart things to smart buildings, smart cities, and smart environments. A lot of attention has been devoted to the tsunami of data produced by IoT, and the related means of extracting useful actionable information from it, spawning efforts in Big Data processing and machine learning. Yet, all of this does little to address the need for IoT to capture, interpret, and act on this wall of (noisy) information at the right time, at the right place, and in the right form. Conventional computing systems are a poor match to the needs of this emerging massively distributed real-time system. Hence, alternative computing techniques present an attractive alternative, trading off computational resolution for significant gains in quality-of-service energy efficiency and robustness. This observation is based on the conjecture that most applications related to IoT have an inherent error resilience and are evolutionary (that is, learning-based). Alternative computing strategies may be conceived at every level of the design hierarchy, starting from the device level with novel 3-D nonvolatile memory/logic combinations, or at the architectural level by shifting away from the traditional von Neumann architecture to different computing paradigms such as neuromorphic and/or stochastic computation all the way up to the algorithmic and data representation levels.},

abstract={The advent of Fifth Generation (5G) and the Internet of Things (IoT) is expected not only to make it possible to collect and disseminate information for various crowd-sensing services in densely populated environments but also to put forward a higher request on these services with the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and edge computing, which provides cloud computing and cache capabilities to reduce the computational load of cellular networks, displacing it at the edges of such networks. However, the costs for deployment and maintenance of mobile edge computing (MEC) are still high. Human-driven edge computing (HEC) is a novel model which integrates the elements of human, devices, internet and information, and combines the power of MEC architecture and the large-scale sensing ability of mobile crowd-sensing (MCS). Realizing better data spreading and environmental coverage in smart cities based on HEC has aroused a great deal of research interest from academia and industry. Although the studies of human-driven edge computing for 5G and the IoT are attractive, there are many open research problems, such as fusion analysis, efficient resource usage, low latency communication, large-scale search, and data security and privacy.},

abstract={The papers in this special section focus on industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS), with an emphasis on computing and communications applications. CPS systems are defined by integrating computation and communication facilities on the one hand and the monitoring and control of physical processes on the other hand. Industrial cyber–physical systems (ICPS) refer to the science and art of designing and using cyber–physical systems for industrial and process control applications, for example in smart factories, smart energy grids, smart transportation systems, smart cities, and several other areas. Many of these applications are time- and mission-critical and hence often require low latency and high reliability. In parallel, there has been a strong growth in integrating intelligence, often in the form of machine/deep learning, into applications, which also leads to vastly increasing computational requirements. These innovations then will be integrated into complex systems, which need to be properly engineered to become safe, reliable, trustworthy, and secure while at the same time being cost-efficient.},

Smart cities can be described as a smart system comprising numerous integrated smart systems that fuse and share data, including personal and potentially sensitive private information. Such circumstances could intrude on the rights to privacy, and human dignity, with disclosures potentially harmful to the individual, families, friends, associates, and communities. This workshop will examine ways to promote the best outcomes for the residents and visitors of smart cities through the lens of human rights. Affective rights will also be discussed as requisite to formulating the optimal smart city. Moreover, this workshop will foster discussion around the still relatively nascent technology of Affective Computing, which is the application of AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), biometric measurement, sentiment analysis, and psychological factor assessment in determining and interacting with the affective states of the individual. This workshop is open to all stakeholders in smart city development and management, including computer scientists, engineers, smart city integrators, application developers, third party vendors, ethicists, city managers and administrators. It should be especially informative for oversight and governance organizations providing auditing and performance evaluations.},

The upcoming 5G cellular technologies promise to deliver higher data rates with lower latency, enabling a wide range of data-intensive applications such as remote gaming, telepresence, and VR. 5G is also anticipated to help realize the full potential of IoT, bringing IoT and edge devices even closer to the cloud. At the same time, many applications would benefit from, and sometime require, local computation and intelligence, prompting a new wave of research and excitement on artificial intelligence at the edge (Edge AI). In this panel, we bring together experts from IoT, CPS, and Edge AI to understand the challenges across these three topics, as well as explore opportunities together with the audience.},
