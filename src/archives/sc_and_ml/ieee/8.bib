abstract={Indonesia is one of country with the highest number of smokers in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), 65.19 million people. This figure is equivalent to 34 % of the total population of Indonesia in 2016. There is a campaign to stop smoking in public places or Non-Smoking Areas because smoke can harm people. But some people violate and still smoke in Nonsmoking areas such as in Campus, School, or hospital. The Indonesian government has arranged forbidden places to smoke according to the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No.36 of 2009. Therefore a monitoring system is needed to detect offenders who smoke in no-smoking areas. Cigarette smoke detection system has made based on internet of face recognition and artificial intelligence technologies. This smoke detection system has designed using a raspberry pi B+, a gas sensor (MQ-2), GPS and camera, and data communication. We need an internet connection via WiFi or Ethernet to transfer data to the database server. When the Sensor releases the cigarette immediately, the system will send a notification to the administrator. The system also sends location and photos of smokers. The system will process and identify the smoker's identity. This system is expected to be implemented to support the smart city or smart campus.},

abstract={Network trustworthiness is a critical component of network security, as it builds on positive inter-actions, guarantees, transparency, and accountability. And with the growth of smart city services and applications, trustworthiness is becoming more important. Most current network trustworthiness solutions are insufficient, particularly for critical infrastructures where end devices are vulnerable and easily hacked. In terms of the energy sector, blockchain technology transforms all currencies into digital modes, thereby allowing one person to manage and exchange energy with others. This has drawn the attention of experts in many fields as a safe, low-cost platform to track billions of transactions in a distributed energy economy. Security and trust issues are still relatively new in the current centralized energy management scheme. With blockchain technology, a decentralized energy infrastructure enables parties to establish micro- grid trading energy transactions and apply artificial intelligence (AI). Using AI in energy systems enables machines to learn various parameters, such as predicted required amounts, excess amounts, and trusted partners. In this article, we envision a cooperative and distributed framework based on cutting-edge computing, communication, and intelligence capabilities such as AI and blockchain in the energy sector to enable secure energy trading, remote monitoring, and trustworthiness. The proposed framework can also enable secure energy trading at the edge devices and among multiple devices. There are also discussions on difficulties, issues, and design principles, as well as spotlights on some of the more popular solutions.},

abstract={Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Internet of Things (IoT) has rapidly taken on a powerful role to combat it with the emerging smart medicine, smart community, smart city, smart home, and so on. IoT devices are widely deployed in various places to provide feasible solutions for personnel temperature detection, medical treatment, and quarantine control during the pandemic. However, IoT-enabled applications inevitably face serious security challenges due to the massive amount of sensitive data. In this article, we first investigate several strategies of pandemic control based on IoT and the critical supporting technologies, 5G, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. Then we present the security issues in the process of data collection to usage in the applications. Through the analysis of specific paradigms, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and a location check-in system, we exploit the potential security challenges, including data leakage and false sensing. Countermeasures are proposed to address these issues and are effectively validated by simulation results. Finally, some open issues instead of data security threats of IoT are outlined.},

pages={1-6},
abstract={This paper presents a design of real-time Air Quality Monitoring System (AQMS) which incorporates Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. AQMS utilizes solar panel and battery pack for independent and autonomous operation, thus, making it self-powered and sustainable. AQMS is based on AVR Microcontroller (Atmega32) and GSM modem (Sim900) for connectivity with the cloud application. The design is made low cost and scalable so that around 50nos. of such systems can be installed on roundabouts of market places, residential and industrial areas. The AQMS monitors the air quality with the help of a miniature suction pump (5volt DC) which establishes a controlled and constant stream of air-flow through a manifold that encapsulates electromechanical sensors, thus measuring the concentration of O2, CO, CO2, SO / SO2 (SOx), NO/ NO2 (NOx), Hydrocarbon (CxHx), temperature, humidity and noise. By default, the air sampling is carried out once in an hour which may be changed depending on the change in air quality, i.e. making it adoptive for energy conservation and extending the sensor's life. The data collected at the cloud application will be processed using data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for getting insights of data (data mining) regarding the potential locations where the emissions are critical and disastrous for environmental, thus, leading to prevent any mishap. The design is mapped over a metropolitan city of Pakistan, i.e. Karachi, thus initiating the transformation of Karachi to a smart city.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has been deeply penetrated into a wide range of important and critical sectors, including smart city, water, transportation, manufacturing, and smart factory. Massive data are being acquired from a fast growing number of IoT devices. Efficient data processing is a necessity to meet diversified and stringent requirements of many emerging IoT applications. Due to the constrained computation and storage resources, IoT devices have resorted to the powerful cloud computing to process their data. However, centralized and remote cloud computing may introduce unacceptable communication delay since its physical location is far away from IoT devices. Edge cloud has been introduced to overcome this issue by moving the cloud in closer proximity to IoT devices. The orchestration and cooperation between the cloud and the edge provides a crucial computing architecture for IoT applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool to enable the intelligent orchestration in this architecture. This article first introduces such a kind of computing architecture from the perspective of IoT applications. It then investigates the state-of-the-art proposals on AI-powered cloud-edge orchestration for the IoT. Finally, a list of potential research challenges and open issues is provided and discussed, which can provide useful resources for carrying out future research in this area.},

abstract={The relentless development of the Internet of Things (IoT) communication technologies and the gradual maturity of artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a powerful cognitive computing ability. Users can now access efficient and convenient smart services in smart-city, green-IoT, and heterogeneous networks. AI has been applied in various areas, including the intelligent household, advanced health-care, automatic driving, and emotional interactions. This paper focuses on current wireless-communication technologies, including cellular-communication technologies (4G, 5G), low-power wide-area (LPWA) technologies with an unlicensed spectrum (LoRa, SigFox), and other LPWA technologies supported by 3GPP working with an authorized spectrum (EC-GSM, LTE-M, NB-IoT). We put forward a cognitive LPWA-network (Cognitive-LPWAN) architecture to safeguard stable and efficient communications in a heterogeneous IoT. To ensure that the user can employ the AI efficiently and conveniently, we realize a variety of LPWA technologies to safeguard the network layer. In addition, to balance the demand for heterogeneous IoT devices with the communication delay and energy consumption, we put forward the AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method, starting from the perspective of traffic control. The AI algorithm provides the smart control of wireless-communication technology, intelligent applications and services for the choice of different wireless-communication technologies. As an example, we consider the AIWAC emotion interaction system, build the Cognitive-LPWAN and test the proposed AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method. The experimental results show that our scheme can meet the demands of communication-delay applications. Cognitive-LPWAN selects appropriate communication technologies to achieve a better interaction experience.},

pages={923-948},
abstract={Most of the vehicle manufacturers aim to deploy level-5 fully autonomous ground vehicles (FAGVs) on city roads in 2021 by leveraging extensive existing knowledge about sensors, actuators, telematics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) gained from the level-3 and level-4 autonomy. FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure. With this framework, the concept of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) is transformed into the concept of Automated ITS (A-ITS). Cities currently designed for cars can turn into cities developed for citizens using FAGVinSCF enabling more sustainable cities.},

abstract={In smart cities, the Internet of Things (IoT) consists of many low-power smart nodes. Its robustness is essential for protection of communication in data science against node failures caused by energy shortage or cyber-attacks. Scale-free networking topology, widely applied in IoT, is effectively resilient to random attacks but is vulnerable to malicious ones in which high-degree nodes are made to fail. The prohibitively high computational cost of existing robustness optimization algorithms is an obstacle to efficient topology self-optimization. To solve this problem, a novel robust networking model based on artificial intelligence is proposed to improve IoT topology robustness to protect its communication. Using the Back-Propagation neural network learning algorithm, the model extracts topology features from a dataset by supervised training. The experimental results show that the model achieves better prediction accuracy, thereby optimizing the topology with minimal computation overhead.},

abstract={Smart environments, such as Industry 4.0 or smart cities, are based on digital technologies that collect large amounts of data and artificial intelligence applications—or agents—to analyze this data and optimize various operational aspects of the environment. However, any intelligent environment must include humans. In this case, the interactions between humans and agents, referred to as human-agent interaction (HAI), will occur in complex arrangements involving multiple humans and agents interacting concurrently along with various scenarios. Agents’ ability to learn and perform their tasks is contingent on some degree of consistency in their interactions with humans. A lack of such consistency would jeopardize their learning and performance. It is thus necessary to integrate humans and agents across the entire environment consistently. Assuming that HAI is a complex system, the paper argues that ensuring HAI consistency can be achieved by deploying a new class of agents devoted to managing human-agent interactions, the Human Digital Twin (HDT). The proposed HDTs are placed alongside each human in the HAI environment to observe and learn about their interaction patterns and then use them to ensure HAI consistency.},

Artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and smart cities have all reached their peaks due to the advent of 5G. However, the network environment is becoming more complex, and the types of cyberattacks are gradually increasing. Once the network device is attacked, the loss it brings cannot be calculated. The intrusion detection system is a very effective measure in protecting network security.

Experiments are constructed based on the CIC-IDS2018 dataset. We compare the proposed model with DNN and CNN.

abstract={With the development of technology and economy, the planning and construction of smart cities have generated new demands and goals. Artificial intelligence-led technologies and applications are changing people's lives where location-based services are one of the most important technical supports. In recent years, the popularity of portable devices with GPS (Global Positioning System) function and the development of positioning technology make a large amount of individual track data accessible. Consequently, collecting personal semantic location by mining these tracklogs would be the application direction and research focus of location-based services. Personal semantic location is a practical significant location that users will visit frequently, stay for a long time such as a home address, workplace, etc.). The acquisition of personal semantic location involves two steps, which are acquiring location and matching semantics. Currently, most of the relevant research use density clustering-based algorithms to collect location data. When the original DBSCAN algorithm is used to acquire location, all the trajectory points in the raw dataset need to be included in the clustering samples, which increases calculation and reduces the program efficiency. This paper addresses this problem and proposes an advanced density-based clustering algorithm STF-DBSCAN. First, the trajectory points in the raw dataset are filtered to obtain the dwell points. Then, the dwell points are clustered and analyzed to achieve the purpose of improving the running efficiency. For the semantic recognition issue, this paper pre-defines the daily behavior pattern of individual and analyzes the temporal features of the trajectory points in each class. When using the same trajectory data samples for location acquisition, the running time of the proposed algorithm in this paper is one-fifteenth of the original algorithm.},

However, making sure that the data is not tampered with is of the utmost importance. One way to do this is to utilize blockchain technology to record and trace the history of the data. Park and Kim proposed ensuring the trustworthiness of the data by utilizing an IoT device with a trusted execution environment (TEE). Also, Guan et al. proposed authenticating an IoT device and mediating data using a TEE. For the authentication, they use the physically unclonable function of the IoT device. Usually, IoT devices suffer from the lack of resources necessary for creating transactions for the blockchain ledger. In this paper, we present a secure protocol in which a TEE acts as a proxy to the IoT devices and creates the necessary transactions for the blockchain. We use an authenticated encryption method on the data transmission between the IoT device and TEE to authenticate the device and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data generated by the IoT devices.},

abstract={A framework to predict cramps during Activities of Daily Living (ADL) to contribute towards assisted living and healthy aging of the constantly increasing elderly population, in the future of Internet of Things (IoT)-based interconnected living environments, for instance Smart Homes and Smart Cities is proposed in this paper. The framework leverages the immense potential at the intersection of IoT, Big Data, Human Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence and their interrelated disciplines. Leg cramps are known to be associated with all age groups but studies [1], [2] have shown that cramps are more frequent in older adults and have a multitude of risks and associated impacts, both temporary and permanent, which affect their quality of life and their abilities to perform ADL – which are essential for one’s sustenance. The challenge in this field is to predict cramps to minimize their effects on the performance of older adults during ADL, with an aim to improve their quality of life in the future of living environments. Addressing this challenge through development of a framework for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) of elderly in Smart Homes serves as the main motivation for this work. To evaluate the efficacy of this proposed approach it has been tested on a dataset of ADL and the performance characteristics are discussed. A case study has also been performed where performance characteristics of various learning models are compared to deduce the best learning model for development of this framework. The results presented uphold the relevance and immense potential of this work for contributing towards AAL of the elderly population in Smart Homes through accurate prediction of cramps during ADL.},

abstract={With the development of smart cities, the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) based services grows exponentially. The existing works just focus on cloud- edge or edge-device cooperative AI which suffers low learning efficiency of AI, while edge-to-edge cooperative AI is still an unresolved issue. Moreover, the existing researches concentrate on the computation offloading of the AI-based task, ignoring that it is a brain-like task performing sophisticated processing to raw data, which leads to the high latency and low quality of the learning services. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an on-demand learning offloading mechanism for edge-to-edge cooperative AI. Firstly, the principle of the learning capability and its offloading are proposed for the formal description of the learning resources migration. Secondly, the proposed mechanism realizes the bilateral learning offloading utilizing edge-to-edge and cloud-edge collaborations to handle AI-based tasks with high learning efficiency and resource utilization rate. Moreover, we model the edge-to-edge learning offloading allocation based on the concatenation of deep neural network (DNN) subtasks and their heterogeneous requirement of learning resources. Simulation results indicate the rationality and efficiency of the proposed mechanism.},

abstract={Nowadays, 5G network is considered to be one of the main pillars of various industries, including the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, virtual reality, and many more. Unlike previous network generations, 5G utilizes complex digital technologies such as massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and runs over higher radio frequencies. The introduction of new technologies and advanced features in the 5G network raises new challenges for network operators, and merging Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the effective solutions to address these complexities. However, AI-enabled 5G network engenders security concerns and requires improvement to meet the standardization and qualification of the new network generation. To mitigate these dilemmas, Blockchain must be integrated. Blockchain, as a decentralized methodology provides a secure sharing of information and resources among various nodes of 5G environments. Blockchain can support other technologies, such as AI-based 5G, to create smarter, more efficient, and secure cellular networks. In this article, we present a comprehensive intelligence and secure data analytics framework for 5G networks based on the convergence of Blockchain and AI named “Block5GIntell”. We depict the applications of Blockchain and AI on 5G networks separately and we argue on the support that Blockchain can provide for AI to create smart and secure 5G networks relying on our proposed framework. To support our proposition, we present an energy-saving case study using Blockchain for AI-enabled 5G. The simulation shows an overall 20% decrease in energy consumption at the RAN level.},

abstract={The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has a significant impact on people’s lives, occupations, businesses, and economies globally. The world economic market is experiencing a big shift and the share market has observed crashes day-by-day. Even, the Indian economy has witnessed a slowdown in the current pandemic, and recovery of it is quite difficult. The restrictions and restrain strategies (e.g., lockdown and social distancing) introduced by the government leave many professions and facilities in a dormant state, catalyzing economy downfall. It necessitates to improve economy along with control strategies of COVID-19, which is a challenging task. To handle the above-mentioned issues, this article proposes a novel economy-boosting scheme, i.e., $\xi $ boost, which is a fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics (BDA) integrated with the Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based data communication. Here, a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) model is anticipated for early prediction of total positive cases as well as the economy. Then, it calculates an optimal subsegment of days, in which trade and commerce related restrictions could be reduced to control a sharp decline in the economy. Next, a spark-based pre and post unlock (PPU) analytics is carried out on the rise of COVID-19 cases to validate the intensity of testing in the country and deciding economy-boosting activities. Then, the $\xi $ boost scheme is evaluated based on various factors such as prediction accuracy and others while comparing to existing approaches. It facilitates healthy and profitable smart cities by the means to control pandemic with subsequent economy rise.},

abstract={The era of pervasive computing has resulted in countless devices that continuously monitor users and their environment, generating an abundance of user behavioural data. Such data may support improving the quality of service, but may also lead to adverse usages such as surveillance and advertisement. In parallel, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are being applied to sensitive fields such as healthcare, justice, or human resources, raising multiple concerns on the trustworthiness of such systems. Trust in AI systems is thus intrinsically linked to ethics, including the ethics of algorithms, the ethics of data, or the ethics of practice. In this paper, we formalise the requirements of trustworthy AI systems through an ethics perspective. We specifically focus on the aspects that can be integrated into the design and development of AI systems. After discussing the state of research and the remaining challenges, we show how a concrete use-case in smart cities can benefit from these methods.},

pages={396-405},
abstract={Databases as software components may be used to serve a variety of smart applications. Currently, the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud technologies are used in the course of projects such as the Horizon 2020 EU-Korea DECENTER project in order to implement four smart applications in the domains of Smart Homes, Smart Cities, Smart Construction and Robot Logistics. In these smart applications the Big Data pipeline starts from various sensor and video streams to which AI and feature extraction methods are applied. The resulting information is stored in database containers, which have to be placed on Edge, Fog or Cloud infrastructures. The placement decision depends on complex application requirements, including Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Information that must be considered when making placement decisions includes the expected workload, the list of candidate infrastructures, geolocation, connectivity and similar. Software engineers currently perform such decisions manually, which usually leads to QoS threshold violations. This paper aims to automate the process of making such decisions. Therefore, the goals of this paper are to: (1) develop a decision making method for database container placement; (2) formally verify each placement decision and provide probability assurances to the software engineer for high QoS; and (3) design and implement a new architecture that automates the whole process. A new optimisation method is introduced, which is based on the theory and practice of stochastic Markov Decision Processes (MDP). It uses as input monitoring data from the container runtime, the expected workload and user-related metrics in order to automatically construct a probabilistic finite automaton. The generated automaton is used for both automated decision making and placement success verification. The method is implemented in Java. It also uses the PRISM model-checking tool. Kubernetes is used in order to automate the whole process when orchestrating database containers across Edge, Fog and Cloud infrastructures. Experiments are performed for NoSQL Cassandra database containers for three representative workloads of 50000 (workload 1), 200000 (workload 2) and 500000 (workload 3) CRUD database operations. Five computing infrastructures serve as candidates for database container placement. The new MDP-based method is compared with the widely used Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The obtained results are used to analyse container placement decisions. When using the new MDP based method there were no QoS violations in any of the placement cases, while when using the AHP based method the placement results in some QoS threshold violations in all workload cases. Due to its properties, the new MDP method is particularly suitable for implementation. The paper also describes a multi-tier distributed computing system that uses multi-level (infrastructure, container, application) monitoring metrics and Kubernetes in order to orchestrate database containers across Edge, Fog and Cloud nodes. This architecture demonstrates fully automated decision making and high QoS container operation.},

abstract={In this paper a prototype to classify sounds emitted by car engines to be used for urban traffic management in smart cities is presented. The solution is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) executed on a resource constrained low cost embedded micro controller integrated into a sensing unit very close to the microphone. The prototype operates without the need of being connected to a remote server through an always-on connectivity. The adoption of an on-the-edge artificial intelligence architecture brings a set of advantages: safety, reliability, promptness and low power consumption. The embedded intelligence is trained from a purpose-built dataset enclosing environmental car engine sound data. A pre trained ANN classifies sound events and counts cars approaching and leaving the microphone by sensing the Doppler Effects in the sound emitted by the moving vehicles. The results showed in this paper refer to the application running on the Sensortile Development Kit board from STMicroelectronics, featuring 128KB of RAM and 1MB of Flash memory. The development of the proposed solution was somehow inspired by the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda defines a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It does so by defining 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to enable the transformation into a more peaceful and free society. Among them, the ones which interested the authors to develop the proposed solution were the following; Goal 3: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” Goal 11: “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” Goal 13: “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”.},

The electric vehicle EV is one of the solutions recommended by the vehicle manufacturers and research organizations to reduce noise pollution, fuel consumption, real time and time execution for tasks in networking EV. The transport and mobility sector has for more than a decade seen a fundamental change in its organization due to a double technological revolution and use a new forms of mobility. This motion has profound consequences on the relationship that citizens maintain with mobility. It also proposes a physical platform able to perform a form of platooning using Artificial Intelligence (AI) with scheduler to create platoons with miniature vehicle. Platform called Autonomous Learning Intelligent Vehicles is the association of multiple physical cars coupled with an infrastructure, which handles the data of every single car and makes decisions based on the augmented environmental. In this solution, we present tracking and detection of EVs in parking or in station. So, we change communications EVs, giving priority to charging demands over other types of sms lower priority messages. Finally, we propose an efficient admission control mechanism to manage EVs traffic and to provide quality of Service to charging demand messages in terms of strict delay to avoid both a long latency of EV users and a network overload in high offered load conditions.},

abstract={Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have a strategic goal to achieve service delivery in roads and smart cities, considering the integration and communication between vehicles, sensors and fixed road-side components (routers, gateways and services). VANETs have singular characteristics such as fast mobile nodes, self-organization, distributed network and frequently changing topology. Despite the recent evolution of VANETs, security, data integrity and users privacy information are major concerns, since attacks prevention is still open issue. One of the most dangerous attacks in VANETs is the Sybil, which forges false identities in the network to disrupt compromise the communication between the network nodes. Sybil attacks affect the service delivery related to road safety, traffic congestion, multimedia entertainment and others. Thus, VANETs claim for security mechanism to prevent Sybil attacks. Within this context, this paper proposes a mechanism, called SyDVELM, to detect Sybil attacks in VANETs based on artificial intelligence techniques. The SyDVELM mechanism uses Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with occasional features of vehicular nodes, minimizing the identification time, maximizing the detection accuracy and improving the scalability. The results suggest that the suitability of SyDVELM mechanism to mitigate Sybil attacks and to maintain the service delivery in VANETs.},

However, heterogeneous data source in smart cities are continuously producing low-quality data, and ever-growing applications have greater real-time requirements. Therefore, this article proposes a data stream cleaning system (named DSCS) using edge intelligence to utilize the advantages of cloud servers and edge devices. The DSCS in edge nodes consists of a dynamic protocol interpreter, a structure parser, and a cleaning model activator. Meanwhile, a cloud server, which has pools of protocol and structured programs and cleaning models, supports the edge nodes to adapt massive heterogeneous data sources. To validate the proposed data cleaning system, we applied it to two scenarios: monitoring the injection molding machines, and base stations. The DSCS can have a stable processing time when the number of accessed edge devices is increased, as well as a good cleaning effect.},

abstract={Adaptation of artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions at sensitive locations is growing rapidly. Use of these techniques along with surveillance cameras has become a primary requirement of smart cities to convert data into intelligible information. Consequently, these solutions are minimizing the effort of training and reliance on human resource. In this research paper, we have devised use cases of object detection with focus on human and luggage detection in real-time using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technique YOLOv3. This technique, trained on MS-COCO dataset, has not been able to produce desirable results when tested on images from subcontinent region containing luggage, human or both. As a case study, we enhanced MS-COCO dataset by incorporating our own collection of realistic images. The study is carried out on a commodity hardware to strengthen our claim to use technology over humans. The proposed solution is developed for analysing video streams in real time against a predefined rules-set. Idea to automate the process of surveillance at strategic locations without human intervention opens a new window of research for literary community to develop cost effective solutions.},

abstract={The new Fifth-Generation (5G) mobile networks entail next-generation network management solutions to manage both physical and virtual network infrastructures and services. The challenge is to effectively manage the increased complexity due to virtualization and softwarization, whilst attempting to reduce the operational costs for 5G operators. This paper focuses on the approach of the EU Horizon 2020 5G-PPP project SliceNet to meet this challenge. SliceNet is implementing an intelligence-based autonomic end-to-end slicing-friendly infrastructure for 5G networks. The paper describes SliceNet's virtualized Mobile/Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure segment as a solution to manage the combination of edge and cloud computing for the new services emerging on the vertical industries as part of the new 5G mobile networks. It presents the vision and recent development of the project on the MEC part of the architecture, and the artificial intelligence approach being investigated in the project. Moreover, the paper introduces three representative use cases to describe how the framework organizes between cloud and edge. These use cases show how the MEC and cloud computing can be combined for services in e-health, smart-grids, and smart-cities verticals.},

abstract={Since the beginning of twenty-first century, Malaysian civil and defense systems became increasingly dependent on sophisticated electronic and wireless systems. This led to the use of many intelligent applications and emerging the smart cities which highly rely on modern technologies such as smart telecommunication, smart grid, smart transportation, artificial intelligence, smart health, enterprise Internet of Things, smart building management systems and smart governance. These introduced new services and practices which highly impacting the planning, policy, development, and operation of infrastructure of society, while co-exist with urban facilities, and must be electromagnetic compatible with the existing systems. Hence, it initiated Intentional Electromagnetic Interference which could be a significant threat towards civil, defense, industrial, and commercial sectors, with possible targets of radio and television, telecommunication networks, grid power networks, railway networks, air traffic control, government and banking administrative networks, or even defense system as well. The susceptibility and vulnerability of these sensitive systems due to the electromagnetic interference in the current decades will keep of increasing due to the expansion and spread of radiation sources.. Threats from high power microwave sources and high power electromagnetic pulses and high-altitude electromagnetic pulse on civil and defense infrastructure that include an electronic equipment and wireless systems could be harmful and may cause disturbances and damages on electronic devices and wireless systems. This paper presents an overview of the important events in history related to the high power electromagnetic sources that is paving the way for enhancing the understanding of electromagnetic interference capabilities in disturbing modern infrastructure systems.

abstract={Indian educational satellite, EDUSAT, launched from GSLV was the world's first dedicated satellite to provide education to rural and urban students through Virtual Classrooms. Around 15 million students across 26 States of India receive education each year. UNESCO's Institute for Statistics (UIS) suggests that, over 68 million trained school teachers will be needed across the world to achieve the objective of Universal Education Goal. To realize this, we require conventional education, as well as Satellite Networks that foster interactive and inexpensive distance education through e-learning. This type of learning process will provide education for all. The Indian educational satellite networks are compared with those of other nations to understand the methodologies to improve literacy. The value addition provided by educational technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Augmented Reality, Virtual Classroom, etc. in association with satellite networks, is also investigated. In the urban areas and Smart Cities, high tech education is best implemented by using high bandwidth satellite networks in conjunction with high speed terrestrial optical fiber links and modern EdTech. This paper examines the synergistic utilization of educational technologies with ubiquitous connectivity of satellites to provide education to tribal as well as remote hilly regions like the recently created Union Territory of Ladakh. This study gives input to the initiatives of the Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD) of the Government of India for the proposed New Education Policy (NEP), which envisages equitable and inclusive education for all.},

abstract={These days the Human Action Recognition (HAR) is playing a vital role in several applications such as surveillance systems, gaming, robotics, and so on. Interpreting the actions performed by a person from the video is one of the essential tasks of intelligent surveillance systems in the smart city, smart building, etc. Human action can be recognized either by using models such as depth, skeleton, or combinations of these models. In this paper, we propose the human action recognition system based on the 3D skeleton model. Since the role of different joints varies while performing the action, in the proposed work, we use the most informative distance and the angle between joints in the skeleton model as a feature set. Further, we propose a deep learning framework for human action recognition based on these features. We performed experiments using MSRAction3D, a publicly available dataset for 3D HAR, and the results demonstrated that the proposed framework obtained the accuracies of 95.83%, 92.9%, and 98.63% on three subsets of the dataset AS1, AS2, and AS3, respectively, using the protocols of [19].},

Hence, this paper proposes a novel deep learning algorithm called DeepVDD to facilitate vehicle-assisted data delivery. First, a theoretical analysis is presented to quantitatively reveal the correlation between vehicle mobility and the success ratio of vehicle-assisted data delivery. Based on the findings in analysis, DeepVDD adopts a novel multi-headed neural network to determine the strategies for vehicles to deliver data. Comprehensive evaluations have been executed based on the real taxi mobility data in Tokyo, Japan. The results have validated that, compared with other state-of-art algorithms, DeepVDD not only improves the success ratio of data delivery, but also significantly reduces the communication overhead of vehicular networks.},

abstract={Photovoltaic power generation forecasting (PVGF) is an attractive research topic for efficient energy management in smart city. In addition, the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM/RNN) has been actively utilized for predicting various time series tasks in recent years due to its outstanding ability to learn the feature of sequential time-series data. Although the existing forecasting models were obtained from learning the sequential PVGF data, it is observed that irregular factors made adverse effects on the forecasting results of very-short-term PVGF tasks, thus, the entire forecasting performance was deteriorated. In this regard, multiscale LSTM-based deep learning which is capable for forecasting very-short-term PVGF is proposed for efficient management. The model concatenates on two different scaled LSTM modules to overcome the deterioration that is originated from the irregular factors. Lastly, experimental results present the proposed framework can assist to forecast the tendency of PVGF amount steadily.},

abstract={Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is having a significant impact in a wide range of applications in smart city, smart home, and personal healthcare. Such wide deployment of HAR systems often faces the annotation-scarcity challenge; that is, most of the HAR techniques, especially the deep learning techniques, require a large number of training data while annotating sensor data is very time- and effort-consuming. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been successfully applied to tackle this challenge, where the activity knowledge from a well-annotated domain can be transferred to a new, unlabelled domain. However, these existing techniques do not perform well on highly heterogeneous domains. This article proposes shift-GAN that integrate bidirectional generative adversarial networks (Bi-GAN) and kernel mean matching (KMM) in an innovative way to learn intrinsic, robust feature transfer between two heterogeneous domains. Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data.},

abstract={In this paper we tackle the problem of vehicle re-identification in a camera network utilizing triplet embeddings. Re-identification is the problem of matching appearances of objects across different cameras. With the proliferation of surveillance cameras enabling smart and safer cities, there is an ever-increasing need to re-identify vehicles across cameras. Typical challenges arising in smart city scenarios include variations of viewpoints, illumination and self occlusions. Most successful approaches for re-identification involve (deep) learning an embedding space such that the vehicles of same identities are projected closer to one another, compared to the vehicles representing different identities. Popular loss functions for learning an embedding (space) include contrastive or triplet loss. In this paper we provide an extensive evaluation of these losses applied to vehicle re-identification and demonstrate that using the best practices for learning embeddings outperform most of the previous approaches proposed in the vehicle re-identification literature. Compared to most existing state-of-the-art approaches, our approach is simpler and more straightforward for training utilizing only identity-level annotations, along with one of the smallest published embedding dimensions for efficient inference. Furthermore in this work we introduce a formal evaluation of a triplet sampling variant (batch sample) into the re-identification literature.},

abstract={An effective transportation system is important for supporting various human activities in a modern smart city. The waiting time at various stations has great impacts on the overall transportation system efficiency and people's health like stress and anxiety. Knowing the waiting time at different locations in advance can assist the travelers to plan their trips. However, such waiting time may depend on many factors like crowdedness and the collective travel behaviors of the travellers involved. In general, it is very expensive to collect all the required data at every location. In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed for determining the waiting time levels at public transport stations based on some proxy data and limited historical waiting time data at some stations. We formulate the public transportation network as a graph and develop a semi-supervised classification model based on Graph Convolutional Networks which can operate directly on the graph-structured data with limited labelled data. We conduct experiments for the mass transit railway in Hong Kong with real data and our proposed approach can achieve 89% accuracy of classifying the waiting time levels.},

Recent works of adversarial attacks have explored the serious vulnerability of deep Re-ID systems. However, existing attacks are performed with idealized conditions and ignore the real-world environments, such as occlusion caused by walking habits. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method to perform an occlusion resilient adversarial attack for better evaluation of deep Re-ID systems. Specifically, we construct the occlusion template from the observation and statics of pedestrian walking habits. Then, we design a partition training strategy for a better combination of occluded and exposed adversarial patches. During the training, we introduce contextual loss to penalize the semantic distance of attacked images with the same identity. The extensive experiments on Market1501 demonstrate the performance of our method.},

abstract={Health management has become a primary problem as new kinds of diseases and complex symptoms are introduced to a rapidly growing modern society. Building a better and smarter healthcare infrastructure is one of the ultimate goals of a smart city. To the best of our knowledge, neural network models are already employed to assist healthcare professionals in achieving this goal. Typically, training a neural network requires a rich amount of data but heterogeneous and vulnerable properties of clinical data introduce a challenge for the traditional centralized network. Moreover, adding new inputs to a medical database requires re-training an existing model from scratch. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a deep learning-based clinical decision support system trained and managed under a federated learning paradigm. We focused on a novel strategy to guarantee the safety of patient privacy and overcome the risk of cyberattacks while enabling large-scale clinical data mining. As a result, we can leverage rich clinical data for training each local neural network without the need for exchanging the confidential data of patients. Moreover, we implemented the proposed scheme as a sequence-to-sequence model architecture integrating the attention mechanism. Thus, our objective is to provide a personalized clinical decision support system with evolvable characteristics that can deliver accurate solutions and assist healthcare professionals in medical diagnosing.},

abstract={The ubiquitous commercial Wi-Fi has brought unlimited possibilities to the smart city and the Internet of Things. Wi-Fi device-free sensing technology has received more and more attention in recent years. Counting the people in queuing is an uneasy task due to labile information. Most current counting schemes have existed in an ideal environment with idealistic people's behavior. In this article, we propose a more realistic counting scheme called Que-Fi, a queue number identification system based on Wi-Fi channel state information and a deep learning network. In the proposed Que-Fi scheme, the nonnegligible interference of human motion and the surrounding environment is first analyzed based on the Fresnel zone. Then, we proposed a static model based on the convolutional long short-term memory fully connected deep neural network in order to overcome the interference. A dynamic Que-Fi model is proposed to identify the entering/leaving people's behavior and update the counting number. In this article, different preprocessing methods are analyzed and compared to test and evaluate the proposed Que-Fi. Experiments have shown that the proposed Que-Fi outperforms the traditional support vector machine and provide accuracy up to 95% and 96.67% for static and dynamic models, respectively.},

abstract={A neat and clean surrounding is the main driving force for any city to be called a smart city. By 2050, it is expected that 66% of the world population will live in cities. The growing volumes of wastes are largely caused by urbanization and industry growth. The residents of a city can have a direct impact in the waste management efforts by the approach that they take towards sorting their waste. Therefore, a system that can observe the sorting behavior of each resident and provide a motivating force towards proper sorting can be essential in shaping one aspect of the sustainability culture in a city. To achieve this goal, we proposed and developed an IoT based solution that can observe and score the sorting behavior of a user based on the items thrown into a particular dustbin. Additionally, this system can also record the temperature, humidity, pressure, and air quality inside the dustbin, as well as fill level of the bin to inform the users when the bin needs to be emptied. The proposed system uses solar panels as its main source of power and does not store any personal information about the items that users throw into the dustbin. All data processing happens onboard inside the dustbin and only the results are sent over to the cloud database. The results from the deep learning models for trash classification are promising with accuracy up to 88%. Although there is still space for improvement, the proposed system shows promising results in terms of reliability and accuracy for a smart framework to promote sustainable behaviors among the society.},

abstract={Traffic surveillance is essential for regulating traffic and reducing congestion. Nonetheless, the video data generated is non-structured, high-volume, bandwidth intensive and also raises privacy concerns. Edge computing solves these issues by preprocessing the data locally. In this paper we propose a fast, realtime vehicle detection and tracking method running on an edge device. The device sends only a single high resolution image of each detected vehicle accompanied with its trajectory. Allowing not only lower bandwidth requirements for smart city cameras, but also improved privacy, as only minimum required data is sent for post-processing. We implement object detection and tracking on an edge device, validate it in a real city environment and compare it to a state-of-the-art deep learning method using a publicly available benchmark data set where our method shows speed increase of up to 24 times.},

abstract={To meet the stringent demands of emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, such as smart home, smart city, and virtual reality in 5G/6G IoT networks, edge content caching for mobile/multiaccess edge computing (MEC) has been identified as a promising approach to improve the quality of services in terms of latency and energy consumption. However, the limitations of cache capacity make it difficult to develop an effective common caching framework that satisfies diverse user preferences. In this article, we propose a new content caching strategy that maximizes the cache hit ratio through flexible prediction in dynamically changing network and user environments. It is based on a hierarchical deep learning architecture: long short-term memory (LSTM)-based local learning and ensemble-based meta-learning. First, as a local learning model, we employ an LSTM method with seasonal-trend decomposition using loess (STL)-based preprocessing. It identifies the attributes for demand prediction on the contents in various demographic user groups. Second, as a metalearning model, we employ a regression-based ensemble learning method, which uses an online convex optimization framework and exhibits sublinear “regret” performance. It orchestrates the obtained multiple demographic user preferences into a unified caching strategy in real time. Extensive experiments were conducted on the popular MovieLens data sets. It was shown that the proposed control provides up to a 30% higher cache hit ratio than conventional representative algorithms and a near-optimal cache hit ratio within approximately 9% of the optimal caching scheme with perfect prior knowledge of content popularity. The proposed learning and caching control can be implemented as a core function of the 5G/6G standard’s network data analytic function (NWDAF) module.},

abstract={Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are critical to any smart city strategy. They are used to optimize the flow of urban traffic which in turn leads to a reduction in time spent traveling. In order for ITS to work properly, sensors that collect real-time traffic flow information from streets and highways are required so the ITS can know the current state of the traffic. However, such sensors are prone to failures and network faults. This poses a serious hindrance when performing data analysis and knowledge extraction on sensor data due to the fact that such data is composed of noisy and missing values. In this work, we benchmark several deep learning based methods for filling missing values in a dataset collected from 2013 to 2015 in the city of Oporto, Portugal. The dataset is composed of readings of 26 sensors that measure traffic information in 5 minute intervals. Around 12% of all values are missing.},

abstract={With the rapid growth in the demand for internet-of-things (IoT) systems such as factory of future, smart home, smart city, long-term healthcare, deep learning (DL) applications have attracted significant attention from people. However, it is challenging to inference such tasks on computational limited IoT devices due to the massive computational requirements of DL models. The conventional solution is to deliver data collected from IoT devices to remote cloud for computation, while this may not only rely heavily on networking resources but also cause security risks. The rising concept of edge computing gives us another solution. Tasks can be decomposed by different scales. Model-level decomposition is to inference the models in the task pipeline on different computing devices, while layer-level decomposition is to inference the layers in the single DL model on different computing devices. Both scales of decomposition can be inferenced on edge-cloud framework or simply device-edge framework based on different considerations. This would lead to several aspects of management: resource management for both networking resources and computing resources as well as application configuration management. In this work, we first design configuration tables for different application tasks, with different choices of DL models, different parameter settings, and different layer-level partition points, then we apply Vick-rey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction to allocate both networking and computing resources by assigning each IoT device a proper configuration. We also show some desired properties such as truthfulness of the mechanism and observe that the VCG truly utilizes both resources better.},

abstract={Recently, the research of WiFi-based indoor localization combing with deep-learning techniques has earned wide attention due to its potential applications in smart cities. In this paper, a novel fingerprinting system is proposed to achieve indoor localization via learning spatiotemporal features from channel state information (CSI) of multiple-input multiple-output wireless channels (CSI-MIMO) by a dual-stream three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (DS-3DCNN). In the proposed system, the gathered raw CSI-MIMO data are firstly preprocessed through amplitude outliers elimination and phase sanitization for constructing a pair of 3D CSI-MIMO matrices including a 3D amplitude matrix and a 3D phase matrix. Next, the 3D matrices will be input to the DS-3DCNN deep neural network which consists of two parallel subnetworks with specific architecture of several convolution, batch normalization, max-pooling, and fully connected layers. Through this DS-3DCNN network, learning spatiotemporal features of CSI-MIMO is carried out simultaneously from 3D amplitude and phase matrices. And then, probabilistic classification results of two subnetworks are fused in the final output layer of the proposed DS-3DCNN based on Bayes' theorem. Moreover, in the offline training stage, a dual-stream joint optimization method is presented for efficiently optimizing network parameters. After offline training of the DS-3DCNN, in the online locating stage, current CSI-MIMO data are firstly collected from the mobile device to be located. Then probabilistic classification results are obtained from the output layer of the DS-3DCNN, and further used to approximate the posterior distribution of the mobile device's location with a Gaussian mixture model. Finally, a novel location estimation algorithm is deduced based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Since unique features of wireless MIMO channels are jointly learnt in spatial, temporal, and frequency domains, the proposed DS-3DCNN based fingerprinting system is reasonable to provide accurate localization results in indoor environments, which is verified in corresponding experiments.},

abstract={With the development of cloud computing, the storage and processing of massive visual media data has gradually transferred to the cloud server. For example, if the intelligent video monitoring system cannot process a large amount of data locally, the data will be uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, how to process data in the cloud without exposing the original data has become an important research topic. We propose a single-server version of somewhat homomorphic encryption cryptosystem based on confused modulo projection theorem named CMP-SWHE, which allows the server to complete blind data processing without seeing the effective information of user data. On the client side, the original data is encrypted by amplification, randomization, and setting confusing redundancy. Operating on the encrypted data on the server side is equivalent to operating on the original data. As an extension, we designed and implemented a blind computing scheme of accelerated version based on batch processing technology to improve efficiency. To make this algorithm easy to use, we also designed and implemented an efficient general blind computing library based on CMP-SWHE. We have applied this library to foreground extraction, optical flow tracking, and object detection with satisfactory results, which are helpful for building smart cities. We also discuss how to extend the algorithm to deep learning applications. Compared with other homomorphic encryption cryptosystems and libraries, the results show that our method has obvious advantages in computing efficiency. Although our algorithm has some tiny errors ( $10^{-6}$ ) when the data is too large, it is very efficient and practical, especially suitable for blind image and video processing.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted significant attentions in the fifth generation mobile networks and the smart cities. However, considering the large numbers of connectivity demands, it is vital to improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) of the IoT with an affordable power consumption. To improve the SE, the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is newly proposed through accommodating multiple users in the same spectrums. As a result, in this paper, an energy efficient resource allocation (RA) problem is introduced for the NOMA-based heterogeneous IoT. At first, we assume the successive interference cancellation (SIC) is imperfect for practical implementations. Then, based on the analyzing method for cognitive radio networks, we present a stepwise RA scheme for the mobile users and the IoT users with the mutual interference management. Third, we propose a deep recurrent neural network-based algorithm to solve the problem optimally and rapidly. Moreover, a priorities and rate demands-based user scheduling method is supplemented, to coordinate the access of the heterogeneous users with the limited radio resource. At last, the simulation results verify that the deep learning-based scheme is able to provide optimal RA results for the NOMA heterogeneous IoT with fast convergence and low computational complexity. Compared with the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiple access system, the NOMA system with imperfect SIC yields better performance on the SE and the scale of connectivity, at the cost of high power consumption and low energy efficiency.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has garnered considerable interest in recent years as its technical capabilities have facilitated the creation of a diverse variety of commercial revenue models and services (e.g., medical cyber-physical systems, smart agriculture, Industry 4.0, smart cities, etc.). However, the security gaps in intelligent systems continue to be a significant source of concern. Malevolent attackers employ attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) to weaken system availability. To mitigate attack traffic, adopting a modern Software-defined Networked backbone and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) paradigm has proven to be a potential approach.

IIoT has several applications in smart homes, smart cities, smart grids, connected cars, and supply chain management. However, these systems are being more frequently targeted by cybercriminals. Deep learning and big data analytics have great potential in designing and developing robust security mechanisms for IIoT networks. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep random neural network (HDRaNN) for cyberattack detection in the IIoT is presented. The HDRaNN combines a deep random neural network and a multilayer perceptron with dropout regularization. The proposed technique is evaluated using two IIoT security-related datasets: (i) DS2OS and (ii) UNSW-NB15. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed through a number of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, log loss, Region of Convergence (ROC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The HDRaNN classified 16 different types of cyberattacks using with higher accuracy of 98% and 99% for DS2OS and UNSW-NB15, respectively. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the performance metrics are also compared with several state-of-the-art attack detection algorithms.

abstract={With the continuous growth of urban population, it is urgent for people to accurately plan the travel time. Therefore, travel time prediction of urban areas has become a key research direction in the field of smart cities. At present, several studies on travel time prediction are only conducted on a single mode, where the prediction process only treats a certain vehicle as an isolated traffic state on the route. However, the factors affecting traffic are extremely complex, thus making it very difficult to produce a comprehensive forecast. Based on this situation, the mixed existing model and mutual influence of multiple modes of transportation in the city are fully considered, and a multimodal deep learning model namely MC-GRU (Multimodal Convoluted Gated Recurrent Unit Network) is proposed. At the same time, to solve the problem of some objective factors, such as departure time and travel distance, we propose an attribute module to deal with these implicit factors. In addition, to explore the interaction between different modes of vehicles, a feature fusion module for obtaining the interaction effect between different modes of vehicles is proposed. Finally, we use GRU to learn the long-term dependence. MC-GRU can realize the accurate prediction of travel time in multimodal traffic state, as well as implement travel time prediction for three types of travel modes. The experimental results show that MC-GRU achieves higher prediction accuracy on a challenging real world dataset as compared with MAE, MAPE and RMSE.},

WiFi devices can be utilized to distinguish daily activities such as "walk", "run", and "sleep". These activities affect WiFi signal propagation and can be further used to recognize activities. This paper proposes a Deep Learning method for HAR tasks using channel state information (CSI). A new model is developed in which CSI data are converted to grayscale images. These images are then fed into a 2D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for activity classification. We take advantage of CNN's high accuracy on image classification along with WiFi-based ubiquity.

abstract={Although intelligent load forecasting is essential for optimal energy management (EM) in smart cities, there is a lack of current research exploring EM in well-regulated Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This article develops a new deep learning (DL) model for efficient forecasting of short-term energy consumption while maintaining effective communication between energy providers and users. The proposed Energy-Net stack comprises multiple stacked spatiotemporal modules, where each module consists of a temporal transformer (TT) submodule and a spatial transformer (ST) submodule. The TT models the temporal relationships in load data; and the ST submodule extracts hidden spatial information by integrating convolutional layers and includes an improved self-attention mechanism. The experimental evaluation on IHPEC and independent system operator New England (ISO-NE) data set demonstrates the superiority of Energy-Net over recent cutting-edge DL models with root mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.354 and 0.535, respectively. The computational complexity of Energy-Net is appropriate for dependable resource-constrained IoT devices (i.e., fog nodes or edge nodes) linked to a joint IoT-cloud server that interacts with connected smart grids to handle EM tasks.},

abstract={The ecological imbalance caused by environmental pollution has gradually become a thought-provoking topic. In addition, the development of global smart cities urgently requires the emergence of a powerful smart waste management system which can realize trash segregation. Therefore we focus on the this issue and proposed a novel method for trash classification based on deep learning strategy. In order to realize the efficiency of real-time outdoor trash detection by robot, we adopt a lightweight GhostNet as backbone of detection network. The network was trained in our self-made dataset which includes 4 kinds of object(namely : plastic bottle, glass bottle, metal can, carton). Moreover, for comparison and evaluation, we set up a comparative experiment. The experimental results show that the improved version of the YOLOv4 method proposed has improved detection performance compared to the original YOLOV4 algorithm, and has produced satisfactory Generalization performance in different types of trash.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) services have been implemented for several network applications from smart cities to rural areas. However, there are many barriers to provide an efficient solution for the IoT service deployment underlying innovation SDN/NFV-based technologies. First, though an IoT service can flexibly deploy via virtual network functions (VNFs), a deployment scheme needs to solve the joint routing and resource allocation problem, which becomes more difficult than the traditional centralized cloud/datacenter solution due to distributed resources in the edge-cloud network. In addition, due to uncertain workloads in IoT services, static optimization solutions may not deal with uncompleted knowledge of the entire input, which is often given by assumptions, but unrealistic in current provisioning approaches. Aiming to address these issues, we model an online mechanism for the dynamic IoT service chain deployment to optimize the operational cost in a finite horizon. We propose a JOint Routing and Placement problem for IoT service chain (JORP) that can dynamically scale in/out the number of VNF instances. We then propose a learning method to efficiently solve JORP based on branch-and-bound (BnB). Our proposed learning mechanism can intelligently imitate the branching/pruning actions of BnB, and remove unlikely solutions in the search space based on the deep neural network model to improve the performance. In that respect, we take an intensive simulation that illustrates the promising result of our proposed deep learning method compared to BnB and the greedy baseline in terms of the performance of the algorithm and the operational cost reduction.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is increasing its span in our daily life, intelligent homes, agriculture, industries and smart cities are few popular fields among application areas. Use of smart devices connected over the network can be seen in the mentioned fields. Vast data is collected through the connected devices using wireless sensors and then transmitted over the network to the edge and cloud for the computation. The increase in sensory devices lead to more data generation thereby there is also raise in wireless terminals as now more data is generated. This brings some challenges that need to be resolved, like processing delay leading to more time consumption, data bandwidth issues affecting data transfer rate and computation capability. It has been identified that massive work needs to be researched on communication medium to provide IoT services among the applications. Various frameworks like TelcoFog, Edge framework, CoSMOS, ROUTER, FogFlow, Deep Learning and IoTecture were studied and their results were analysed.

abstract={The advancement of deep learning has facilitated rapid progress in person re-identification (re-id) task. Its applications in intelligent video surveillance made it a key component of today's smart cities infrastructure. Person re-id task is aimed to identify the person in distributed camera setup with non-overlapping views. The feature extraction process is an important part of person re-id technique. The present state of art methods mostly used ResNet as a backbone for feature extraction, which results in low geometric transformation modeling and low-resolution representation learning. We addressed these two major challenges by integrating deformable convolution module to enhance the transformation modeling capability and replaced the traditional ResNet backbone for person re-id with the novel feature extraction network named as HRNet, which is based on high-resolution representation learning without any additional supervision. The verification of our approach performance is done by conducting an experiment on a person re-id dataset named Market-1501. We achieved 90.57% Rank-1 accuracy and 75.43% mAP, outperforming the ResNet baseline results, which confirmed the effectiveness of our approach and will have a promising future in person re-id.},

For effective energy management of smart buildings, the accurate prediction of the electrical consumption data is required. To increase the accuracy of prediction, the paper proposes deep learning methods for load profile prediction in a model-free environment. In this paper, a commercial smart building load profile is predicted using the re-current neural network (RNN), long short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. Using the best features of RNN and BiLSTM a hybrid model is developed for the load profile prediction. To compare the performance of different models error metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are considered for performance evaluation. The paper also highlights the significance of hyperparameters in improving the accuracy of prediction. Finally, from the results, it can be claimed that the hybrid model performs better as compared to RNN, LSTM, and GRU models.},

abstract={Cyber-attacks and threats are growing fast in the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure as applications in smart cities gain momentum. Usually, IoT devices communicate via machine-to-machine protocols such as Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Due to the heterogeneous structure in IoT and the absence of security by design methodologies, security mechanisms in environments with MQTT traffic are needed, and they can be deployed as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This paper proposes a Deep Learning (DL) based Network IDS trained using a public dataset containing MQTT attacks. We assess the proposal using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and weighted average. When evaluating the performance of our DL-based Network IDS, it obtained, in average, 97.09% of accuracy and an F1-score equal to 98.33% in the detection of MQTT attacks. Another important contribution of our work is the sharing of the experiments on GitHub, which guarantees the reproducibility of the research.},

abstract={As an industrial application of Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the most crucial techniques for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), which is a basic element of smart cities. The primary issue for the deployment of ITS based on IoV is the security for both users and infrastructures. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is important for IoV users to keep them away from various attacks via the malware and ensure the security of users and infrastructures. In this paper, we design a data-driven IDS by analyzing the link load behaviors of the Road Side Unit (RSU) in the IoV against various attacks leading to the irregular fluctuations of traffic flows. A deep learning architecture based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed to extract the features of link loads, and detect the intrusion aiming at RSUs. The proposed architecture is composed of a traditional CNN and a fundamental error term in view of the convergence of the backpropagation algorithm. Meanwhile, a theoretical analysis of the convergence is provided by the probabilistic representation for the proposed CNN-based deep architecture. We finally evaluate the accuracy of our method by way of implementing it over the testbed.},

abstract={With video surveillance through Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras becoming increasingly ubiquitous, maintaining the integrity of such videos assumes significance to guarantee compliance with privacy protection laws. Recently adopted European General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR) suggests encryption as a reversible safeguard for all type of data protection. Traditionally, data encryption methods deal with naïve encryption of the videos which is not advisable if the intention is to provide efficient privacy to some important parts/areas in the video. This has resulted in the research being directed towards Features-of-Interest (FOI) based privacy protection schemes, wherein only selected parts of a video frame are encrypted/obfuscated. This research utilizes a deep learning (DL) model to identify GDPR compliant privacy-preserved (encrypted) videos among different types of obfuscated videos. For evaluation, two types of video obfuscation methods viz. selective encryption and data removal are applied on the extracted background and foreground FOIs/parts of video frames. Then the applicability of a modified version of the highly-optimized MobileNetV2 model for identification of privacy-preserving features is presented. Results show that the lightweight DL model is suitable for deployment on low-resource hardware (such as Raspberry Pi's) in Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure in smart cities.},

With the development of edge computing, a new paradigm for smart data management is emerging. Raw video feeds can be pre-processed at the point of capture while integration and deeper analytics is performed in the cloud. In this paper we explore the capacity of video processing at the edge and shown that basic image processing can be achieved in near real-time on low-powered gateway devices. We have also investigated deep learning model capabilities for crowd counting in this context showing that its performance is highly dependent on the input size and rescaling video frames can optimise processing and performance. Increased edge processing resolves a number of issues in video analytics for crowd monitoring applications.},

abstract={With the advancement of communication technology and location acquisition technology in the context of modern smart cities, the sharing bike systems offer users the great autonomy and convenience for the last/first-kilometer trip. Meanwhile, we can now able to collect, store, and analyze a large amount of sharing bike data. How to effectively use these massive data to provide better services is an emerging task. However, due to the skewed and imbalanced bike usages for stations located at different places, it is of great significance yet very challenging to predict the potential destinations of each individual trip beforehand so that the service providers can better schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an attention-based deep learning framework for trip destination prediction (AFTER). AFTER first learns the low-dimension representations of users and sharing bike stations via negative sampling strategies. Then, a convolution neural network with an attention mechanism is utilized to predict the future trip destination. Experimental results on a real-world dataset indicate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall, and F1.},

The correlation between various traffic parameters such as traffic flow, speed and occupancy are considered for the prediction. We performed the experiment with Recurrent Neural Network based multivariate Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model.

abstract={The democratization of Internet of Things and ubiquitous computing equips citizens with phenomenal new ways for online participation and decision-making in application domains of smart grids and smart cities. When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing. The contribution of an I-EPOS open source software suite implemented as a paradigmatic artifact for community aspires to settle a knowledge exchange for the design of new algorithms and application scenarios of sharing economies towards highly participatory and sustainable digital societies.},

abstract={Body area networks, including smart sensors, are widely reshaping health applications in the new era of smart cities. To meet increasing security and privacy requirements, physiological signalbased biometric human identification is gaining tremendous attention. This paper focuses on two major impediments: the signal processing technique is usually both complicated and data-dependent and the feature engineering is time-consuming and can fit only specific datasets . To enable a data-independent and highly generalizable signal processing and feature learning process, a novel wavelet domain multiresolution convolutional neural network is proposed. Specifically, it allows for blindly selecting a physiological signal segment for identification purpose, avoiding the complicated signal fiducial characteristics extraction process. To enrich the data representation, the random chosen signal segment is then transformed to the wavelet domain, where multiresolution time-frequency representation is achieved. An auto-correlation operation is applied to the transformed data to remove the phase difference as the result of the blind segmentation operation. Afterward, a multiresolution 1-D-convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) is introduced to automatically learn the intrinsic hierarchical features from the wavelet domain raw data without datadependent and heavy feature engineering, and perform the user identification task. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is thoroughly evaluated on eight electrocardiogram datasets with diverse behaviors, such as with or without severe heart diseases, and with different sensor placement methods. Our evaluation is much more extensive than the state-of-the-art works, and an average identification rate of 93.5% is achieved. The proposed multiresolution 1-D-CNN algorithm can effectively identify human subjects, even from randomly selected signal segments and without heavy feature engineering. This paper is expected to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the blind signal processing and deep learning techniques to biometric human identification, to enable a low algorithm engineering effort and also a high generalization ability.},

Recently, social media users are increasingly using images and videos to express their feelings and share emotions. Sentiment analysis of such large-scale visual content, such as those in image tweets, helps to obtain user sentiments toward events or topics and therefore complement textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the need to leverage large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of face sentiment analysis, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We designed a suitable CNN architecture to classify facial emotions and analyze sentiments. We have conducted extensive experiments on labeled images.

abstract={The sudden climate change, that has taken place in recent years, has generated calamitous phenomena linked to hydrogeological instability in many areas of the world. An accurate estimate of rainfall levels is fundamental in smart city application scenarios: it becomes essential to be able to warn of the imminent occurrence of a calamitous event and reduce the risk to human beings. Unfortunately, to date, traditional techniques for rainfall level estimation present numerous critical issues. This paper proposes a new approach to rainfall classification based on the LTE radio channel parameters adopted for the cell selection mechanism. In particular, this study highlights the correlation between the set of radio channel quality monitoring parameters and the relative rainfall intensity levels. Through a pattern recognition approach based on neural networks with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), the proposed algorithm identifies five classes of rainfall levels with an average accuracy of 96 % and a F1 score of 93.6 %.},

abstract={In our daily life, the scenes around us are always with multiple labels especially in a smart city, i.e., recognizing the information of city operation to response and control. Great efforts have been made by using Deep Neural Networks to recognize multi-label images. Since multi-label image classification is very complicated, people seek to use the attention mechanism to guide the classification process. However, conventional attention-based methods always analyzed images directly and aggressively. It is difficult for them to well understand complicated scenes. In this paper, we propose a global/local attention method that can recognize an image from coarse to fine by mimicking how human-beings observe images. Specifically, our global/local attention method first concentrates on the whole image, and then focuses on local specific objects in the image. We also propose a joint max-margin objective function, which enforces that the minimum score of positive labels should be larger than the maximum score of negative labels horizontally and vertically. This function can further improve our multi-label image classification method. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on two popular multilabel image datasets (i.e., Pascal VOC and MS-COCO). Our experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Location Based Service (LBS) is one of the important aspects of a smart city. Accurate indoor localization plays a vital role in LBS. The ability to localize various subjects in the area of interest facilitates further ubiquitous environments. Specifically, device free localization using wireless signals is getting increased attention as human location is estimated using its impact on the surrounding wireless signals without any active device tagged with subject. In this paper, we propose MuDLoc, the first multi-view discriminant learning approach for device free indoor localization using both amplitude and phase features of Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple Access Points (APs). The same location oriented CSI data can be observed by different APs, thus generating multiple distinct even heterogeneous samples. Multi-view learning is an emerging technique in machine learning which improve performance by utilizing diversity from different view data. In MuDLoc, the localization is modeled as a pattern matching problem, where the target location is predicted based on similarity measure of CSI features of an unknown location with those of the training locations. MuDLoc implements Generalized Inter-view and Intra-view Discriminant Correlation Analysis (GI2DCA), a discriminative feature extraction approach that incorporates inter-view and intra-view class associations while maximizing pairwise correlations across multi-view data sets. Experimental results from two cluttered environments show that MuDLoc can estimate location with high accuracy which outperforms other benchmark approaches.},

abstract={Agricultural afforestation is an important way to mitigate climate change and improve the environmental quality of city system. The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity. This research highlights the application of machine learning at the high level of smart city management to improve the efficacy and intelligence of urban planning.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has been the driving force for many smart city applications. The huge volume of IoT data generated from these applications require efficient processing to get the insight, which poses significant difficulty. Data mining and machine learning (DM) algorithms are used to minimize such difficulty. However, it is still very challenging to select a particular DM algorithm that can process a dynamic IoT dataset based on some application-specific goals to achieve better accuracy. This paper proposes a knowledge-driven framework that considers the knowledge of datasets, available DM algorithms, and application goals to select the suitable DM algorithm for performing a target data processing task. This work considers data from cultural domain, health domain, and transportation domain in the experiment. The results show that the proposed approach dynamically selects the best-suited DM algorithms for the available datasets and target goals that exhibits satisfactory performance in obtaining accurate results compared to the existing work. The proposed approach not only provides flexibility in conducting dynamic IoT data mining tasks, but also reduces the complexity that would otherwise be necessary while adopting the traditional data mining approaches.},

abstract={With the spread of the number of smart devices in the context of Smart City, Software Defined Networking (SDN) is considered as a vital principle to manage a large-scale heterogeneous network within centralized controller. To deal with cyberattacks against such networks, intrusion detection system (IDS) is built to recognize and alert to the system administrator for further appropriate response. Currently, machine learning-based IDS (ML-IDS) has been explored and is still being developed. However, these systems give a high rate of false alert and are easily deceived by sophisticated attacks such as variants of attacks containing perturbation. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously evaluate and improve these systems by simulating mutation of real-world network attack. Relied on the Generative Discriminative Networks (GANs), we introduce DIGFuPAS, a framework that generates data flow of cyberattacks capable of bypassing ML-IDS. It can generate malicious data streams that mutate from real attack traffic making the IDS undetectable. The generated traffic flow is used to retrain ML-IDS, for improving the robustness of IDS in detecting sophisticated attacks. The experiments are performed and evaluated through 2 criteria: Detection rate (DR) and F1 Score (F1) on the public dataset, named CICIDS2017. DIGFuPAS can be used for continuously pentesting and evaluating IDS’s capability once integrated as an automated sustainability test pipeline for SDN-enabled networks.},

abstract={Dealing with air pollution presents a major environmental challenge in smart city environments. Real-time monitoring of pollution data enables local authorities to analyze the current traffic situation of the city and make decisions accordingly. Deployment of the Internet of Things-based sensors has considerably changed the dynamics of predicting air quality. Existing research has used different machine learning tools for pollution prediction; however, comparative analysis of these techniques is required to have a better understanding of their processing time for multiple datasets. In this paper, we have performed pollution prediction using four advanced regression techniques and present a comparative study to determine the best model for accurately predicting air quality with reference to data size and processing time. We have conducted experiments using Apache Spark and performed pollution estimation using multiple datasets. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) have been used as evaluation criteria for the comparison of these regression models. Furthermore, the processing time of each technique through standalone learning and through fitting the hyperparameter tuning on Apache Spark has also been calculated to find the best-fit model in terms of processing time and lowest error rate.},

abstract={In smart city framework, the water monitoring through an efficient, low-cost, low-power and IoT-oriented sensor technology is a crucial aspect to allow, with limited resources, the analysis of contaminants eventually affecting wastewater. In this sense, common interfering substances, as detergents, cannot be classified as dangerous contaminants and should be neglected in the classification. By adopting classical machine learning approaches having a finite set of possible responses, each alteration of the sensor baseline is always classified as one out of the predetermined substances. Consequently, we developed an anomaly detection system based on one-class classifiers, able to discriminate between a recognized set of substances and an interfering source. In this way, the proposed detection system is able to provide detailed information about the water status and distinguish between harmless detergents and dangerous contaminants.},
