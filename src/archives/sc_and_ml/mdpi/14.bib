ABSTRACT = {Citizen safety in modern urban environments is an important aspect of life quality. Implementation of a smart city approach to video surveillance depends heavily on the capability of gathering and processing huge amounts of live urban data. Analyzing data from high bandwidth surveillance video streams provided by large size distributed sensor networks is particularly challenging. We propose here an efficient method for automatic violent behavior detection designed for video sensor networks. Known solutions to real-time violence detection are not suitable for implementation in a resource-constrained environment due to the high processing power requirements. Our algorithm achieves real-time processing on a Raspberry PI-embedded architecture. To ensure separation of temporal and spatial information processing we employ a computationally effective cascaded approach. It consists of a deep neural network followed by a time domain classifier. In contrast with current approaches, the deep neural network input is fed exclusively with motion vector features extracted directly from the MPEG encoded video stream. As proven by results, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, while running on a low computational resources embedded architecture.},

ABSTRACT = {Networking is crucial for smart city projects nowadays, as it offers an environment where people and things are connected. This paper presents a chronology of factors on the development of smart cities, including IoT technologies as network infrastructure. Increasing IoT nodes leads to increasing data flow, which is a potential source of failure for IoT networks. The biggest challenge of IoT networks is that the IoT may have insufficient memory to handle all transaction data within the IoT network. We aim in this paper to propose a potential compression method for reducing IoT network data traffic. Therefore, we investigate various lossless compression algorithms, such as entropy or dictionary-based algorithms, and general compression methods to determine which algorithm or method adheres to the IoT specifications. Furthermore, this study conducts compression experiments using entropy (Huffman, Adaptive Huffman) and Dictionary (LZ77, LZ78) as well as five different types of datasets of the IoT data traffic. Though the above algorithms can alleviate the IoT data traffic, adaptive Huffman gave the best compression algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to propose a conceptual compression method for IoT data traffic by improving an adaptive Huffman based on deep learning concepts using weights, pruning, and pooling in the neural network. The proposed algorithm is believed to obtain a better compression ratio. Additionally, in this paper, we also discuss the challenges of applying the proposed algorithm to IoT data compression due to the limitations of IoT memory and IoT processor, which later it can be implemented in IoT networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Decision makers and policy analysts at different administrative levels often lack a holistic view of the problem as there are semantic variations in policy documents due to domain-specific content. For example, smart city initiatives are derived from national and international initiatives which may influence the incentives for local participants, but local initiatives reflect the local contextual elements of the city. Balanced assessment of smart city initiatives should include a systemic evaluation of the initiatives at multiple levels including the city, the country in which the city resides as well as at international level. In this paper, a knowledge elicitation methodology is presented for multi-granularity evaluation of policies and initiatives. The methodology is demonstrated on the evaluation of smart city initiatives generated at different administrative levels. Semantic networks are constructed using formal ontologies and deep learning methods for automatic semantic evaluation of initiatives to abstract knowledge found in text. Three smart city initiatives published by different administrative levels including international, national, and city level are evaluated in terms of relevance, coherence, and alignment of multi-level smart city initiatives. Experiments and analysis ultimately provide a holistic view of the problem which is necessary for decision makers and policy analysts of smart cities.},

ABSTRACT = {In the construction of new smart cities, traditional fire-detection systems can be replaced with vision-based systems to establish fire safety in society using emerging technologies, such as digital cameras, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. In this study, we developed a fire detector that accurately detects even small sparks and sounds an alarm within 8 s of a fire outbreak. A novel convolutional neural network was developed to detect fire regions using an enhanced You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4network. Based on the improved YOLOv4 algorithm, we adapted the network to operate on the Banana Pi M3 board using only three layers. Initially, we examined the originalYOLOv4 approach to determine the accuracy of predictions of candidate fire regions. However, the anticipated results were not observed after several experiments involving this approach to detect fire accidents. We improved the traditional YOLOv4 network by increasing the size of the training dataset based on data augmentation techniques for the real-time monitoring of fire disasters. By modifying the network structure through automatic color augmentation, reducing parameters, etc., the proposed method successfully detected and notified the incidence of disastrous fires with a high speed and accuracy in different weather environments&mdash;sunny or cloudy, day or night. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method can be used successfully for the protection of smart cities and in monitoring fires in urban areas. Finally, we compared the performance of our method with that of recently reported fire-detection approaches employing widely used performance matrices to test the fire classification results achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, object detection has gained significant interest and is considered a challenging problem in computer vision. Object detection is mainly employed for several applications, such as instance segmentation, object tracking, image captioning, healthcare, etc. Recent studies have reported that deep learning (DL) models can be employed for effective object detection compared to traditional methods. The rapid urbanization of smart cities necessitates the design of intelligent and automated waste management techniques for effective recycling of waste. In this view, this study develops a novel deep learning-based small object detection and classification model for garbage waste management (DLSODC-GWM) technique. The proposed DLSODC-GWM technique mainly focuses on detecting and classifying small garbage waste objects to assist intelligent waste management systems. The DLSODC-GWM technique follows two major processes, namely, object detection and classification. For object detection, an arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) with an improved RefineDet (IRD) model is applied, where the hyperparameters of the IRD model are optimally chosen by the AOA. Secondly, the functional link neural network (FLNN) technique was applied for the classification of waste objects into multiple classes. The design of IRD for waste classification and AOA-based hyperparameter tuning demonstrates the novelty of the work. The performance validation of the DLSODC-GWM technique is performed using benchmark datasets, and the experimental results show the promising performance of the DLSODC-GWM method on existing approaches with a maximum accuy of 98.61%.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous energy management is becoming a significant mechanism for attaining sustainability in energy management. This resulted in this research paper, which aimed to apply deep reinforcement learning algorithms for an autonomous energy management system of a microgrid. This paper proposed a novel microgrid model that consisted of a combustion set of a household load, renewable energy, an energy storage system, and a generator, which were connected to the main grid. The proposed autonomous energy management system was designed to cooperate with the various flexible sources and loads by defining the priority resources, loads, and electricity prices. The system was implemented by using deep reinforcement learning algorithms that worked effectively in order to control the power storage, solar panels, generator, and main grid. The system model could achieve the optimal performance with near-optimal policies. As a result, this method could save 13.19% in the cost compared to conducting manual control of energy management. In this study, there was a focus on applying Q-learning for the microgrid in the tourism industry in remote areas which can produce and store energy. Therefore, we proposed an autonomous energy management system for effective energy management. In future work, the system could be improved by applying deep learning to use energy price data to predict the future energy price, when the system could produce more energy than the demand and store it for selling at the most appropriate price; this would make the autonomous energy management system smarter and provide better benefits for the tourism industry. This proposed autonomous energy management could be applied to other industries, for example businesses or factories which need effective energy management to maintain microgrid stability and also save energy.},

ABSTRACT = {The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) is on a global scale and that wearing a face mask at work is the only effective way to avoid becoming infected with the virus. The pandemic made governments worldwide stay under lock-downs to prevent virus transmissions. Reports show that wearing face masks would reduce the risk of transmission. With the rise in population in cities, there is a greater need for efficient city management in today&rsquo;s world for reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease. For smart cities to prosper, significant improvements to occur in public transportation, roads, businesses, houses, city streets, and other facets of city life will have to be developed. The current public bus transportation system, such as it is, should be expanded with artificial intelligence. The autonomous mask detection and alert system are needed to find whether the person is wearing a face mask or not. This article presents a novel IoT-based face mask detection system in public transportation, especially buses. This system would collect real-time data via facial recognition. The main objective of the paper is to detect the presence of face masks in real-time video stream by utilizing deep learning, machine learning, and image processing techniques. To achieve this objective, a hybrid deep and machine learning model was designed and implemented. The model was evaluated using a new dataset in addition to public datasets. The results showed that the transformation of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classifier has better performance over the Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier; it has almost complete face-identification capabilities with respect to people&rsquo;s presence in the case where they are wearing masks, with an error rate of only 1.1%. Overall, compared with the standard models, AlexNet, Mobinet, and You Only Look Once (YOLO), the proposed model showed a better performance. Moreover, the experiments showed that the proposed model can detect faces and masks accurately with low inference time and memory, thus meeting the IoT limited resources.},
