ABSTRACT = {Intelligent infrastructure, including smart cities and intelligent buildings, must learn and adapt to the variable needs and requirements of users, owners and operators in order to be future proof and to provide a return on investment based on Operational Expenditure (OPEX) and Capital Expenditure (CAPEX). To address this challenge, this article presents a biological algorithm based on neural networks and deep reinforcement learning that enables infrastructure to be intelligent by making predictions about its different variables. In addition, the proposed method makes decisions based on real time data. Intelligent infrastructure must be able to proactively monitor, protect and repair itself: this includes independent components and assets working the same way any autonomous biological organisms would. Neurons of artificial neural networks are associated with a prediction or decision layer based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that takes into consideration all of its previous learning. The proposed method was validated against an intelligent infrastructure dataset with outstanding results: the intelligent infrastructure was able to learn, predict and adapt to its variables, and components could make relevant decisions autonomously, emulating a living biological organism in which data flow exhaustively.},

ABSTRACT = {Crowding in city public transportation systems is a primary issue that causes delay in the mobility of passengers. Moreover, scheduled and unscheduled events in a city lead to excess crowding situations at the metro or bus stations. The Internet of Things (IoT) devices could be used for data collection, which are related to crowding situations in a smart city. The fog computing data centers located in different zones of a smart city can process and analyze the collected data to assist the passengers how to commute smoothly with minimum waiting time in the crowded situation. In this paper, Q-learning based passengers assistance system is designed to assist the commuters in finding less crowded bus and metro stations to avoid long queues of waiting. The traffic congestion and crowded situation data are processed in the fog computing data centers. From our experimental results, it is found that our proposed method can achieve higher reward values, which can be used to minimize the passengers&rsquo; waiting time with minimum computational delay as compared to the cloud computing platform.},

ABSTRACT = {A paramount challenge of prohibiting increased CO2 emissions for network densification is to deliver the Fifth Generation (5G) cellular capacity and connectivity demands, while maintaining a greener, healthier and prosperous environment. Energy consumption is a demanding consideration in the 5G era to combat several challenges such as reactive mode of operation, high latency wake up times, incorrect user association with the cells, multiple cross-functional operation of Self-Organising Networks (SON), etc. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Mobility Management-Based Autonomous Energy-Aware Framework for analysing bus passengers ridership through statistical Machine Learning (ML) and proactive energy savings coupled with CO2 emissions in Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) architecture using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Furthermore, we compare and report various ML algorithms using bus passengers ridership obtained from London Overground (LO) dataset. Extensive spatiotemporal simulations show that our proposed framework can achieve up to 98.82% prediction accuracy and CO2 reduction gains of up to 31.83%.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban traffic congestion has a significant detrimental impact on the environment, public health and the economy, with at a high cost to society worldwide. Moreover, it is not possible to continually modify urban road infrastructure in order to mitigate increasing traffic demand. Therefore, it is important to develop traffic control models that can handle high-volume traffic data and synchronize traffic lights in an urban network in real time, without interfering with other initiatives. Within this context, this study proposes a model, based on deep reinforcement learning, for synchronizing the traffic signals of an urban traffic network composed of two intersections. The calibration of this model, including training of its neural network, was performed using real traffic data collected at the approach to each intersection. The results achieved through simulations were very promising, yielding significant improvements in indicators measured in relation to the pre-existing conditions in the network. The model was able to deal with a broad spectrum of traffic flows and, in peak demand periods, reduced delays and queue lengths by more than 28% and 42%, respectively.},
