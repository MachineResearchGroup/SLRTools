ABSTRACT = {The unprecedented urban growth of recent years requires improved urban planning and management to make urban spaces more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Additionally, humanity faces the COVID pandemic, which especially complicates the management of Smart Cities. A possible solution to address these two problems (environmental and health) in Smart Cities may be the use of Machine Learning techniques. One of the objectives of our work is to thoroughly analyze the link between the concepts of Smart Cities, Machine Learning techniques and their applicability. In this work, an exhaustive study of the relationship between Smart Cities and the applicability of Machine Learning (ML) techniques is carried out with the aim of optimizing sustainability. For this, the ML models, analyzed from the point of view of the models, techniques and applications, are studied. The areas and dimensions of sustainability addressed are analyzed, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are discussed. The main objective is to propose a model (EARLY) that allows us to tackle these problems in the future. An inclusive perspective on applicability, sustainability scopes and dimensions, SDGs, tools, data types and Machine Learning techniques is provided. Finally, a case study applied to an Andalusian city is presented.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the widespread deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications has contributed to the development of smart cities. A smart city utilizes IoT-enabled technologies, communications and applications to maximize operational efficiency and enhance both the service providers&rsquo; quality of services and people&rsquo;s wellbeing and quality of life. With the growth of smart city networks, however, comes the increased risk of cybersecurity threats and attacks. IoT devices within a smart city network are connected to sensors linked to large cloud servers and are exposed to malicious attacks and threats. Thus, it is important to devise approaches to prevent such attacks and protect IoT devices from failure. In this paper, we explore an attack and anomaly detection technique based on machine learning algorithms (LR, SVM, DT, RF, ANN and KNN) to defend against and mitigate IoT cybersecurity threats in a smart city. Contrary to existing works that have focused on single classifiers, we also explore ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting and stacking to enhance the performance of the detection system. Additionally, we consider an integration of feature selection, cross-validation and multi-class classification for the discussed domain, which has not been well considered in the existing literature. Experimental results with the recent attack dataset demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively identify cyberattacks and the stacking ensemble model outperforms comparable models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score, implying the promise of stacking in this domain.},

ABSTRACT = {Daily traffic accidents increase annually, causing a significant number of death and disability cases. Most of fatalities occur because of the late response to these emergency cases. The time after the traumatic injury is called the golden hour, where providing essential medical and surgical aid at that time increases the probability of saving human lives by one-third an average. Thus, the focus of this paper was to develop a system based on IoT for accident detection and classification. The system detects and classifies vehicle accidents based on severity level and reports the essential information about the accident to emergency services providers. The system consists of a microcontroller, GPS, and a group of sensors to determine different physical parameters related to vehicle motion. In addition, different types of machine learning classifiers were examined with the developed system to determine the most accurate classifier for the system. The classifiers are the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Naive-Bayes Tree (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). The implementation of the system showed that GMM and CART models were better in terms of precision and recall. It was also shown that the severity of accidents depends mainly on the g-force value and fire occurrence.},

ABSTRACT = {The concept of a smart city requires the integration of information and communication technologies and devices over a network for the better provision of services to citizens. As a result, the quality of living is improved by continuous analyses of data to improve service delivery by governments and other organizations. Due to the presence of extensive devices and data flow over networks, the probability of cyber attacks and intrusion detection has increased. The monitoring of this huge amount of data traffic is very difficult, though machine learning algorithms have huge potential to support this task. In this study, we compared different machine learning models used for cyber threat classification. Our comparison was focused on the analyzed cyber threats, algorithms, and performance of these models. We have identified that real-time classification, accuracy, and false-positive rates are still the major issues in the performance of existing models. Accordingly, we have proposed a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to improve threat classification performance. Our model was based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and quasi-recurrent neural network (QRNN). The use of QRNN not only resulted in improved accuracy but also enabled real-time classification. The model was tested on BoT-IoT and TON_IoT datasets, and the results showed that the proposed model outperformed the other models. Due to this improved performance, we emphasize that the application of this model in the real-time environment of a smart system network will help in reducing threats in a reasonable time.},

ABSTRACT = {Food waste is an important social and environmental issue that the current society faces, where one third of the total food produced is wasted or lost every year while more than 820 million people around the world do not have access to adequate food. However, as we move towards a decentralized Web 3.0 enabled smart city, we can utilize cutting edge technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and many more to reduce food waste in different phases of the supply chain. In this paper, we propose SmartNoshWaste&mdash;a blockchain based multi-layered framework utilizing cloud computing, QR code and reinforcement learning to reduce food waste. We also evaluate SmartNoshWaste on real world food data collected from the nosh app to show the efficacy of the proposed framework and we are able to reduce food waste by 9.46% in comparison to the originally collected food data based on the experimental evaluation.},
