ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an intelligent surveillance platform based on the usage of large numbers of inexpensive sensors designed and developed inside the European Eureka Celtic project HuSIMS. With the aim of maximizing the number of deployable units while keeping monetary and resource/bandwidth costs at a minimum, the surveillance platform is based on the usage of inexpensive visual sensors which apply efficient motion detection and tracking algorithms to transform the video signal in a set of motion parameters. In order to automate the analysis of the myriad of data streams generated by the visual sensors, the platform’s control center includes an alarm detection engine which comprises three components applying three different Artificial Intelligence strategies in parallel. These strategies are generic, domain-independent approaches which are able to operate in several domains (traffic surveillance, vandalism prevention, perimeter security, etc.). The architecture is completed with a versatile communication network which facilitates data collection from the visual sensors and alarm and video stream distribution towards the emergency teams. The resulting surveillance system is extremely suitable for its deployment in metropolitan areas, smart cities, and large facilities, mainly because cheap visual sensors and autonomous alarm detection facilitate dense sensor network deployments for wide and detailed coverage.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart city (SC) technologies can provide appropriate services according to citizens&rsquo; demands. One of the key enablers in a SC is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which enables a massive number of devices to connect with each other. However, these devices usually come from different manufacturers with different product standards, which confront interactive control problems. Moreover, these devices will produce large amounts of data, and efficiently analyzing these data for intelligent services. In this paper, we propose a novel artificial intelligence-based semantic IoT (AI-SIoT) hybrid service architecture to integrate heterogeneous IoT devices to support intelligent services. In particular, the proposed architecture is empowered by semantic and AI technologies, which enable flexible connections among heterogeneous devices. The AI technology can support very implement efficient data analysis and make accurate decisions on service provisions in various kinds. Furthermore, we also present several practical use cases of the proposed AI-SIoT architecture and the opportunities and challenges to implement the proposed AI-SIoT for future SCs are also discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban mobility optimization problem has a great focus in the context of Smart cities. To its solution a very important factor is the transport demand, which is mostly inferred using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence techniques from Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and mobile devices data. In this paper a novel approach, based on Transport Demand Management techniques is proposed, using technology to produce a more active social involvement in the planning and optimization of mobility. This paper describes, a first step to this long-term objective, the general architecture and current implementation of an explicit multi-modal transport demand system for Smart Cities, which is being developed in the frame of MUSA—I project in the city of Madrid.},

ABSTRACT = {Energy sustainability is one of the key questions that drive the debate on cities&rsquo; and urban areas development. In parallel, artificial intelligence and cognitive computing have emerged as catalysts in the process aimed at designing and optimizing smart services&rsquo; supply and utilization in urban space. The latter are paramount in the domain of energy provision and consumption. This paper offers an insight into pilot systems and prototypes that showcase in which ways artificial intelligence can offer critical support in the process of attaining energy sustainability in smart cities. To this end, this paper examines smart metering and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) to make a case for the latter&rsquo;s value added in context of profiling electric appliances&rsquo; electricity consumption. By employing the findings in context of smart cities research, the paper then adds to the debate on energy sustainability in urban space. Existing research tends to be limited by data granularity (not in high frequency) and consideration of about six kinds of appliances. In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm support vector machine multiple kernel learning approach (GA-SVM-MKL) is proposed for NILM, with consideration of 20 kinds of appliance. Genetic algorithm helps to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and design the optimal kernel function based on various kernel properties. The performance indicators are sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and overall accuracy (OA) of the classifier. First, the performance evaluation of proposed GA-SVM-MKL achieves Se of 92.1%, Sp of 91.5% and OA of 91.8%. Second, the percentage improvement of performance indicators using proposed method is more than 21% compared with traditional kernel. Third, results reveal that by keeping different modes of electric appliance as identical class label, the performance indicators can increase to about 15%. Forth, tunable modes of GA-SVM-MKL classifier are proposed to further enhance the performance indicators up to 7%. Overall, this paper is a bold and novel contribution to the debate on energy utilization and sustainability in urban spaces as it integrates insights from artificial intelligence, IoT, and big data analytics and queries them in a context defined by energy sustainability in smart cities.},

ABSTRACT = {Digitalization has enabled infrastructure and cities to be “smarter”; the use of physical space and energy, the transmission of information, the management of users, assets and processes, the operation of businesses and companies have been progressively digitalized. The main challenges of a Smart City is its definition, scope and interconnections; there are different approaches to Smart City implementations that vary from collaborative multidisciplinary environments, the addition of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) within its physical fabric to the use of Big Data for higher abstraction decisions. This paper presents the concept of Digital as a Service (DaaS), where any complete digitalization can be implemented independently of its associated physical infrastructure in a Cloud environment; DasS would enable an interoperable Virtual Digital Infrastructure (VDI). In addition, this paper reviews the current Digital Systems, Transmission Networks, Servers and Management Systems. The next Industrial Revolution will be founded on Artificial Intelligence that will entirely replace humans by taking production and management decisions based on the Internet of Things (IoT), the Cloud, BlockChain, Big Data, Virtual Reality and the combination of digital and real infrastructure or city. Digital as a Service would be its enabler by providing the entire interconnection, integration and virtualization of its Space, Services and Structure (3S).},

ABSTRACT = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) have emerged rapidly across the globe as a powerful eco-friendly initiative that if integrated well with an urban environment could be iconic for the host city&rsquo;s commitment to sustainable mobility and be a key ingredient of the smart city concept. This paper examines ways that will help us to develop a better understanding of how EVs can achieve energy use optimization and be connected with a smart city. As a whole, the present study is based on an original idea that would be useful in informing policy-makers, automotive manufacturers and transport operators of how to improve and embrace better EV technologies in the context of smart cities. The proposed approach is based on vehicles&rsquo; and buildings&rsquo; communication to share some special information related to the vehicles&rsquo; status and to the road conditions. EVs can share their own information related to their energy consumption experience on a specific path. This information can be gathered in a gigantic database and used for managing the power inside these vehicles. In this field, this paper exposes a new approach to power management inside an electric vehicle based on two-way communication between vehicles and buildings. The principle of this method is established in two sections; the first one is related to vehicles&rsquo; classification and the second one is attached to the buildings&rsquo; recommendations, according to the car position. The classification problem is resolved using the support vector classification method. The recommendation phase is resolved using the artificial intelligence principle and a neural network was employed to give the best decision. The optimal decision will be calculated inside the building, according to its position and using the old vehicle&rsquo;s data, and transferred to the coming vehicle, for optimizing its energy consumption method in the corresponding building zone. Different possibilities and situations in this approach were discussed. The proposed power management methodology was tested and validated using Simulink/Matlab tool. Results related to the battery state of charge and to the consumed energy were compared at the end of this work, to show the efficiency of this approach.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and its subarea of deep learning have drawn the attention of many researchers. At the same time, advances in technologies enable the generation or collection of large amounts of valuable data (e.g., sensor data) from various sources in different applications, such as those for the Internet of Things (IoT), which in turn aims towards the development of smart cities. With the availability of sensor data from various sources, sensor information fusion is in demand for effective integration of big data. In this article, we present an AI-based sensor-information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of transportation data generated and collected from various types of sensors, including remote sensed imagery for the geographic information system (GIS), accelerometers, as well as sensors for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and global positioning system (GPS). The discovered knowledge and information returned from our system provides analysts with a clearer understanding of trajectories or mobility of citizens, which in turn helps to develop better transportation models to achieve the ultimate goal of smarter cities. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and practicality of our AI-based sensor information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of big transportation data.},

ABSTRACT = {Through the Internet of things (IoT), as promoted by smart cities, there is an emergence of big data accentuating the use of artificial intelligence through various components of urban planning, management, and design. One such system is that of artificial neural networks (ANNs), a component of machine learning that boasts similitude with brain neurological networks and its functioning. However, the development of ANN was done in singular fashion, whereby processes are rendered in sequence in a unidimensional perspective, contrasting with the functions of the brain to which ANN boasts similitude, and in particular to the concept of neuroplasticity which encourages unique complex interactions in self-learning fashion, thereby encouraging more inclusive urban processes and render urban coherence. This paper takes inspiration from Christopher Alexander&rsquo;s Nature of Order and dwells in the concept of complexity theory; it also proposes a theoretical model of how ANN can be rendered with the same plastic properties as brain neurological networks with multidimensional interactivity in the context of smart cities through the use of big data and its emerging complex networks. By doing so, this model caters to the creation of stronger, richer, and more complex patterns that support Alexander&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; through the connection of overlapping networks. This paper is aimed toward engineers with interdisciplinary interest looking at creating more complex and intricate ANN models, and toward urban planners and urban theorists working on the emerging contemporary concept of smart cities.},

ABSTRACT = {A fire detection system requires accurate and fast mechanisms to make the right decision in a fire situation. Since most commercial fire detection systems use a simple sensor, their fire recognition accuracy is deficient because of the limitations of the detection capability of the sensor. Existing proposals, which use rule-based algorithms or image-based machine learning can hardly adapt to the changes in the environment because of their static features. Since the legacy fire detection systems and network services do not guarantee data transfer latency, the required need for promptness is unmet. In this paper, we propose a new fire detection system with a multifunctional artificial intelligence framework and a data transfer delay minimization mechanism for the safety of smart cities. The framework includes a set of multiple machine learning algorithms and an adaptive fuzzy algorithm. In addition, Direct-MQTT based on SDN is introduced to solve the traffic concentration problems of the traditional MQTT. We verify the performance of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and delay time and found a fire detection accuracy of over 95%. The end-to-end delay, which comprises the transfer and decision delays, is reduced by an average of 72%.},

ABSTRACT = {Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Complex Information Systems and infrastructures, like Smart Cities, must be efficiently operated, minimizing inefficiencies and maximizing productivity. Traditional approaches are focused on improving the systems, automating processes and services, leaving aside human and emotions considerations. To achieve this efficient operation, we attempted to cover both sides. We found new ways to capture the information coming from the workforce, in our case, the operations management team, and, merged this information with the data from the IoT sensors from the systems, enabling a holistic view of the entire operations occurring in real-time. In a Data Center environment, we have developed a set of tools for capturing the emotional data in order to detect potential biases caused by the specific mood of the person inside the operations team. We used Artificial Intelligence algorithms for finding the patterns that will help us to manage the system in the future. We compared and verified our findings with the existing references from other disciplines, e.g., Psychology. In this article, we expose some methods to be developed in future studies for supervising and increasing productivity in Data Centers, as a useful example for Smart Cities. Our research focuses on monitoring the mood and the emotional status of the personnel responsible for operating the system. We use this emotional data as an input for measurement.},

ABSTRACT = {The application of smart city technologies requires new data analysis methods to interpret the voluminous data collected. In this study, we first analyzed the transfer behavior of subway pedestrians using the fingerprinting technique using data collected by more than 100 MAC (Media Access Control) ID sensors installed in a congested subway station serving two subway lines. We then developed a model that employs an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based methodology, the cumulative visibility of moving objects (CVMO), to present the data in such a manner that it could be used to address pedestrian flow issues in this real-world implementation of smart city technology. The MAC ID location data collected during a three-month monitoring period were mapped using the fingerprinting wireless location sensing method to display the congestion situation in real time. Furthermore we developed a model that can inform immediate response to identified conditions. In addition, we formulated several schemes for disbursing congestion and improving pedestrian flow using behavioral economics, and then confirmed their effectiveness in a follow-up monitoring period. The proposed pedestrian flow analysis method cannot only solve pedestrian congestion, but can also help to prevent accidents and maintain public order.},

ABSTRACT = {As urbanization continues to accelerate, the number of cities and their growing populations have created problems, such as the congestion and noise related to transportation, the pollution from industry, and the difficulty of disposing of garbage. An emerging urban strategy is to make use of digital technologies and big data to help improve the quality of life of urban residents. In the past decade, more and more researchers have studied smart cities, and the number of literature in this field grows rapidly, making it &ldquo;big data&rdquo;. With the aim of better understanding the contexts of smart-city research, including the distribution of topics, knowledge bases, and the research frontiers in the field, this paper is based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection, and the method used is that of comprehensive scientometric analysis and knowledge mapping in terms of diversity, time slicing, and dynamics, using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to study the literature in the field.

ABSTRACT = {The exponential growth of cities has brought important challenges such as waste management, pollution and overpopulation, and the administration of transportation. To mitigate these problems, the idea of the smart city was born, seeking to provide robust solutions integrating sensors and electronics, information technologies, and communication networks. More particularly, to face transportation challenges, intelligent transportation systems are a vital component in this quest, helped by vehicular communication networks, which offer a communication framework for vehicles, road infrastructure, and pedestrians. The extreme conditions of vehicular environments, nonetheless, make communication between nodes that may be moving at very high speeds very difficult to achieve, so non-deterministic approaches are necessary to maximize the chances of packet delivery. In this paper, we address this problem using artificial intelligence from a hybrid perspective, focusing on both the best next message to replicate and the best next hop in its path. Furthermore, we propose a deep learning&ndash;based router (DLR+), a router with a prioritized type of message scheduler and a routing algorithm based on deep learning. Simulations done to assess the router performance show important gains in terms of network overhead and hop count, while maintaining an acceptable packet delivery ratio and delivery delays, with respect to other popular routing protocols in vehicular networks.},

ABSTRACT = {The application of artificial intelligence enhances the ability of sensor and networking technologies to realize smart systems that sense, monitor and automatically control our everyday environments. Intelligent systems and applications often automate decisions based on the outcome of certain machine learning models. They collaborate at an ever increasing scale, ranging from smart homes and smart factories to smart cities. The best performing machine learning model, its architecture and parameters for a given task are ideally automatically determined through a hyperparameter tuning process. At the same time, edge computing is an emerging distributed computing paradigm that aims to bring computation and data storage closer to the location where they are needed to save network bandwidth or reduce the latency of requests. The challenge we address in this work is that hyperparameter tuning does not take into consideration resource trade-offs when selecting the best model for deployment in smart environments. The most accurate model might be prohibitively expensive to computationally evaluate on a resource constrained node at the edge of the network. We propose a multi-objective optimization solution to find acceptable trade-offs between model accuracy and resource consumption to enable the deployment of machine learning models in resource constrained smart environments. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by means of an anomaly detection use case. Additionally, we evaluate the extent that transfer learning techniques can be applied to reduce the amount of training required by reusing previous models, parameters and trade-off points from similar settings.},

ABSTRACT = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful concept still in its infancy that has the potential, if utilised responsibly, to provide a vehicle for positive change that could promote sustainable transitions to a more resource-efficient livability paradigm. AI with its deep learning functions and capabilities can be employed as a tool which empowers machines to solve problems that could reform urban landscapes as we have known them for decades now and help with establishing a new era; the era of the &ldquo;smart city&rdquo;. One of the key areas that AI can redefine is transport. Mobility provision and its impact on urban development can be significantly improved by the employment of intelligent transport systems in general and automated transport in particular. This new breed of AI-based mobility, despite its machine-orientation, has to be a user-centred technology that &ldquo;understands&rdquo; and &ldquo;satisfies&rdquo; the human user, the markets and the society as a whole. Trust should be built, and risks should be eliminated, for this transition to take off. This paper provides a novel conceptual contribution that thoroughly discusses the scarcely studied nexus of AI, transportation and the smart city and how this will affect urban futures. It specifically covers key smart mobility initiatives referring to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), autonomous Personal and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (PAVs and UAVs) and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), but also interventions that may work as enabling technologies for transport, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Physical Internet (PI) or reflect broader transformations like Industry 4.0. This work is ultimately a reference tool for researchers and city planners that provides clear and systematic definitions of the ambiguous smart mobility terms of tomorrow and describes their individual and collective roles underpinning the nexus in scope.},

ABSTRACT = {Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enabled optimisation of train&rsquo;s passenger traffic flows is a key consideration of transportation under Smart City planning (SCP). Traditional mobility prediction based optimisation and encryption approaches are reactive in nature; however, Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven proactive solutions are required for near real-time optimisation. Leveraging the historical passenger data recorded via Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors installed at the train stations, mobility prediction models can be developed to support and improve the railway operational performance vis-a-vis 5G and beyond. In this paper we have analysed the passenger traffic flows based on an Access, Egress and Interchange (AEI) framework to support train infrastructure against congestion, accidents, overloading carriages and maintenance. This paper predominantly focuses on developing passenger flow predictions using Machine Learning (ML) along with a novel encryption model that is capable of handling the heavy passenger traffic flow in real-time. We have compared and reported the performance of various ML driven flow prediction models using real-world passenger flow data obtained from London Underground and Overground (LUO). Extensive spatio-temporal simulations leveraging realistic mobility prediction models show that an AEI framework can achieve 91.17% prediction accuracy along with secure and light-weight encryption capabilities. Security parameters such as correlation coefficient (&lt;0.01), entropy (&gt;7.70), number of pixel change rate (&gt;99%), unified average change intensity (&gt;33), contrast (&gt;10), homogeneity (&lt;0.3) and energy (&lt;0.01) prove the efficacy of the proposed encryption scheme.},

ABSTRACT = {The transport sector accounts for a large share of global Co2 emissions. To mitigate the impact of climate change, several sustainability-oriented large-scale infrastructure projects such as electric road systems and expanding rail systems have recently been on the policy agenda. A parallel development that is expected to accelerate the transition of the transport sector is digitalization, which, although ongoing for many decades, has recently been augmented by concepts such as artificial intelligence (AI) and smart city technologies. The integration of these digitalization tools at the organizational level poses not only opportunities but also some challenges for the actors involved in infrastructure projects. An approach that is currently promoted in the infrastructure sector is the Building Information Model (BIM), which is a decision-making instrument that leverages various digitalization tools and applications. However, although the economic implications of BIM are widely discussed in the literature, the (inter-) organizational dynamics involving multiple actors in infrastructure projects are not fully grasped. Large infrastructure projects are sociotechnical endeavors embedded in complex institutional frames; hence the institutional norms, practices and logics in them are significant. Responding to this, this paper adopted an institutional analysis and put the BIM approach in the (inter-) organizational context in infrastructure delivery. Drawing on empirical data from three organizations in infrastructure delivery in Spain, this paper analyzed the tensions among actors during BIM adoption and implementation.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents advanced computational solutions for selected sectors in the context of the optimization of technology processes as an innovation and progress in improving energy efficiency of smart cities. The main emphasis was placed on the sectors of critical urban infrastructure, including in particular the use of algorithmic models based on artificial intelligence implemented in supervisory control systems (SCADA-type, including Virtual SCADA) of technological processes involving the sewage treatment systems (including in particular wastewater treatment systems) and waste management systems. The novelty of the presented solution involves the use of predictive diagnostic tools, based on multi-threaded polymorphic models supporting decision making processes during the control of a complex technological process and objects of distributed network systems (smart water grid, smart sewage system, smart waste management system) and solving problems of optimal control for smart dynamic objects with logical representation of knowledge about the process, the control object and the control itself, for which the learning process consists of successive validation and updating of knowledge and the use of the results of this updating to make control decisions. The advantage of the proposed solution in relation to the existing ones lies in the use of advanced models of predictive diagnostics, validation and reconstruction of data, implemented in functional tools, allowing the stabilization of the work of technological objects through the use of FTC technology (fault tolerant control) and soft sensors, predictive measurement path diagnostics (sensors, transducers), validation and reconstruction of measurement data from sensors in the measuring paths in real time. The dedicated tools (Intelligent Real Time Diagnostic System &minus; iRTDS) built into the system of a hierarchical, multi-threaded control optimizing system of SCADA system allow to obtain advanced diagnostics of technological processes in real time using HPC technology. In effect of the application of the proprietary iRTDS tool, we obtain a significant rise of energy efficiency of technological processes in key sectors of the economy, which in global terms, e.g., urban agglomeration, increases the economic efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {Cybersecurity issues constitute a key concern of today&rsquo;s technology-based economies. Cybersecurity has become a core need for providing a sustainable and safe society to online users in cyberspace. Considering the rapid increase of technological implementations, it has turned into a global necessity in the attempt to adapt security countermeasures, whether direct or indirect, and prevent systems from cyberthreats. Identifying, characterizing, and classifying such threats and their sources is required for a sustainable cyber-ecosystem. This paper focuses on the cybersecurity of smart grids and the emerging trends such as using blockchain in the Internet of Things (IoT). The cybersecurity of emerging technologies such as smart cities is also discussed. In addition, associated solutions based on artificial intelligence and machine learning frameworks to prevent cyber-risks are also discussed. Our review will serve as a reference for policy-makers from the industry, government, and the cybersecurity research community.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart city strategies developed by cities around the world provide a useful resource for insights into the future of smart development. This study examines such strategies to identify plans for the explicit deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. A total of 12 case studies emerged from an online keyword search representing cities of various sizes globally. The search was based on the keywords of &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; (or &ldquo;AI&rdquo;), and &ldquo;robot,&rdquo; representing robotics and associated terminology. Based on the findings, it is evident that the more concentrated deployment of AI and robotics in smart city development is currently in the Global North, although countries in the Global South are also increasingly represented. Multiple cities in Australia and Canada actively seek to develop AI and robotics, and Moscow has one of the most in-depth elaborations for this deployment. The ramifications of these plans are discussed as part of cyber&ndash;physical systems alongside consideration given to the social and ethical implications.},

ABSTRACT = {Improving road safety through artificial intelligence-based systems is now crucial turning smart cities into a reality. Under this highly relevant and extensive heading, an approach is proposed to improve vehicle detection in smart crosswalks using machine learning models. Contrarily to classic fuzzy classifiers, machine learning models do not require the readjustment of labels that depend on the location of the system and the road conditions. Several machine learning models were trained and tested using real traffic data taken from urban scenarios in both Portugal and Spain. These include random forest, time-series forecasting, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine, and logistic regression models. A deep reinforcement learning agent, based on a state-of-the-art double-deep recurrent Q-network, is also designed and compared with the machine learning models just mentioned. Results show that the machine learning models can efficiently replace the classic fuzzy classifier.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies used in developing smart cities solutions, Machine Learning (ML) and recently Deep Learning (DL), rely more on utilising best representative training datasets and features engineering and less on the available domain expertise. We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of &lsquo;explainable deep learning&rsquo; as a subset of the &lsquo;explainable AI&rsquo; problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project. Monitoring of gullies and drainage in crucial geographical areas susceptible to flooding issues is an important aspect of any flood monitoring solution. Typical solutions for this problem involve the use of cameras to capture images showing the affected areas in real-time with different objects such as leaves, plastic bottles etc., and building a DL-based classifier to detect such objects and classify blockages based on the presence and coverage of these objects in the images. In this work, we uniquely propose an Explainable AI solution using DL and Semantic Web technologies to build a hybrid classifier. In this hybrid classifier, the DL component detects object presence and coverage level and semantic rules designed with close consultation with experts carry out the classification. By using the expert knowledge in the flooding context, our hybrid classifier provides the flexibility on categorising the image using objects and their coverage relationships. The experimental results demonstrated with a real-world use case showed that this hybrid approach of image classification has on average 11% improvement (F-Measure) in image classification performance compared to DL-only classifier. It also has the distinct advantage of integrating experts&rsquo; knowledge on defining the decision-making rules to represent the complex circumstances and using such knowledge to explain the results.},

ABSTRACT = {Visual question answering (VQA) is a multi-modal task involving natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), which requires models to understand of both visual information and textual information simultaneously to predict the correct answer for the input visual image and textual question, and has been widely used in smart and intelligent transport systems, smart city, and other fields. Today, advanced VQA approaches model dense interactions between image regions and question words by designing co-attention mechanisms to achieve better accuracy. However, modeling interactions between each image region and each question word will force the model to calculate irrelevant information, thus causing the model&rsquo;s attention to be distracted. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a novel model called Multi-modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks (MESAN), which concentrates the model&rsquo;s attention by explicitly selecting the parts of the input features that are the most relevant to answering the input question. We consider that this method based on top-k selection can reduce the interference caused by irrelevant information and ultimately help the model to achieve better performance. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset VQA v2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our best single model delivers 70.71% and 71.08% overall accuracy on the test-dev and test-std sets, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can obtain better attended features than other advanced models through attention visualization. Our work proves that the models with sparse attention mechanisms can also achieve competitive results on VQA datasets. We hope that it can promote the development of VQA models and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology related to VQA in various aspects.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an efficient cyberphysical platform for the smart management of smart territories. It is efficient because it facilitates the implementation of data acquisition and data management methods, as well as data representation and dashboard configuration. The platform allows for the use of any type of data source, ranging from the measurements of a multi-functional IoT sensing devices to relational and non-relational databases. It is also smart because it incorporates a complete artificial intelligence suit for data analysis; it includes techniques for data classification, clustering, forecasting, optimization, visualization, etc. It is also compatible with the edge computing concept, allowing for the distribution of intelligence and the use of intelligent sensors. The concept of smart cities is evolving and adapting to new applications; the trend to create intelligent neighbourhoods, districts or territories is becoming increasingly popular, as opposed to the previous approach of managing an entire megacity. In this paper, the platform is presented, and its architecture and functionalities are described. Moreover, its operation has been validated in a case study where the bike renting service of Paris&mdash;V&eacute;lib&rsquo; M&eacute;tropole has been managed. This platform could enable smart territories to develop adapted knowledge management systems, adapt them to new requirements and to use multiple types of data, and execute efficient computational and artificial intelligence algorithms. The platform optimizes the decisions taken by human experts through explainable artificial intelligence models that obtain data from IoT sensors, databases, the Internet, etc. The global intelligence of the platform could potentially coordinate its decision-making processes with intelligent nodes installed in the edge, which would use the most advanced data processing techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and fifth-generation mobile network technologies, automatic instrument reading has become an increasingly important topic for intelligent sensors in smart cities. We propose a full pipeline to automatically read watermeters based on a single image, using deep learning methods to provide new technical support for an intelligent water meter reading. To handle the various challenging environments where watermeters reside, our pipeline disentangled the task into individual subtasks based on the structures of typical watermeters. These subtasks include component localization, orientation alignment, spatial layout guidance reading, and regression-based pointer reading. The devised algorithms for orientation alignment and spatial layout guidance are tailored to improve the robustness of our neural network. We also collect images of watermeters in real scenes and build a dataset for training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method even under challenging environments with varying lighting, occlusions, and different orientations. Thanks to the lightweight algorithms adopted in our pipeline, the system can be easily deployed and fully automated.},

ABSTRACT = {Improving road safety through artificial intelligence is now crucial to achieving more secure smart cities. With this objective, a mobile app based on the integration of the smartphone sensors and a fuzzy logic strategy to determine the pedestrian&rsquo;s crossing intention around crosswalks is presented. The app developed also allows the calculation, tracing and guidance of safe routes thanks to an optimization algorithm that includes pedestrian areas on the paths generated over the whole city through a cloud database (i.e., zebra crossings, pedestrian streets and walkways). The experimentation carried out consisted in testing the fuzzy logic strategy with a total of 31 volunteers crossing and walking around a crosswalk. For that, the fuzzy logic approach was subjected to a total of 3120 samples generated by the volunteers. It has been proven that a smartphone can be successfully used as a crossing intention detector system with an accuracy of 98.63%, obtaining a true positive rate of 98.27% and a specificity of 99.39% according to a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Finally, a total of 30 routes were calculated by the proposed algorithm and compared with Google Maps considering the values of time, distance and safety along the routes. As a result, the routes generated by the proposed algorithm were safer than the routes obtained with Google Maps, achieving an increase in the use of safe pedestrian areas of at least 183%.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart Cities (or Cities 2.0) are an evolution in citizen habitation. In such cities, transport commuting is changing rapidly with the proliferation of contemporary vehicular technology. New models of vehicle ride sharing systems are changing the way citizens commute in their daily movement schedule. The use of a private vehicle per single passenger transportation is no longer viable in sustainable Smart Cities (SC) because of the vehicles&rsquo; resource allocation and urban pollution. The current research on car ride sharing systems is widely expanding in a range of contemporary technologies, however, without covering a multidisciplinary approach. In this paper, the focus is on performing a multidisciplinary research on car riding systems taking into consideration personalized user mobility behavior by providing next destination prediction as well as a recommender system based on riders&rsquo; personalized information. Specifically, it proposes a predictive vehicle ride sharing system for commuting, which has impact on the SC green ecosystem. The adopted system also provides a recommendation to citizens to select the persons they would like to commute with. An Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled weighted pattern matching model is used to assess user movement behavior in SC and provide the best predicted recommendation list of commuting users. Citizens are then able to engage a current trip to next destination with the more suitable user provided by the list. An experimented is conducted with real data from the municipality of New Philadelphia, in SC of Athens, Greece, to implement the proposed system and observe certain user movement behavior. The results are promising for the incorporation of the adopted system to other SCs.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, intelligent systems play an important role in a wide range of applications, including financial ones, smart cities, healthcare, and transportation. Most of the intelligent systems are composed of prefabricated components. Inappropriate composition of components may lead to unsafe, power-consuming, and vulnerable intelligent systems. Although artificial intelligence-based systems can provide various advantages for humanity, they have several dark sides that can affect our lives. Some terms, such as security, trust, privacy, safety, and fairness, relate to the dark sides of artificial intelligence, which may be inherent to the intelligent systems. Existing solutions either focus on solving a specific problem or consider the some other challenge without addressing the fundamental issues of artificial intelligence. In other words, there is no general framework to conduct a component selection process while considering the dark sides in the literature. Hence, in this paper, we proposed a new framework for the component selection of intelligent systems while considering the dark sides of artificial intelligence. This framework consists of four phases, namely, component analyzing, extracting criteria and weighting, formulating the problem as multiple knapsacks, and finding components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first component selection framework to deal with the dark sides of artificial intelligence. We also developed a case study for the component selection issue in autonomous vehicles to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. Six components along with four criteria (i.e., energy consumption, security, privacy, and complexity) were analyzed and weighted by experts via analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. The results clearly show that the appropriate composition of components was selected through the proposed framework for the desired functions.},

ABSTRACT = {Several Internet of Things (IoT) applications are booming which rely on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and, in particular, machine learning (ML) algorithms to assist the users and make decisions on their behalf in a large variety of contexts, such as smart homes, smart cities, smart factories. Although the traditional approach is to deploy such compute-intensive algorithms into the centralized cloud, the recent proliferation of low-cost, AI-powered microcontrollers and consumer devices paves the way for having the intelligence pervasively spread along the cloud-to-things continuum. The take off of such a promising vision may be hurdled by the resource constraints of IoT devices and by the heterogeneity of (mostly proprietary) AI-embedded software and hardware platforms. In this paper, we propose a solution for the AI distributed deployment at the deep edge, which lays its foundation in the IoT virtualization concept. We design a virtualization layer hosted at the network edge that is in charge of the semantic description of AI-embedded IoT devices, and, hence, it can expose as well as augment their cognitive capabilities in order to feed intelligent IoT applications. The proposal has been mainly devised with the twofold aim of (i) relieving the pressure on constrained devices that are solicited by multiple parties interested in accessing their generated data and inference, and (ii) and targeting interoperability among AI-powered platforms. A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is provided to showcase the viability and advantages of the proposed solution.},

ABSTRACT = {In the context of the European Union promoting clean energy, sustainability and better living conditions for its citizens, the development of smarts cities is an initiative supported at the European Union level, in line with the new energy policies of the European Union promoted by the package “Clean Energy for All Europeans”. The concept of smart cities gains increasing importance in the European Union, a fact that is reflected in the project “European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities” of the European Commission. Smart cities are a practical example of how the new energy policies shape the lives of the European Union citizens, trying to improve it. As a consequence, new business models arise in big cities, involving the use of technology for better living conditions. These new, technology-based business models are important, as they improve the life quality of the inhabitants, they reduce the climate change impact, and they contribute as well to job creation in the IT-industry, promoting innovation. They have as well a social impact, as they bring experts from energy policies, business, economics, legal and IT together in order to project a new type of city—the smart city. The research hypothesis of the present article is that there is a high acceptance towards the concept of smart cities at the European Union level and that this concept could be implemented with the help of information technology and of artificial intelligence. This way, legal provisions, economic measures and IT-tools work together in order to create synergy effects for better life quality of the citizens of the European Union. The research hypothesis is analyzed by means of the questionnaire as a qualitative research method and is as well assessed by using case studies (e.g., Austria, Finland, Romania). The novelty of the case studies is that the development of smart cities is analyzed due to the new trend towards sustainability in two countries with different living conditions in the European Union.},

ABSTRACT = {A smart city is an environment that uses innovative technologies to make networks and services more flexible, effective, and sustainable with the use of information, digital, and telecommunication technologies, improving the city’s operations for the benefit of its citizens. Most cities incorporate data acquisition elements from their own systems or those managed by subcontracted companies that can be used to optimise their resources: energy consumption, smart meters, lighting, irrigation water consumption, traffic data, camera images, waste collection, security systems, pollution meters, climate data, etc. The city-as-a-platform concept is becoming popular and it is increasingly evident that cities must have efficient management systems capable of deploying, for instance, IoT platforms, open data, etc., and of using artificial intelligence intensively. For many cities, data collection is not a problem, but managing and analysing data with the aim of optimising resources and improving the lives of citizens is. This article presents deepint.net, a platform for capturing, integrating, analysing, and creating dashboards, alert systems, optimisation models, etc. This article shows how deepint.net has been used to estimate pedestrian traffic on the streets of Melbourne (Australia) using the XGBoost algorithm. Given the current situation, it is advisable not to transit urban roads when overcrowded, thus, the model proposed in this paper (and implemented with deepint.net) facilitates the identification of areas with less pedestrian traffic. This use case is an example of an efficient crowd management system, implemented and operated via a platform that offers many possibilities for the management of the data collected in smart territories and cities.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart cities and communities (SCC) constitute a new paradigm in urban development. SCC ideate a data-centered society aimed at improving efficiency by automating and optimizing activities and utilities. Information and communication technology along with Internet of Things enables data collection and with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) situation awareness can be obtained to feed the SCC actors with enriched knowledge. This paper describes AI perspectives in SCC and gives an overview of AI-based technologies used in traffic to enable road vehicle automation and smart traffic control. Perception, smart traffic control and driver modeling are described along with open research challenges and standardization to help introduce advanced driver assistance systems and automated vehicle functionality in traffic. To fully realize the potential of SCC, to create a holistic view on a city level, availability of data from different stakeholders is necessary. Further, though AI technologies provide accurate predictions and classifications, there is an ambiguity regarding the correctness of their outputs. This can make it difficult for the human operator to trust the system. Today there are no methods that can be used to match function requirements with the level of detail in data annotation in order to train an accurate model. Another challenge related to trust is explainability: models can have difficulty explaining how they came to certain conclusions, so it is difficult for humans to trust them.},

ABSTRACT = {The smart city concept, in which data from different systems are available, contains a multitude of critical infrastructures. This data availability opens new research opportunities in the study of the interdependency between those critical infrastructures and cascading effects solutions and focuses on the smart city as a network of critical infrastructures. This paper proposes an integrated resilience system linking interconnected critical infrastructures in a smart city to improve disaster resilience. A data-driven approach is considered, using artificial intelligence and methods to minimize cascading effects and the destruction of failing critical infrastructures and their components (at a city level). The proposed approach allows rapid recovery of infrastructures’ service performance levels after disasters while keeping the coverage of the assessment of risks, prevention, detection, response, and mitigation of consequences. The proposed approach has the originality and the practical implication of providing a decision support system that handles the infrastructures that will support the city disaster management system—make the city prepare, adapt, absorb, respond, and recover from disasters by taking advantage of the interconnections between its various critical infrastructures to increase the overall resilience capacity. The city of Lisbon (Portugal) is used as a case to show the practical application of the approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Transportation data in a smart city environment is increasingly becoming available. This data availability allows building smart solutions that are viewed as meaningful by both city residents and city management authorities. Our research work was based on Lisbon mobility data available through the local municipality, where we integrated and cleaned different data sources and applied a CRISP-DM approach using Python. We focused on mobility problems and interdependence and cascading-effect solutions for the city of Lisbon. We developed data-driven approaches using artificial intelligence and visualization methods to understand traffic and accident problems, providing a big picture to competent authorities and supporting the city in being more prepared, adaptable, and responsive, and better able to recover from such events.},

ABSTRACT = {The evolution of Mobile Networks and Internet of Things (IoT) architectures allows one to rethink the way smart cities infrastructures are designed and managed, and solve a number of problems in terms of human mobility. The territories that adopt the sensoring era can take advantage of this disruptive technology to improve the quality of mobility of their citizens and the rationalization of their resources. However, with this rapid development of smart terminals and infrastructures, as well as the proliferation of diversified applications, even current networks may not be able to completely meet quickly rising human mobility demands. Thus, they are facing many challenges and to cope with these challenges, different standards and projects have been proposed so far. Accordingly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been utilized as a new paradigm for the design and optimization of mobile networks with a high level of intelligence. The objective of this work is to identify and discuss the challenges of mobile networks, alongside IoT and AI, to characterize smart human mobility and to discuss some workable solutions to these challenges. Finally, based on this discussion, we propose paths for future smart human mobility researches.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, we are observing a rapid development of UAV-based monitoring systems, which are faced with more and more new tasks, such as high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution of measurements, or Artificial Intelligence on board. This paper presents the open universal framework intended for fast prototyping or building a short series of specialized flying monitoring systems able to work in urban and industrial areas. The proposed framework combines mobility of UAV with IoT measurements and full-stack WebRTC communications. WebRTC offers simultaneous transmission of both a real-time video stream and the flow of data coming from sensors, and ensures a kind of protection of data flow, which leads to preserving its near-real-time character and enables contextual communication. Addition of the AI accelerator hardware makes this system AI-ready, i.e., the IoT communication hub, which is the air component of our system, is able to perform tasks of AI-supported computing. The exemplary prototype of this system was evaluated in terms of the ability to work with fast-response sensors, the ability to work with high temporal and high spatial resolutions, video information in poor visibility conditions and AI-readiness. Results show that prototypes based on the proposed framework are able to meet the challenges of monitoring systems in smart cities and industrial areas.},

ABSTRACT = {With the advent of smart health, smart cities, and smart grids, the amount of data has grown swiftly. When the collected data is published for valuable information mining, privacy turns out to be a key matter due to the presence of sensitive information. Such sensitive information comprises either a single sensitive attribute (an individual has only one sensitive attribute) or multiple sensitive attributes (an individual can have multiple sensitive attributes). Anonymization of data sets with multiple sensitive attributes presents some unique problems due to the correlation among these attributes. Artificial intelligence techniques can help the data publishers in anonymizing such data. To the best of our knowledge, no fuzzy logic-based privacy model has been proposed until now for privacy preservation of multiple sensitive attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy preserving model F-Classify that uses fuzzy logic for the classification of quasi-identifier and multiple sensitive attributes. Classes are defined based on defined rules, and every tuple is assigned to its class according to attribute value. The working of the F-Classify Algorithm is also verified using HLPN. A wide range of experiments on healthcare data sets acknowledged that F-Classify surpasses its counterparts in terms of privacy and utility. Being based on artificial intelligence, it has a lower execution time than other approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {The article presents a research in the field of complex sensing, detection, and recovery of communications networks applications and hardware, in case of failures, maloperations, or unauthorized intrusions. A case study, based on Davis AI engine operation versus human maintenance operation is performed on the efficiency of artificial intelligence agents in detecting faulty operation, in the context of growing complexity of communications networks, and the perspective of future development of internet of things, big data, smart cities, and connected vehicles. (*). In the second part of the article, a new solution is proposed for the detection of applications faults or unauthorized intrusions in traffic of communications networks. The first objective of the proposed method is to propose an approach for predicting time series. This approach is based on a multi-resolution decomposition of the signals employing the undecimate wavelet transform (UWT). The second approach for assessing traffic flow is based on the analysis of long-range dependence (LRD) (for this case, a long-term dependence). Estimating the degree of long-range dependence is performed by estimating the Hurst parameter of the analyzed time series. This is a relatively new statistical concept in communications traffic analysis and can be implemented using UWT. This property has important implications for network performance, design, and sizing. The presence of long-range dependency in network traffic is assumed to have a significant impact on network performance, and the occurrence of LRD can be the result of faults that occur during certain periods. The strategy chosen for this purpose is based on long-term dependence on traffic, and for the prediction of faults occurrence, a predictive control model (MPC) is proposed, combined with a neural network with radial function (RBF). It is demonstrated via simulations that, in the case of communications traffic, time location is the most important feature of the proposed algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {A successful application of low-cost 3D cameras in combination with artificial intelligence (AI)-based 3D object detection algorithms to outdoor mobile mapping would offer great potential for numerous mapping, asset inventory, and change detection tasks in the context of smart cities. This paper presents a mobile mapping system mounted on an electric tricycle and a procedure for creating on-street parking statistics, which allow government agencies and policy makers to verify and adjust parking policies in different city districts. Our method combines georeferenced red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) imagery from two low-cost 3D cameras with state-of-the-art 3D object detection algorithms for extracting and mapping parked vehicles. Our investigations demonstrate the suitability of the latest generation of low-cost 3D cameras for real-world outdoor applications with respect to supported ranges, depth measurement accuracy, and robustness under varying lighting conditions. In an evaluation of suitable algorithms for detecting vehicles in the noisy and often incomplete 3D point clouds from RGB-D cameras, the 3D object detection network PointRCNN, which extends region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) to 3D point clouds, clearly outperformed all other candidates. The results of a mapping mission with 313 parking spaces show that our method is capable of reliably detecting parked cars with a precision of 100% and a recall of 97%. It can be applied to unslotted and slotted parking and different parking types including parallel, perpendicular, and angle parking.},

ABSTRACT = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting all aspects of food systems, including production, food processing, distribution, and consumption. AI, if implemented ethically for sustainability, can enhance biodiversity, conserve water and energy resources, provide land-related services, power smart cities, and help mitigate climate change. However, there are significant issues in using AI to transition to sustainable food systems. AI’s own carbon footprint could cancel out any sustainability benefits that it creates. Additionally, the technology could further entrench inequalities between and within countries, and bias against minorities or less powerful groups. This paper draws on findings from a study of the Victorian Farmers’ Markets Association (VFMA) that investigated the complexity of designing AI tools to enhance sustainability and resilience for the benefit of the organisation and its members. Codesign workshops, both synchronous and asynchronous, semi-structured interviews, and design innovation methods led the VFMA to experiment with an AI tool to link sustainable soil practices, nutrient rich produce, and human health. The analysis shows that the codesign process and an agile approach created a co-learning environment where sustainability and ethical questions could be considered iteratively within transdisciplinary engagement. The bottom-up approach developed through this study supports organisations who want to engage with AI while reinforcing fairness, transparency, and sustainability.},

ABSTRACT = {Personalization, mobility, artificial intelligence, corporate life transferred to the online world—all these elements will shape all intelligent solutions, including those for cities in the future also in the field of energy management. A necessary condition is to determine which specific repetitive behaviors and features smart cities will have to meet in order to build an image among residents and adapt to their preferences and requirements and energy requirements. Smart cities were created to support residents in using various services, to give them the possibility of easy communication without time and local barriers. Therefore, high-quality smart solutions in cities significantly affect trust in the city and can affect its reputation. Given that the purpose of the article is to examine the perception of intelligent solutions also in the field of energy and their impact on the sense of privacy and security, different exchanges of perceptions of quality, the risks they pose to residents and their perception of what gives a picture, have been studied. The results of empirical research clearly showed that the safety and level of satisfaction with the activities carried out by the city have a significant impact on the perceived quality, which in turn has a positive impact on reputation. The authors proposed a methodology based on the Kano model for examining residents’ satisfaction in order to investigate undefined desires and identified and confirmed needs and to study the analysis of risk and potential threats. The study was in the form of a proprietary questionnaire that can be used in similar surveys on the satisfaction of residents; 2685 correctly completed questionnaires were analyzed and the results obtained after submission were included in management action plans. The city government has expressed an interest that the measures taken will be reviewed after one to two years.},

ABSTRACT = {Climacteric fruit such as peaches are stored in cold chambers after harvest and usually are maintained there until the desired ripening is reached to direct these fruit to market. Producers, food industries and or traders have difficulties in defining the period when fruit are at the highest level of quality desired by consumers in terms of the physical-chemical parameters (hardness –H–, soluble solids content –SSC–, and acidity –Ac–). The evolution of peach quality in terms of these parameters depends directly on storage temperature –T– and relative humidity –RH–, as well on the storage duration –t–. This paper describes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Decision Support System (DSS) designed to predict the evolution of the quality of peaches, namely the storage time required before commercialization as well as the late commercialization time. The peaches quality is stated in terms of the values of SSC, H and Ac that consumers most like for the storage T and RH. An Artificial neuronal network (ANN) is proposed to provide this prediction. The training and validation of the ANN were conducted with experimental data acquired in three different farmers’ cold storage facilities. A user interface was developed to provide an expedited and simple prediction of the marketable time of peaches, considering the storage temperature, relative humidity, and initial physical and chemical parameters. This AI DSS may help the vegetable sector (logistics and retailers), especially smaller neighborhood grocery stores, define the marketable period of fruit. It will contribute with advantages and benefits for all parties—producers, traders, retailers, and consumers—by being able to provide fruit at the highest quality and reducing waste in the process. In this sense, the ANN DSS proposed in this study contributes to new AI-based solutions for smart cities.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart cities play a vital role in the growth of a nation. In recent years, several countries have made huge investments in developing smart cities to offer sustainable living. However, there are some challenges to overcome in smart city development, such as traffic and transportation management, energy and water distribution and management, air quality and waste management monitoring, etc. The capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help to achieve some goals of smart cities, and there are proven examples from some cities like Singapore, Copenhagen, etc. However, the adoption of AI and the IoT in developing countries has some challenges. The analysis of challenges hindering the adoption of AI and the IoT are very limited. This study aims to fill this research gap by analyzing the causal relationships among the challenges in smart city development, and contains several parts that conclude the previous scholars’ work, as well as independent research and investigation, such as data collection and analysis based on DEMATEL. In this paper, we have reviewed the literature to extract key challenges for the adoption of AI and the IoT. These helped us to proceed with the investigation and analyze the adoption status. Therefore, using the PRISMA method, 10 challenges were identified from the literature review. Subsequently, determination of the causal inter-relationships among the key challenges based on expert opinions using DEMATEL is performed. This study explored the driving and dependent power of the challenges, and causal relationships between the barriers were established. The results of the study indicated that “lack of infrastructure (C1)”, ”insufficient funds (C2)”, “cybersecurity risks (C3)”, and “lack of trust in AI, IoT” are the causal factors that are slowing down the adoption of AI and IoT in smart city development. The inter-relationships between the various challenges are presented using a network relationship map, cause–effect diagram. The study’s findings can help regulatory bodies, policymakers, and researchers to make better decisions to overcome the challenges for developing sustainable smart cities.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasingly huge amount of device connections will transform the Internet of Things (IoT) into the massive IoT. The use cases of massive IoT consist of the smart city, digital agriculture, smart traffic, etc., in which the service requirements are different and even constantly changing. To fulfill the different requirements, the networks must be able to automatically adjust the network configuration, architectures, resource allocations, and other network parameters according to the different scenarios to match the different service requirements in massive IoT, which are beyond the abilities of the fifth generation (5G) networks. Moreover, the sixth generation (6G) networks are expected to have endogenous intelligence, which can well support the massive IoT application scenarios. In this paper, we first propose the framework of the 6G self-evolving networks, in which the autonomous decision-making is one of the vital parts. Then, we introduce the autonomous decision-making methods and analyze the characteristics of the different methods and mechanisms for 6G networks. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we consider one of the typical scenarios of massive IoT and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based distributed decision-making algorithm to solve the problem of the offloading policy and the network resource allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed decision-making algorithm with the self-evolving networks can improve the quality of experience (QoE) compared with the lower training.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite the promise of AI and IoT, the efforts of many organizations at scaling smart city initiatives fall short. Organizations often start by exploring the potential with a proof-of-concept and a pilot project, with the process later grinding to a halt for various reasons. Pilot purgatory, in which organizations invest in small-scale implementations without them realizing substantial benefits, is given very little attention in the scientific literature relating to the question of why AI and IoT initiatives fail to scale up for smart cities. By combining extensive study of the literature and expert interviews, this research explores the underlying reasons why many smart city initiatives relying on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) fail to scale up. The findings suggest that a multitude of factors may leave organizations ill prepared for smart city AIoT solutions, and that these tend to multiply when cities lack much-needed resources and capabilities. Yet many organizations tend to overlook the fact that such initiatives require them to pay attention to all aspects of change: strategy, data, people and organization, process, and technology. Furthermore, the research reveals that some factors tend to be more influential in certain stages. Strategic factors tend to be more prominent in the earlier stages, whereas factors relating to people and the organization tend to feature later when organizations roll out solutions. The study also puts forward potential strategies that companies can employ to scale up successfully. Three main strategic themes emerge from the study: proof-of-value, rather than proof-of-concept; treating and managing data as a key asset; and commitment at all levels.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart seaside cities can fully exploit the capabilities brought by Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of city services in traditional smart city applications: smart home, smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart surveillance, smart environment, cyber security, etc. However, smart coastal cities are characterized by their specific application domain, namely, beach monitoring. Beach attendance prediction is a beach monitoring application of particular importance for coastal managers to successfully plan beach services in terms of security, rescue, health and environmental assistance. In this paper, an experimental study that uses IoT data and deep learning to predict the number of beach visitors at Castelldefels beach (Barcelona, Spain) was developed. Images of Castelldefels beach were captured by a video monitoring system. An image recognition software was used to estimate beach attendance. A deep learning algorithm (deep neural network) to predict beach attendance was developed. The experimental results prove the feasibility of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for beach attendance prediction. For each beach, a classification of occupancy was estimated, depending on the number of beach visitors. The proposed model outperforms other machine learning models (decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest) and can successfully classify seven beach occupancy levels with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of 0.03, 92.7%, 92.9%, 92.7%, and 92.7%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the High-Level Architecture (HLA) of the European research project DEWI (Dependable Embedded Wireless Infrastructure). The objective of this HLA is to serve as a reference framework for the development of industrial Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) based on the concept of the DEWI Bubble. The DEWI Bubble constitutes a set of architecture design rules and recommendations that can be used to integrate legacy industrial sensor networks with a modern, interoperable and flexible IoT (Internet-of-Things) infrastructure. The DEWI Bubble can be regarded as a high-level abstraction of an industrial WSAN with enhanced interoperability (via standardized interfaces), dependability, technology reusability and cross-domain development. The DEWI Bubble aims to resolve the issue on how to integrate commercial WSAN technology to match the dependability, interoperability and high criticality needs of industrial domains. This paper details the criteria used to design the HLA and the organization of the infrastructure internal and external to the DEWI Bubble. The description includes the different perspectives, models, or views of the architecture: the entity model, the layered perspective of the entity model and the functional model. This includes an overview of software and hardware interfaces. The DEWI HLA constitutes an extension of the ISO/IEC 29182 SNRA (Sensor Network Reference Architecture) towards the support of wireless industrial applications in different domains: aeronautics, automotive, railway and building. To improve interoperability with existing approaches, the DEWI HLA also reuses some features from other standardized technologies and architectures. The DEWI HLA and the concept of Bubble allow networks with different industrial sensor technologies to exchange information between them or with external clients via standard interfaces, thus providing consolidated access to sensor information of different industrial domains. This is an important aspect for smart city applications, Big Data, Industry 4.0 and the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The paper includes a non-exhaustive review of the state of the art of the different interfaces, protocols and standards of this architecture. The HLA has also been proposed as the basis of the European projects SCOTT (Secure Connected Trustable Things) for enhanced security and privacy in the IoT and InSecTT (Intelligent Secure Trustable Things) for the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the IoT.},

ABSTRACT = {Evidence-based decision making is promoted as offering efficiency and effectiveness; however, its uptake has faced barriers such as underdeveloped supporting culture, limited access to evidence, and evidence that is not fully relevant. Smart city conceptualizations offer economic and environmental sustainability and better quality of life through evidence-based policy decision-making. We wondered whether smart city theory and practice has advanced the knowledge of evidence-based decision-making. We searched major databases for literature containing a mention of smart cities, decision-making, and policy. We identified relevant literature from a range of disciplines and supplemented these by following backwards and forwards citations. Evidence-based decision-making was found mostly in literature regarding the theory and practice of smart city operations, and, to lesser extents, the articles regarding policy decisions and tactical decisions. Better decision-making which supported the achievement of city sustainability objectives was reported in some articles; however, we found significant obstacles to the further achievement of city objectives in the areas of underachievement in collaborative decision-making, privileging of big data evidence, and artificial intelligence agents as decision-makers. We assembled a definition of smart city decision-making and developed an agenda of research which will support city governments, theorists, and practitioners in better achieving sustainability through improved decision-making.},

ABSTRACT = {In the construction of new smart cities, traditional fire-detection systems can be replaced with vision-based systems to establish fire safety in society using emerging technologies, such as digital cameras, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. In this study, we developed a fire detector that accurately detects even small sparks and sounds an alarm within 8 s of a fire outbreak. A novel convolutional neural network was developed to detect fire regions using an enhanced You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4network. Based on the improved YOLOv4 algorithm, we adapted the network to operate on the Banana Pi M3 board using only three layers. Initially, we examined the originalYOLOv4 approach to determine the accuracy of predictions of candidate fire regions. However, the anticipated results were not observed after several experiments involving this approach to detect fire accidents. We improved the traditional YOLOv4 network by increasing the size of the training dataset based on data augmentation techniques for the real-time monitoring of fire disasters. By modifying the network structure through automatic color augmentation, reducing parameters, etc., the proposed method successfully detected and notified the incidence of disastrous fires with a high speed and accuracy in different weather environments&mdash;sunny or cloudy, day or night. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method can be used successfully for the protection of smart cities and in monitoring fires in urban areas. Finally, we compared the performance of our method with that of recently reported fire-detection approaches employing widely used performance matrices to test the fire classification results achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {The goal of this study is to investigate the direct and indirect relationships that exist between artificial intelligence (AI), social innovation (SI), and smart decision-making (SDM). This study used a survey design and collected cross-sectional data from South Korea and Pakistan using survey questionnaires. Four hundred sixty respondents from the public and private sectors were obtained and empirically analyzed using SPSS multiple regression. The study discovered a strong and positive mediating effect of SI between the relationship of AI and SDM, as predicted. Previous researchers have investigated some of the factors that influence the decision-making process. This study adds to the social science literature by examining the impact of a mediating factor on decision-making. The findings of this study will contribute to the local government in building smart cities such that the factor of social innovations should be involved in the decision-making process because smart decision-making would share such collected data with entrepreneurs, businesses, and industries and would benefit society and all relevant stakeholders, including such social innovators.},

ABSTRACT = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the deaths of millions of people around the world. The scientific community faces a tough struggle to reduce the effects of this pandemic. Several investigations dealing with different perspectives have been carried out. However, it is not easy to find studies focused on COVID-19 contagion chains. A deep analysis of contagion chains may contribute new findings that can be used to reduce the effects of COVID-19. For example, some interesting chains with specific behaviors could be identified and more in-depth analyses could be performed to investigate the reasons for such behaviors. To represent, validate and analyze the information of contagion chains, we adopted an ontological approach. Ontologies are artificial intelligence techniques that have become widely accepted solutions for the representation of knowledge and corresponding analyses. The semantic representation of information by means of ontologies enables the consistency of the information to be checked, as well as automatic reasoning to infer new knowledge. The ontology was implemented in Ontology Web Language (OWL), which is a formal language based on description logics. This approach could have a special impact on smart cities, which are characterized as using information to enhance the quality of basic services for citizens. In particular, health services could take advantage of this approach to reduce the effects of COVID-19.},

ABSTRACT = {The growing importance and widespread adoption of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies have helped the enhancement of smart environments in numerous sectors such as manufacturing, smart cities, transportation and Internet of Things by providing pervasive real-time applications. In this survey, we analyze the existing research trends with respect to Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in WSN and the possible use of these methods for WSN enhancement. The main goal of data collection, aggregation and dissemination algorithms is to gather and aggregate data in an energy efficient manner so that network lifetime is enhanced. In this paper, we highlight data collection, aggregation and dissemination challenges in WSN and present a comprehensive discussion on the recent studies that utilized various AI methods to meet specific objectives of WSN, during the span of 2010 to 2021. We compare and contrast different algorithms on the basis of optimization criteria, simulation/real deployment, centralized/distributed kind, mobility and performance parameters. We conclude with possible future research directions. This would guide the reader towards an understanding of up-to-date applications of AI methods with respect to data collection, aggregation and dissemination challenges in WSN. Then, we provide a general evaluation and comparison of different AI methods used in WSNs, which will be a guide for the research community in identifying the mostly adapted methods and the benefits of using various AI methods for solving the challenges related to WSNs. Finally, we conclude the paper stating the open research issues and new possibilities for future studies.},

ABSTRACT = {Food waste is an important social and environmental issue that the current society faces, where one third of the total food produced is wasted or lost every year while more than 820 million people around the world do not have access to adequate food. However, as we move towards a decentralized Web 3.0 enabled smart city, we can utilize cutting edge technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and many more to reduce food waste in different phases of the supply chain. In this paper, we propose SmartNoshWaste&mdash;a blockchain based multi-layered framework utilizing cloud computing, QR code and reinforcement learning to reduce food waste. We also evaluate SmartNoshWaste on real world food data collected from the nosh app to show the efficacy of the proposed framework and we are able to reduce food waste by 9.46% in comparison to the originally collected food data based on the experimental evaluation.},

ABSTRACT = {The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) is on a global scale and that wearing a face mask at work is the only effective way to avoid becoming infected with the virus. The pandemic made governments worldwide stay under lock-downs to prevent virus transmissions. Reports show that wearing face masks would reduce the risk of transmission. With the rise in population in cities, there is a greater need for efficient city management in today&rsquo;s world for reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease. For smart cities to prosper, significant improvements to occur in public transportation, roads, businesses, houses, city streets, and other facets of city life will have to be developed. The current public bus transportation system, such as it is, should be expanded with artificial intelligence. The autonomous mask detection and alert system are needed to find whether the person is wearing a face mask or not. This article presents a novel IoT-based face mask detection system in public transportation, especially buses. This system would collect real-time data via facial recognition. The main objective of the paper is to detect the presence of face masks in real-time video stream by utilizing deep learning, machine learning, and image processing techniques. To achieve this objective, a hybrid deep and machine learning model was designed and implemented. The model was evaluated using a new dataset in addition to public datasets. The results showed that the transformation of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classifier has better performance over the Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier; it has almost complete face-identification capabilities with respect to people&rsquo;s presence in the case where they are wearing masks, with an error rate of only 1.1%. Overall, compared with the standard models, AlexNet, Mobinet, and You Only Look Once (YOLO), the proposed model showed a better performance. Moreover, the experiments showed that the proposed model can detect faces and masks accurately with low inference time and memory, thus meeting the IoT limited resources.},

ABSTRACT = {A fundamental strategy of addressing the energy performance of buildings (EPB) and creating conditions for energy sustainability in applying renewable energy sources (RES) is the effective management of building technical equipment. The buildings in question are buildings within a cluster of buildings. The building cluster can be considered as a unit that is, in the sense of the system concept, a part of a subdivision of the city and subsequently of the whole urban agglomeration. We are talking about smart cities. The control system of a building and, subsequently, smart cities is a process management system using artificial intelligence (AI). In order to achieve the desired effects, such as &ldquo;near-zero energy buildings&rdquo;, as required by the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD 3), the application of AI needs to be shifted towards wireless network connection, i.e., &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo; (IoT) application. The aim is to create conditions for reducing energy consumption, improving environmental comfort in buildings and reducing CO2 emissions. This paper further analyzes the current state of IoT and the implementation thereof in the process management of sustainable energy at the smart city level as a basic element of a smart city system applied to building management.},
