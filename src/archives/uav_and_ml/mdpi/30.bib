ABSTRACT = {Deep learning has recently attracted much attention due to its excellent performance in processing audio, image, and video data. However, few studies are devoted to the field of automatic modulation classification (AMC). It is one of the most well-known research topics in communication signal recognition and remains challenging for traditional methods due to complex disturbance from other sources. This paper proposes a heterogeneous deep model fusion (HDMF) method to solve the problem in a unified framework. The contributions include the following: (1) a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) are combined by two different ways without prior knowledge involved; (2) a large database, including eleven types of single-carrier modulation signals with various noises as well as a fading channel, is collected with various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) based on a real geographical environment; and (3) experimental results demonstrate that HDMF is very capable of coping with the AMC problem, and achieves much better performance when compared with the independent network.},

ABSTRACT = {Buildings along riverbanks are likely to be affected by rising water levels, therefore the acquisition of accurate building information has great importance not only for riverbank environmental protection but also for dealing with emergency cases like flooding. UAV-based photographs are flexible and cloud-free compared to satellite images and can provide very high-resolution images up to centimeter level, while there exist great challenges in quickly and accurately detecting and extracting building from UAV images because there are usually too many details and distortions on UAV images. In this paper, a deep learning (DL)-based approach is proposed for more accurately extracting building information, in which the network architecture, SegNet, is used in the semantic segmentation after the network training on a completely labeled UAV image dataset covering multi-dimension urban settlement appearances along a riverbank area in Chongqing. The experiment results show that an excellent performance has been obtained in the detection of buildings from untrained locations with an average overall accuracy more than 90%. To verify the generality and advantage of the proposed method, the procedure is further evaluated by training and testing with another two open standard datasets which have a variety of building patterns and styles, and the final overall accuracies of building extraction are more than 93% and 95%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the most important ecosystems in the Amazon rainforest is the Mauritia flexuosa swamp or “aguajal”. However, deforestation of its dominant species, the Mauritia flexuosa palm, also known as “aguaje”, is a common issue, and conservation is poorly monitored because of the difficult access to these swamps. The contribution of this paper is twofold: the presentation of a dataset called MauFlex, and the proposal of a segmentation and measurement method for areas covered in Mauritia flexuosa palms using high-resolution aerial images acquired by UAVs. The method performs a semantic segmentation of Mauritia flexuosa using an end-to-end trainable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the Deeplab v3+ architecture. Images were acquired under different environment and light conditions using three different RGB cameras. The MauFlex dataset was created from these images and it consists of 25,248 image patches of     512 × 512     pixels and their respective ground truth masks. The results over the test set achieved an accuracy of 98.143%, specificity of 96.599%, and sensitivity of 95.556%. It is shown that our method is able not only to detect full-grown isolated Mauritia flexuosa palms, but also young palms or palms partially covered by other types of vegetation.},

ABSTRACT = {Invasion of the Polygraphus proximus Blandford bark beetle causes catastrophic damage to forests with firs (Abies sibirica Ledeb) in Russia, especially in Central Siberia. Determining tree damage stage based on the shape, texture and colour of tree crown in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images could help to assess forest health in a faster and cheaper way. However, this task is challenging since (i) fir trees at different damage stages coexist and overlap in the canopy, (ii) the distribution of fir trees in nature is irregular and hence distinguishing between different crowns is hard, even for the human eye. Motivated by the latest advances in computer vision and machine learning, this work proposes a two-stage solution: In a first stage, we built a detection strategy that finds the regions of the input UAV image that are more likely to contain a crown, in the second stage, we developed a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that predicts the fir tree damage stage in each candidate region. Our experiments show that the proposed approach shows satisfactory results on UAV Red, Green, Blue (RGB) images of forest areas in the state nature reserve “Stolby” (Krasnoyarsk, Russia).},

ABSTRACT = {Wild birds are monitored with the important objectives of identifying their habitats and estimating the size of their populations. Especially in the case of migratory bird, they are significantly recorded during specific periods of time to forecast any possible spread of animal disease such as avian influenza. This study led to the construction of deep-learning-based object-detection models with the aid of aerial photographs collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The dataset containing the aerial photographs includes diverse images of birds in various bird habitats and in the vicinity of lakes and on farmland. In addition, aerial images of bird decoys are captured to achieve various bird patterns and more accurate bird information. Bird detection models such as Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), Retinanet, and You Only Look Once (YOLO) were created and the performance of all models was estimated by comparing their computing speed and average precision. The test results show Faster R-CNN to be the most accurate and YOLO to be the fastest among the models. The combined results demonstrate that the use of deep-learning-based detection methods in combination with UAV aerial imagery is fairly suitable for bird detection in various environments.},

ABSTRACT = {The number of panicles per unit area is a common indicator of rice yield and is of great significance to yield estimation, breeding, and phenotype analysis. Traditional counting methods have various drawbacks, such as long delay times and high subjectivity, and they are easily perturbed by noise. To improve the accuracy of rice detection and counting in the field, we developed and implemented a panicle detection and counting system that is based on improved region-based fully convolutional networks, and we use the system to automate rice-phenotype measurements. The field experiments were conducted in target areas to train and test the system and used a rotor light unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a high-definition RGB camera to collect images. The trained model achieved a precision of 0.868 on a held-out test set, which demonstrates the feasibility of this approach. The algorithm can deal with the irregular edge of the rice panicle, the significantly different appearance between the different varieties and growing periods, the interference due to color overlapping between panicle and leaves, and the variations in illumination intensity and shading effects in the field. The result is more accurate and efficient recognition of rice-panicles, which facilitates rice breeding. Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path toward smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a global scale.},

ABSTRACT = {Rice lodging severely affects harvest yield. Traditional evaluation methods and manual on-site measurement are found to be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and cost-intensive. In this study, a new method for rice lodging assessment based on a deep learning UNet (U-shaped Network) architecture was proposed. The UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) equipped with a high-resolution digital camera and a three-band multispectral camera synchronously was used to collect lodged and non-lodged rice images at an altitude of 100 m. After splicing and cropping the original images, the datasets with the lodged and non-lodged rice image samples were established by augmenting for building a UNet model. The research results showed that the dice coefficients in RGB (Red, Green and Blue) image and multispectral image test set were 0.9442 and 0.9284, respectively. The rice lodging recognition effect using the RGB images without feature extraction is better than that of multispectral images. The findings of this study are useful for rice lodging investigations by different optical sensors, which can provide an important method for large-area, high-efficiency, and low-cost rice lodging monitoring research.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing and deep learning provide a practical approach to object detection. However, most of the current approaches for processing UAV remote-sensing data cannot carry out object detection in real time for emergencies, such as firefighting. This study proposes a new approach for integrating UAV remote sensing and deep learning for the real-time detection of ground objects. Excavators, which usually threaten pipeline safety, are selected as the target object. A widely used deep-learning algorithm, namely You Only Look Once V3, is first used to train the excavator detection model on a workstation and then deployed on an embedded board that is carried by a UAV. The recall rate of the trained excavator detection model is 99.4%, demonstrating that the trained model has a very high accuracy. Then, the UAV for an excavator detection system (UAV-ED) is further constructed for operational application. UAV-ED is composed of a UAV Control Module, a UAV Module, and a Warning Module. A UAV experiment with different scenarios was conducted to evaluate the performance of the UAV-ED. The whole process from the UAV observation of an excavator to the Warning Module (350 km away from the testing area) receiving the detection results only lasted about 1.15 s. Thus, the UAV-ED system has good performance and would benefit the management of pipeline safety.},

ABSTRACT = {Although plastic pollution is one of the most noteworthy environmental issues nowadays, there is still a knowledge gap in terms of monitoring the spatial distribution of plastics, which is needed to prevent its negative effects and to plan mitigation actions. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can provide suitable data for mapping floating plastic, but most of the methods require visual interpretation and manual labeling. The main goals of this paper are to determine the suitability of deep learning algorithms for automatic floating plastic extraction from UAV orthophotos, testing the possibility of differentiating plastic types, and exploring the relationship between spatial resolution and detectable plastic size, in order to define a methodology for UAV surveys to map floating plastic. Two study areas and three datasets were used to train and validate the models. An end-to-end semantic segmentation algorithm based on U-Net architecture using the ResUNet50 provided the highest accuracy to map different plastic materials (F1-score: Oriented Polystyrene (OPS): 0.86; Nylon: 0.88; Polyethylene terephthalate (PET): 0.92; plastic (in general): 0.78), showing its ability to identify plastic types. The classification accuracy decreased with the decrease in spatial resolution, performing best on 4 mm resolution images for all kinds of plastic. The model provided reliable estimates of the area and volume of the plastics, which is crucial information for a cleaning campaign.},

ABSTRACT = {Leaf area index (LAI) is a vital parameter for predicting rice yield. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveillance with an RGB camera has been shown to have potential as a low-cost and efficient tool for monitoring crop growth. Simultaneously, deep learning (DL) algorithms have attracted attention as a promising tool for the task of image recognition. The principal aim of this research was to evaluate the feasibility of combining DL and RGB images obtained by a UAV for rice LAI estimation. In the present study, an LAI estimation model developed by DL with RGB images was compared to three other practical methods: a plant canopy analyzer (PCA); regression models based on color indices (CIs) obtained from an RGB camera; and vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from a multispectral camera. The results showed that the estimation accuracy of the model developed by DL with RGB images (R2 = 0.963 and RMSE = 0.334) was higher than those of the PCA (R2 = 0.934 and RMSE = 0.555) and the regression models based on CIs (R2 = 0.802-0.947 and RMSE = 0.401&ndash;1.13), and comparable to that of the regression models based on VIs (R2 = 0.917&ndash;0.976 and RMSE = 0.332&ndash;0.644). Therefore, our results demonstrated that the estimation model using DL with an RGB camera on a UAV could be an alternative to the methods using PCA and a multispectral camera for rice LAI estimation.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep reinforcement learning is a promising method for training a nonlinear attitude controller for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. Until now, proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated successful attitude control in simulation. However, detailed experimental investigations have not yet been conducted. This study applied deep reinforcement learning for one-degree-of-freedom pitch control in wind tunnel tests with the aim of gaining practical understandings of attitude control application. Three controllers with different discrete action choices, that is, elevator angles, were designed. The controllers with larger action rates exhibited better performance in terms of following angle-of-attack commands. The root mean square errors for tracking angle-of-attack commands decreased from 3.42&deg; to 1.99&deg; as the maximum action rate increased from 10&deg;/s to 50&deg;/s. The comparison between experimental and simulation results showed that the controller with a smaller action rate experienced the friction effect, and the controllers with larger action rates experienced fluctuating behaviors in elevator maneuvers owing to delay. The investigation of the effect of friction and delay on pitch control highlighted the importance of conducting experiments to understand actual control performances, specifically when the controllers were trained with a low-fidelity model.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) undoubtedly pose many security challenges. We need only look to the December 2018 Gatwick Airport incident for an example of the disruption UAVs can cause. In total, 1000 flights were grounded for 36 h over the Christmas period which was estimated to cost over 50 million pounds. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach which considers UAV detection as an imagery classification problem. We consider signal representations Power Spectral Density (PSD); Spectrogram, Histogram and raw IQ constellation as graphical images presented to a deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) ResNet50 for feature extraction. Pre-trained on ImageNet, transfer learning is utilised to mitigate the requirement for a large signal dataset. We evaluate performance through machine learning classifier Logistic Regression. Three popular UAVs are classified in different modes; switched on; hovering; flying; flying with video; and no UAV present, creating a total of 10 classes. Our results, validated with 5-fold cross validation and an independent dataset, show PSD representation to produce over 91% accuracy for 10 classifications. Our paper treats UAV detection as an imagery classification problem by presenting signal representations as images to a ResNet50, utilising the benefits of transfer learning and outperforming previous work in the field.},

ABSTRACT = {It is important to obtain accurate information about kiwifruit vines to monitoring their physiological states and undertake precise orchard operations. However, because vines are small and cling to trellises, and have branches laying on the ground, numerous challenges exist in the acquisition of accurate data for kiwifruit vines. In this paper, a kiwifruit canopy distribution prediction model is proposed on the basis of low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and deep learning techniques. First, the location of the kiwifruit plants and vine distribution are extracted from high-precision images collected by UAV. The canopy gradient distribution maps with different noise reduction and distribution effects are generated by modifying the threshold and sampling size using the resampling normalization method. The results showed that the accuracies of the vine segmentation using PSPnet, support vector machine, and random forest classification were 71.2%, 85.8%, and 75.26%, respectively. However, the segmentation image obtained using depth semantic segmentation had a higher signal-to-noise ratio and was closer to the real situation. The average intersection over union of the deep semantic segmentation was more than or equal to 80% in distribution maps, whereas, in traditional machine learning, the average intersection was between 20% and 60%. This indicates the proposed model can quickly extract the vine distribution and plant position, and is thus able to perform dynamic monitoring of orchards to provide real-time operation guidance.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are abundantly becoming a part of society, which is a trend that is expected to grow even further. The quadrotor is one of the drone technologies that is applicable in many sectors and in both military and civilian activities, with some applications requiring autonomous flight. However, stability, path planning, and control remain significant challenges in autonomous quadrotor flights. Traditional control algorithms, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID), have deficiencies, especially in tuning. Recently, machine learning has received great attention in flying UAVs to desired positions autonomously. In this work, we configure the quadrotor to fly autonomously by using agents (the machine learning schemes being used to fly the quadrotor autonomously) to learn about the virtual physical environment. The quadrotor will fly from an initial to a desired position. When the agent brings the quadrotor closer to the desired position, it is rewarded; otherwise, it is punished. Two reinforcement learning models, Q-learning and SARSA, and a deep learning deep Q-network network are used as agents. The simulation is conducted by integrating the robot operating system (ROS) and Gazebo, which allowed for the implementation of the learning algorithms and the physical environment, respectively. The result has shown that the Deep Q-network network with Adadelta optimizer is the best setting to fly the quadrotor from the initial to desired position.},

ABSTRACT = {Pine wilt disease (PWD) is a serious threat to pine forests. Combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and deep learning (DL) techniques to identify infected pines is the most efficient method to determine the potential spread of PWD over a large area. In particular, image segmentation using DL obtains the detailed shape and size of infected pines to assess the disease’s degree of damage. However, the performance of such segmentation models has not been thoroughly studied. We used a fixed-wing UAV to collect images from a pine forest in Laoshan, Qingdao, China, and conducted a ground survey to collect samples of infected pines and construct prior knowledge to interpret the images. Then, training and test sets were annotated on selected images, and we obtained 2352 samples of infected pines annotated over different backgrounds. Finally, high-performance DL models (e.g., fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation, DeepLabv3+, and PSPNet) were trained and evaluated. The results demonstrated that focal loss provided a higher accuracy and a finer boundary than Dice loss, with the average intersection over union (IoU) for all models increasing from 0.656 to 0.701. From the evaluated models, DeepLLabv3+ achieved the highest IoU and an F1 score of 0.720 and 0.832, respectively. Also, an atrous spatial pyramid pooling module encoded multiscale context information, and the encoder–decoder architecture recovered location/spatial information, being the best architecture for segmenting trees infected by the PWD. Furthermore, segmentation accuracy did not improve as the depth of the backbone network increased, and neither ResNet34 nor ResNet50 was the appropriate backbone for most segmentation models.},

ABSTRACT = {Nonlinear flight controllers for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can potentially be developed using deep reinforcement learning. However, there is often a reality gap between the simulation models used to train these controllers and the real world. This study experimentally investigated the application of deep reinforcement learning to the pitch control of a UAV in wind tunnel tests, with a particular focus of investigating the effect of time delays on flight controller performance. Multiple neural networks were trained in simulation with different assumed time delays and then wind tunnel tested. The neural networks trained with shorter delays tended to be susceptible to delay in the real tests and produce fluctuating behaviour. The neural networks trained with longer delays behaved more conservatively and did not produce oscillations but suffered steady state errors under some conditions due to unmodeled frictional effects. These results highlight the importance of performing physical experiments to validate controller performance and how the training approach used with reinforcement learning needs to be robust to reality gaps between simulation and the real world.},

ABSTRACT = {Computation offloading technology extends cloud computing to the edge of the access network close to users, bringing many benefits to terminal devices with limited battery and computational resources. Nevertheless, the existing computation offloading approaches are challenging to apply to specific scenarios, such as the dense distribution of end-users and the sparse distribution of network infrastructure. The technological revolution in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and chip industry has granted UAVs more computing resources and promoted the emergence of UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, which could be applied to those scenarios. However, in the MEC system with multiple users and multiple servers, making reasonable offloading decisions and allocating system resources is still a severe challenge. This paper studies the offloading decision and resource allocation problem in the UAV-assisted MEC environment with multiple users and servers. To ensure the quality of service for end-users, we set the weighted total cost of delay, energy consumption, and the size of discarded tasks as our optimization objective. We further formulate the joint optimization problem as a Markov decision process and apply the soft actor–critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the offloading policy. Numerical simulation results show that the offloading policy optimized by our proposed SAC-based dynamic computing offloading (SACDCO) algorithm effectively reduces the delay, energy consumption, and size of discarded tasks for the UAV-assisted MEC system. Compared with the fixed local-UAV scheme in the specific simulation setting, our proposed approach reduces system delay and energy consumption by approximately 50% and 200%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Yellow rust is a disease with a wide range that causes great damage to wheat. The traditional method of manually identifying wheat yellow rust is very inefficient. To improve this situation, this study proposed a deep-learning-based method for identifying wheat yellow rust from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The method was based on the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) semantic segmentation model to classify healthy wheat, yellow rust wheat, and bare soil in small-scale UAV images, and to investigate the spatial generalization of the model. In addition, it was proposed to use the high-accuracy classification results of traditional algorithms as weak samples for wheat yellow rust identification. The recognition accuracy of the PSPNet model in this study reached 98%. On this basis, this study used the trained semantic segmentation model to recognize another wheat field. The results showed that the method had certain generalization ability, and its accuracy reached 98%. In addition, the high-accuracy classification result of a support vector machine was used as a weak label by weak supervision, which better solved the labeling problem of large-size images, and the final recognition accuracy reached 94%. Therefore, the present study method facilitated timely control measures to reduce economic losses.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in several applications of environmental modeling and land use inventories. At the same time, the computer vision-based remote sensing image classification models are needed to monitor the modifications over time such as vegetation, inland water, bare soil or human infrastructure regardless of spectral, spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolutions. In this aspect, this paper proposes an ensemble of DL-based multimodal land cover classification (EDL-MMLCC) models using remote sensing images. The EDL-MMLCC technique aims to classify remote sensing images into the different cloud, shades, and land cover classes. Primarily, median filtering-based preprocessing and data augmentation techniques take place. In addition, an ensemble of DL models, namely VGG-19, Capsule Network (CapsNet), and MobileNet, is used for feature extraction. In addition, the training process of the DL models can be enhanced by the use of hosted cuckoo optimization (HCO) algorithm. Finally, the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) with regularized extreme learning machine (RELM) classifier is applied for land cover classification. The design of the HCO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization and SSA for parameter tuning of the RELM model helps to increase the classification outcome to a maximum level considerably. The proposed EDL-MMLCC technique is tested using an Amazon dataset from the Kaggle repository. The experimental results pointed out the promising performance of the EDL-MMLCC technique over the recent state of art approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {Solar home systems (SHS), a cost-effective solution for rural communities far from the grid in developing countries, are small solar panels and associated equipment that provides power to a single household. A crucial resource for targeting further investment of public and private resources, as well as tracking the progress of universal electrification goals, is shared access to high-quality data on individual SHS installations including information such as location and power capacity. Though recent studies utilizing satellite imagery and machine learning to detect solar panels have emerged, they struggle to accurately locate many SHS due to limited image resolution (some small solar panels only occupy several pixels in satellite imagery). In this work, we explore the viability and cost-performance tradeoff of using automatic SHS detection on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery as an alternative to satellite imagery. More specifically, we explore three questions: (i) what is the detection performance of SHS using drone imagery; (ii) how expensive is the drone data collection, compared to satellite imagery; and (iii) how well does drone-based SHS detection perform in real-world scenarios? To examine these questions, we collect and publicly-release a dataset of high-resolution drone imagery encompassing SHS imaged under a variety of real-world conditions and use this dataset and a dataset of imagery from Rwanda to evaluate the capabilities of deep learning models to recognize SHS, including those that are too small to be reliably recognized in satellite imagery. The results suggest that UAV imagery may be a viable alternative to identify very small SHS from perspectives of both detection accuracy and financial costs of data collection. UAV-based data collection may be a practical option for supporting electricity access planning strategies for achieving sustainable development goals and for monitoring the progress towards those goals.},
