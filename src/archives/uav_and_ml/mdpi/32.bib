ABSTRACT = {In this study, a novel type of swarm intelligence algorithm referred as the anas platyrhynchos optimizer is proposed by simulating the cluster action of the anas platyrhynchos. Starting from the core of swarm intelligence algorithm, on the premise of the use of few parameters and ease in implementation, the mathematical model and algorithm flow of the anas platyrhynchos optimizer are given, and the balance between global search and local development in the algorithm is ensured. The algorithm was applied to a benchmark function and a cooperative path planning solution for multi-UAVs as a means of testing the performance of the algorithm. The optimization results showed that the anas platyrhynchos optimizer is more superior in solving optimization problems compared with the mainstream intelligent algorithm. This study provides a new idea for solving more engineering problems.},
