ABSTRACT = {Following an avalanche, one of the factors that affect victims’ chance of survival is the speed with which they are located and dug out. Rescue teams use techniques like trained rescue dogs and electronic transceivers to locate victims. However, the resources and time required to deploy rescue teams are major bottlenecks that decrease a victim’s chance of survival. Advances in the field of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have enabled the use of flying robots equipped with sensors like optical cameras to assess the damage caused by natural or manmade disasters and locate victims in the debris. In this paper, we propose assisting avalanche search and rescue (SAR) operations with UAVs fitted with vision cameras. The sequence of images of the avalanche debris captured by the UAV is processed with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract discriminative features. A trained linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) is integrated at the top of the CNN to detect objects of interest. Moreover, we introduce a pre-processing method to increase the detection rate and a post-processing method based on a Hidden Markov Model to improve the prediction performance of the classifier. Experimental results conducted on two different datasets at different levels of resolution show that the detection performance increases with an increase in resolution, while the computation time increases. Additionally, they also suggest that a significant decrease in processing time can be achieved thanks to the pre-processing step.},

ABSTRACT = {Water stress, which affects yield and wine quality, is often evaluated using the midday stem water potential (Ψstem). However, this measurement is acquired on a per plant basis and does not account for the assessment of vine water status spatial variability. The use of multispectral cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is capable to capture the variability of vine water stress in a whole field scenario. It has been reported that conventional multispectral indices (CMI) that use information between 500–800 nm, do not accurately predict plant water status since they are not sensitive to water content. The objective of this study was to develop artificial neural network (ANN) models derived from multispectral images to predict the Ψstem spatial variability of a drip-irrigated Carménère vineyard in Talca, Maule Region, Chile. The coefficient of determination (R2) obtained between ANN outputs and ground-truth measurements of Ψstem were between 0.56–0.87, with the best performance observed for the model that included the bands 550, 570, 670, 700 and 800 nm. Validation analysis indicated that the ANN model could estimate Ψstem with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.1 MPa, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12 MPa, and relative error (RE) of −9.1%. For the validation of the CMI, the MAE, RMSE and RE values were between 0.26–0.27 MPa, 0.32–0.34 MPa and −24.2–25.6%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have rapidly emerged as a new technology in the fields of plant protection and pest control in China. Based on existing variable spray research, a plant protection UAV variable spray system integrating neural network based decision making is designed. Using the existing data on plant protection UAV operations, combined with artificial neural network (ANN) technology, an error back propagation (BP) neural network model between the factors affecting droplet deposition is trained. The factors affecting droplet deposition include ambient temperature, ambient humidity, wind speed, flight speed, flight altitude, propeller pitch, nozzles pitch and prescription value. Subsequently, the BP neural network model is combined with variable rate spray control for plant protection UAVs, and real-time information is collected by multi-sensor. The deposition rate is determined by the neural network model, and the flow rate of the spray system is regulated according to the predicted deposition amount. The amount of droplet deposition can meet the prescription requirement. The results show that the training variance of the ANN is 0.003, and thus, the model is stable and reliable. The outdoor tests show that the error between the predicted droplet deposition and actual droplet deposition is less than 20%. The ratio of droplet deposition to prescription value in each unit is approximately equal, and a variable spray operation under different conditions is realized.},

ABSTRACT = {The number of rice seedlings in the field is one of the main agronomic components for determining rice yield. This counting task, however, is still mainly performed using human vision rather than computer vision and is thus cumbersome and time-consuming. A fast and accurate alternative method of acquiring such data may contribute to monitoring the efficiency of crop management practices, to earlier estimations of rice yield, and as a phenotyping trait in breeding programs. In this paper, we propose an efficient method that uses computer vision to accurately count rice seedlings in a digital image. First, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with red-green-blue (RGB) cameras was used to acquire field images at the seedling stage. Next, we use a regression network (Basic Network) inspired by a deep fully convolutional neural network to regress the density map and estimate the number of rice seedlings for a given UAV image. Finally, an improved version of the Basic Network, the Combined Network, is also proposed to further improve counting accuracy. To explore the efficacy of the proposed method, a novel rice seedling counting (RSC) dataset was built, which consisted of 40 images (where the number of seedlings varied between 3732 and 16,173) and corresponding manually-dotted annotations. The results demonstrated high average accuracy (higher than 93%) between counts according to the proposed method and manual (UAV image-based) rice seedling counts, and very good performance, with a high coefficient of determination (R2) (around 0.94). In conclusion, the results indicate that the proposed method is an efficient alternative for large-scale counting of rice seedlings, and offers a new opportunity for yield estimation. The RSC dataset and source code are available online.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in several fields including, for example, archaeology, cargo transport, conservation, healthcare, filmmaking, hobbies and recreational use. UAVs are aircraft characterized by the absence of a human pilot on board. The extensive use of these devices has highlighted maintenance problems with regard to the propellers, which represent the source of propulsion of the aircraft. A defect in the propellers of a drone can cause the aircraft to fall to the ground and its consequent destruction, and it also constitutes a safety problem for objects and people that are in the range of action of the aircraft. In this study, the measurements of the noise emitted by a UAV were used to build a classification model to detect unbalanced blades in a UAV propeller. To simulate the fault condition, two strips of paper tape were applied to the upper surface of a blade. The paper tape created a substantial modification of the aerodynamics of the blade, and this modification characterized the noise produced by the blade in its rotation. Then, a model based on artificial neural network algorithms was built to detect unbalanced blades in a UAV propeller. This model showed high accuracy (0.9763), indicating a high number of correct detections and suggests the adoption of this tool to verify the operating conditions of a UAV. The test must be performed indoors; from the measurements of the noise produced by the UAV it is possible to identify an imbalance in the propeller blade.},

ABSTRACT = {Slope failures occur when parts of a slope collapse abruptly under the influence of gravity, often triggered by a rainfall event or earthquake. The resulting slope failures often cause problems in mountainous or hilly regions, and the detection of slope failure is therefore an important topic for research. Most of the methods currently used for mapping and modelling slope failures rely on classification algorithms or feature extraction, but the spatial complexity of slope failures, the uncertainties inherent in expert knowledge, and problems in transferability, all combine to inhibit slope failure detection. In an attempt to overcome some of these problems we have analyzed the potential of deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for slope failure detection, in an area along a road section in the northern Himalayas, India. We used optical data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over two separate study areas. Different CNN designs were used to produce eight different slope failure distribution maps, which were then compared with manually extracted slope failure polygons using different accuracy assessment metrics such as the precision, F-score, and mean intersection-over-union (mIOU). A slope failure inventory data set was produced for each of the study areas using a frequency-area distribution (FAD). The CNN approach that was found to perform best (precision accuracy assessment of almost 90% precision, F-score 85%, mIOU 74%) was one that used a window size of 64 &times; 64 pixels for the sample patches, and included slope data as an additional input layer. The additional information from the slope data helped to discriminate between slope failure areas and roads, which had similar spectral characteristics in the optical imagery. We concluded that the effectiveness of CNNs for slope failure detection was strongly dependent on their design (i.e., the window size selected for the sample patch, the data used, and the training strategies), but that CNNs are currently only designed by trial and error. While CNNs can be powerful tools, such trial and error strategies make it difficult to explain why a particular pooling or layer numbering works better than any other.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate extraction of buildings using high spatial resolution imagery is essential to a wide range of urban applications. However, it is difficult to extract semantic features from a variety of complex scenes (e.g., suburban, urban and urban village areas) because various complex man-made objects usually appear heterogeneous with large intra-class and low inter-class variations. The automatic extraction of buildings is thus extremely challenging. The fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) developed in recent years have performed well in the extraction of urban man-made objects due to their ability to learn state-of-the-art features and to label pixels end-to-end. One of the most successful FCNs used in building extraction is U-net. However, the commonly used skip connection and feature fusion refinement modules in U-net often ignore the problem of feature selection, and the ability to extract smaller buildings and refine building boundaries needs to be improved. In this paper, we propose a trainable chain fully convolutional neural network (CFCN), which fuses high spatial resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and the digital surface model (DSM) for building extraction. Multilevel features are obtained from the fusion data, and an improved U-net is used for the coarse extraction of the building. To solve the problem of incomplete extraction of building boundaries, a U-net network is introduced by chain, which is used for the introduction of a coarse building boundary constraint, hole filling, and "speckle" removal. Typical areas such as suburban, urban, and urban villages were selected for building extraction experiments. The results show that the CFCN achieved recall of 98.67%, 98.62%, and 99.52% and intersection over union (IoU) of 96.23%, 96.43%, and 95.76% in suburban, urban, and urban village areas, respectively. Considering the IoU in conjunction with the CFCN and U-net resulted in improvements of 6.61%, 5.31%, and 6.45% in suburban, urban, and urban village areas, respectively. The proposed method can extract buildings with higher accuracy and with clearer and more complete boundaries.},

ABSTRACT = {To improve the intelligence and accuracy of the Situation Assessment (SA) in complex scenes, this work develops an improved fuzzy deep neural network approach to the situation assessment for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV)s. Firstly, this work normalizes the scene data based on time series and use the normalized data as the input for an improved fuzzy deep neural network. Secondly, adaptive momentum and Elastic SGD (Elastic Stochastic Gradient Descent) are introduced into the training process of the neural network, to improve the learning performance. Lastly, in the real-time situation assessment task for multiple UAVs, conventional methods often bring inaccurate results for the situation assessment because these methods don&rsquo;t consider the fuzziness of task situations. This work uses an improved fuzzy deep neural network to calculate the results of situation assessment and normalizes these results. Then, the degree of trust of the current result, relative to each situation label, is calculated with the normalized results using fuzzy logic. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms competitors.},

ABSTRACT = {Vehicle targets in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images are generally small, so a significant amount of detailed information on targets may be lost after neural computing, which leads to the poor performances of the existing recognition algorithms. Based on convolutional neural networks that utilize the YOLOv3 algorithm, this article focuses on the development of a quick automatic vehicle detection method for UAV images. First, a vehicle dataset for target recognition is constructed. Then, a novel YOLOv3 vehicle detection framework is proposed according to the following characteristics: The vehicle targets in the UAV image are relatively small and dense. The average precision (AP) increased by 5.48%, from 92.01% to 97.49%, which still remains the rather high processing speed of the YOLO network. Finally, the proposed framework is tested using three datasets: COWC, VEDAI, and CAR. The experimental results demonstrate that our method had a better detection capability.},

ABSTRACT = {Citrus is an important cash crop in the world, and huanglongbing (HLB) is a destructive disease in the citrus industry. To efficiently detect the degree of HLB stress on large-scale orchard citrus trees, an UAV (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) hyperspectral remote sensing tool is used for HLB rapid detection. A Cubert S185 (Airborne Hyperspectral camera) was mounted on the UAV of DJI Matrice 600 Pro to capture the hyperspectral remote sensing images; and a ASD Handheld2 (spectrometer) was used to verify the effectiveness of the remote sensing data. Correlation-proven UAV hyperspectral remote sensing data were used, and canopy spectral samples based on single pixels were extracted for processing and analysis. The feature bands extracted by the genetic algorithm (GA) of the improved selection operator were 468 nm, 504 nm, 512 nm, 516 nm, 528 nm, 536 nm, 632 nm, 680 nm, 688 nm, and 852 nm for the HLB detection. The proposed HLB detection methods (based on the multi-feature fusion of vegetation index) and canopy spectral feature parameters constructed (based on the feature band in stacked autoencoder (SAE) neural network) have a classification accuracy of 99.33% and a loss of 0.0783 for the training set, and a classification accuracy of 99.72% and a loss of 0.0585 for the validation set. This performance is higher than that based on the full-band AutoEncoder neural network. The field-testing results show that the model could effectively detect the HLB plants and output the distribution of the disease in the canopy, thus judging the plant disease level in a large area efficiently.},

ABSTRACT = {Soybean maturity is a trait of critical importance for the development of new soybean cultivars, nevertheless, its characterization based on visual ratings has many challenges. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) imagery-based high-throughput phenotyping methodologies have been proposed as an alternative to the traditional visual ratings of pod senescence. However, the lack of scalable and accurate methods to extract the desired information from the images remains a significant bottleneck in breeding programs. The objective of this study was to develop an image-based high-throughput phenotyping system for evaluating soybean maturity in breeding programs. Images were acquired twice a week, starting when the earlier lines began maturation until the latest ones were mature. Two complementary convolutional neural networks (CNN) were developed to predict the maturity date. The first using a single date and the second using the five best image dates identified by the first model. The proposed CNN architecture was validated using more than 15,000 ground truth observations from five trials, including data from three growing seasons and two countries. The trained model showed good generalization capability with a root mean squared error lower than two days in four out of five trials. Four methods of estimating prediction uncertainty showed potential at identifying different sources of errors in the maturity date predictions. The architecture developed solves limitations of previous research and can be used at scale in commercial breeding programs.},

ABSTRACT = {With the upsurge in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in various fields, detecting and identifying them in real-time are becoming important topics. However, the identification of UAVs is difficult due to their characteristics such as low altitude, slow speed, and small radar cross-section (LSS). With the existing deterministic approach, the algorithm becomes complex and requires a large number of computations, making it unsuitable for real-time systems. Hence, effective alternatives enabling real-time identification of these new threats are needed. Deep learning-based classification models learn features from data by themselves and have shown outstanding performance in computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based classification model that learns the micro-Doppler signatures (MDS) of targets represented on radar spectrogram images. To enable this, first, we recorded five LSS targets (three types of UAVs and two different types of human activities) with a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar in various scenarios. Then, we converted signals into spectrograms in the form of images by Short time Fourier transform (STFT). After the data refinement and augmentation, we made our own radar spectrogram dataset. Secondly, we analyzed characteristics of the radar spectrogram dataset with the ResNet-18 model and designed the ResNet-SP model with less computation, higher accuracy and stability based on the ResNet-18 model. The results show that the proposed ResNet-SP has a training time of 242 s and an accuracy of 83.39%, which is superior to the ResNet-18 that takes 640 s for training with an accuracy of 79.88%.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes a bioinspired neural-network-based approach to solve a coverage planning problem for a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles exploring critical areas. The main goal is to fully cover the map, maintaining a uniform distribution of the fleet on the map, and avoiding collisions between vehicles and other obstacles. This specific task is suitable for surveillance applications, where the uniform distribution of the fleet in the map permits them to reach any position on the map as fast as possible in emergency scenarios. To solve this problem, a bioinspired neural network structure is adopted. Specifically, the neural network consists of a grid of neurons, where each neuron has a local cost and has a local connection only with neighbor neurons. The cost of each neuron influences the cost of its neighbors, generating an attractive contribution to unvisited neurons. We introduce several controls and precautions to minimize the risk of collisions and optimize coverage planning. Then, preliminary simulations are performed in different scenarios by testing the algorithm in four maps and with fleets consisting of 3 to 10 vehicles. Results confirm the ability of the proposed approach to manage and coordinate the fleet providing the full coverage of the map in every tested scenario, avoiding collisions between vehicles, and uniformly distributing the fleet on the map.},

Inspectors regularly monitor structures’ health using visual information because early detection of cracks on highly trafficked structures is critical for maintaining the public’s safety.

Image data provided by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is stitched using image processing techniques to overcome limitations in the resolution of cameras. This stitched image is analyzed to identify cracks using a deep learning model that makes judgements regarding the presence of cracks in the image. Moreover, cracks’ locations are determined using data from UAV sensors. To validate the system, cracks forming on an actual building are captured by a UAV, and these images are analyzed to detect and locate cracks. The proposed framework is proven as an effective way to detect cracks and to represent the cracks’ locations.},

ABSTRACT = {Significant advances in weed mapping from unmanned aerial platforms have been achieved in recent years. The detection of weed location has made possible the generation of site specific weed treatments to reduce the use of herbicides according to weed cover maps. However, the characterization of weed infestations should not be limited to the location of weed stands, but should also be able to distinguish the types of weeds to allow the best possible choice of herbicide treatment to be applied. A first step in this direction should be the discrimination between broad-leaved (dicotyledonous) and grass (monocotyledonous) weeds. Considering the advances in weed detection based on images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles, and the ability of neural networks to solve hard classification problems in remote sensing, these technologies have been merged in this study with the aim of exploring their potential for broadleaf and grass weed detection in wide-row herbaceous crops such as sunflower and cotton. Overall accuracies of around 80% were obtained in both crops, with user accuracy for broad-leaved and grass weeds around 75% and 65%, respectively. These results confirm the potential of the presented combination of technologies for improving the characterization of different weed infestations, which would allow the generation of timely and adequate herbicide treatment maps according to groups of weeds.},

ABSTRACT = {Forage dry matter is the main source of nutrients in the diet of ruminant animals. Thus, this trait is evaluated in most forage breeding programs with the objective of increasing the yield. Novel solutions combining unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and computer vision are crucial to increase the efficiency of forage breeding programs, to support high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), aiming to estimate parameters correlated to important traits. The main goal of this study was to propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach using UAV-RGB imagery to estimate dry matter yield traits in a guineagrass breeding program. For this, an experiment composed of 330 plots of full-sib families and checks conducted at Embrapa Beef Cattle, Brazil, was used. The image dataset was composed of images obtained with an RGB sensor embedded in a Phantom 4 PRO. The traits leaf dry matter yield (LDMY) and total dry matter yield (TDMY) were obtained by conventional agronomic methodology and considered as the ground-truth data. Different CNN architectures were analyzed, such as AlexNet, ResNeXt50, DarkNet53, and two networks proposed recently for related tasks named MaCNN and LF-CNN. Pretrained AlexNet and ResNeXt50 architectures were also studied. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for training and testing the model. Estimates of DMY traits by each CNN architecture were considered as new HTP traits to compare with real traits. Pearson correlation coefficient r between real and HTP traits ranged from 0.62 to 0.79 for LDMY and from 0.60 to 0.76 for TDMY; root square mean error (RSME) ranged from 286.24 to 366.93 kg·ha−1 for LDMY and from 413.07 to 506.56 kg·ha−1 for TDMY. All the CNNs generated heritable HTP traits, except LF-CNN for LDMY and AlexNet for TDMY. Genetic correlations between real and HTP traits were high but varied according to the CNN architecture. HTP trait from ResNeXt50 pretrained achieved the best results for indirect selection regardless of the dry matter trait. This demonstrates that CNNs with remote sensing data are highly promising for HTP for dry matter yield traits in forage breeding programs.},

ABSTRACT = {Multirotor UAVs have become ubiquitous in commercial and public use. As they become more affordable and more available, the associated security risks further increase, especially in relation to airspace breaches and the danger of drone-to-aircraft collisions. Thus, robust systems must be set in place to detect and deal with hostile drones. This paper investigates the use of deep learning methods to detect UAVs using acoustic signals. Deep neural network models are trained with mel-spectrograms as inputs. In this case, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are shown to be the better performing network, compared with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs). Furthermore, late fusion methods have been evaluated using an ensemble of deep neural networks, where the weighted soft voting mechanism has achieved the highest average accuracy of 94.7%, which has outperformed the solo models. In future work, the developed late fusion technique could be utilized with radar and visual methods to further improve the UAV detection performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Floods have been a major cause of destruction, instigating fatalities and massive damage to the infrastructure and overall economy of the affected country. Flood-related devastation results in the loss of homes, buildings, and critical infrastructure, leaving no means of communication or travel for the people stuck in such disasters. Thus, it is essential to develop systems that can detect floods in a region to provide timely aid and relief to stranded people, save their livelihoods, homes, and buildings, and protect key city infrastructure. Flood prediction and warning systems have been implemented in developed countries, but the manufacturing cost of such systems is too high for developing countries. Remote sensing, satellite imagery, global positioning system, and geographical information systems are currently used for flood detection to assess the flood-related damages. These techniques use neural networks, machine learning, or deep learning methods. However, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) coupled with convolution neural networks have not been explored in these contexts to instigate a swift disaster management response to minimize damage to infrastructure. Accordingly, this paper uses UAV-based aerial imagery as a flood detection method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract flood-related features from the images of the disaster zone. This method is effective in assessing the damage to local infrastructures in the disaster zones. The study area is based on a flood-prone region of the Indus River in Pakistan, where both pre-and post-disaster images are collected through UAVs. For the training phase, 2150 image patches are created by resizing and cropping the source images. These patches in the training dataset train the CNN model to detect and extract the regions where a flood-related change has occurred. The model is tested against both pre-and post-disaster images to validate it, which has positive flood detection results with an accuracy of 91%. Disaster management organizations can use this model to assess the damages to critical city infrastructure and other assets worldwide to instigate proper disaster responses and minimize the damages. This can help with the smart governance of the cities where all emergent disasters are addressed promptly.},

ABSTRACT = {Lichen is an important food source for caribou in Canada. Lichen mapping using remote sensing (RS) images could be a challenging task, however, as lichens generally appear in unevenly distributed, small patches, and could resemble surficial features. Moreover, collecting lichen labeled data (reference data) is expensive, which restricts the application of many robust supervised classification models that generally demand a large quantity of labeled data. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential of using a very-high-spatial resolution (1-cm) lichen map of a small sample site (e.g., generated based on a single UAV scene and using field data) to train a subsequent classifier to map caribou lichen over a much larger area (~0.04 km2 vs. ~195 km2) and a lower spatial resolution image (in this case, a 50-cm WorldView-2 image). The limited labeled data from the sample site were also partially noisy due to spatial and temporal mismatching issues. For this, we deployed a recently proposed Teacher-Student semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach (based on U-Net and U-Net++ networks) involving unlabeled data to assist with improving the model performance. Our experiments showed that it was possible to scale-up the UAV-derived lichen map to the WorldView-2 scale with reasonable accuracy (overall accuracy of 85.28% and F1-socre of 84.38%) without collecting any samples directly in the WorldView-2 scene. We also found that our noisy labels were partially beneficial to the SSL robustness because they improved the false positive rate compared to the use of a cleaner training set directly collected within the same area in the WorldView-2 image. As a result, this research opens new insights into how current very high-resolution, small-scale caribou lichen maps can be used for generating more accurate large-scale caribou lichen maps from high-resolution satellite imagery.},

ABSTRACT = {Large-scale mapping of date palm trees is vital for their consistent monitoring and sustainable management, considering their substantial commercial, environmental, and cultural value. This study presents an automatic approach for the large-scale mapping of date palm trees from very-high-spatial-resolution (VHSR) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) datasets, based on a deep learning approach. A U-Shape convolutional neural network (U-Net), based on a deep residual learning framework, was developed for the semantic segmentation of date palm trees. A comprehensive set of labeled data was established to enable the training and evaluation of the proposed segmentation model and increase its generalization capability. The performance of the proposed approach was compared with those of various state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks (FCNs) with different encoder architectures, including U-Net (based on VGG-16 backbone), pyramid scene parsing network, and two variants of DeepLab V3+. Experimental results showed that the proposed model outperformed other FCNs in the validation and testing datasets. The generalizability evaluation of the proposed approach on a comprehensive and complex testing dataset exhibited higher classification accuracy and showed that date palm trees could be automatically mapped from VHSR UAV images with an F-score, mean intersection over union, precision, and recall of 91%, 85%, 0.91, and 0.92, respectively. The proposed approach provides an efficient deep learning architecture for the automatic mapping of date palm trees from VHSR UAV-based images.},

ABSTRACT = {Riverbed material has multiple functions in river ecosystems, such as habitats, feeding grounds, spawning grounds, and shelters for aquatic organisms, and particle size of riverbed material reflects the tractive force of the channel flow. Therefore, regular surveys of riverbed material are conducted for environmental protection and river flood control projects. The field method is the most conventional riverbed material survey. However, conventional surveys of particle size of riverbed material require much labor, time, and cost to collect material on site. Furthermore, its spatial representativeness is also a problem because of the limited survey area against a wide riverbank. As a further solution to these problems, in this study, we tried an automatic classification of riverbed conditions using aerial photography with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and image recognition with artificial intelligence (AI) to improve survey efficiency. Due to using AI for image processing, a large number of images can be handled regardless of whether they are of fine or coarse particles. We tried a classification of aerial riverbed images that have the difference of particle size characteristics with a convolutional neural network (CNN). GoogLeNet, Alexnet, VGG-16 and ResNet, the common pre-trained networks, were retrained to perform the new task with the 70 riverbed images using transfer learning. Among the networks tested, GoogleNet showed the best performance for this study. The overall accuracy of the image classification reached 95.4%. On the other hand, it was supposed that shadows of the gravels caused the error of the classification. The network retrained with the images taken in the uniform temporal period gives higher accuracy for classifying the images taken in the same period as the training data. The results suggest the potential of evaluating riverbed materials using aerial photography with UAV and image recognition with CNN.},

ABSTRACT = {Altitude estimation is one of the fundamental tasks of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) automatic navigation, where it aims to accurately and robustly estimate the relative altitude between the UAV and specific areas. However, most methods rely on auxiliary signal reception or expensive equipment, which are not always available, or applicable owing to signal interference, cost or power-consuming limitations in real application scenarios. In addition, fixed-wing UAVs have more complex kinematic models than vertical take-off and landing UAVs. Therefore, an altitude estimation method which can be robustly applied in a GPS denied environment for fixed-wing UAVs must be considered. In this paper, we present a method for high-precision altitude estimation that combines the vision information from a monocular camera and poses information from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) through a novel end-to-end deep neural network architecture. Our method has numerous advantages over existing approaches. First, we utilize the visual-inertial information and physics-based reasoning to build an ideal altitude model that provides general applicability and data efficiency for neural network learning. A further advantage is that we have designed a novel feature fusion module to simplify the tedious manual calibration and synchronization of the camera and IMU, which are required for the standard visual or visual-inertial methods to obtain the data association for altitude estimation modeling. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated, and validated using real flight data obtained during a fixed-wing UAV landing phase. The results show the average estimation error of our method is less than 3% of the actual altitude, which vastly improves the altitude estimation accuracy compared to other visual and visual-inertial based methods.},

ABSTRACT = {As one of the most devastating disasters to pine forests, pine wilt disease (PWD) has caused tremendous ecological and economic losses in China. An effective way to prevent large-scale PWD outbreaks is to detect and remove the damaged pine trees at the early stage of PWD infection. However, early infected pine trees do not show obvious changes in morphology or color in the visible wavelength range, making early detection of PWD tricky. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral imagery (HI) has great potential for early detection of PWD. However, the commonly used methods, such as the two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN), fail to simultaneously extract and fully utilize the spatial and spectral information, whereas the three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) is able to collect this information from raw hyperspectral data. In this paper, we applied the residual block to 3D-CNN and constructed a 3D-Res CNN model, the performance of which was then compared with that of 3D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and 2D-Res CNN in identifying PWD-infected pine trees from the hyperspectral images. The 3D-Res CNN model outperformed the other models, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 88.11% and an accuracy of 72.86% for detecting early infected pine trees (EIPs). Using only 20% of the training samples, the OA and EIP accuracy of 3D-Res CNN can still achieve 81.06% and 51.97%, which is superior to the state-of-the-art method in the early detection of PWD based on hyperspectral images. Collectively, 3D-Res CNN was more accurate and effective in early detection of PWD. In conclusion, 3D-Res CNN is proposed for early detection of PWD in this paper, making the prediction and control of PWD more accurate and effective. This model can also be applied to detect pine trees damaged by other diseases or insect pests in the forest.},

ABSTRACT = {With the proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide diverse critical services, such as surveillance, disaster management, and medicine delivery, the accurate detection of these small devices and the efficient classification of their flight modes are of paramount importance to guarantee their safe operation in our sky. Among the existing approaches, Radio Frequency (RF) based methods are less affected by complex environmental factors. The similarities between UAV RF signals and the diversity of frequency components make accurate detection and classification a particularly difficult task. To bridge this gap, we propose a joint Feature Engineering Generator (FEG) and Multi-Channel Deep Neural Network (MC-DNN) approach. Specifically, in FEG, data truncation and normalization separate different frequency components, the moving average filter reduces the outliers in the RF signal, and the concatenation fully exploits the details of the dataset. In addition, the multi-channel input in MC-DNN separates multiple frequency components and reduces the interference between them. A novel dataset that contains ten categories of RF signals from three types of UAVs is used to verify the effectiveness. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art UAV detection and classification approaches in terms of 98.4% and F1 score of 98.3%.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper introduces a new intelligent fault diagnosis method based on stack pruning sparse denoising autoencoder and convolutional neural network (sPSDAE-CNN). This method processes the original input data by using a stack denoising autoencoder. Different from the traditional autoencoder, stack pruning sparse denoising autoencoder includes a fully connected autoencoding network, the features extracted from the front layer of the network are used for the operation of the subsequent layer, which means that some new connections will appear between the front and rear layers of the network, reduce the loss of information, and obtain more effective features. Firstly, a one-dimensional sliding window is introduced for data enhancement. In addition, transforming one-dimensional time-domain data into the two-dimensional gray image can further improve the deep learning (DL) ability of models. At the same time, pruning operation is introduced to improve the training efficiency and accuracy of the network. The convolutional neural network model with sPSDAE has a faster training speed, strong adaptability to noise interference signals, and can also suppress the over-fitting problem of the convolutional neural network to a certain extent. Actual experiments show that for the fault of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) blade damage, the sPSDAE-CNN model we use has better stability and reliable prediction accuracy than traditional convolutional neural networks. At the same time, For noise signals, better results can be obtained. The experimental results show that the sPSDAE-CNN model still has a good diagnostic accuracy rate in a high-noise environment. In the case of a signal-to-noise ratio of &minus;4, it still has an accuracy rate of 90%.},

ABSTRACT = {Using UAV and multispectral images has contributed to identifying field variability and improving crop management through different data modeling methods. However, knowledge on application of these tools to manage peanut maturity variability is still lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare and validate linear and multiple linear regression with models using artificial neural networks (ANN) for estimating peanut maturity under irrigated and rainfed conditions. The models were trained (80% dataset) and tested (20% dataset) using results from the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons from irrigated and rainfed fields. In each field, plant reflectance was collected weekly from 90 days after planting using a UAV-mounted multispectral camera. Images were used to develop vegetation indices (VIs). Peanut pods were collected on the same dates as the UAV flights for maturity assessment using the peanut maturity index (PMI). The precision and accuracy of the linear models to estimate PMI using VIs were, in general, greater in irrigated fields with R2 &gt; 0.40 than in rainfed areas, which had a maximum R2 value of 0.21. Multiple linear regressions combining adjusted growing degree days (aGDD) and VIs resulted in decreased RMSE for both irrigated and rainfed conditions and increased R2 in irrigated areas. However, these models did not perform successfully in the test process. On the other hand, ANN models that included VIs and aGDD showed accuracy of R2 = 0.91 in irrigated areas, regardless of using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP; RMSE = 0.062) or Radial Basis Function (RBF; RMSE = 0.065), as well as low tendency (1:1 line). These results indicated that, regardless of the ANN architecture used to predict complex and non-linear variables, peanut maturity can be estimated accurately through models with multiple inputs using VIs and aGDD. Although the accuracy of the MLP or RBF models for irrigated and rainfed areas separately was high, the overall ANN models using both irrigated and rainfed areas can be used to predict peanut maturity with the same precision.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring crops and weeds is a major challenge in agriculture and food production today. Weeds compete directly with crops for moisture, nutrients, and sunlight. They therefore have a significant negative impact on crop yield if not sufficiently controlled. Weed detection and mapping is an essential step in weed control. Many existing research studies recognize the importance of remote sensing systems and machine learning algorithms in weed management. Deep learning approaches have shown good performance in many agriculture-related remote sensing tasks, such as plant classification, disease detection, etc. However, despite the success of these approaches, they still face many challenges such as high computation cost, the need of large labelled datasets, intra-class discrimination (in growing phase weeds and crops share many attributes similarity as color, texture, and shape), etc. This paper aims to show that the attention-based deep network is a promising approach to address the forementioned problems, in the context of weeds and crops recognition with drone system. The specific objective of this study was to investigate visual transformers (ViT) and apply them to plant classification in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) images. Data were collected using a high-resolution camera mounted on a UAV, which was deployed in beet, parsley and spinach fields. The acquired data were augmented to build larger dataset, since ViT requires large sample sets for better performance, we also adopted the transfer learning strategy. Experiments were set out to assess the effect of training and validation dataset size, as well as the effect of increasing the test set while reducing the training set. The results show that with a small labeled training dataset, the ViT models outperform state-of-the-art models such as EfficientNet and ResNet. The results of this study are promising and show the potential of ViT to be applied to a wide range of remote sensing image analysis tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing is gaining momentum in a variety of agricultural and environmental applications. Very-high-resolution remote sensing image sets collected repeatedly throughout a crop growing season are becoming increasingly common. Analytical methods able to learn from both spatial and time dimensions of the data may allow for an improved estimation of crop traits, as well as the effects of genetics and the environment on these traits. Multispectral and geometric time series imagery was collected by UAV on 11 dates, along with ground-truth data, in a field trial of 866 genetically diverse biomass sorghum accessions. We compared the performance of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures that used image data from single dates (two spatial dimensions, 2D) versus multiple dates (two spatial dimensions + temporal dimension, 3D) to estimate lodging detection and severity. Lodging was detected with 3D-CNN analysis of time series imagery with 0.88 accuracy, 0.92 Precision, and 0.83 Recall. This outperformed the best 2D-CNN on a single date with 0.85 accuracy, 0.84 Precision, and 0.76 Recall. The variation in lodging severity was estimated by the best 3D-CNN analysis with 9.4% mean absolute error (MAE), 11.9% root mean square error (RMSE), and goodness-of-fit (R2) of 0.76. This was a significant improvement over the best 2D-CNN analysis with 11.84% MAE, 14.91% RMSE, and 0.63 R2. The success of the improved 3D-CNN analysis approach depended on the inclusion of &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; data, i.e., images collected on dates before and after the lodging event. The integration of geometric and spectral features with 3D-CNN architecture was also key to the improved assessment of lodging severity, which is an important and difficult-to-assess phenomenon in bioenergy feedstocks such as biomass sorghum. This demonstrates that spatio-temporal CNN architectures based on UAV time series imagery have significant potential to enhance plant phenotyping capabilities in crop breeding and Precision agriculture applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Matching aerial and satellite optical images with large dip angles is a core technology and is essential for target positioning and dynamic monitoring in sensitive areas. However, due to the long distances and large dip angle observations of the aerial platform, there are significant perspective, radiation, and scale differences between heterologous space-sky images, which seriously affect the accuracy and robustness of feature matching. In this paper, a multiview satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image matching method based on deep learning is proposed to solve this problem. The main innovation of this approach is to propose a joint descriptor consisting of soft descriptions and hard descriptions. Hard descriptions are used as the main description to ensure matching accuracy. Soft descriptions are used not only as auxiliary descriptions but also for the process of network training. Experiments on several problems show that the proposed method ensures matching efficiency and achieves better matching accuracy for multiview satellite and UAV images than other traditional methods. In addition, the matching accuracy of our method in optical satellite and UAV images is within 3 pixels, and can nearly reach 2 pixels, which meets the requirements of relevant UAV missions.},

ABSTRACT = {In this article, a cascade fuzzy neural network (FNN) control approach is proposed for position control of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system with high coupling and underactuated. For the attitude loop with limited range, the FNN controller parameters were trained offline using flight data, whereas for the position loop, the method based on FNN compensation proportional-integral-derivative (PID) was adopted to tune the system online adaptively. This method not only combined the advantages of fuzzy systems and neural networks but also reduced the amount of calculation for cascade neural network control. Simulations of fixed set point flight and spiral and square trajectory tracking flight were then conducted. The comparison of the results showed that our method had advantages in terms of minimizing overshoot and settling time. Finally, flight experiments were carried out on a DJI Tello quadrotor UAV. The experimental results showed that the proposed controller had good performance in position control.},

ABSTRACT = {Vibration dampers can greatly eliminate the galloping phenomenon of overhead transmission wires caused by wind. The detection of vibration dampers based on visual technology is an important issue. The current vibration damper detection work is mainly carried out manually. In view of the above situation, this article proposes a vibration damper detection model named DamperYOLO based on the one-stage framework in object detection. DamperYOLO first uses a Canny operator to smooth the overexposed points of the input image and extract edge features, then selectees ResNet101 as the backbone of the framework to improve the detection speed, and finally injects edge features into backbone through an attention mechanism. At the same time, an FPN-based feature fusion network is used to provide feature maps of multiple resolutions. In addition, we built a vibration damper detection dataset named DamperDetSet based on UAV cruise images. Multiple sets of experiments on self-built DamperDetSet dataset prove that our model reaches state-of-the-art level in terms of accuracy and test speed and meets the standard of real-time output of high-accuracy test results.},
