ABSTRACT = {Surveying threatened and invasive species to obtain accurate population estimates is an important but challenging task that requires a considerable investment in time and resources. Estimates using existing ground-based monitoring techniques, such as camera traps and surveys performed on foot, are known to be resource intensive, potentially inaccurate and imprecise, and difficult to validate. Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), artificial intelligence and miniaturized thermal imaging systems represent a new opportunity for wildlife experts to inexpensively survey relatively large areas. The system presented in this paper includes thermal image acquisition as well as a video processing pipeline to perform object detection, classification and tracking of wildlife in forest or open areas. The system is tested on thermal video data from ground based and test flight footage, and is found to be able to detect all the target wildlife located in the surveyed area. The system is flexible in that the user can readily define the types of objects to classify and the object characteristics that should be considered during classification.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional plant breeding evaluation methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. Accurate and rapid phenotypic trait data acquisition and analysis can improve genomic selection and accelerate cultivar development. In this work, a technique for data acquisition and image processing was developed utilizing small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multispectral imaging, and deep learning convolutional neural networks to evaluate phenotypic characteristics on citrus crops. This low-cost and automated high-throughput phenotyping technique utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to: (i) detect, count, and geolocate trees and tree gaps; (ii) categorize trees based on their canopy size; (iii) develop individual tree health indices; and (iv) evaluate citrus varieties and rootstocks. The proposed remote sensing technique was able to detect and count citrus trees in a grove of 4,931 trees, with precision and recall of 99.9% and 99.7%, respectively, estimate their canopy size with overall accuracy of 85.5%, and detect, count, and geolocate tree gaps with a precision and recall of 100% and 94.6%, respectively. This UAV-based technique provides a consistent, more direct, cost-effective, and rapid method to evaluate phenotypic characteristics of citrus varieties and rootstocks.},

ABSTRACT = {Controlling vegetation fuels around human settlements is a crucial strategy for reducing fire severity in forests, buildings and infrastructure, as well as protecting human lives. Each country has its own regulations in this respect, but they all have in common that by reducing fuel load, we in turn reduce the intensity and severity of the fire. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-acquired data combined with other passive and active remote sensing data has the greatest performance to planning Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fuelbreak through machine learning algorithms. Nine remote sensing data sources (active and passive) and four supervised classification algorithms (Random Forest, Linear and Radial Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks) were tested to classify five fuel-area types. We used very high-density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquired by UAV (154 returns&middot;m&minus;2 and ortho-mosaic of 5-cm pixel), multispectral data from the satellites Pleiades-1B and Sentinel-2, and low-density LiDAR data acquired by Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) (0.5 returns&middot;m&minus;2, ortho-mosaic of 25 cm pixels). Through the Variable Selection Using Random Forest (VSURF) procedure, a pre-selection of final variables was carried out to train the model. The four algorithms were compared, and it was concluded that the differences among them in overall accuracy (OA) on training datasets were negligible. Although the highest accuracy in the training step was obtained in SVML (OA=94.46%) and in testing in ANN (OA=91.91%), Random Forest was considered to be the most reliable algorithm, since it produced more consistent predictions due to the smaller differences between training and testing performance. Using a combination of Sentinel-2 and the two LiDAR data (UAV and ALS), Random Forest obtained an OA of 90.66% in training and of 91.80% in testing datasets. The differences in accuracy between the data sources used are much greater than between algorithms. LiDAR growth metrics calculated using point clouds in different dates and multispectral information from different seasons of the year are the most important variables in the classification. Our results support the essential role of UAVs in fuelbreak planning and management and thus, in the prevention of forest fires.},

ABSTRACT = {Tomato crops are susceptible to multiple diseases, several of which may be present during the same season. Therefore, rapid disease identification could enhance crop management consequently increasing the yield. In this study, nondestructive methods were developed to detect diseases that affect tomato crops, such as bacterial spot (BS), target spot (TS), and tomato yellow leaf curl (TYLC) for two varieties of tomato (susceptible and tolerant to TYLC only) by using hyperspectral sensing in two conditions: a) laboratory (benchtop scanning), and b) in field using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV-based). The stepwise discriminant analysis (STDA) and the radial basis function were applied to classify the infected plants and distinguish them from noninfected or healthy (H) plants. Multiple vegetation indices (VIs) and the M statistic method were utilized to distinguish and classify the diseased plants. In general, the classification results between healthy and diseased plants were highly accurate for all diseases; for instance, when comparing H vs. BS, TS, and TYLC in the asymptomatic stage and laboratory conditions, the classification rates were 94%, 95%, and 100%, respectively. Similarly, in the symptomatic stage, the classification rates between healthy and infected plants were 98% for BS, and 99&ndash;100% for TS and TYLC diseases. The classification results in the field conditions also showed high values of 98%, 96%, and 100%, for BS, TS, and TYLC, respectively. The VIs that could best identify these diseases were the renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), and the modified triangular vegetation index 1 (MTVI 1) in both laboratory and field. The results were promising and suggest the possibility to identify these diseases using remote sensing.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), although hardly a new technology, have recently gained a prominent role in many industries being widely used not only among enthusiastic consumers, but also in high demanding professional situations, and will have a massive societal impact over the coming years. However, the operation of UAVs is fraught with serious safety risks, such as collisions with dynamic obstacles (birds, other UAVs, or randomly thrown objects). These collision scenarios are complex to analyze in real-time, sometimes being computationally impossible to solve with existing State of the Art (SoA) algorithms, making the use of UAVs an operational hazard and therefore significantly reducing their commercial applicability in urban environments. In this work, a conceptual framework for both stand-alone and swarm (networked) UAVs is introduced, with a focus on the architectural requirements of the collision avoidance subsystem to achieve acceptable levels of safety and reliability. The SoA principles for collision avoidance against stationary objects are reviewed and a novel approach is described, using deep learning techniques to solve the computational intensive problem of real-time collision avoidance with dynamic objects. The proposed framework includes a web-interface allowing the full control of UAVs as remote clients with a supervisor cloud-based platform. The feasibility of the proposed approach was demonstrated through experimental tests using a UAV, developed from scratch using the proposed framework. Test flight results are presented for an autonomous UAV monitored from multiple countries across the world.},

ABSTRACT = {The increased demand for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) has also led to higher demand for realistic and efficient UAV testing environments. The current use of simulated environments has been shown to be a relatively inexpensive, safe, and repeatable way to evaluate UAVs before real-world use. However, the use of generic environments and manually-created custom scenarios leaves more to be desired. In this paper, we propose a new testbed that utilizes machine learning algorithms to procedurally generate, scale, and place 3D models to create a realistic environment. These environments are additionally based on satellite images, thus providing users with a more robust example of real-world UAV deployment. Although certain graphical improvements could be made, this paper serves as a proof of concept for an novel autonomous and relatively-large scale environment generator. Such a testbed could allow for preliminary operational planning and testing worldwide, without the need for on-site evaluation or data collection in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Drones are becoming increasingly popular not only for recreational purposes but in day-to-day applications in engineering, medicine, logistics, security and others. In addition to their useful applications, an alarming concern in regard to the physical infrastructure security, safety and privacy has arisen due to the potential of their use in malicious activities. To address this problem, we propose a novel solution that automates the drone detection and identification processes using a drone’s acoustic features with different deep learning algorithms. However, the lack of acoustic drone datasets hinders the ability to implement an effective solution. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by introducing a hybrid drone acoustic dataset composed of recorded drone audio clips and artificially generated drone audio samples using a state-of-the-art deep learning technique known as the Generative Adversarial Network. Furthermore, we examine the effectiveness of using drone audio with different deep learning algorithms, namely, the Convolutional Neural Network, the Recurrent Neural Network and the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network in drone detection and identification. Moreover, we investigate the impact of our proposed hybrid dataset in drone detection. Our findings prove the advantage of using deep learning techniques for drone detection and identification while confirming our hypothesis on the benefits of using the Generative Adversarial Networks to generate real-like drone audio clips with an aim of enhancing the detection of new and unfamiliar drones.},

ABSTRACT = {Relating ground photographs to UAV orthomosaics is a key linkage required for accurate multi-scaled lichen mapping. Conventional methods of multi-scaled lichen mapping, such as random forest models and convolutional neural networks, heavily rely on pixel DN values for classification. However, the limited spectral range of ground photos requires additional characteristics to differentiate lichen from spectrally similar objects, such as bright logs. By applying a neural network to tiles of a UAV orthomosaics, additional characteristics, such as surface texture and spatial patterns, can be used for inferences. Our methodology used a neural network (UAV LiCNN) trained on ground photo mosaics to predict lichen in UAV orthomosaic tiles. The UAV LiCNN achieved mean user and producer accuracies of 85.84% and 92.93%, respectively, in the high lichen class across eight different orthomosaics. We compared the known lichen percentages found in 77 vegetation microplots with the predicted lichen percentage calculated from the UAV LiCNN, resulting in a R2 relationship of 0.6910. This research shows that AI models trained on ground photographs effectively classify lichen in UAV orthomosaics. Limiting factors include the misclassification of spectrally similar objects to lichen in the RGB bands and dark shadows cast by vegetation.},

ABSTRACT = {Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global pandemic since late 2019 and has affected all forms of human life and economic developments. Various techniques are used to collect the infected patients’ sample, which carries risks of transferring the infection to others. The current study proposes an AI-powered UAV-based sample collection procedure through self-collection kits delivery to the potential patients and bringing the samples back for testing. Using a hypothetical case study of Islamabad, Pakistan, various test cases are run where the UAVs paths are optimized using four key algorithms, greedy, intra-route, inter-route, and tabu, to save time and reduce carbon emissions associated with alternate transportation methods. Four cases with 30, 50, 100, and 500 patients are investigated for delivering the self-testing kits to the patients. The results show that the Tabu algorithm provides the best-optimized paths covering 31.85, 51.35, 85, and 349.15 km distance for different numbers of patients. In addition, the algorithms optimize the number of UAVs to be used in each case and address the studied cases patients with 5, 8, 14, and 71 UAVs, respectively. The current study provides the first step towards the practical handling of COVID-19 and other pandemics in developing countries, where the risks of spreading the infections can be minimized by reducing person-to-person contact. Furthermore, the reduced carbon footprints of these UAVs are an added advantage for developing countries that struggle to control such emissions. The proposed system is equally applicable to both developed and developing countries and can help reduce the spread of COVID-19 through minimizing the person-to-person contact, thus helping the transformation of healthcare to smart healthcare.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have increased their use in remote sensing applications, such as precision agriculture, biosecurity, disaster monitoring, and surveillance. However, onboard UAV cognition capabilities for understanding and interacting in environments with imprecise or partial observations, for objects of interest within complex scenes, are limited, and have not yet been fully investigated. This limitation of onboard decision-making under uncertainty has delegated the motion planning strategy in complex environments to human pilots, which rely on communication subsystems and real-time telemetry from ground control stations. This paper presents a UAV-based autonomous motion planning and object finding system under uncertainty and partial observability in outdoor environments. The proposed system architecture follows a modular design, which allocates most of the computationally intensive tasks to a companion computer onboard the UAV to achieve high-fidelity results in simulated environments. We demonstrate the system with a search and rescue (SAR) case study, where a lost person (victim) in bushland needs to be found using a sub-2 kg quadrotor UAV. The navigation problem is mathematically formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). A motion strategy (or policy) is obtained once a POMDP is solved mid-flight and in real time using augmented belief trees (ABT) and the TAPIR toolkit. The system’s performance was assessed using three flight modes: (1) mission mode, which follows a survey plan and used here as the baseline motion planner; (2) offboard mode, which runs the POMDP-based planner across the flying area; and (3) hybrid mode, which combines mission and offboard modes for improved coverage in outdoor scenarios. Results suggest the increased cognitive power added by the proposed motion planner and flight modes allow UAVs to collect more accurate victim coordinates compared to the baseline planner. Adding the proposed system to UAVs results in improved robustness against potential false positive readings of detected objects caused by data noise, inaccurate detections, and elevated complexity to navigate in time-critical applications, such as SAR.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can play a key role in meeting certain demands of cellular networks. UAVs can be used not only as user equipment (UE) in cellular networks but also as mobile base stations (BSs) wherein they can either augment conventional BSs by adapting their position to serve the changing traffic and connectivity demands or temporarily replace BSs that are damaged due to natural disasters. The flexibility of UAVs allows them to provide coverage to UEs in hot-spots, at cell-edges, in coverage holes, or regions with scarce cellular infrastructure. In this work, we study how UAV locations and other cellular parameters may be optimized in such scenarios to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) of the network. We compare the performance of machine learning (ML) techniques with conventional optimization approaches. We found that, on an average, a double deep Q learning approach can achieve 93.46% of the optimal median SE and 95.83% of the optimal mean SE. A simple greedy approach, which tunes the parameters of each BS and UAV independently, performed very well in all the cases that we tested. These computationally efficient approaches can be utilized to enhance the network performance in existing cellular networks.},

ABSTRACT = {To control unmanned aerial systems, we rarely have a perfect system model. Safe and aggressive planning is also challenging for nonlinear and under-actuated systems. Expert pilots, however, demonstrate maneuvers that are deemed at the edge of plane envelope. Inspired by biological systems, in this paper, we introduce a framework that leverages methods in the field of control theory and reinforcement learning to generate feasible, possibly aggressive, trajectories. For the control policies, Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) imitate pilot-induced primitives, and DMPs are combined in parallel to generate trajectories to reach original or different goal points. The stability properties of DMPs and their overall systems are analyzed using contraction theory. For reinforcement learning, Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) was used for the maneuvers. The results in this paper show that PI2 updated policies are a feasible and parallel combination of different updated primitives transfer the learning in the contraction regions. Our proposed methodology can be used to imitate, reshape, and improve feasible, possibly aggressive, maneuvers. In addition, we can exploit trajectories generated by optimization methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), and a library of maneuvers can be instantly generated. For application, 3-DOF (degrees of freedom) Helicopter and 2D-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) models are utilized to demonstrate the main results.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of drones in mining environments is one way in which data pertaining to the state of a site in various industries can be remotely collected. This paper proposes a combined system that employs a 6-bands multispectral image capturing camera mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) drone, Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM), as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI). Depth possessing multispectral data were captured at different flight elevations. This was in an attempt to find the best elevation where remote identification of magnetite iron sands via the UAV drone specialized in collecting spectral information at a minimum accuracy of +/&minus; 16 nm was possible. Data were analyzed via SAM to deduce the cosine similarity thresholds at each elevation. Using these thresholds, AI algorithms specialized in classifying imagery data were trained and tested to find the best performing model at classifying magnetite iron sand. Considering the post flight logs, the spatial area coverage of 338 m2, a global classification accuracy of 99.7%, as well the per-class precision of 99.4%, the 20 m flight elevation outputs presented the best performance ratios overall. Thus, the positive outputs of this study suggest viability in a variety of mining and mineral engineering practices.},
