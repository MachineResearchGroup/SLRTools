ABSTRACT = {This paper tackles the problem of sensing coverage for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with an approach that takes into account the reciprocal between neighboring UAVs to reduce the oscillation of their trajectories. The proposed reciprocal decision approach, which is performed in three steps, is self-organized, distributed and autonomous. First, in contrast to the traditional method modeled and optimized in configuration space, the sensing coverage problem is directly presented as an optimal reciprocal coverage velocity (ORCV) in velocity space that is concise and effective. Second, the ORCV is determined by adjusting the action velocity out of weak coverage velocity relative to neighboring UAVs to demonstrate that the ORCV supports a collision-avoiding assembly. Third, a corresponding random probability method is proposed for determining the optimal velocity in the ORCV. The results from the simulation indicate that the proposed method has a high coverage rate, rapid convergence rate and low deadweight loss. In addition, for up to 103-size UAVs, the proposed method has excellent scalability and collision-avoiding ability.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a novel search method for a swarm of quadcopter drones. In the proposed method, inspired by the phenomena of swarms in nature, drones effectively look for the search target by investigating the evidence from the surroundings and communicating with each other. The position update mechanism is implemented using the particle swarm optimization algorithm as the swarm intelligence (a well-known swarm-based optimization algorithm), as well as a dynamic model for the drones to take the real-world environment into account. In addition, the mechanism is processed in real-time along with the movements of the drones. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through repeated test simulations, including a benchmark function optimization and air pollutant search problems. The results show that the proposed method is highly practical, accurate, and robust.},
