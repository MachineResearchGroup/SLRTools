ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on one of the collision avoidance scenarios for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where the UAV needs to avoid collision with the enemy UAV during its flying path to the goal point. Such a type of problem is defined as the enemy avoidance problem in this paper. To deal with this problem, a learning based framework is proposed. Under this framework, the enemy avoidance problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and the maneuver policies for the UAV are learned based on a temporal-difference reinforcement learning method called Sarsa. To handle the enemy avoidance problem in continuous state space, the Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMAC) function approximation technique is embodied in the proposed framework. Furthermore, a hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation environment is established. Simulation results show that the UAV agent can learn a satisfying policy under the proposed framework. Comparing with the random policy and the fixed-rule policy, the learned policy can achieve a far higher possibility in reaching the goal point without colliding with the enemy UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have a wide range of applications, such as in the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G communications, and so forth. However, the communications between UAVs and UAVs to ground control stations mainly use radio channels, and therefore these communications are vulnerable to cyberattacks. With the advent of software-defined radio (SDR), smart attacks that can flexibly select attack strategies according to the defender&rsquo;s state information are gradually attracting the attention of researchers and potential attackers of UAV networks. The smart attack can even induce the defender to take a specific defense strategy, causing even greater damage. Inspired by symmetrical thinking, a solution using a software-defined network (SDN) to combat software-defined radio was proposed. We propose a network architecture which uses dual controllers, including a UAV flight controller and SDN controller, to achieve collaborative decision-making. Built on the top of the SDN, the state information of the whole network converges quickly and is fitted to an environment model used to develop an improved Dyna-Q-based reinforcement learning algorithm. The improved algorithm integrates the power allocation and track planning of UAVs into a unified action space. The simulation data showed that the proposed communication solution can effectively avoid smart jamming attacks and has faster learning efficiency and higher convergence performance than the compared algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are very popular and increasingly used in different applications. Today, the use of multiple UAVs and UAV swarms are attracting more interest from the research community, leading to the exploration of topics such as UAV cooperation, multi-drone autonomous navigation, etc. In this work, we propose two approaches for UAV pursuit-evasion. The first approach uses deep reinforcement learning to predict the actions to apply to the follower UAV to keep track of the target UAV. The second approach uses a deep object detector and a search area proposal (SAP) to predict the position of the target UAV in the next frame for tracking purposes. The two approaches are promising and lead to a higher tracking accuracy with an intersection over union (IoU) above the selected threshold. We also show that the deep SAP-based approach improves the detection of distant objects that cover small areas in the image. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated in outdoor tracking scenarios using real UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the important topic of cooperative searches for multi-dynamic targets in unknown sea areas by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is studied based on a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. A novel multi-UAV sea area search map is established, in which models of the environment, UAV dynamics, target dynamics, and sensor detection are involved. Then, the search map is updated and extended using the concept of the territory awareness information map. Finally, according to the search efficiency function, a reward and punishment function is designed, and an RL method is used to generate a multi-UAV cooperative search path online. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm could effectively perform the search task in the sea area with no prior information.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, and robust deep deterministic policy gradient (Robust-DDPG), is proposed for developing a controller that allows robust flying of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in dynamic uncertain environments. This technique is applicable in many fields, such as penetration and remote surveillance. The learning-based controller is constructed with an actor-critic framework, and can perform a dual-channel continuous control (roll and speed) of the UAV. To overcome the fragility and volatility of original DDPG, three critical learning tricks are introduced in Robust-DDPG: (1) Delayed-learning trick, providing stable learnings, while facing dynamic environments; (2) adversarial attack trick, improving policy&rsquo;s adaptability to uncertain environments; (3) mixed exploration trick, enabling faster convergence of the model. The training experiments show great improvement in its convergence speed, convergence effect, and stability. The exploiting experiments demonstrate high efficiency in providing the UAV a shorter and smoother path. While, the generalization experiments verify its better adaptability to complicated, dynamic and uncertain environments, comparing to Deep Q Network (DQN) and DDPG algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {The autonomous landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on a marker is one of the most challenging problems in robotics. Many solutions have been proposed, with the best results achieved via customized geometric features and external sensors. This paper discusses for the first time the use of deep reinforcement learning as an end-to-end learning paradigm to find a policy for UAVs autonomous landing. Our method is based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm that splits a task into sequential sub-tasks, each one assigned to a Deep Q-Network (DQN), hence the name Sequential Deep Q-Network (SDQN). Each DQN in an SDQN is activated by an internal trigger, and it represents a component of a high-level control policy, which can navigate the UAV towards the marker. Different technical solutions have been implemented, for example combining vanilla and double DQNs, and the introduction of a partitioned buffer replay to address the problem of sample efficiency. One of the main contributions of this work consists in showing how an SDQN trained in a simulator via domain randomization, can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios of increasing complexity. The performance of SDQNs is comparable with a state-of-the-art algorithm and human pilots while being quantitatively better in noisy conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous motion planning (AMP) of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is aimed at enabling a UAV to safely fly to the target without human intervention. Recently, several emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been employed to address the AMP problem in some simplified environments, and these methods have yielded good results. This paper proposes a multiple experience pools (MEPs) framework leveraging human expert experiences for DRL to speed up the learning process. Based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a MEP&ndash;DDPG algorithm was designed using model predictive control and simulated annealing to generate expert experiences. On applying this algorithm to a complex unknown simulation environment constructed based on the parameters of the real UAV, the training experiment results showed that the novel DRL algorithm resulted in a performance improvement exceeding 20% as compared with the state-of-the-art DDPG. The results of the experimental testing indicate that UAVs trained using MEP&ndash;DDPG can stably complete a variety of tasks in complex, unknown environments.},

ABSTRACT = {With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, Intelligent UAV will be widely used in future autonomous aerial combat. Previous researches on autonomous aerial combat within visual range (WVR) have limitations due to simplifying assumptions, limited robustness, and ignoring sensor errors. In this paper, in order to consider the error of the aircraft sensors, we model the aerial combat WVR as a state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP), which introduce the small adversarial perturbations on state observations and these perturbations do not alter the environment directly, but can mislead the agent into making suboptimal decisions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel autonomous aerial combat maneuver strategy generation algorithm with high-performance and high-robustness based on state-adversarial deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (SA-DDPG), which add a robustness regularizers related to an upper bound on performance loss at the actor-network. At the same time, a reward shaping method based on maximum entropy (MaxEnt) inverse reinforcement learning algorithm (IRL) is proposed to improve the aerial combat strategy generation algorithm&rsquo;s efficiency. Finally, the efficiency of the aerial combat strategy generation algorithm and the performance and robustness of the resulting aerial combat strategy is verified by simulation experiments. Our main contributions are three-fold. First, to introduce the observation errors of UAV, we are modeling air combat as SA-MDP. Second, to make the strategy network of air combat maneuver more robust in the presence of observation errors, we introduce regularizers into the policy gradient. Third, to solve the problem that air combat&rsquo;s reward function is too sparse, we use MaxEnt IRL to design a shaping reward to accelerate the convergence of SA-DDPG.},

ABSTRACT = {Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collaboration has great potential. To increase the intelligence and environmental adaptability of multi-UAV control, we study the application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms in the field of multi-UAV cooperative control. Aiming at the problem of a non-stationary environment caused by the change of learning agent strategy in reinforcement learning in a multi-agent environment, the paper presents an improved multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm&mdash;the multiagent joint proximal policy optimization (MAJPPO) algorithm with the centralized learning and decentralized execution. This algorithm uses the moving window averaging method to make each agent obtain a centralized state value function, so that the agents can achieve better collaboration. The improved algorithm enhances the collaboration and increases the sum of reward values obtained by the multiagent system. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, we use the MAJPPO algorithm to complete the task of multi-UAV formation and the crossing of multiple-obstacle environments. To simplify the control complexity of the UAV, we use the six-degree of freedom and 12-state equations of the dynamics model of the UAV with an attitude control loop. The experimental results show that the MAJPPO algorithm has better performance and better environmental adaptability.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied for pesticide spraying as they have high efficiency and operational flexibility. However, the pesticide droplet drift caused by wind may decrease the pesticide spraying efficiency and pollute the environment. A precision spraying system based on an airborne meteorological monitoring platform on manned agricultural aircrafts is not adaptable for. So far, there is no better solution for controlling droplet drift outside the target area caused by wind, especially by wind gusts. In this regard, a UAV trajectory adjustment system based on Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for pesticide drift control was proposed in this research. By collecting data from ground WSN, the UAV utilizes the wind speed and wind direction as inputs to autonomously adjust its trajectory for keeping droplet deposition in the target spraying area. Two optimized algorithms, namely deep reinforcement learning and particle swarm optimization, were applied to generate the newly modified flight route. At the same time, a simplified pesticide droplet drift model that includes wind speed and wind direction as parameters was developed and adopted to simulate and compute the drift distance of pesticide droplets. Moreover, an LSTM-based wind speed prediction model and a RNN-based wind direction prediction model were established, so as to address the problem of missing the latest wind data caused by communication latency or a lack of connection with the ground nodes. Finally, experiments were carried out to test the communication latency between UAV and ground WSN, and to evaluate the proposed scheme with embedded Raspberry Pi boards in UAV for feasibility verification. Results show that the WSN-assisted UAV trajectory adjustment system is capable of providing a better performance of on-target droplet deposition for real time pesticide spraying with UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous tracking and landing is playing an increasingly important role in military and civil applications. In particular, machine learning has been successfully introduced to robotics-related tasks. A novel UAV autonomous tracking and landing approach based on a deep reinforcement learning strategy is presented in this paper, with the aim of dealing with the UAV motion control problem in an unpredictable and harsh environment. Instead of building a prior model and inferring the landing actions based on heuristic rules, a model-free method based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is proposed. In the POMDP model, the UAV automatically learns the landing maneuver by an end-to-end neural network, which combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm and heuristic rules. A Modular Open Robots Simulation Engine (MORSE)-based reinforcement learning framework is designed and validated with a continuous UAV tracking and landing task on a randomly moving platform in high sensor noise and intermittent measurements. The simulation results show that when the moving platform is moving in different trajectories, the average landing success rate of the proposed algorithm is about 10% higher than that of the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) method. As an indirect result, a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning-based UAV control method is validated, where the UAV can learn the optimal strategy of a continuously autonomous landing and perform properly in a simulation environment.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with meta-learning and proposes a novel approach, named meta twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (Meta-TD3), to realize the control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), allowing a UAV to quickly track a target in an environment where the motion of a target is uncertain. This approach can be applied to a variety of scenarios, such as wildlife protection, emergency aid, and remote sensing. We consider a multi-task experience replay buffer to provide data for the multi-task learning of the DRL algorithm, and we combine meta-learning to develop a multi-task reinforcement learning update method to ensure the generalization capability of reinforcement learning. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), experimental results show that the Meta-TD3 algorithm has achieved a great improvement in terms of both convergence value and convergence rate. In a UAV target tracking problem, Meta-TD3 only requires a few steps to train to enable a UAV to adapt quickly to a new target movement mode more and maintain a better tracking effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep reinforcement learning is a promising method for training a nonlinear attitude controller for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. Until now, proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated successful attitude control in simulation. However, detailed experimental investigations have not yet been conducted. This study applied deep reinforcement learning for one-degree-of-freedom pitch control in wind tunnel tests with the aim of gaining practical understandings of attitude control application. Three controllers with different discrete action choices, that is, elevator angles, were designed. The controllers with larger action rates exhibited better performance in terms of following angle-of-attack commands. The root mean square errors for tracking angle-of-attack commands decreased from 3.42&deg; to 1.99&deg; as the maximum action rate increased from 10&deg;/s to 50&deg;/s. The comparison between experimental and simulation results showed that the controller with a smaller action rate experienced the friction effect, and the controllers with larger action rates experienced fluctuating behaviors in elevator maneuvers owing to delay. The investigation of the effect of friction and delay on pitch control highlighted the importance of conducting experiments to understand actual control performances, specifically when the controllers were trained with a low-fidelity model.},

ABSTRACT = {Advances in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have led to an exponential increase in their market, thanks to the development of innovative technological solutions aimed at a wide range of applications and services, such as emergencies and those related to fires. In addition, the expansion of this market has been accompanied by the birth and growth of the so-called UAV swarms. Currently, the expansion of these systems is due to their properties in terms of robustness, versatility, and efficiency. Along with these properties there is an aspect, which is still a field of study, such as autonomous and cooperative navigation of these swarms. In this paper we present an architecture that includes a set of complementary methods that allow the establishment of different control layers to enable the autonomous and cooperative navigation of a swarm of UAVs. Among the different layers, there are a global trajectory planner based on sampling, algorithms for obstacle detection and avoidance, and methods for autonomous decision making based on deep reinforcement learning. The paper shows satisfactory results for a line-of-sight based algorithm for global path planner trajectory smoothing in 2D and 3D. In addition, a novel method for autonomous navigation of UAVs based on deep reinforcement learning is shown, which has been tested in 2 different simulation environments with promising results about the use of these techniques to achieve autonomous navigation of UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in search and rescue (SAR) missions due to their high flexibility. A key problem in SAR missions is to search and track moving targets in an area of interest. In this paper, we focus on the problem of Cooperative Multi-UAV Observation of Multiple Moving Targets (CMUOMMT). In contrast to the existing literature, we not only optimize the average observation rate of the discovered targets, but we also emphasize the fairness of the observation of the discovered targets and the continuous exploration of the undiscovered targets, under the assumption that the total number of targets is unknown. To achieve this objective, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method is proposed under the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, where each UAV maintains four observation history maps, and maps from different UAVs within a communication range can be merged to enhance UAVs’ awareness of the environment. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to process the merged maps and generate the control commands to UAVs. The simulation results show that our policy can enable UAVs to balance between giving the discovered targets a fair observation and exploring the search region compared with other methods.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a novel coordinated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm for energy sharing among multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in order to conduct big-data processing in a distributed manner. For realizing UAV-assisted aerial surveillance or flexible mobile cellular services, robust wireless charging mechanisms are essential for delivering energy sources from charging towers (i.e., charging infrastructure) to their associated UAVs for seamless operations of autonomous UAVs in the sky. In order to actively and intelligently manage the energy resources in charging towers, a MADRL-based coordinated energy management system is desired and proposed for energy resource sharing among charging towers. When the required energy for charging UAVs is not enough in charging towers, the energy purchase from utility company (i.e., energy source provider in local energy market) is desired, which takes high costs. Therefore, the main objective of our proposed coordinated MADRL-based energy sharing learning algorithm is minimizing energy purchase from external utility companies to minimize system-operational costs. Finally, our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed coordinated MADRL-based algorithm achieves desired performance improvements.},

ABSTRACT = {The resource management in wireless networks with massive Internet of Things (IoT) users is one of the most crucial issues for the advancement of fifth-generation networks. The main objective of this study is to optimize the usage of resources for IoT networks. Firstly, the unmanned aerial vehicle is considered to be a base station for air-to-ground communications. Secondly, according to the distribution and fluctuation of signals; the IoT devices are categorized into urban and suburban clusters. This clustering helps to manage the environment easily. Thirdly, real data collection and preprocessing tasks are carried out. Fourthly, the deep reinforcement learning approach is proposed as a main system development scheme for resource management. Fifthly, K-means and round-robin scheduling algorithms are applied for clustering and managing the users’ resource requests, respectively. Then, the TensorFlow (python) programming tool is used to test the overall capability of the proposed method. Finally, this paper evaluates the proposed approach with related works based on different scenarios. According to the experimental findings, our proposed scheme shows promising outcomes. Moreover, on the evaluation tasks, the outcomes show rapid convergence, suitable for heterogeneous IoT networks, and low complexity.},

ABSTRACT = {Path planning algorithms are of paramount importance in guidance and collision systems to provide trustworthiness and safety for operations of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Previous works showed different approaches mostly focusing on shortest path discovery without a sufficient consideration on local planning and collision avoidance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid path planning algorithm that uses an anytime graph-based path planning algorithm for global planning and deep reinforcement learning for local planning which applied for a real-time mission planning system of an autonomous UAV. In particular, we aim to achieve a highly autonomous UAV mission planning system that is adaptive to real-world environments consisting of both static and moving obstacles for collision avoidance capabilities. To achieve adaptive behavior for real-world problems, a simulator is required that can imitate real environments for learning. For this reason, the simulator must be sufficiently flexible to allow the UAV to learn about the environment and to adapt to real-world conditions. In our scheme, the UAV first learns about the environment via a simulator, and only then is it applied to the real-world. The proposed system is divided into two main parts: optimal flight path generation and collision avoidance. A hybrid path planning approach is developed by combining a graph-based path planning algorithm with a learning-based algorithm for local planning to allow the UAV to avoid a collision in real time. The global path planning problem is solved in the first stage using a novel anytime incremental search algorithm called improved Anytime Dynamic A* (iADA*). A reinforcement learning method is used to carry out local planning between waypoints, to avoid any obstacles within the environment. The developed hybrid path planning system was investigated and validated in an AirSim environment. A number of different simulations and experiments were performed using AirSim platform in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for an autonomous UAV. This study helps expand the existing research area in designing efficient and safe path planning algorithms for UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {In this article, methods for the attitude control optimization of large-load plant-protection quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are presented. Large-load plant-protection quadrotors can be defined as quadrotors equipped with sprayers and a tank containing a large amount of water or pesticide, allowing the quadrotors to water plants or spray pesticide during flight. Compared to the control of common small quadrotors, two main points need to be considered in the control of large-load plant-protection quadrotors—first, the water in the tank gradually diminishes during flight and the physical parameters change during this process. Second, the size and mass of the rotors are especially large, which greatly slows the response rate of the rotors. We present an extended-state reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to solve these problems. The moment of inertia (MOI) of the three axes and the dynamic response constant of the rotors are included in the state list of the quadrotor during the training process, so that the controller can learn these changes in the models. The controlling laws are automatically generated and optimized, which greatly simplifies the tuning process compared to those of traditional control algorithms. The controller in this article is tested on a 10 kg class large-load plant-protection quadrotor, and the flight performance verifies the effectiveness of our work.},

ABSTRACT = {An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can greatly reduce manpower in the agricultural plant protection such as watering, sowing, and pesticide spraying. It is essential to develop a Decision-making Support System (DSS) for UAVs to help them choose the correct action in states according to the policy. In an unknown environment, the method of formulating rules for UAVs to help them choose actions is not applicable, and it is a feasible solution to obtain the optimal policy through reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that the existing reinforcement learning algorithms cannot get the optimal policy for a UAV in the agricultural plant protection environment. In this work we propose an improved Q-learning algorithm based on similar state matching, and we prove theoretically that there has a greater probability for UAV choosing the optimal action according to the policy learned by the algorithm we proposed than the classic Q-learning algorithm in the agricultural plant protection environment. This proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on datasets that are evenly distributed based on real UAV parameters and real farm information. The performance evaluation of the algorithm is discussed in detail. Experimental results show that the algorithm we proposed can efficiently learn the optimal policy for UAVs in the agricultural plant protection environment.},

ABSTRACT = {In Public Safety Networks (PSNs), the conservation of on-scene device energy is critical to ensure long term connectivity to first responders. Due to the limited transmit power, this connectivity can be ensured by enabling continuous cooperation among on-scene devices through multipath routing. In this paper, we present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle- (UAV) aided multipath routing scheme for PSNs. The aim is to increase network lifetime by improving the Energy Efficiency (EE) of the PSN. First, network configurations are generated by using different clustering schemes. The RL is then applied to configure the routing topology that considers both the immediate energy cost and the total distance cost of the transmission path. The performance of these schemes are analyzed in terms of throughput, energy consumption, number of dead nodes, delay, packet delivery ratio, number of cluster head changes, number of control packets, and EE. The results showed an improvement of approximately 42% in EE of the clustering scheme when compared with non-clustering schemes. Furthermore, the impact of UAV trajectory and the number of UAVs are jointly analyzed by considering various trajectory scenarios around the disaster area. The EE can be further improved by 27% using Two UAVs on Opposite Axis of the building and moving in the Opposite directions (TUOAO) when compared to a single UAV scheme. The result showed that although the number of control packets in both the single and two UAV scenarios are comparable, the total number of CH changes are significantly different.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a multipurpose reinforcement learning based low-level multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles control structure constructed using neural networks with model-free training. Other low-level reinforcement learning controllers developed in studies have only been applicable to a model-specific and physical-parameter-specific multirotor, and time-consuming training is required when switching to a different vehicle. We use a 6-degree-of-freedom dynamic model combining acceleration-based control from the policy neural network to overcome these problems. The UAV automatically learns the maneuver by an end-to-end neural network from fusion states to acceleration command. The state estimation is performed using the data from on-board sensors and motion capture. The motion capture system provides spatial position information and a multisensory fusion framework fuses the measurement from the onboard inertia measurement units for compensating the time delay and low update frequency of the capture system. Without requiring expert demonstration, the trained control policy implemented using an improved algorithm can be applied to various multirotors with the output directly mapped to actuators. The algorithm’s ability to control multirotors in the hovering and the tracking task is evaluated. Through simulation and actual experiments, we demonstrate the flight control with a quadrotor and hexrotor by using the trained policy. With the same policy, we verify that we can stabilize the quadrotor and hexrotor in the air under random initial states.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are abundantly becoming a part of society, which is a trend that is expected to grow even further. The quadrotor is one of the drone technologies that is applicable in many sectors and in both military and civilian activities, with some applications requiring autonomous flight. However, stability, path planning, and control remain significant challenges in autonomous quadrotor flights. Traditional control algorithms, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID), have deficiencies, especially in tuning. Recently, machine learning has received great attention in flying UAVs to desired positions autonomously. In this work, we configure the quadrotor to fly autonomously by using agents (the machine learning schemes being used to fly the quadrotor autonomously) to learn about the virtual physical environment. The quadrotor will fly from an initial to a desired position. When the agent brings the quadrotor closer to the desired position, it is rewarded; otherwise, it is punished. Two reinforcement learning models, Q-learning and SARSA, and a deep learning deep Q-network network are used as agents. The simulation is conducted by integrating the robot operating system (ROS) and Gazebo, which allowed for the implementation of the learning algorithms and the physical environment, respectively. The result has shown that the Deep Q-network network with Adadelta optimizer is the best setting to fly the quadrotor from the initial to desired position.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to solve the flight time problem of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), this paper proposes a set of energy management strategies based on reinforcement learning for hybrid agricultural UAV. The battery is used to optimize the working point of internal combustion engines to the greatest extent while solving the high power demand issues of UAV and the response problem of internal combustion engines. Firstly, the decision-making oriented hybrid model and UAV dynamic model are established. Owing to the characteristics of the energy management strategy (EMS) based on reinforcement learning (RL), which is an intelligent optimization algorithm that has emerged in recent years, the complex theoretical formula derivation is avoided in the modeling process. In terms of the EMS, a double Q learning algorithm with strong convergence is adopted. The algorithm separates the state action value function database used in derivation decisions and the state action value function-updated database brought by the decision, so as to avoid delay and shock within the convergence process caused by maximum deviation. After the improvement, the off-line training is carried out with a large number of flight data generated in the past. The simulation results demonstrate that the improved algorithm can show better performance with less learning cost than before by virtue of the search function strategy proposed in this paper. In the state space, time-based and residual fuel-based selection are carried out successively, and the convergence rate and application effect are compared and analyzed. The results show that the learning algorithm has stronger robustness and convergence speed due to the appropriate selection of state space under different types of operating cycles. After 120,000 cycles of training, the fuel economy of the improved algorithm in this paper can reach more than 90% of that of the optimal solution, and can perform stably in actual flight.},

ABSTRACT = {Clusters of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are often used to perform complex tasks. In such clusters, the reliability of the communication network connecting the UAVs is an essential factor in their collective efficiency. Due to the complex wireless environment, however, communication malfunctions within the cluster are likely during the flight of UAVs. In such cases, it is important to control the cluster and rebuild the connected network. The asymmetry of the cluster topology also increases the complexity of the control mechanisms. The traditional control methods based on cluster consistency often rely on the motion information of the neighboring UAVs. The motion information, however, may become unavailable because of the interrupted communications. UAV control algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning have achieved outstanding results in many fields. Here, we propose a cluster control method based on the Decomposed Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DE-MADDPG) to rebuild a communication network for UAV clusters. The DE-MADDPG improves the framework of the traditional multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm by decomposing the reward function. We further introduce the reward reshaping function to facilitate the convergence of the algorithm in sparse reward environments. To address the instability of the state-space in the reinforcement learning framework, we also propose the notion of the virtual leader–follower model. Extensive simulations show that the success rate of the DE-MADDPG is higher than that of the MADDPG algorithm, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), used in civilian applications such as emergency medical deliveries, precision agriculture, wireless communication provisioning, etc., face the challenge of limited flight time due to their reliance on the on-board battery. Therefore, developing efficient mechanisms for in situ power transfer to recharge UAV batteries holds potential to extend their mission time. In this paper, we study the use of the far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) technique from specialized, transmitter UAVs (tUAVs) carrying Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas for transferring wireless power to receiver UAVs (rUAVs) in a mission. The tUAVs can fly and adjust their distance to the rUAVs to maximize energy transfer gain. The use of MIMO antennas further boosts the energy reception by narrowing the energy beam toward the rUAVs. The complexity of their dynamic operating environment increases with the growing number of tUAVs and rUAVs with varying levels of energy consumption and residual power. We propose an intelligent trajectory selection algorithm for the tUAVs based on a deep reinforcement learning model called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize the energy transfer gain. The simulation results demonstrate that the PPO-based system achieves about a tenfold increase in flight time for a set of realistic transmit power, distance, sub-band number and antenna numbers. Further, PPO outperforms the benchmark movement strategies of “Traveling Salesman Problem” and “Low Battery First” when used by the tUAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {Nonlinear flight controllers for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can potentially be developed using deep reinforcement learning. However, there is often a reality gap between the simulation models used to train these controllers and the real world. This study experimentally investigated the application of deep reinforcement learning to the pitch control of a UAV in wind tunnel tests, with a particular focus of investigating the effect of time delays on flight controller performance. Multiple neural networks were trained in simulation with different assumed time delays and then wind tunnel tested. The neural networks trained with shorter delays tended to be susceptible to delay in the real tests and produce fluctuating behaviour. The neural networks trained with longer delays behaved more conservatively and did not produce oscillations but suffered steady state errors under some conditions due to unmodeled frictional effects. These results highlight the importance of performing physical experiments to validate controller performance and how the training approach used with reinforcement learning needs to be robust to reality gaps between simulation and the real world.},

ABSTRACT = {Computation offloading technology extends cloud computing to the edge of the access network close to users, bringing many benefits to terminal devices with limited battery and computational resources. Nevertheless, the existing computation offloading approaches are challenging to apply to specific scenarios, such as the dense distribution of end-users and the sparse distribution of network infrastructure. The technological revolution in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and chip industry has granted UAVs more computing resources and promoted the emergence of UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, which could be applied to those scenarios. However, in the MEC system with multiple users and multiple servers, making reasonable offloading decisions and allocating system resources is still a severe challenge. This paper studies the offloading decision and resource allocation problem in the UAV-assisted MEC environment with multiple users and servers. To ensure the quality of service for end-users, we set the weighted total cost of delay, energy consumption, and the size of discarded tasks as our optimization objective. We further formulate the joint optimization problem as a Markov decision process and apply the soft actor–critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the offloading policy. Numerical simulation results show that the offloading policy optimized by our proposed SAC-based dynamic computing offloading (SACDCO) algorithm effectively reduces the delay, energy consumption, and size of discarded tasks for the UAV-assisted MEC system. Compared with the fixed local-UAV scheme in the specific simulation setting, our proposed approach reduces system delay and energy consumption by approximately 50% and 200%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The number of applications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is increasing. The use of UAVs in swarms makes many operators see more advantages than the individual use of UAVs, thus reducing operational time and costs. The main objective of this work is to design a system that, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) techniques, can obtain a good path for each UAV in the swarm and distribute the flight environment in such a way that the combination of the captured images is as simple as possible. To determine whether it is better to use a global ANN or multiple local ANNs, experiments have been done over the same map and with different numbers of UAVs at different altitudes. The results are measured based on the time taken to find a solution. The results show that the system works with any number of UAVs if the map is correctly partitioned. On the other hand, using local ANNs seems to be the option that can find solutions faster, ensuring better trajectories than using a single global network. There is no need to use additional map information other than the current state of the environment, like targets or distance maps.},

ABSTRACT = {In the near future, it’s expected that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will become ubiquitous surrogates for human-crewed vehicles in the field of border patrol, package delivery, etc. Therefore, many three-dimensional (3D) navigation algorithms based on different techniques, e.g., model predictive control (MPC)-based, navigation potential field-based, sliding mode control-based, and reinforcement learning-based, have been extensively studied in recent years to help achieve collision-free navigation. The vast majority of the 3D navigation algorithms perform well when obstacles are sparsely spaced, but fail when facing crowd-spaced obstacles, which causes a potential threat to UAV operations. In this paper, a 3D vision cone-based reactive navigation algorithm is proposed to enable small quadcopter UAVs to seek a path through crowd-spaced 3D obstacles to the destination without collisions. The proposed algorithm is simulated in MATLAB with different 3D obstacles settings to demonstrate its feasibility and compared with the other two existing 3D navigation algorithms to exhibit its superiority. Furthermore, a modified version of the proposed algorithm is also introduced and compared with the initially proposed algorithm to lay the foundation for future work.},

ABSTRACT = {The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as base station (BS) is gaining popularity. In this paper, we consider maximization of the overall data rate by intelligent deployment of UAV BS in the downlink of a cellular system. We investigate a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided approach to optimize the position of flying BSs mounted on board UAVs to support a macro BS (MBS). We propose an algorithm to avoid collision between multiple UAVs undergoing exploratory movements and to restrict UAV BSs movement within a predefined area. Q-learning technique is used to optimize UAV BS position, where the reward is equal to sum of user equipment (UE) data rates. We consider a framework where the UAV BSs carry out exploratory movements in the beginning and exploitary movements in later stages to maximize the overall data rate. Our results show that a cellular system with three UAV BSs and one MBS serving 72 UE reaches 69.2% of the best possible data rate, which is identified by brute force search. Finally, the RL algorithm is compared with a K-means algorithm to study the need of accurate UE locations. Our results show that the RL algorithm outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm when the measure of imperfection is higher. The proposed algorithm can be made use of by a practical MBS&ndash;UAV BSs&ndash;UEs system to provide protection to UAV BSs while maximizing data rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays a more and more important role in Internet of Things (IoT) for remote sensing and device interconnecting. Due to the limitation of computing capacity and energy, the UAV cannot handle complex tasks. Recently, computation offloading provides a promising way for the UAV to handle complex tasks by deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods. However, existing DRL-based computation offloading methods merely protect usage pattern privacy and location privacy. In this paper, we consider a new privacy issue in UAV-assisted IoT, namely computation offloading preference leakage, which lacks through study. To cope with this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserving online computation offloading method for UAV-assisted IoT. Our method integrates the differential privacy mechanism into deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which can protect UAV&rsquo;s offloading preference. We provide the formal analysis on security and utility loss of our method. Extensive real-world experiments are conducted. Results demonstrate that, compared with baseline methods, our method can learn cost-efficient computation offloading policy without preference leakage and a priori knowledge of the wireless channel model.},

ABSTRACT = {Supported by the advances in rocket technology, companies like SpaceX and Amazon competitively have entered the satellite Internet business. These companies said that they could provide Internet service sufficiently to users using their communication resources. However, the Internet service might not be provided in densely populated areas, as the satellites coverage is broad but its resource capacity is limited. To offload the traffic of the densely populated area, we present an adaptable aerial access network (AAN), composed of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and federated reinforcement learning (FRL)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using the proposed system, UAVs could operate with relatively low computation resources than centralized coverage management systems. Furthermore, by utilizing FRL, the system could continuously learn from various environments and perform better with the longer operation times. Based on our proposed design, we implemented FRL, constructed the UAV-aided AAN simulator, and evaluated the proposed system. Base on the evaluation result, we validated that the FRL enabled UAV-aided AAN could operate efficiently in densely populated areas where the satellites cannot provide sufficient Internet services, which improves network performances. In the evaluations, our proposed AAN system provided about 3.25 times more communication resources and had 5.1% lower latency than the satellite-only AAN.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) clusters usually face problems such as complex environments, heterogeneous combat subjects, and realistic interference factors in the course of mission assignment. In order to reduce resource consumption and improve the task execution rate, it is very important to develop a reasonable allocation plan for the tasks. Therefore, this paper constructs a heterogeneous UAV multitask assignment model based on several realistic constraints and proposes an improved half-random Q-learning (HR Q-learning) algorithm. The algorithm is based on the Q-learning algorithm under reinforcement learning, and by changing the way the Q-learning algorithm selects the next action in the process of random exploration, the probability of obtaining an invalid action in the random case is reduced, and the exploration efficiency is improved, thus increasing the possibility of obtaining a better assignment scheme, this also ensures symmetry and synergy in the distribution process of the drones. Simulation experiments show that compared with Q-learning algorithm and other heuristic algorithms, HR Q-learning algorithm can improve the performance of task execution, including the ability to improve the rationality of task assignment, increasing the value of gains by 12.12%, this is equivalent to an average of one drone per mission saved, and higher success rate of task execution. This improvement provides a meaningful attempt for UAV task assignment.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted cellular networks over the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band can meet the requirements of a high data rate and flexible coverage in next-generation communication networks. However, higher propagation loss and the use of a large number of antennas in mmWave networks give rise to high energy consumption and UAVs are constrained by their low-capacity onboard battery. Energy harvesting (EH) is a viable solution to reduce the energy cost of UAV-enabled mmWave networks. However, the random nature of renewable energy makes it challenging to maintain robust connectivity in UAV-assisted terrestrial cellular networks. Energy cooperation allows UAVs to send their excessive energy to other UAVs with reduced energy. In this paper, we propose a power allocation algorithm based on energy harvesting and energy cooperation to maximize the throughput of a UAV-assisted mmWave cellular network. Since there is channel-state uncertainty and the amount of harvested energy can be treated as a stochastic process, we propose an optimal multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DRL) named Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) to solve the renewable energy resource allocation problem for throughput maximization. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the Random Power (RP), Maximal Power (MP) and value-based Deep Q-Learning (DQL) algorithms in terms of network throughput.},

ABSTRACT = {To control unmanned aerial systems, we rarely have a perfect system model. Safe and aggressive planning is also challenging for nonlinear and under-actuated systems. Expert pilots, however, demonstrate maneuvers that are deemed at the edge of plane envelope. Inspired by biological systems, in this paper, we introduce a framework that leverages methods in the field of control theory and reinforcement learning to generate feasible, possibly aggressive, trajectories. For the control policies, Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) imitate pilot-induced primitives, and DMPs are combined in parallel to generate trajectories to reach original or different goal points. The stability properties of DMPs and their overall systems are analyzed using contraction theory. For reinforcement learning, Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) was used for the maneuvers. The results in this paper show that PI2 updated policies are a feasible and parallel combination of different updated primitives transfer the learning in the contraction regions. Our proposed methodology can be used to imitate, reshape, and improve feasible, possibly aggressive, maneuvers. In addition, we can exploit trajectories generated by optimization methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), and a library of maneuvers can be instantly generated. For application, 3-DOF (degrees of freedom) Helicopter and 2D-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) models are utilized to demonstrate the main results.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the limited ability of a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), group unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted more attention in communication and radar fields. The use of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system can make communication and radar modules share a radar module&rsquo;s resources, coupled with efficient resource allocation methods. It can effectively solve the problem of inadequate UAV resources and the low utilization rate of resources. In this paper, the resource allocation problem is addressed for group UAVs to achieve a trade-off between the detection and communication performance, where the ISAC system is equipped in group UAVs. The resource allocation problem is described by an optimization problem, but with group UAVs, the problem is complex and cannot be solved efficiently. Compared with the traditional resource allocation scheme, which needs a lot of calculation or sample set problems, a novel reinforcement-learning-based method is proposed. We formulate a new reward function by combining mutual information (MI) and the communication rate (CR). The MI describes the radar detection performance, and the CR is for wireless communication. Simulation results show that compared with the traditional Kuhn Munkres (KM) or the deep neural network (DNN) methods, this method has better performance with the increase in problem complexity. Additionally, the execution time of this scheme is close to that of the DNN scheme, and it is better than the KM algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {The applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly growing in domains such as surveillance, logistics, and entertainment and require continuous connectivity with cellular networks to ensure their seamless operations. However, handover policies in current cellular networks are primarily designed for ground users, and thus are not appropriate for UAVs due to frequent fluctuations of signal strength in the air. This paper presents a novel handover decision scheme deploying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to prevent unnecessary handovers while maintaining stable connectivity. The proposed DRL framework takes the UAV state as an input for a proximal policy optimization algorithm and develops a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based on a reward function for the online learning of UAV handover decisions. The proposed scheme is evaluated in a 3D-emulated UAV mobility environment where it reduces up to 76 and 73% of unnecessary handovers compared to greedy and Q-learning-based UAV handover decision schemes, respectively. Furthermore, this scheme ensures reliable communication with the UAV by maintaining the RSSI above &minus;75 dBm more than 80% of the time.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper studies the problem of distributed spectrum/channel access for cognitive radio-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (CUAVs) that overlay upon primary channels. Under the framework of cooperative spectrum sensing and opportunistic transmission, a one-shot optimization problem for channel allocation, aiming to maximize the expected cumulative weighted reward of multiple CUAVs, is formulated. To handle the uncertainty due to the lack of prior knowledge about the primary user activities as well as the lack of the channel-access coordinator, the original problem is cast into a competition and cooperation hybrid multi-agent reinforcement learning (CCH-MARL) problem in the framework of Markov game (MG). Then, a value-iteration-based RL algorithm, which features upper confidence bound-Hoeffding (UCB-H) strategy searching, is proposed by treating each CUAV as an independent learner (IL). To address the curse of dimensionality, the UCB-H strategy is further extended with a double deep Q-network (DDQN). Numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithms are able to efficiently converge to stable strategies, and significantly improve the network performance when compared with the benchmark algorithms such as the vanilla Q-learning and DDQN algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is one of the most remarkable inventions of the last 100 years. Much research has been invested in the development of this flying robot. The landing system is one of the more challenging aspects of this system&rsquo;s development. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become the preferred technique for landing system development, including reinforcement learning. However, current research is more focused is on system development based on image processing and advanced geometry. A novel calibration based on our previous research had been used to ameliorate the accuracy of the AprilTag pose estimation. With the help of advanced geometry from camera and range sensor data, a process known as Inverse Homography Range Camera Fusion (IHRCF), a pose estimation that outperforms our previous work, is now possible. The range sensor used here is a Time of Flight (ToF) sensor, but the algorithm can be used with any range sensor. First, images are captured by the image acquisition device, a monocular camera. Next, the corners of the landing landmark are detected through AprilTag detection algorithms (ATDA). The pixel correspondence between the image and the range sensor is then calculated via the calibration data. In the succeeding phase, the planar homography between the real-world locations of sensor data and their obtained pixel coordinates is calculated. In the next phase, the pixel coordinates of the AprilTag-detected four corners are transformed by inverse planar homography from pixel coordinates to world coordinates in the camera frame. Finally, knowing the world frame corner points of the AprilTag, rigid body transformation can be used to create the pose data. A CoppeliaSim simulation environment was used to evaluate the IHRCF algorithm, and the test was implemented in real-time Software-in-the-Loop (SIL). The IHRCF algorithm outperformed the AprilTag-only detection approach significantly in both translational and rotational terms. To conclude, the conventional landmark detection algorithm can be ameliorated by incorporating sensor fusion for cameras with lower radial distortion.},
