ABSTRACT = {Following striking developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, the use of UAVs has been researched in various industrial fields. Furthermore, a number of studies on operating multiple autonomous networking UAVs suggest a potential to use UAVs in large-scale environments. To achieve efficiency of performance in multi-UAV operations, it is essential to consider a variety of factors in UAV network conditions, such as energy efficiency, network overhead, and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that improves the energy efficiency and network throughputs by controlling the topology of the network. Our proposed network topology control scheme functions between the data link layer (L3) and the network layer (L2). Accordingly, it can be considered to be layer 2.5 in the network hierarchy model. In addition, our methodology includes swarm intelligence, meaning that whole topology control can be generated with less cost and effort, and without a centralized controller. Our experimental results confirm the notable performance of our proposed method compared to previous approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a novel type of swarm intelligence algorithm referred as the anas platyrhynchos optimizer is proposed by simulating the cluster action of the anas platyrhynchos. Starting from the core of swarm intelligence algorithm, on the premise of the use of few parameters and ease in implementation, the mathematical model and algorithm flow of the anas platyrhynchos optimizer are given, and the balance between global search and local development in the algorithm is ensured. The algorithm was applied to a benchmark function and a cooperative path planning solution for multi-UAVs as a means of testing the performance of the algorithm. The optimization results showed that the anas platyrhynchos optimizer is more superior in solving optimization problems compared with the mainstream intelligent algorithm. This study provides a new idea for solving more engineering problems.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown their superiority in military and civilian missions. In the face of complex tasks, many UAVs are usually needed to cooperate with each other. Therefore, multi-UAV cooperative target search has attracted more and more scholars’ attention. At present, there are many bionic algorithms for solving the cooperative search problem of multi-UAVs, including particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and differential evolution (DE). Pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm proposed in recent years. It has great advantages over other algorithms in convergence, robustness, and accuracy, and has few parameters to be adjusted. Aiming at the shortcomings of the standard pigeon colony algorithm, such as poor population diversity, slow convergence speed, and the ease of falling into local optimum, we have proposed chaotic disturbance pigeon-inspired optimization (CDPIO) algorithm. The improved tent chaotic map was used to initialize the population and increase the diversity of the population. The disturbance factor is introduced in the iterative update stage of the algorithm to generate new individuals, replace the individuals with poor performance, and carry out disturbance to increase the optimization accuracy. Benchmark functions and UAV target search model were used to test the algorithm performance. The results show that the CDPIO had faster convergence speed, better optimization precision, better robustness, and better performance than PIO.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of the demand of location awareness in a special complex environment, for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multi base-station semi-passive positioning system, the hybrid positioning solutions and optimized site layout in the positioning system can effectively improve the positioning accuracy for a specific region. In this paper, the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) formula of a time difference of arrival (TDOA) and angles of arrival (AOA) hybrid location algorithm is deduced. Mayfly optimization algorithm (MOA) which is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm is introduced, and a method to find the optimal station of the UAV airborne multiple base station’s semi-passive positioning system using MOA is proposed. The simulation and analysis of the optimization of the different number of base stations, compared with other station layout methods, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. MOA is less likely to fall into local optimum, and the error of regional target positioning is reduced. By simulating the deployment of four base stations and five base stations in various situations, MOA can achieve a better deployment effect. The dynamic station configuration capability of the multi-station semi-passive positioning system has been improved with the UAV.},
