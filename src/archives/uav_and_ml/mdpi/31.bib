ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based spraying systems have recently become important for the precision application of pesticides, using machine learning approaches. Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop a machine learning system that has the advantages of high computational speed and good accuracy for recognizing spray and non-spray areas for UAV-based sprayers. A machine learning system was developed by using the mutual subspace method (MSM) for images collected from a UAV. Two target lands: agricultural croplands and orchard areas, were considered in building two classifiers for distinguishing spray and non-spray areas. The field experiments were conducted in target areas to train and test the system by using a commercial UAV (DJI Phantom 3 Pro) with an onboard 4K camera. The images were collected from low (5 m) and high (15 m) altitudes for croplands and orchards, respectively. The recognition system was divided into offline and online systems. In the offline recognition system, 74.4% accuracy was obtained for the classifiers in recognizing spray and non-spray areas for croplands. In the case of orchards, the average classifier recognition accuracy of spray and non-spray areas was 77%. On the other hand, the online recognition system performance had an average accuracy of 65.1% for croplands, and 75.1% for orchards. The computational time for the online recognition system was minimal, with an average of 0.0031 s for classifier recognition. The developed machine learning system had an average recognition accuracy of 70%, which can be implemented in an autonomous UAV spray system for recognizing spray and non-spray areas for real-time applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Optimizing nitrogen (N) management in rice is crucial for China&rsquo;s food security and sustainable agricultural development. Nondestructive crop growth monitoring based on remote sensing technologies can accurately assess crop N status, which may be used to guide the in-season site-specific N recommendations. The fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing is a low-cost, easy-to-operate technology for collecting spectral reflectance imagery, an important data source for precision N management. The relationships between many vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spectral reflectance data and crop parameters are known to be nonlinear. As a result, nonlinear machine learning methods have the potential to improve the estimation accuracy. The objective of this study was to evaluate five different approaches for estimating rice (Oryza sativa L.) aboveground biomass (AGB), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI) at stem elongation (SE) and heading (HD) stages in Northeast China: (1) single VI (SVI); (2) stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR); (3) random forest (RF); (4) support vector machine (SVM); and (5) artificial neural networks (ANN) regression. The results indicated that machine learning methods improved the NNI estimation compared to VI-SLR and SMLR methods. The RF algorithm performed the best for estimating NNI (R2 = 0.94 (SE) and 0.96 (HD) for calibration and 0.61 (SE) and 0.79 (HD) for validation). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 0.09, and the relative errors were &lt;10% in all the models. It is concluded that the RF machine learning regression can significantly improve the estimation of rice N status using UAV remote sensing. The application machine learning methods offers a new opportunity to better use remote sensing data for monitoring crop growth conditions and guiding precision crop management. More studies are needed to further improve these machine learning-based models by combining both remote sensing data and other related soil, weather, and management information for applications in precision N and crop management.},

ABSTRACT = {What makes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) intelligent is their capability of sensing and understanding new unknown environments. Some studies utilize computer vision algorithms like Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) and Visual Odometry (VO) to sense the environment for pose estimation, obstacles avoidance and visual servoing. However, understanding the new environment (i.e., make the UAV recognize generic objects) is still an essential scientific problem that lacks a solution. Therefore, this paper takes a step to understand the items in an unknown environment. The aim of this research is to enable the UAV with basic understanding capability for a high-level UAV flock application in the future. Specially, firstly, the proposed understanding method combines machine learning and traditional algorithm to understand the unknown environment through RGB images; secondly, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection system is integrated (based on TensorFlow) in a smartphone to perceive the position and category of 80 classes of objects in the images; thirdly, the method makes the UAV more intelligent and liberates the operator from labor; fourthly, detection accuracy and latency in working condition are quantitatively evaluated, and properties of generality (can be used in various platforms), transportability (easily deployed from one platform to another) and scalability (easily updated and maintained) for UAV flocks are qualitatively discussed. The experiments suggest that the method has enough accuracy to recognize various objects with high computational speed, and excellent properties of generality, transportability and scalability.},

ABSTRACT = {The interactions between humans and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), whose applications are increasing in the civilian field rather than for military purposes, are a popular future research area. Human–UAV interactions are a challenging problem because UAVs move in a three-dimensional space. In this paper, we present an intelligent human–UAV interaction approach in real time based on machine learning using wearable gloves. The proposed approach offers scientific contributions such as a multi-mode command structure, machine-learning-based recognition, task scheduling algorithms, real-time usage, robust and effective use, and high accuracy rates. For this purpose, two wearable smart gloves working in real time were designed. The signal data obtained from the gloves were processed with machine-learning-based methods and classified multi-mode commands were included in the human–UAV interaction process via the interface according to the task scheduling algorithm to facilitate sequential and fast operation. The performance of the proposed approach was verified on a data set created using 25 different hand gestures from 20 different people. In a test using the proposed approach on 49,000 datapoints, process time performance of a few milliseconds was achieved with approximately 98 percent accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Since outdoor compost piles (OCPs) contain large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus, they act as a major pollutant that deteriorates water quality, such as eutrophication and green algae, when the OCPs enter the river during rainfall. In South Korea, OCPs are frequently used, but there is a limitation that a lot of manpower and budget are consumed to investigate the current situation, so it is necessary to efficiently investigate the OCPs. This study compared the accuracy of various machine learning techniques for the efficient detection and management of outdoor compost piles (OCPs), a non-point pollution source in agricultural areas in South Korea, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. RGB, multispectral, and thermal infrared UAV images were taken in August and October 2019. Additionally, vegetation indices (NDVI, NDRE, ENDVI, and GNDVI) and surface temperature were also considered. Four machine learning techniques, including support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and k-NN, were implemented, and the machine learning technique with the highest accuracy was identified by adjusting several variables. The accuracy of all machine learning techniques was very high, reaching values of up to 0.96. Particularly, the accuracy of the RF method with the number of estimators set to 10 was highest, reaching 0.989 in August and 0.987 in October. The proposed method allows for the prediction of OCP location and area over large regions, thereby foregoing the need for OCP field measurements. Therefore, our findings provide highly useful data for the improvement of OCP management strategies and water quality.},

ABSTRACT = {The need for civilian use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has drastically increased in recent years. Their potential applications for civilian use include door-to-door package delivery, law enforcement, first aid, and emergency services in urban areas, which put the UAVs into obstacle collision risk. Therefore, UAVs are required to be equipped with sensors so as to acquire Artificial Intelligence (AI) to avoid potential risks during mission execution. The AI comes with intensive training of an on-board machine that is responsible to autonomously navigate the UAV. The training enables the UAV to develop humanoid perception of the environment it is to be navigating in. During the mission, this perception detects and localizes objects in the environment. It is based on this AI that this work proposes a real-time three-dimensional (3D) path planner that maneuvers the UAV towards destination through obstacle-free path. The proposed path planner has a heuristic sense of A⋆ algorithm, but requires no frontier nodes to be stored in a memory unlike A⋆. The planner relies on relative locations of detected objects (obstacles) and determines collision-free paths. This path planner is light-weight and hence a fast guidance method for real-time purposes. Its performance efficiency is proved through rigorous Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulations in constrained-environment and preliminary real flight tests.},

ABSTRACT = {Management of nitrogen (N) fertilizers is an important agricultural practice and field of research to minimize environmental impacts and the cost of production. To apply N fertilizer at the right rate, time, and place depends on the crop type, desired yield, and field conditions. The objective of this study is to use Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery, vegetation indices (VI), crop height, field topographic metrics, and soil properties to predict canopy nitrogen weight (g/m2) of a corn field in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Random Forests (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) models were evaluated for canopy nitrogen weight prediction from 29 variables. RF consistently had better performance than SVR, and the top-performing validation model was RF using 15 selected height, spectral, and topographic variables with an R2 of 0.73 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.21 g/m2. Of the model’s 15 variables, crop height was the most important predictor, followed by 10 VIs, three MicaSense band reflectance mosaics (blue, red, and green), and topographic profile curvature. The model information can be used to improve field nitrogen prediction, leading to more effective and efficient N fertilizer management.},

ABSTRACT = {Determining maize water content variability is necessary for crop monitoring and in developing early warning systems to optimise agricultural production in smallholder farms. However, spatially explicit information on maize water content, particularly in Southern Africa, remains elementary due to the shortage of efficient and affordable primary sources of suitable spatial data at a local scale. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), equipped with light-weight multispectral sensors, provide spatially explicit, near-real-time information for determining the maize crop water status at farm scale. Therefore, this study evaluated the utility of UAV-derived multispectral imagery and machine learning techniques in estimating maize leaf water indicators: equivalent water thickness (EWT), fuel moisture content (FMC), and specific leaf area (SLA). The results illustrated that both NIR and red-edge derived spectral variables were critical in characterising the maize water indicators on smallholder farms. Furthermore, the best models for estimating EWT, FMC, and SLA were derived from the random forest regression (RFR) algorithm with an rRMSE of 3.13%, 1%, and 3.48%, respectively. Additionally, EWT and FMC yielded the highest predictive performance and were the most optimal indicators of maize leaf water content. The findings are critical towards developing a robust and spatially explicit monitoring framework of maize water status and serve as a proxy of crop health and the overall productivity of smallholder maize farms.},
