abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely used in various area coverage applications which require the monitoring and surveillance of systems with spatiotemporally varying variables or parameters. One important task in the implementation of WSNs for area coverage and monitoring purposes is the determination of the solution for the optimal coverage problem. This paper describes that the formulation of the area coverage problem can be modeled using Markov game modeling formalism whereas the optimal joint state-action policy for each agent which also takes into consideration the group objective can be computed using multi-agent Q-learning iterative processes using multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the proposed iterative learning-based area coverage solution approach.},

abstract={The choice of the transmitting frequency to provide cellular-connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) reliable connectivity and mobility support introduce several challenges. Conventional sub-6 GHz networks are optimized for ground Users (UEs). Operating at the millimeter Wave (mmWave) band would provide high-capacity but highly intermittent links. To reach the destination while minimizing a weighted function of traveling time and number of radio failures, we propose in this paper a UAV joint trajectory and band switch approach. By leveraging Double Deep Q-Learning we develop two different approaches to learn a trajectory besides managing the band switch. A first blind approach switches the band along the trajectory anytime the UAV-UE throughput is below a predefined threshold. In addition, we propose a smart approach for simultaneous learning-based path planning of UAV and band switch. The two approaches are compared with an optimal band switch strategy in terms of radio failure and band switches for different thresholds. Results reveal that the smart approach is able in a high threshold regime to reduce the number of radio failures and band switches while reaching the desired destination.},

abstract={In recent years, with the development and wide application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, the key technology of unmanned aerial vehicle network has become a new research focus. Compared with traditional networks, UAV networks have the characteristics of dynamic topology and limited energy. These characteristics have brought new challenges to the design and implementation of UAV communication systems. We need to redesign the organizational structure of the UAV network to reduce network power consumption, extend network operation time, and improve network stability. In this paper, we have studied the clustering of UAV networks and designed a clustering strategy. First, calculate the best number of clusters in the current network based on bandwidth balance, then use the K-means algorithm to quickly cluster the entire network, and finally implement a cluster head selection algorithm based on Deep Q-learning (DQN) in each cluster . We simulated the clustering strategy and analyzed the average link retention time, average cluster head retention time, network energy consumption, etc., which proved the efficiency and correctness of the algorithm proposed in this paper.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be an integral part of wireless networks, and determining collision-free trajectories in multi-UAV non-cooperative scenarios is a challenging task. In this paper, we consider a path planning optimization problem to maximize the collected data from multiple Internet of Things (IoT) nodes under realistic constraints. The considered multi-UAV non-cooperative scenarios involve random number of other UAVs in addition to the typical UAV, and UAVs do not communicate with each other. We translate the problem into an Markov decision process (MDP). Dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN) is proposed to learn the decision making policy for the typical UAV, without any prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., channel propagation model and locations of the obstacles) and other UAVs (e.g., their missions, movements, and policies). Numerical results demonstrate that real-time navigation can be efficiently performed with high success rate, high data collection rate, and low collision rate.},

pages={184-190},
abstract={In this paper, the intelligent resource allocation problem has been investigated for the ultra-dense network under harsh environments, e.g. battlefield, etc. Recently, Ultra-Dense Network (UDN) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted dynamic network have emerged as prominent solutions to overcome the challenges of fulfilling 5G/6G extremely high capacity density requirement. To stimulate the potential of the UAV-assisted ultra-dense network, designing effective resource allocation is critical and challenging. Hence, a novel joint beamforming and distributed power control algorithm have been developed that can optimize the UAV-assisted ultra-dense network effectively and further pave the way to benefit emerging complex systems such as the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT). Firstly, a novel hierarchical optimization framework is designed to reduce the optimization complexity in UAV-assisted ultra-dense network resource allocation by integrating beamforming for the base station as well as UAV relays (Upper Level) and distributed power control for multi-users (Lower Level) in ultra-dense network seamlessly. Then, a deep reinforcement learning technique has been developed along with dynamic codebook development to find the optimal beamforming strategy for upper level resource allocation optimization in the UAV-assisted ultra-dense network. After that, an actor-critic-mass reinforcement learning algorithm is developed with mean-field game to obtain the optimal distributed power control for multi-users in the lower level of UAV-assisted ultra-dense network. To better coordinate upper level and lower level resource allocation optimization, base station and UAV can sense and describe the ultra-dense network communication environment as a novel multi-area signal-to-interference-noise (SINR) probability density function (PDF) with the mean value of multi-area PDF being the desired SINR targets for wireless users in the corresponding area. This two-way interaction mechanism can allow agents in the two-level UAV-assisted ultra-dense network to dynamically collaborate with each other and further achieve the overall optimal solution. The effectiveness of the proposed design has been demonstrated through real-time simulation.},

abstract={In general, aerial mapping is an image registration problem, i.e., the problem of transforming different sets of images into one coordinate system. Aerial mapping is one of the important capability of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Here, the images processed by the registration system is strongly influenced by the quality of the image captured by the UAV. To select the image that will be processed efficiently is not easy considering the ground truth in the mapping process is not given before the UAV flies and captures the image. On the other hand, generally, UAV will fly and take the image in sequence regardless of the quality. These will result in several issues, such as: 1) the quality of mapping results becomes bad, and 2) the computational cost of registration process becomes high. To tackle such issues, therefore, we need a recognition system that is able to recognize images that should be excluded from the registration process. In this paper, we define such image as an “inclined image,” i.e., images captured by UAV not perpendicular with the ground. Although we can calculate the inclination angle using a gyroscope attached to the UAV, our interest here is to recognize the images without the use of such sensor like human do. To realize that, we utilize a deep learning method to build an inclined image recognition system. We tested our proposed system with images captured by UAV. The results showed that the proposed system yielded accuracy rate of 86.4%.},

abstract={In this paper, we exploit the deep learning based technologies to mitigate the impact of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jittering on wireless sensing performance. In recent years, UAV has been widely utilized for remote sensing applications due to its high flexibility and maneuverability. However, the mobility and vibration of the UAV's body may cause the jittering effect which can severely degrade the sensing performance. To our best knowledge, the impact of UAV jittering has not been fully examined in literature so far. To alleviate this problem, we propose to leverage adversarial denoising autoencoder (ADAE) for corrupted signal reconstruction. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, we consider a device-free human sensing scenario in which a UAV is used to sense surrounding human activity by analyzing the received signal strength (RSS). Experiments demonstrate that the proposed ADAE based scheme can effectively reduce the impact of UAV jittering, recovering up to 97% of the performance loss due to the UAV jittering.},

abstract={The rising number of technological advanced devices making network coverage planning very challenging tasks for network operators. The transmission quality between the transmitter and the end users has to be optimum for the best performance out of any device. Besides, the presence of coverage hole is also an ongoing issue for operators which cannot be ignored throughout the whole operational stage. Any coverage hole in network operators' coverage region will hamper the communication applications and degrade the reputation of the operator's services. Presently, there are techniques to detect coverage holes such as drive test or minimization of drive test. However, these approaches have many limitations. The extreme costs, outdated information about the radio environment and high time consumption do not allow to meet the requirement competently. To overcome these problems, we take advantage of Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Q-learning to autonomously detect coverage hole in a given area and then deploy UAV based base station (UAV-BS) by considering wireless back-haul with the core network and users demand. This machine learning mechanism will help the UAV to eliminate human-in-the-loop (HiTL) model. Later, we formulate an optimisation problem for 3D UAV-BS placement at various angular positions to maximise the number of users associated with the UAV-BS. In summary, we have illustrated a cost-effective as well as time saving approach of detecting coverage hole and providing on-demand coverage in this article.},

On the contrary, detecting objects in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images remains to be a difficult task in the field of computer vision, due to the challenge of training a well-performed detection model working on UAV images which usually contain instances with varied orientations, scales, and contours, etc. Furthermore, only a few researchers have focused on this field, probably because of difficulties in UAV data acquisition and labelling. Inspired by this, we collected a large-scale dataset with multi-scale and high-resolution UAV images, named MOHR, which contains 10,631 images captured by a UAV affixed with three kinds of cameras. Since these images were captured in a suburban environment, we manually annotated five classes of objects, including car, truck, building, collapse and flood damage. An empirical study was then conducted by adopting six advanced object detection methods all of which are based on deep learning technologies. The results indicate the great potential of these evaluated object detection models, but also reveal that the research on such a challenging UAV dataset using current deep learning techniques is far reaching.},

abstract={Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles are able to sense their surrounding environments, and fly safely with little or no human intervention. Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles are characterized by their ability to make decisions based on predicting future possible situations and learning from previous experiences. In this paper, we aim at developing algorithms that enable unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor and detect a dynamic uncertain target autonomously. This work considers a real monitoring system consists of a mission area, an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle, a charging station, and a dynamic uncertain target. The mission area consists of two main areas, which are the area where the charging station is placed and the area where the target moves. The target area is divided to a number of subareas. We also adopt a time slotted system that has M equal-duration slots. The unmanned aerial vehicle is equipped with a battery of finite energy that can be recharged from the charging station. It can fly from one subarea to another during one time slot. The target moves from one subarea to another according to an unknown Markov process. In this context, we propose to using reinforcement learning algorithms that enables autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles to learn the movement of a dynamic uncertain target autonomously. Simulation results show that reinforcement learning algorithms outperform the performance of random and circular algorithms.11This work was supported by the ASPIRE Award for Research Excellence Program 2020 (Abu Dhabi, UAE) under grant AARE20-161.},

To alleviate this, a deep learning based DOA estimation approach is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a complex-valued convolutional neural network (CCNN) is designed to fit the electromagnetic UAV signal with complex envelope better. In the CCNN design, we construct some mapping functions using quantum probabilities, and further analyze some factors which may impact the convergence of complex-valued neural networks. Numerical simulations show that the proposed CCNN converges faster than the real convolutional neural network, and the DOA estimation result is more accurate and robust.},

abstract={This paper considers Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where low resource IoT devices periodically sample a stochastic process and need to upload more recent information to a Base Station (BS). Among the myriad of applications, there is a need for timely delivery of data (for example, status-updates) before the data becomes outdated and loses its value. Since transmission capabilities of IoT devices are limited, it may not always be feasible to transmit over one hop transmission to the BS. To address this challenge, UAVs with virtual queues are deployed as middle layer between IoT devices and the BS to relay recent information over unreliable channels. In the absence of channel conditions, the optimal online scheduling policy is investigated as well as dynamic UAV altitude control that maintains a fresh status of information at the BS. The objective of this paper is to minimize the Expected Weighted Sum Age of Information (EWSA) for IoT devices. First, the problem is formulated as an optimization problem that is however generally hard to solve. Second, an online model free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is proposed, where the deployed UAV obtains instantaneous channel state information (CSI) in real time along with any adjustment to its deployment altitude. Third, we formulate the online problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is a highly stable state-of-the-art DRL algorithm, is leveraged to solve the formulated problem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify findings and comprehensive comparisons with other baseline approaches are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.},

abstract={Modeling signal power path loss (SPPL) for deployment of wireless communication systems (WCSs) is one of the most time consuming and expensive processes that require data collections during link budget analysis. Radio frequency (RF) engineers mainly employ either deterministic or stochastic approaches for the estimation of SPPL. In the case of stochastic approach, empirical propagation models use predefined estimation parameters for different environments such as reference distance path loss PL(d0)(dB), path loss exponent (n), and log-normal shadowing (Xσ with N(σ, μ = 0)). Since empirical models broadly classify the environment under urban, suburban, and rural area, they do not take into account every micro-variation on the terrain. Therefore, empirical models deviate significantly from actual measurements. This paper proposes a smart deployment method of WCS to minimize the need for predefined estimation parameters by creating a 3-D deployment environment which takes into account the micro-variations in the environment. Tree canopies are highly complex structures which create micro-variations and related unidentified path loss due to scattering and absorption. Thus, our proposed model will mainly focus on the effect of tree canopies and can be applied to any environment. The proposed model uses a 2-D image color classification to extract features from a 3-D point cloud and a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict SPPL. Empirical path loss models have received signal level (RSL) errors in the range of 6.29%-16.9% from the actual RSL measurements while the proposed model has an RSL error of 4.26%.},

abstract={Traffic surveillance using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV`s) has gained a lot of attraction in civilian applications and remote sensing tasks. Thanks to its high mobility and large field of view and ability to cover regions at different altitudes UAVs have made a mark in recent years for surveillance. The primary purpose of UAV in traffic surveillance is to monitor the daily activities in the busy traffic areas and report the abnormal activities which may take place. In recent years, many gated campuses such as educational institutions, organizations, shopping malls, etc. have taken steps to keep a track of vehicles trespassing within its vicinity. Vehicle counting is one of the monitoring tasks performed in surveillance to estimate the density of vehicles in an event or areas where traffic congestion is common. In this paper, a vehicle counting framework is proposed to eliminate the problem of redundant vehicle information count when a vehicle has appeared in successive frames of UAV videos. This work demonstrates that the comparison of concatenated three features vectors (Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Local Binary Pattern, and mean RGB value) can be used to recognize identical vehicles in UAV aerial videos.},

abstract={This paper investigates the distributed finite-time fault-tolerant containment control problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) in the presence of actuator faults and input saturation. The distributed finite-time sliding-mode observer (SMO) is first developed to estimate the reference for each follower UAV. Then, based on the estimated knowledge, the distributed finite-time fault-tolerant controller is recursively designed to guide all follower UAVs into the convex hull spanned by the trajectories of leader UAVs with the help of a new set of error variables. Moreover, the unknown nonlinearities inherent in the multi-UAVs system, computational burden, and input saturation are simultaneously handled by utilizing neural network (NN), minimum parameter learning of NN (MPLNN), first-order sliding-mode differentiator (FOSMD) techniques, and a group of auxiliary systems. Furthermore, the graph theory and Lyapunov stability analysis methods are adopted to guarantee that all follower UAVs can converge to the convex hull spanned by the leader UAVs even in the event of actuator faults. Finally, extensive comparative simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

The fault signal can be analyzed locally with wavelet packet entropy, then extract the feature vector, which is used to express the feature state of the UAV in different sensor faults. For the sack of the defects of the BP neural network algorithm, such as low convergence speed and easy to fall into the local minimum value, we update and optimize the weights and thresholds of the BP neural network by adaptive fireworks algorithm, which is based on the best fireworks individual analyzed by the immune concentration idea.

abstract={Brain-computer interface (BCI), an actively re-searched multi-disciplinary domain, has completely trans-formed the approach to robotic control problems. Researchers have focused on developing algorithms that optimize robotic movement to achieve desired trajectories, and it's a general understanding that route optimization problems are difficult to solve mathematically. Humans, on the other hand, tend to optimize their day-to-day activities intuitively. In order to achieve the desired results, the brain exploits a multi-level filtering approach, where the macro features are weighted in the first layer and the microfeatures in further layers. This optimization inside the brain interestingly, leave distinct traces in electroencephalography (EEG) plots. Based on the observations, we propose to use artificial neural networks to classify the EEG data, which intuitively should give a high classification rate, because the human brain also exploits a network of neurons to classify auditory (time-series) and visual (spatial) data. In this paper, we discuss the performances of 14- channel and 5-channel EEG headsets for robotic applications. Data is acquired from 20 subjects corresponding to four different tasks. Using neural nets, we have been successfully able to classify the EEG input into four different classes. We get an overall classification accuracy of 98.8% for 14-channel and 84.5% 5-channel system. As a real-time demonstration of the interface, the predicted class number is sent to a multi-rotor via a wireless link as an appropriate velocity command.},

number={},
pages={1-5},
abstract={Pose estimation is a core competence for cyber-physical systems and is all the more important where there is any element of autonomy. In the context of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) this task is more challenging due to weight and cost restrictions. These restrictions dictate that MAVs usually have noisy sensors and limited computational capacity. There are many different approaches to solving this problem but the standard approach is to use the Kalman Filter (KF) [1], or it's nonlinear variant the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) [2], in order to fuse sensor data and provide optimal estimates of state. While the KF is an optimal estimator of linear systems given some assumptions, most systems are non-linear so the EKF is used. In either case the estimates rely on assumptions that may not always hold. This allows room for improvement. This paper implements the newly proposed technique of Hybrid Inference (HI) [3] on a model of an MAV simulated in Gazebo [4] and explores its performance as compared to the EKF which is used as the standard. HI is a framework for combining graphical models, like the KF, with inverse models which are learned with a Recurrent Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) [5] [6]. This paper evaluates the technique in a more challenging domain than has previously been implemented. It explores the challenges of implementing the technique, analyses its computational performance and discusses its suitability for use at this time with a strong practical focus. The main findings are that it is too challenging to implement correctly to take full advantage of its proposed benefits. And that it is too computationally inefficient in its current form for it to be suitable for use in real time systems with current technology.},

abstract={Indonesia has a vast ocean with an abundance of fishes with its natural environments. Those abundances have to be conserved to prevent further destruction of the environment, which can result in the extinction of the surrounding living things. The government had deployed a vessel monitoring system, but illegal fishing still hardly been controlled. In this paper, toward conserving the fishes and especially the environment, we present a surveillance system framework from aerial images using drones technology. We develop a surveillance system using only visual information from the camera installed on the UAV and the design of the convolutional layer for accurate detection. Parameters are learned automatically without manually hand-tuned parameters because the learning process is pure from visual data that learned, so that makes the surveillance and investigation process easier. Experiment show relatively well that the proposed method successfully reaches Average Precision (AP)=75.03%, and hull plate classification reaches Average Matching Precision (AMP)=96.44%, and we believe it could bring many benefits for the ministry of fisheries and marine affairs Indonesia for identifying the illegal vessels and reduce the number of illegal fishing.},

abstract={Emerging applications of quadrotor vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles in various fields have created a need for demanding controllers that are able to counter several challenges, inter alia, nonlinearity, underactuated dynamics, lack of modeling, and uncertainties in the working environment. This study compares and contrasts type-1 and type-2 fuzzy neural networks (T2FNNs) for the trajectory tracking problem of quadrotor VTOL aircraft in terms of their tracking accuracy and control efforts. A realistic trajectory consisting of both straight lines and curvatures for a surveillance operation with minimum snap property, which is feasible regarding input constraints of the quadrotor, is generated to evaluate the proposed controllers. In order to imitate the outdoor noisy and time-varying working conditions, realistic uncertainties, such as wind and gust disturbances, are fed to the real-time experiment in the laboratory environment. Furthermore, a cost function based on the integral of the square of the sliding surface, which gives the optimal parameter update rules, is used to train the consequent part parameters of the T2FNN. Thanks to the learning capability of the proposed controllers, experimental results show the efficiency and efficacy of the learning algorithms that the proposed T2FNN-based controller with the optimal tuning algorithm is 50% superior to a conventional proportional-derivative (PD) controller in terms of control accuracy but requires more control effort. T2FNN structures are also shown to possess better noise reduction property as compared to their type-1 counterparts in the presence of unmodeled noise and disturbances.},

After the attack on World trade Center on 9th November 2001, Pentagon decided to launch fight against terrorism operations in Afghanistan. The operation started in Afghanistan in 2001 and then with the passage of time the scope of operation was increased to northwest part of Pakistan. Remarkable results have been achieved with this technology but there are also some disadvantages of this technology. The negative impact of using the drone technology is that civilians are also affected by the strikes. First drone attack happened in Waziristan in November 2004, which resulted in the killing of militant's commander, and his companions with civilians were martyred. To minimize the deaths of such local innocent civilians different predictive systems for finding the location and time of next drone strike have been created by the researchers.In this research paper we have designed a predictive system using neural network that how many civilians will be affected by the next drone strike. This system has been designed on the basis of the available data about the drone strikes in Pakistan. Realistic results have been achieved and we are hopeful that this system can save some innocent lives.},

abstract={Flying base stations (FlyBSs) enable ubiquitous communications in the next generation mobile networks with a flexible topology. However, a deployment of the FlyBSs intensifies interference, which can result in a degradation in the throughput of cell-edge users. In this paper, we introduce a flexible soft frequency reuse (F-SFR) that enables a self-organization of a common SFR in the networks with an unpredictable and dynamic topology with the FlyBSs. We propose a graph theory-based algorithm for an allocation of resource plans, which is understood as a bandwidth allocation and a transmission power setting in the context of SFR. Furthermore, we introduce a low-complexity implementation of the proposed resource allocation using deep neural network (DNN) to significantly reduce the computation complexity. We show that the proposed F-SFR increases the throughput of cell-edge users by 16% to 26% and, at the same time, improves the satisfaction of the cell-edge users by up to 25% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. We also demonstrate that the proposed scheme ensures a higher fairness in the throughput among the users with respect to the state-of-the-art solutions. The implementation via DNN also outperforms all state-of-the-art solutions despite its very low complexity.},

pages={5723-5736},
abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) reduces the computational distance between the source and the servers by fortifying near-user site evaluations of data for expedited communications, using caching. Caching provides ephemeral storage of data on designated servers for low-latency transmissions. However, with the network following a hierarchical layout, even the near-user site evaluations can be impacted by the overheads associated with maintaining a perpetual connection and other factors (e.g., those relating to the reliability of the underpinning network). Prior solutions study reliability as a factor of throughput, delays, jitters, or delivery ratio. However, with modern networks supporting high data rates, a current research trend is in ultrareliability. The latter is defined in terms of availability, connectivity, and survivability. Thus, in this paper, we focus on the ultrareliable communication in MEC. Specifically, in our setting, we use drones as on-demand nodes for efficient caching. While some existing solutions use cache-enabled drones, they generally focus only on the positioning problem rather than factors relating to ultrareliable communications. We present a novel neural-blockchain-based drone-caching approach, designed to ensure ultrareliability and provide a flat architecture (via blockchain). This neural-model fortifies an efficient transport mechanism, since blockchain maintains high reliability amongst the peers involved in the communications. The findings from the evaluation demonstrate that the proposed approach scores well in the following metrics: the probability of connectivity reaches 0.99; energy consumption is decreased by 60.34%; the maximum failure rate is affected by 13.0%; survivability is greater than 0.90; reliability reaches 1.0 even for a large set of users.},

abstract={Due to a growing number of people who carry out various adrenaline activities or adventure tourism and stay in the mountains and other inaccessible places, there is an increasing need to organize a search and rescue operation (SAR) to provide assistance and health care to the injured. The goal of SAR operation is to search the largest area of the territory in the shortest time possible and find a lost or injured person. Today, drones (UAVs or drones) are increasingly involved in search operations, as they can capture a large, controlled area in a short amount of time. However, a detailed examination of a large amount of recorded material remains a problem. Even for an expert, it is not easy to find searched people who are relatively small considering the area where they are, often sheltered by vegetation or merged with the ground and in unusual positions due to falls, injuries, or exhaustion. Therefore, the automatic detection of persons and objects in images/videos taken by drones in these operations is very significant. In this paper, the reliability of existing state-of-the-art detectors such as Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN on a VisDrone benchmark and custom-made dataset SARD build to simulate rescue scenes was investigated. After training the models on selected datasets, detection results were compared. Because of the high speed and accuracy and the small number of false detections, the YOLOv4 detector was chosen for further examination. YOLOv4 model results related to different network sizes, different detection accuracies, and transfer learning settings were analyzed. The model robustness to weather conditions and motion blur were also investigated. The paper proposes a model that can be used in SAR operations because of the excellent results in detecting people in search and rescue scenarios.},

abstract={The universal availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has resulted in many applications where the same make/model can be deployed by multiple parties. Thus, identifying a specific UAV in a given swarm, in a manner that cannot be spoofed by software methods, becomes important. We propose RF fingerprinting for this purpose, where a neural network learns subtle imperfections present in the transmitted waveform. For UAVs, the constant hovering motion raises a key challenge, which remains a fundamental problem in previous works on RF fingerprinting: Since the wireless channel changes constantly, the network trained with a previously collected dataset performs poorly on the test data. The main contribution of this paper is to address this problem by: (i) proposing a multi-classifier scheme with a two-step score-based aggregation method, (ii) using RF data augmentation to increase neural network robustness to hovering-induced variations, and (iii) extending the multi-classifier scheme for detecting a new UAV, not seen earlier during training. Importantly, our approach permits RF fingerprinting on manufacturer-proprietary waveforms that cannot be decoded or altered by the end-user. Results reveal a near two-fold accuracy in UAV classification through our multi-classifier method over the single-classifier case, with an overall accuracy of 95% when tested with data under unseen channel. Our multi-classifier scheme also improves new UAV detection accuracy to a near perfect 99%, up from 68% for a single neural network approach.},

abstract={In order to achieve the goal offormation maintenance, each Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) tracks the leader aircraft more accurately in formation. A UAV trajectory tracking control method based on Fuzzy Hyperbolic Model (FHM) is proposed to realize the purpose of UAV tracking the leader aircraft quickly and accurately in formation, combining with FHM and back propagation (BP) neural network algorithm. First of all, the dynamics model of single UAV is established, according to the principle of flight mechanics. Secondly, the FHM of UAV tracking leader aircraft was established, combining with the law of flight movement of leader aircraft and the fuzzy control principle. Then the neural network topology of FHM is constructed and the network parameter is identified by gradient descent method. Meanwhile, a UAV trajectory tracking controller based on FHM is designed, which is verified by simulation method. Finally, the simulation results can be seen: When UAV tracks the leader aircraft in a short distance, the convergence speed of control system is high, steady-state error is zero and control energy input is minimal. Therefore, each UAV in formation can track the leader aircraft quickly and accurately through this method, maintaining the same state of movement with the leader aircraft.},

abstract={In this work, we study the problem of efficiently generating dynamically-feasible trajectories for quadrotors in real-time. A supervised learning approach is used to train a simple neural network with two hidden layers. The training data is generated from a well-established trajectory generation method for quadrotors that minimizes jerk given a fixed time interval. More than a million dynamically-feasible trajectories between two random points in the three-dimensional (3D) space are generated and used as training data. The input of the neural network is a vector composed of initial and desired states, along with the final trajectory time. The output of the neural network generates the motion primitives of the trajectories, as well as the duration or final time of a segment. Simulation results show extremely fast generation of dynamically-feasible trajectories by the proposed learning algorithm, which makes it suitable for real-time implementation.},

abstract={Like any new technology, unmanned aerial vehicles are used not only for good purposes. Nowadays attackers adapted UAVs for drug delivery, transportation of explosives and surveillance. For this reason, UAV detection and classification are the significant problems for researchers of this area. Previous studies in the field of UAV classification have mostly focused on classifying UAV images as UAV and no UAV, or UAV and other flying objects, also classifying different UAV models. This paper proposes a deep residual convolutional neural network based classification of loaded and unloaded UAV images. As the depth of neural network increases it shows a large learning error. In this case it is relatively easy to optimize residual neural network. Also, ResNet makes it easy to increase accuracy by increasing depth, which is more difficult to achieve with other networks. This paper attempts to show that using ResNet-34 for classification of loaded and unloaded UAV images gives superior performance and acceptable accuracy.},

abstract={In disaster situations, collapse of local communication infrastructure is a major issue due to destruction of buildings, antennas, power sources, and to name a few. Drones, as flying base stations, are a promising solution to restore essential communication services in emergency situations. The contribution of this article is twofold: First, an efficient computer vision technique is proposed to identify areas with high density of low mobility or stationary users. This is done using a multistep process, which includes image acquisition, classification, and crowd density estimation. Next, an accurate mathematical model is presented for joint optimization of drone base stations placement and user assignment. The goal here is to maximize the number of serviced users with minimum number of drones, while satisfying practical network constraints. An optimal solution to such a biobjective optimization problem has complexity exponential to the network size. Furthermore, a low complexity heuristic is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Complexity analysis of the proposed solution is then carried out. Simulation results for a number of practical network scenarios demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a performance comparable to the optimal solution.},

abstract={Semantic segmentation of videos helps in scene understanding, thereby assisting in other automated video processing techniques like anomaly detection, object detection, event detection, etc. However, there has been limited study on semantic segmentation of videos acquired using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), primarily due to the absence of standard dataset. In this paper, a new UAV aerial video dataset (ManipalUAVid) for semantic segmentation is presented. The videos have been acquired in a closed university campus, and fine annotation is provided for four background classes viz. constructions, greeneries, roads, and waterbodies. Also, the performance of four semantic segmentation approaches: Conditional Random Field (CRF), U-Net, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and DeepLabV3+ are analysed on ManipalUAVid dataset. It is seen that these algorithms perform competitively on UAV aerial video dataset and achieves an mIoU of 0.86, 0.86, 0.86 and 0.83 respectively.},

abstract={On one hand, we are aware of the fact that quadrotors have been becoming a part of our daily life day to day; on the other hand, their control is still a challenging task as, unlike from the ground vehicles, they do not have enough friction forces to stabilize their motion. What is more, quadrotor's six DOF motion (three translational and three rotational) is controlled by varying only the speeds of its four independent rotors, resulting in under-actuated, highly nonlinear and coupled dynamics. In this paper, conventional proportional-derivative (PD), Mamdani-type fuzzy and TSK-type fuzzy neural network-based controllers have been designed, and their performance have been compared based on both control accuracy and control effort. A realistic trajectory, which is feasible regarding the input constraints of the quadrotor, is generated to test the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods. Realistic uncertainties, such as wind and gust conditions, are also given to the system to demonstrate the robustness of the controllers in real-time operation. The adaptive fuzzy-neural controller gives the most accurate trajectory tracking results for a 4D trajectory reducing the error by a factor of 4 when compared to the conventional PD and fuzzy controller although the control effort increases only by 10%.},

abstract={With the increasing volume of aerial videos, the demand for automatically parsing these videos is surging. To achieve this, current researches mainly focus on extracting a holistic feature with convolutions along both spatial and temporal dimensions. However, these methods are limited by small temporal receptive fields and cannot adequately capture long-term temporal dependencies which are important for describing complicated dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel two-pathway network to model not only holistic features, but also temporal relations for aerial video classification. More specially, our model employs a two-pathway architecture: (1) a holistic representation pathway to learn a general feature of frame appearances and short-term temporal variations and (2) a temporal relation pathway to capture multi-scale temporal relations across arbitrary frames, providing long-term temporal dependencies. Our model is evaluated on event recognition dataset, ERA, and achieves the state-of-the-art results. This demonstrates its effectiveness and good generalization capacity.},

It can take full advantage of reinforcement learning (RL) in sample-free learning. Facing the complex and unknown decision-making environment, the SAC algorithm can make the UAV continuously summarize experience in the process of interacting with the environment and make the best strategic choice.

abstract={The cache-enabling unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cellular networks with massive access capability supported by non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are investigated in this paper. The delivery of multi-media contents for the mixed augmented reality (AR) and normal multi-media application is assisted by multiple mobile UAV base stations, which cache popular contents for wireless backhaul link traffic offloading. To cope with the dynamic content requests and mobility of users in practical scenarios, the dynamic optimization problem for user association, caching placement of UAVs, real-time deployment of UAVs, and power allocation of NOMA is modeled as a stackelberg game to minimize the long-term content delivery delay. Specifically, the game is decomposed into a leader level problem and a number of follower level problems. A correction mechanism is added in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize the user association in leader level. A meta actor network is proposed in DRL to jointly optimize the UAVs caching placement, real-time UAVs deployment and power allocation of NOMA in follower level. Then, a dynamic caching placement and resource allocation algorithm based on multi-agent meta deep reinforcement learning is proposed to minimize the long-term content delivery delay. Finally, we demonstrate that the considerable gains are achieved by the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={Advances in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) design and capability, as well as decreases in the manufacturing cost, have opened up applications of UAVs in various fields, including surveillance, firefighting, cellular networks, and delivery purposes. The uniqueness of UAVs in systems creates a novel set of trajectory or path planning and coordination problems. Environments include many more points of interest (POIs) than UAVs, with obstacles and no-fly zones. We introduce REPlanner, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm inspired by economic transactions to distribute tasks among UAVs. This system revolves around an economic theory, in particular an auction mechanism where UAVs trade assigned POIs. We formulate the path planning problem as a multi-agent economic game, where agents can cooperate and compete for resources. We then translate the problem into a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is solved using a reinforcement learning (RL) model deployed on each agent. As the system computes task distributions via UAV cooperation, it is highly resilient to any change in the swarm size. Our proposed network and economic game architecture can effectively coordinate the swarm as an emergent phenomenon while maintaining the swarm’s operation. Evaluation results prove that REPlanner efficiently outperforms conventional RL-based trajectory search.},

By modeling UAVs as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, we propose a novel framework to deploy UAVs in 3D space to maximize the network utility. Then utilizing tools from stochastic geometry, we model the locations of UAVs as binomial point process (BPP) and derive exact expressions of coverage probability for directional antennas and omnidirectional antennas equipped UAVs. The expressions are functions of UAVs' altitudes and sector angles. The analysis is meaningful for setting UAVs' altitude and sector angle of directional antennas. Simulation results show that 3D deployment of UAVs achieves a remarkable system performance and the analysis provides useful performance trends.},

abstract={Fifth Generation (5G) cellular networks are expected to provide cellular connectivity for vehicular users, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). When flying in the air, these users experience strong, unobstructed channel conditions to a large number of Base Stations (BSs) on the ground. This creates very strong interference conditions for the UAV users, while at the same time offering them a large number of BSs to potentially associate with for cellular service. Therefore, to maximise the performance of the UAV-BS wireless link, the UAV user needs to be able to choose which BSs to connect to, based on the observed environmental conditions. This paper proposes a supervised learning-based association scheme, using which a UAV can intelligently associate with the most appropriate BS. We train a Neural Network (NN) to identify the most suitable BS from several candidate BSs, based on the received signal powers from the BSs, known distances to the BSs, as well as the known locations of potential interferers. We then compare the performance of the NN-based association scheme against strongest-signal and closest-neighbour association schemes, and demonstrate that the NN scheme significantly outperforms the simple heuristic schemes.},

Our proposed method uses a data driven algorithm, SVM, in order to classify the behavior of the vehicle in nominal flight phase and faulty phase. Feasibility of a basic binary classification is shown, despite the well-known over-fitting problem caused by limited data. We have shown that geometrical imperfections that are common in small UAVs can cause particular effects on the prediction performance, and we used it in our advantage to improve the detection on multi-class classification. The SVM algorithm with proposed feature trajectories was capable to detect variation of loss of control effectiveness faults up to an accuracy of 95% in real flights.

abstract={The bird's nest on the transmission line tower has a bad impact on the transmission equipment, and even threaten the safe and stable operation of the power grid. In recent years, the number of bird pest in transmission line is increasing year by year, resulting in increasing economic losses. The traditional bird's nest identification method of transmission line is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and its security level is low. Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic detection method of bird's nest on transmission line tower based on Faster_RCNN convolution neural network. This method can automatically identify the location of the bird's nest on the transmission line tower by using the image collected by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The problem of insufficient training samples and overfitting of neural network classifier is solved by enlarging the bird's nest image. The experimental results show that this method can effectively detect bird's nest targets in complex environment, and the highest recall rate can reach 95.38%, the highest F1 score can reach 96.87%, and the detection time of each image can reach 0.154s. Compared with the traditional nest detection method, this method has stronger applicability and generalization ability. It provides technical support for analyzing bird activities and taking effective preventive measures.},

Subsequently, the mean of spectral bands and twelve vegetation indices were calculated to characterize each segment. To classify tree canopies into dead and healthy trees, supervised machine learning using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied. The overall accuracy of Random Forests was 98.35% and Support Vector Machine of 97.7%. We concluded that SVM did not perform better than RF.

The present study describes a methodology for the detection and characterization of Nitrogen (N) deficiencies in corn fields. Current methods of field surveillance are either completed manually or with the assistance of satellite imaging, which offer infrequent and costly information to the farmers about the state of their fields. The proposed methodology promotes the use of small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Computer Vision algorithms that operate with information in the visual (RGB) spectrum. Through this implementation, a lower cost solution for identifying N deficiencies is promoted. We provide extensive results on the use of commercial RGB sensors for delivering the essential information to farmers regarding the condition of their field, targeting the reduction of N fertilizers and the increase of the crop performance. Data is first collected by a UAV that hovers over a stressed area and collects high resolution RGB images at a low altitude. A recommendation algorithm identifies potential segments of the images that are candidates exhibiting N deficiency. Based on the feedback from experts in the area a training set is constructed utilizing the initial suggestions of the recommendation algorithm. Supervised learning methods are then used to characterize crop leaves that exhibit signs of N deficiency. The performance of 84.2% strongly supports the potential of this scheme to identify N-deficient leaves even in the case of images where the unhealthy leaves are heavily occluded by other healthy or stressed leaves.},

abstract={The aim of this project is to introduce new-fangled way to control Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using electromyography (EMG) signal. Electromyography signals are biopotential signals that are generated when any muscular action takes place in a person's body. The idea is to provide a novel method of controlling drones, and other remote-controlled objects by recognizing hand gestures using EMG Signals. This paper presents a controller designed that can be easily fitted to a band on the user's arm. It is composed by inertial (gyroscope, accelerometer) and electromyographic sensors, that will measure the muscle movements and construe them in references for the drone. Gesture recognition is achieved using an Artificial Neural Network to fully exploit the capabilities of both, the user and UAV - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. UAV chosen to test with the controller is a quadcopter. The comparative results show the compactness and easy-to-handle interface that allows even inexperienced users, to intuitively have control over remote-controlled objects as compared to a standard remote controller.},

abstract={A Public Safety Network (PSN) is an essential element of the Emergency Management System (EMS) for any country to deal with natural or man-made disasters. PSN is an information and communication infrastructure that assists managing first responders during incident operations. In this article we propose a model of computation and communication that could represent a future alternative public safety network. Our concept is based on the integration of emerging technologies like Fog/Edge Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and FirstNet network partly in operation in the United States. Our model proposes a synergy between these technologies and forms a platform for highly qualified people (HQP) in training to develop and experiment with their research work. As the technology is similar to that in actual operation, any research results may be more easily adopted by PSNs in actual operations. Mobile edge devices like smart phones, dones, robots, and aerial platforms form part of deployed devices. These are interconnected via gateways to the Internet for providing useful information to incident command centers where managers can make timely decisions. Our model is implemented using off-the-shelf devices both for computing and communication tasks.},

abstract={This letter proposes a neural network (NN) aided remote unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) online control algorithm, coined oHJB. By downloading a UAV's state, a base station (BS) trains an HJB NN that solves the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) in real time, yielding a sub-optimal control action. Initially, the BS uploads this control action to the UAV. If the HJB NN is sufficiently trained and the UAV is far away, the BS uploads the HJB NN model, enabling to locally carry out control decisions even when the connection is lost. Simulations corroborate the effectiveness of oHJB in reducing the UAV's travel time and energy by utilizing the trade-off between uploading delays and control robustness in poor channel conditions.},

abstract={It has always been difficult to accurately estimate the moment of inertia of an object, e.g. an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Whilst various offline estimation methods exist to allow accurate parametric estimation by minimizing an error cost function, they require large memory consumption, high computational effort, and a long convergence time. The initial estimate's accuracy is also vital in attaining convergence. In this paper, a new real time solution to the model identification problem is provided with the use of a Joint Unscented Kalman Filter for dual estimation. The identification procedures can be easily implemented using a microcontroller, a gyroscope sensor, and a simple bifilar pendulum setup. Accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed are achieved.},

abstract={This paper presents the application of computer vision and machine learning to autonomous approach and landing and taxiing for an air vehicle. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). We present a system and method that uses pattern recognition which aids the landing of a UAS and enhances the human-crewed air vehicle landing. Auto-landing systems based on the Instrument Landing System (ILS) have already proven their importance through decades. The auto-land systems work in conjunction with a radio altimeter, ILS, MLS, or GNSS. Closer to the runway, both under VFR and IFR, pilots are expected to rely on visual references for landing. Modern systems like HUD or CVS allow a trained pilot to manually fly the aircraft using guidance cues from the flight guidance system.Notwithstanding the type of landing and instruments used, typically, Pilots are expected to have the runway threshold markings, aiming point, displacement arrows, and touch down markings/lights insight before Minimum Decision Altitude (MDA). Imaging sensors are the essential standard equipment in crewed and crewless aerial vehicles that are widely used during the landing maneuver. In this method, a dataset of visual objects from satellite images is subjected to pattern recognition training. This trained system learns and then identifies and locates important visual references from imaging sensors and could help in landing and taxiing.},

After experimenting on a dataset generated from Corona discharge videos, our results suggest that of the supervised learning algorithms taken into consideration those based on Radial-Basis approaches are the most effective in classifying the information being fed to it.

abstract={Aerial drones can be used for a number of monitoring and control applications. Most of existing drone control platforms are quite primitive in terms of body-machine interface. They are usually a variation of a hand-held remote controller or ground control station. However, in a number of line-of-sight scenarios it would be more convenient to use the human gestures and voice for the drone control. In this work, we present an approach for instantaneous control of drones based on human voice and gestures. The proposed solution includes wearable sensors and embedded artificial intelligence. We use a microphone and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for capturing the human voice and the hand movements. Primary control is implemented by a voice recognition unit based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) while the secondary control is implemented by the gesture recognition system based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For implementing the embedded intelligence, we use a low-power embedded system with a graphical processing unit able to run pre-trained neural networks on board of the drone. As a result, the system can perform different speech and gesture recognition tasks real-time.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have received a huge interest in military and civil applications. Applications of UAS are dependent on successful communications of these systems with different entities in their networks. A UAS network can include the UAS, ground control station, navigation satellite system, and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) receiver. Through these entities, a UAS is vulnerable to different cyber-attacks such as GPS spoofing. In this attack, a malicious user transmits fake signals to the GPS receiver on the UAS. The fake signals can mislead not only the aircraft but also air traffic controllers, leading to serious problems. These problems range from aircraft hijacking to collisions and human casualties. This paper proposes a supervised machine learning method based on the artificial neural network to detect GPS spoofing signals. Different features such as pseudo range, Doppler shift, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are used to perform the classification of GPS signals. We examine and compare the efficiency of one-and two-hidden-layer neural networks with various numbers of hidden neurons. The results show that our proposed method provides a high probability of detection and a low probability of false alarm.},

Stationary and strong spatial correlation of the aerial channels allow for exploiting predictive techniques for optimal cell selection based on few available neighboring observations. Yet, drastic cell quality changes due to the side lobes of base-station antenna patterns require advanced solutions for accurate prediction. In this paper, we propose a conditional random field based framework to predict a drone's best (or top few) candidates for the serving cell. Our results, assuming realistic antenna patterns as well as errors in the location estimates, show a high prediction accuracy, thereby illustrating the feasibility of exploiting learning approaches to predict the aerial channel environment.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel concept of three-dimensional (3D) cellular networks, that integrate drone base stations (drone-BS) and cellular-connected drone users (drone-UEs), is introduced. For this new 3D cellular architecture, a novel framework for network planning for drone-BSs and latency-minimal cell association for drone-UEs is proposed. For network planning, a tractable method for drone-BSs' deployment based on the notion of truncated octahedron shapes is proposed, which ensures full coverage for a given space with a minimum number of drone-BSs. In addition, to characterize frequency planning in such 3D wireless networks, an analytical expression for the feasible integer frequency reuse factors is derived. Subsequently, an optimal 3D cell association scheme is developed for which the drone-UEs' latency, considering transmission, computation, and backhaul delays, is minimized. To this end, first, the spatial distribution of the drone-UEs is estimated using a kernel density estimation method, and the parameters of the estimator are obtained using a cross-validation method. Then, according to the spatial distribution of drone-UEs and the locations of drone-BSs, the latency-minimal 3D cell association for drone-UEs is derived by exploiting tools from an optimal transport theory. The simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the latency of drone-UEs compared with the classical cell association approach that uses a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion. In particular, the proposed approach yields a reduction of up to 46% in the average latency compared with the SINR-based association. The results also show that the proposed latency-optimal cell association improves the spectral efficiency of a 3D wireless cellular network of drones.},

abstract={As UAVs become increasingly autonomous with decreased physical size, it will become more difficult for human operators to perform a demanding job with many challenges. These challenges include keeping track of UAVs in low-level airspace while considering the psychological state of the operators. The main objective of the operator is to eliminate the high risk of UAV collisions with each other or with unexpected obstacles while in flight. By using AI, the operators psychological state can be assessed in a non-intrusive manner, while equipping the system with the capability to take over and activate the teleoperated mode. In particular, affective computing sensing can aid the user in the teleoperated mode when combined with a particular control technique. A control technique is proposed on the basis of sensory measurements for adjusting the velocity and direction, therefore averting obstacle collisions. Ultrasound sensors are used to provide more real-time local data, however, these sensors can be vulnerable to missing data. To mitigate the issue of sensors with missing data, GANs can generate synthetic values that can be used in an AI-based prediction algorithm to direct the UAV on a path. In this paper, real-time data is collected through on-board Ultrasound sensors mounted on a commercial UAV. The collected data is reported to the edge server where the GAN is implemented along with the ML algorithm to predict the path. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with an accuracy of more than 96.96%.},

abstract={Radio maps that characterize the air-to-ground communication channels play an important role in optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Constructing a radio map is very challenging because a city may have a complicated building and vegetation topology that affects the air-to-ground radio propagation. Existing methods usually require a large amount of measurement data for training. This paper focuses on small sample regime. A learning framework is developed to decompose the radio map into a structural component, which predicts the path loss via constructing a hidden virtual obstacle map, and a non-structural component, which captures the random scattering due to signal reflection and diffraction. It is found that constructing a virtual obstacle map with dynamic resolution improves the learning efficiency. This paper develops a simple grouping method that locally adjusts the map resolution according to the sample density and side information from a 2D street map. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing schemes in small to large sample regimes.},

We also add Receptive Field Block after each predicted feature to increase the receptive field. We have changed the values of parameters in the loss function for better detection performance. The improved model effectively increases the detection rate of small targets so that it can be applied to pedestrian detection under UAV.

abstract={Engineering vehicles on construction sites mainly include excavators, wheeled cranes and so on. If the engineering vehicle is working under or near the high-voltage power line, its bucket or boom probably enter the high-voltage breakdown range when they are lifted, which is very easy to result in accidents such as short circuit breakdown. So, it is necessary to find out the engineering vehicles working near high-voltage power line during inspection. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection is one of the main methods of electric power inspection at present. Lots of images are produced by UAV during the power line inspection. It will save a lot of inspection work if the engineering vehicles working near high-voltage power line can be recognized from these images. First, this paper analyzes the specific requirements of engineering vehicle recognition from aerial images of UAV power line inspection. Then, based on the research status of vehicle recognition in aerial images and other related fields at domestic and abroad, this paper comprehensively analyzes the research status of classical pattern recognition method and deep neural network method to recognize engineering vehicles in aerial images of UAV. Third, in view of the practical problems such as the low aerial image data of engineering vehicles, the roadmap of recognizing the engineering vehicles in the aerial image of UAV using the capsule network method is designed.},

abstract={Insulator fault recognition is a common hidden danger that affects the normal operation of the power system. In recent years, UAV aerial images have been widely used to identify defects in insulators. In order to solve the problem of low efficiency caused by manual inspection and traditional image defect detection methods, this paper proposed a modified Faster R-CNN model to improve the accuracy of model detection and reduce the amount of model parameters. Based on the traditional Faster R-CNN detection framework, the proposed method selected ResNet- 50 to replace VGGNet-16 as the feature extraction networks. The database used 781 labeled UAV aerial insulator images, and they are divided into training set, validation set and test set according to the ratio of 6:2:2. The mAP of the modified feature network model reached 62.41%, and the network model parameter size was 25.26M. Compared with the original framework with VGGNet-16 as the feature network, the mAP increased by 3.43% and the parameter amount was compressed by 4.41 times. The results show that the improved algorithm reduces the missed detection rate and false detection rate, and on the basis of improving the recognition accuracy, it can greatly reduce the amount of network parameters. And it can better meet the needs of lightweight network structure in actual scenarios.},

Our algorithm relies on samples of signal strength collected across the prediction space and a 3D map of the environment, which enables it to predict the scattering of radio waves through the environment. While already extensive body of research exists in spatial signal strength prediction, our approach differs from most existing approaches in that it does not require the knowledge of the transmitter location, it does not require side channel information such as attenuation and shadowing parameters, and it is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, to use 3D maps to accomplish the task of signal strength prediction.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the communication-oriented unmanned air vehicle (UAV) placement issue in a typical manned-and-unmanned (MUM) airborne network. The MUM network consists of a few powerful aircraft nodes in the higher layer and high-density UAVs in the lower layer. While the aircraft network is relatively stable, the UAVs can form different swarm network topologies. Some UAVs are selected as gateway nodes to aggregate the received UAV data and send to a nearby aircraft which acts as a control node for the UAVs in a swarm. Assume a source UAV has data to be sent to its gateway node by using a route which may have broken links. Our goal is to guide the position of one or more relay UAVs to make up for the broken wireless links under the dynamic swarm topology. The placement of the relay node is determined by both traffic quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and the link conditions. We design a new queueing model, called multi-hop priority queue, to analyze the achievable QoS performance through multi-hop queue-to-queue accumulation modeling. To handle dynamic swarm topology and time-varying link conditions, we design a deep Q-learning (DQN) model to determine the optimal link between two UAV nodes, and then use an optimization algorithm to locally fine-tune the position of the UAV node to optimize the overall network performance.

abstract={Monitoring air pollution plumes in emergency situations (industrial accidents, natural disasters, deliberate terrorist releases, etc.) becomes an issue of utmost importance in our society given the dramatic effects that the released pollutants can cause. Considering these situations, the pollution plume is strongly dynamic leading to a fast dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere. Thus, the need for real-time response is very strong and a solution to get precise mapping of pollution dispersion is required to mitigate risks. However, monitoring and forecasting air quality in real time in such situations remains a highly challenging endeavour. In this paper, we suggest a systemic approach for monitoring dynamic air pollution based on aerial sensing (sensors mounted on UAVs). The proposed framework consists of a cycle with feedback loop which will constantly combine a spatio-temporal forecasting model based on a convolutional long short term memory (ConvLSTM) network with a data assimilation technique to get accurate pollution maps, while adjusting at each time the trajectories of drones following uncertainty forecasts. Our solution was evaluated and validated using a highly dynamic real world data set namely Fusion Field Trial 2007 (FFT07). The proposed strategy, together with the obtained evaluation results, are presented, and carefully analyzed.},

abstract={With their rapid technological developments, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and micro UAVs have become a significant threat for homeland security and air defense systems. In air defense applications, classification of UAVs and discrimination of UAV tracks from non-UAV ones have become necessary. The classification of UAVs in the presence of heavy spatio-temporally varying radar clutter and interference across rural and urban areas, or under different weather conditions such as rain or snow is particularly challenging. In this paper, a classification method for UAV vs. non-UAV target discrimination, and micro-UAV classification using kinematic and Radio Frequency (RF) characteristics is proposed. For three different classes, namely, micro UAV-1, micro UAV-2 and non-UAV, various classifier architectures are implemented and the results based on real radar data are presented.},

abstract={Due to Wildfire’s huge destructive impacts on agriculture and food production, wildlife habitat, climate, human life and ecosystem, timely discovery of fires enable swift response to fires before they go out of control, in order to minimize the resulting damage and impacts. One of the emerging technologies for fire monitoring is deploying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, due to their high flexibility and maneuverability, less human risk, and on-demand high quality imaging capabilities. In order to realize a real-time system for fire detection and expansion analysis, fast and high-accuracy image-processing algorithms are required. Several studies have shown that deep learning methods can provide the most accurate response, however the training time can be prohibitively long, especially when using online learning for constant refinement of the developed model. Another challenge is the lack of large datasets for training a deep learning algorithm. In this respect, we propose to use a pretrained mobileNetV2 architecture to implement transfer learning, which requires a smaller dataset and reduces the computational complexity while not compromising the accuracy. In addition, we conduct an effective data augmentation pipeline to simulate some extreme scenarios, which could promise the robustness of our approach. The testing results illustrate that our method maintains a high identification accuracy in different situations - original dataset (99.7%), adding Gaussian blurred (95.3%), and additive Gaussian noise (99.3%) 1 2},

abstract={The first thing to do by the search-and-rescue (SAR) team after the disaster occurred is to find the location of the victim quickly. Thus the loss of lives can be reduced. After the disaster, the environment usually very messy, containing debris from building, soil, and gravel, which makes it harder to find the victims. By detecting the temperature using a thermal camera, it can easily be distinguished between the victims and the other background. Previous work, the technology to detect a person using a thermal camera from aerial has been developed, but it is only working with the most nearly uniform background. In this paper, we developed an automatic aerial (drones) victim detection using a thermal camera. A low-cost thermal camera has been used so that anyone can quickly implement in the real situation. By combining CNN as its algorithm that widely uses for its excellent performance on object detection, it can easily detect victims from the low-cost thermal camera and distinguished from complex background. Experiments show very well that the proposed method able to detect victims from aerial thermal view with accuracy AP = 82.49%. We believe it could bring benefits for future work with the related field and able to help search-and-rescue team to find and evacuate the victims quickly.},

abstract={This paper proposes two novel deep learning models for 2D and 3D classification of objects in extremely low-resolution time-of-flight imagery. The models have been developed to suit contemporary range imaging hardware based on a recently fabricated Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) camera with 64 χ 64 pixel resolution. Being the first prototype of its kind, only a small data set has been collected so far which makes it challenging for training models. To bypass this hurdle, transfer learning is applied to the widely used VGG-16 convolutional neural network (CNN), with supplementary layers added specifically to handle SPAD data. This classifier and the renowned Faster-RCNN detector offer benchmark models for comparison to a newly created 3D CNN operating on time-of-flight data acquired by the SPAD sensor. Another contribution of this work is the proposed shot noise removal algorithm which is particularly useful to mitigate the camera sensitivity in situations of excessive lighting. Models have been tested in both low-light indoor settings and outdoor daytime conditions, on eight objects exhibiting small physical dimensions, low reflectivity, featureless structures and located at ranges from 25m to 700m. Despite antagonist factors, the proposed 2D model has achieved 95% average precision and recall, with higher accuracy for the 3D model.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has overwhelming superiority on the completion of difficult missions in the industrial production or implementation scenarios. Its brilliant navigation and on-board perception abilities endow the aerial platform a considerable potential in the industrial applications. Since manipulation stability and computational capacity of UAVs are crucial for industrial missions, it is challenging to develop a reliable and safe UAV platform for indoor industrial operation. Focusing on the measurement of industrial-standard gauges, we propose a vision algorithm which is capable of fast detecting the industrial-standard gauges and the readings and integrate the algorithm into a quadrotor drone platform with indoor and outdoor navigation. In our work, we demonstrate how to improve the simplicity and efficiency of the UAV-based visual recognition by implementing and adjusting a YOLO v3 framework with Darknet [1]. Moreover, our vision algorithm is combined with the image geometric correction module and the gauge detecting and reading module to overcome the detection problems caused by the harsh industrial conditions, such as an obscure image and the under-exposure condition. And the results show that accuracy of detection in the experimentation is sufficient for industrial missions.},

abstract={Reliable detection and tracking is required to ensure that drones are safely integrated into low altitude airspace. Radar provides a 24-hour, all-weather solution to this problem. However, the radar signatures of birds have a similar RCS to those of drones, thus a robust method of classification is needed to filter out non-drone targets and eliminate, or at least minimize to an acceptable level, false alarms. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to achieve high classification performance but results are only reported for high signal to noise ratio data -a luxury that is not always available to operational radar systems. In this paper, Gaussian noise is added to the test data to vary the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in order to investigate classifier robustness as a function of SNR in the context of drone classification. The performance of six CNN architectures previously established for computer vision applications are exploited and compared with each other to assess classification performance and robustness with network depth.},

abstract={It is one of the significant tasks of power inspection by multi rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to recognize engineering vehicles in aerial images. If there are engineering vehicles working near or below the high-voltage power line, the UAV would give out the important early warning message to avoid the situation that the bucket or boom of the engineering vehicle enters the safe distance from the high-voltage power line, and reduce accidents such as short circuit breakdown. Aiming at the problem of recognition of engineering vehicles in aerial images of UAV inspection, this paper proposed an improved capsule network method. First, the structure of original capsule network is replaced with a multi-layer densely connected capsule network. Next, the dynamic routing algorithm of the capsule network is improved. As the results of experiments have shown, (1) the improved capsule network method gets a mAP of 93.74% for the recognition of engineering vehicles, and its parameter scale is smaller than other methods. (2) The number of network layers influences the recognition precision greatly. Their relationship is non-monotonic and nonlinear. In addition, whether or not to improve the dynamic routing algorithm does not affect the trends of recognition mAP. The overall performance of the improved capsule network method is obviously better than YOLOv5 and other artificial feature extraction methods.},

We propose a deep $Q$ network (DQN)-based secure transmission scheme which jointly optimizes the jamming power of secondary receiver (SR) and the deployment of UAV to maximize secrecy rate. Due to the nonconvex nature of the formulated problem, we decompose it into two-layer sub-problems where the inner layer is to optimize the jamming power while the outer layer is to design the deployment of the UAV. A bi-section search algorithm is developed to solve the inner layer jamming sub-problem and a deep $Q$-learning algorithm is designed to approximate the optimal UAV deployment as the outer problem. Finally, numeric simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance superiorities of our proposal in terms of secrecy rate as compared with the baselines.},

abstract={High-precision electronic maps are required to provide more detailed and accurate information than traditional maps. With the rapid development of high-resolution remote sensing technology, it has become possible to extract fine-grained road scene information such as vehicles, road lines, zebra crossings, ground signs, and lane widths of roads from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images, which opens up opportunities for automatic mapping high-precision maps. The traditional method of deciphering remote sensing images is often obtained through manual visual interpretation. Due to the high cost and long lead time of this method, it leads to inefficiencies in updating large amounts of information. To address this problem, this letter models the fine-grained road scene understanding task as an image semantic segmentation problem and innovatively proposes a semisupervised fully convolutional neural network to extract the information efficiently at a low cost. Compared with the traditional supervised full convolutional neural network, this method can simultaneously optimize the standard supervised classification loss on labeled samples and the unsupervised consistency loss on unlabeled samples by using an integrated prediction technology and then input them to the end-to-end semantic segmentation network for training. This method is designed to effectively improve the classification accuracy of the semantic segmentation network and validly alleviates overfitting problems in the case of small numbers of labeled samples. In order to verify the effectiveness of this method, we constructed a data set for experimental, which is used to verify the effect of a variable number of unlabeled samples on model performance. Experimental results show that our method can efficiently complete the extraction of fine-grained road scene information such as vehicles, road lines, zebra crossings, ground signs, and lane widths of roads with a small number of labeled samples.},

abstract={The object detection in UAV application is a challenging task due to the diversity of target scales, variation of views, and complex backgrounds. To solve several challenges, including dense objects, objects with arbitrary orientation, and diversity of aspect ratios, this article proposes an end-to-end object detection method based on the convolutional neural network. In this article, the feature extraction performance is enhanced by utilizing a deep residual neural network. Multiscale feature maps are obtained through fusion with different convolutional layers, thus combining the high-level semantic information and low-level detail information. A rotation region proposal network is adopted to generate rotated regions, which makes the bounding box sensitive to dense objects in aerial images. Meanwhile, the RoIAlign is used and a convolution layer is appended in the classification stage, and focal loss is used in the classification stage. The proposed method focuses on arbitrary-oriented and dense objects in UAV images. After a comprehensive evaluation with several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, the proposed method is proved to be effective to detect multiclass artificial objects in aerial images. Extensive experiments are conducted on the DOTA, VEDAI, and the VisDrone UAV image datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain discriminative features through the improved multiscale feature extraction and the rotating region network. The results on the above datasets show that our method obtains gains in mean average precision compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Climate change is one of the greatest challenges for modern societies. Its consequences, often associated with extreme events, have dramatic results worldwide. New synergies between different disciplines including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing can lead to radically new approaches for the real-time tracking of natural disasters that are also designed to reduce the environmental footprint. In this article, we propose an AI-based pipeline for processing natural disaster images taken from drones. The purpose of this pipeline is to reduce the number of images to be processed by the first responders of the natural disaster. It consists of three main stages, (1) a lightweight auto-encoder based on deep learning, (2) a dimensionality reduction using the t-SNE algorithm and (3) a fuzzy clustering procedure. This pipeline is evaluated on several edge computing platforms with low-power accelerators to assess the design of intelligent autonomous drones to provide this service in real time. Our experimental evaluation focuses on flooding, showing that the amount of information to be processed is substantially reduced whereas edge computing platforms with low-power GPUs are placed as a compelling alternative for processing these heavy computational workloads, obtaining a performance loss of only 2.3x compared to its cloud counterpart version, running both the training and inference steps.},

abstract={Ground-Air coordination is a very complex environment for a machine learning algorithm. We focus on the case where an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) needs to support a group of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs). The UAV is required to broadcast an image that contains all UGVs, thus, offering a bird-eye-view on the group as a whole. The source of complexity in this task is twofold. First, coordination needs to occur without communication between the UAV and UGVs. Second, the ability of the UAV to sense the UGVs is coupled with the ability of the UAV to learn how to track laterally the UGVs and adapt its vertical position so that the images of the UGVs are appropriately spaced within the camera field of view. In this paper, we propose using the Deep Actor Network component of an Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning architecture as a supervised learner. The advantage of this approach is that it offers a step towards autonomous learning whereby the full Actor-Critic model can be utilized in the future. Human demonstrations are collected for the deep Actor network to learn from. The system is built using the Gazebo Simulator, Robot Operating System, and the OpenAI Gym. We show that the proposed setup is able to train the UAV to follow the UGVs while maintaining all UGVs within camera range in situations where UGVs are performing complex maneuvers.},

abstract={Recent years have seen a rapid development of machine learning based multi-module unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. To address the oracle problem in autonomous systems, numerous studies have been conducted to use metamorphic testing to automatically generate test scenes for various modules, e.g., those in self-driving cars. However, as most of the studies are based on unit testing including end-to-end model-based testing, a similar testing approach may not be equally effective for UAV systems where multiple modules are working closely together. Therefore, in this paper, instead of unit testing, we propose a novel metamorphic system testing framework for UAV, named MSTU, to detect the defects in multi-module UAV systems. A preliminary evaluation plan to apply MSTU on an emerging autonomous multi-module UAV system is also presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed testing framework.},

abstract={With high mobility, low cost and outstanding maneuverability properties, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has attracted worldwide attentions in both academia and industry. Nevertheless, the complex and coherent characteristics of the intelligent cooperation of UAV swarm greatly restrict its wide application. The recent development of artificial intelligence provides new methodologies for intelligent cooperation of UAV swarm. However, these methods are resource-in-tensive that cannot be directly applied in the computation and storage constrained UAVs. In this article, we propose a novel digital twin (DT)-based intelligent cooperation framework of UAV swarm. In the framework, a digital twin model is established to reflect the physical entity (i.e., UAV swarm) with high-fidelity and monitors its whole life cycle. Next, the decision model that integrates a machine learning algorithm is built to explore the global optimal solution and controls the behaviors of UAV swarm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, a case study on intelligent network reconstruction is introduced, and simulation results are presented. Finally, a representative application provided by the framework is discussed.},

abstract={In this paper, we develop a mobility and energy aware data routing protocol for unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted vehicular ad-hoc networks (UAV-assisted VANETs). One of the UAV act as a flying roadside Uunit (RSU) collecting data from ground vehicles, while the other UAVs play the role of relays to deliver the data to mobility service center (MSC). The UAVs can adjust their three-dimensional (3D) locations within a predefined range, if needed, in order to ensure reliable communication links. The proposed approach aims to minimize the energy consumed by the UAVs in both data transfer and movement. which ensures fair distribution of the routing effort across the different UAVs in the network. This is achieved by taking the residual UAV energy into account in the routing decision. We formulate such a routing problem as a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) to determine both the selected route and the locations of the UAVs participating in the data transfer process. Since such a problem is non-convex, we proceed with a joint optimization solution where the route is optimized using an ILP and the UAVs’ 3D locations are determined using the meta-heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. We present a selected set of numerical results to illustrate the performance of the proposed solution for different scenarios and compare it to a meta-heuristic approach based on swarm intelligence.},

abstract={Currently, major security incidents caused by the “unlicensed flying” of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have emerged one after another, which poses a grave threat to the security issues of public facilities and sensitive areas. Whether it can timely detect and prevent “unlicensed flying” of UAV has become a social concern. In response to this demand, the transfer learning method is adopted in this paper to conduct twoclassification and detection on UAV images. Image recognition technology based on transfer learning is an effective method to improve recognition accuracy by applying deep learning models to small samples. Different from the large number of training samples required by deep learning, transfer learning transfers the weights of the pre-trained deep neural network, and uses only small sample data to obtain good results in UAV image recognition. First of all, this paper proposes to construct a UAV data set according to different types of UAV shape structures, to perfect the classification and detection effect and the generalization ability of the model. Then, based on the transfer learning method, experimental comparison is made between three classic deep convolutional neural network classification models (Inception V3, ResNet 101 and VGG16) and two classic deep convolutional neural network detection models (Faster RCNN and SSD). Finally, an experimental evaluation is conducted on the collected UAV test data set. Compared with the traditional recognition model, the image classification model based on transfer learning employed in this paper has achieved important improvements in accuracy, recall and precision. Especially in the InceptionV3 model of transfer training, the recall reaches 96.98%. In addition, the image detection model based on transfer learning has achieved good detection results in accuracy, recall and F1-score.},
