abstract={In order to realize autonomous landing of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in power patrolling, a visual method vision based on Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) for UAVs is studied. In this paper, we design the landing sign of the combination of concentric circles and pentagon, and propose the Faster R-CNN recognition algorithm which can be used to identify the target sign. Faster R-CNN successfully identifying the landing mark is the most important step for the UAV autonomous landing. Then, the estimation algorithm of position and direction based on vision is proposed. Position and direction for the UAV landing can be obtained based on least squares ellipse fitting and Shi-Tomasi corner detection method after the landing sign is effectively identified by Faster R-CNN. The experimental results show that it can achieve recognition speed of nearly 81 millisecond each frame and 97.8% accuracy by using Faster R-CNN for detection and identification. The proposed method has better identification accuracy compared with three target identification methods, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, the Back Propagation (BP) neural network and You Only Look Once (YOLO) based on deep learning. The position and direction estimation error of the vision algorithm is within the allowable range, and it can meet the UAV real-time landing requirements.},

abstract={Semantic segmentation for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images has become one of the research focuses in the field of remote sensing at present, which could accurately analyze the ground objects and their relationships. However, conventional semantic segmentation methods based on deep learning require large-scale models that are not suitable for resource-constrained UAV remote sensing tasks. Therefore, it is important to construct a light-weight semantic segmentation method for UAV remote sensing images. With this motivation, we propose a light-weight neural network model with fewer parameters to solve the problem of semantic segmentation of UAV remote sensing images. The network adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoder, we build a light-weight convolutional neural network model with fewer channels of each layer to reduce the number of model parameters. Then, feature maps of different scales from the encoder are concatenated together after resizing to carry out the multiscale fusion. Moreover, we employ two attention modules to capture the global semantic information from the context and the correlation among channels in UAV remote sensing images. In the decoder part, the model obtains predictions of each pixel through the softmax function. We conducted experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, UAVid dataset, and UDD6 dataset to verify the effectiveness of the light-weight network. Our method obtains quality semantic segmentation results evaluated on UAV remote sensing datasets with only 9 M parameters the model owns, which is competitive among popular methods with the same level of parameters.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can accomplish various specific tasks and play an increasingly essential role in military, industrial and civil fields. However, the safety of the UAV is lower than that of manned aircraft, and great economic loss is caused due to its relatively high failure rate. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the anomaly detection method for the UAV system. In recent years, the deep learning method has been widely applied in various fields due to its outstanding advantages such as strong ability to approximate complex functions and automatic feature extraction. In this paper, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network method is proposed for the UAV anomaly detection. Firstly, a prediction model is formulated based on the training data set which contains only normal data, then the data at next time can be predicted. Secondly, according to the prediction results in train phase, we give an estimation of the prediction uncertainty. Finally, anomaly detection is achieved by comparing the prediction value with the uncertain interval. Real UAV sensor data with point anomalies in north velocity and pneumatic lifting velocity are used to verify the proposed method, and experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect point anomalies.},

abstract={There are several ways in which Foreign Object Debris (FOD) are detected on runways. Some of these methods include Radar, infrared technologies, and stationary cameras mounted on the runway and use image processing tools to find these FODs. Radar technology is highly accurate when finding FODs but is highly inaccurate with small FOD items causing a high false-positive rate. Stationary based RGB camera-based methods also have a high false-positive rate prompting the shutdown of runways, creating disruptions for both the airport and the airline carriers. The paper presents a new method of detection by using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to fly above the runway at a low altitude (e.g. < 30 m) to find FOD in. We developed a system that combines a UAV, an RGB camera, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) detector trained using deep learning methods and locally collected images over a runway. The classes specifically looked at were paper, metal, bolts, plastic, and plastic bottles. Different lighting conditions of both full sunlight and cloudy weather were taken into consideration when the images were collected. The detector was trained with various data augmentation techniques including resize, rotate, and colour augmentation. Results have concluded that there is a potential use for UAV's as a method of FOD detection, with a high rate of accuracy in the detections. This could lead to shorter timeframes and fewer disruptions where runways are closed.},

abstract={The subject of using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in extinguishing activities during large-scale forest fires is described in the scientific literature. For example, the Web of Science service for the period 1990-2018 recorded 308 publications related to UAV and forest fires [1]. These are mainly analyzes and studies on remote fire detection, monitoring, mapping, architecture and technology integration. There is a noticeable growing interest of researchers in the subject of using machine learning to detect and predict the spread of fires using unmanned aerial vehicles [2]. At the same time, analyzes are carried out on the ad-hoc creation of local data networks using drones [3], or drones as an element of the Internet of Things (IoT) [4]. In the operational context, concepts and solutions such as water transfer and extinguishing with UAV are only being tested. [5]. Another important challenge is that current firefighting civil aviation regulations only allow firefighting manned aircrafts to operate between first and last flight due to safety concerns for pilots, limiting the operation time to an average of 12 hours, which leads to many fires reactivating at night. This paper will analyze the legal and technological polish perspective of Unmanned Aircraft Systems usage in international firefighting and crisis management missions.},

abstract={With the development of technology and the decreasing of manufacturing costs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered to be one of the most effective relay to expand the communication coverage and improve the performance of cellular networks. However, the communication system of UAV is very susceptible to Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing, causing it to deviate from the original trajectory and perform abnormal behavior. To address this issue, the abnormal behavior detection scheme of UAV using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the reliable normal behavior models for two different scenarios are established by applying RNNs to avoid the confusion of slight offset and abnormal behavior, so as to improve the accuracy of proposed detection scheme of UAV. Besides, in order to ensure the accuracy of training samples of RNNs, Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm is used to obtain a large number of current 2D arrival angle of UAV. Moreover, an appropriate threshold is selected through amounts of experiments to measure the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) between the real position and the position provided by normal behavior models, thus detecting the abnormal behavior of UAV. Experimental results reveal that the proposed abnormal behavior detection scheme is of high accuracy.},

abstract={With the wide applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in engineering such as the inspection of the electrical equipment from distance, the demands of efficient object detection algorithms for abundant images acquired by UAV have also been significantly increased in recent years. In computer vision and data mining communities, traditional object detection methods usually train a class-specific learner (e.g., the SVM) based on the low level features to detect the single class of images by sliding a local window. Thus, they may not suit for the UAV images with complex background and multiple kinds of interest objects. Recently, the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have already shown great advances in the object detection and segmentation fields and outperformed many traditional methods which usually been employed in the past decades. In this work, we study the performance of the region-based CNN for the electrical equipment defect detection by using the UAV images. In order to train the detection model, we collect a UAV images dataset composes of four classes of electrical equipment defects with thousands of annotated labels. Then, based on the region-based faster R-CNN model, we present a multi-class defects detection model for electrical equipment which is more efficient and accurate than traditional single class detection methods. Technically, we have replaced the RoI pooling layer with a similar operation in Tensorflow and promoted the mini-batch to 128 per image in the training procedure. These improvements have slightly increased the speed of detection without any accuracy loss. Therefore, the modified region-based CNN could simultaneously detect multi-class of defects of the electrical devices in nearly real time. Experimental results on the real word electrical equipment images demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than the traditional object detection algorithms in defect detection.},

abstract={Recently, most object detection under videos have increasingly relied on the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms because of UAVs' timeliness, pertinence, and high flexibility in data acquisition. Convolution neural networks, especially for YOLO v3, have proved to be effective in intelligent pedestrian detection. However, two problems need to be solved in pedestrian detection of UAV images. One is more small pedestrian objects in UAV images; the other is the complex structure of Darknet53 in YOLO v3, which requires massive computation. To solve these problems, an improved lightweight network MobileNetv3 based on YOLO v3 is proposed. First, the improved MobileNetv3 takes place of the Darknet53 for feature extraction to reduce algorithm complexity and model simplify. Second, complete IoU loss by incorporating the overlap area, central point distance and aspect ratio in bounding box regression, is introduced into YOLO v3 to lead to faster convergence and better performance. Moreover, a new attention module SESAM is constructed by channel attention and spatial attention in MobileNetv3. It can effectively judge long-distance and small-volume objects. The experimental results have shown that the proposed model improves the performance of pedestrian detection of UAV images.},

abstract={Landing an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) aboard a patrol boat is a challenging task due to the unpredictable ship movement, being its automation essential. Automated solutions rely on the UAV pose estimation, usually obtained from onboard sensors. Given the onboard sensors’ limitations and the power consumption, we propose an off-board pose estimation method. By relying on RGB images captured from a camera at the ship deck, our method directly estimates the UAV pose with respect to the landing site, removing the dependency on any additional sensors. We propose a model-based pose tracking method with a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF), that models the translational motion of the UAV approximating the translation by a set of hypotheses and a distinct rotational distribution for each translation hypothesis using a autoencoder network trained for our UAV model. This allows to reduce the sample search space from 6D to 3D. Furthermore, we propose a particle weighting process combining the contributions from the rotation likelihood distribution and a detector-based likelihood. The training of the neural networks and the validation of the proposed method is made on a graphically realistic simulator. The results show that our weighting process has benefits when compared to the baseline and other state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, our approach successfully handles objects with geometric symmetries.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based framework for fast UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)detection and identification over encrypted Wi-Fi traffic. It is motivated by the observation that many consumer UAVs use Wi-Fi links for control and video streaming. The proposed framework extracts statistical features derived only from packet size and inter-arrival time of encrypted Wi-Fi traffic, and can quickly identify UAV types. In order to reduce the online identification time, our framework adopts a re-weighted ℓ1-norm regularization, which considers the number of samples and computation cost of different features. This framework jointly optimizes feature selection and prediction performance in a unified objective function. To tackle the packet interarrival time uncertainty when optimizing the trade-off between the identification accuracy and delay, we utilize maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)method to estimate the packet inter-arrival time. We collect a large number of real-world Wi-Fi data traffic of four types of consumer UAVs and conduct extensive evaluation on the performance of our proposed method. Evaluation results show that our proposed method can identify the tested UAVs within 0.15-0.35s with high accuracy of 85.7-95.2%.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is emerging as a promising technique for future networks with flexible network topology and ultra-high data transmission rate. Within such full-dimensionally dynamic mmWave network, beam-tracking is challenging and critical, especially when all the UAVs are in motion for some collaborative tasks that require high-quality communications. In this paper, we propose a fast beam tracking scheme, which is built on an efficient position prediction of multiple moving UAVs. In particular, a Gaussian process based machine learning scheme is proposed to achieve fast and accurate UAV position prediction with quantifiable positional uncertainty. Based on the prediction results, the beam-tracking can be confined within some specific spatial regions centered on the predicted UAV positions. In contrast to the full-space searching based scheme, our proposed position prediction based beam tracking requires little system overhead and thus achieves high net spectrum efficiency. Moreover, we also propose a practical communication protocol embedding our beam-tracking scheme, which monitors the channel evolution and triggers the UAV position prediction for beam-tracking, transmit-receive beam pair selection and data transmission. Simulation results validate the advantages of our scheme over the existing works.},

We also describe a synthesis challenge due to the UAV's hidden-information constraint. Next, we perform human experiments using a developed RESCHU-SA testbed to recognize the geolocation strategies that operators adopt. Furthermore, we deploy machine learning techniques on the collected experimental data to predict the correctness of a geolocation task at a given location based on its geographical features. By representing the model as a delayed-action game and formalizing the system objectives, we utilize off-the-shelf model checkers to synthesize protocols for the human-UAV coalition that satisfy these objectives. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the H-UAV protocol synthesis through a case study where the protocols are experimentally analyzed and further evaluated by human operators.},

abstract={Multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems with high-resolution cameras have been found to be useful for operations such as disaster management and smart farming. These systems feature Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) that connect the computation edge with UAVs and a Ground Control Station (GCS) through air-to-ground network links. Leveraging the edge computation resources effectively with energy-awareness, and dealing with intermittent failures of FANET links are the major challenges in supporting video processing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-aware dynamic computation offloading scheme for UAV systems, which provides the ability to intelligently share tasks among individual UAVs and allows for parallel execution of tasks while evenly distributing energy consumption. Intelligence gathering is performed using machine learning to create resource consumption profiles for a given set of video processing tasks prior to scheduling. Our scheme handles the problem of computation offloading tasks as a job-shop scheduling problem where we aim to minimize the total energy consumption in the edge resources while minimizing video processing times to meet application requirements. Our experimental results show our energy-aware dynamic offloading scheme enables lower processing time for low drone-to-ground server ratios and consumes less energy when compared to other offloading schemes. Notably, these results also hold in various other multi-UAV scenarios involving largely different number of detected objects.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of resource management is studied for a network of wireless virtual reality (VR) users communicating using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)- enabled LTE over unlicensed (LTE-U) network. In the studied model, {the UAVs act as VR control centers that collect tracking information from the VR users over the wireless uplink and, then, send the constructed VR images to the VR users over an LTE-U downlink.} Therefore, resource allocation in such a UAV-enabled LTE-U network must jointly consider the uplink and downlink links over both licensed and unlicensed bands. In such a VR setting, the UAVs can dynamically adjust the data size of each VR image by tuning its quality and format. By doing so, the UAVs can adjust the transmitted data size according to the spectrum allocated to each user so as to meet the delay requirement. Therefore, resource allocation must also take into account the image quality and format. This VR-centric resource allocation problem is formulated as a noncooperative game that enables a joint allocation of licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands, as well as a dynamic adaptation of VR image quality and format. To solve this game, a learning algorithm based on the machine learning tools of echo state networks (ESNs) with leaky integrator neurons is proposed. Unlike conventional ESN learning algorithms that are suitable for discrete-time systems, the proposed algorithm can dynamically adjust the update speed of the ESN's state and, hence, it can enable the UAVs to learn the continuous dynamics of their associated VR users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves up to 14% and 27.1% gains in terms of total VR QoE for all users compared to Q-learning using LTE-U and Q-learning using LTE.},

abstract={Spectrum sensing is a promising technology to deal with the increasing scarcity of spectrum resources since Internet of Things devices have increased tremendously. Specifically, in the cognitive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, UAVs can opportunistically access the licensed spectrum of the primary user when it is sensed idle. However, since the environment of UAV is varying all the time, the noise power and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel are uncertain in UAV communications. Thus, traditional methods are difficult to resist the influence of noise uncertainty on spectrum sensing. In this paper, we combine data preprocessing and machine learning to improve the performance of UAV spectrum sensing and resist the influence of noise power and SNR uncertainty. Specifically, we propose Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network spectrum sensing based on normalized spectrum. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional GRU and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, the proposed algorithm has better performance when the SNR and noise power are uncertain. Besides, when the number of sampling points is more than 600, both the training time and testing time are less than half of traditional GRU and LSTM network.},

With the help of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle's onboard sensors, we can collect air quality data easily. The paper proposes a distributed and decentralized Federated Learning approach within a UAV swarm. The accumulated data by the sensors are used as an input to the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. Each UAV used its locally gathered data to train a model before transmitting the local model to the central base station. The central base station creates a master model by combining all the UAV's local model weights of the participating UAVs in the FL process and transmits it to all UAV s in the subsequent cycles. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated with other machine learning models using various evaluation metrics using test data from the capital city of India, i.e., Delhi.},

It is shown that the neural network adaptive PID controller is capable of dealing with the unknown variable payload issue by adjusting the PID parameters online. Simulation results confirm that the proposed neural network adaptive PID controller outperforms the parallel PID controller.},

abstract={At present, most of the smart systems are based on cloud computing, and massive data generated at the smart end device will need to be transferred to the cloud where AI models are deployed. Therefore, a big challenge for smart system engineers is that cloud based smart systems often face issues such as network congestion and high latency. In recent years, mobile edge computing (MEC) is becoming a promising solution which supports computation-intensive tasks such as deep learning through computation offloading to the servers located at the local network edge. To take full advantage of MEC, an effective collaboration between the end device and the edge server is essential. In this paper, as an initial investigation, we propose Edge4Sys, a Device-Edge Collaborative Framework for MEC based Smart System. Specifically, we employ the deep learning based user identification process in a MEC-based UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) delivery system as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework which can significantly reduce the network traffic and the response time.},

abstract={Industrial internet of things (IIoT) enables edge computing technology to provide communication between the machines that produce a large amount of data and locate at the edge network. A task scheduling is implemented in the edge node. Furthermore, the real-time data can achieve with the lowest latency that allowed by the edge node near the edge network. However, a mobile machine such as an autonomous guided vehicle can interfere in this situation. Because the vehicle also needs service by the edge node. Over that, quality of service (QoS) performance can decrease. Therefore, this paper deploys an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an edge node to provide service to the edge network through optimizing the trajectory of UAV, where the edge network request task using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) Learning. The result shows that using machine learning, notably the DQN algorithm, can increase the number of the machine that can be provided service.

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has limited computing power, but requires high accuracy and low latency in the visual object detection for critical UAV missions, such as infrastructure inspection. It may need highly complex machine learning algorithms with the demand of extensive computing power. With the rising edge computing technology, the heavily-loaded object detection tasks can be offloaded to edge computing systems. To enable such edge-based object detection with low overhead, we discover that it is critical to minimize the response time of the detection while maximizing the frequency of detected image frames.

With the rapid growth of the UAV, a very often discussed topic has become defense against unmanned vehicles. Their early detection and destruction can prevent the occurrence of undesirable situations. A camera located on another unmanned vehicle that protects a space will allow detecting and recognizing unwanted targets, and then tracking movements at the best time eliminates further movement of the detected device by release the net.

abstract={Air pollution monitoring, finding the hazardous zone, and future air quality predictions have recently become a significant issue for many researchers. With the adverse effect of low air quality on human health, it has become necessary for predicting the air quality index (AQI) accurately and on time. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can collect air quality data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Using a fleet of UAVs could be considered a good option. In the proposed work, we implement a distributed federated learning (FL) algorithm within a UAV swarm that collects air quality data using built-in sensors. A scheme for finding the area with the highest AQI value is proposed using swarm intelligence. The collected data are then fed to a CNN-LSTM model to predict the AQI. The trained local model is sent to the central server, and the server aggregates the received models from UAVs in the swarm. A global model is created and is transmitted to the UAV swarm again in the next iteration. The proposed architecture is compared with other time-series models. The results show that the proposed model predicts AQI daily with a minimal error rate on a real-time data set from Delhi.},

abstract={The traditional swarm intelligence algorithm to solve the path planning in single combat style of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can no longer meet the requirements of multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance mission planning (MUCRMP) problem in denied environment for its slow convergence rate, ignorance of complex constraints and guidance to local optimization. A novel method for multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance mission planning in denied environment (MUCRMP-DE) based on an improved synthetic heuristic algorithm is proposed to tackle these. In this paper, a hierarchical model is established with the global optimization goal of UAV's minimum radar detection time at first, including the planning of reconnaissance sequence between and within target groups, as well as relative position to targets. Then an improved synthetic heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the model, which obtains valuable reconnaissance mission plan. For an application example of reconnaissance mission involving 68 targets, the simulation results show that the improved synthetic heuristic algorithm can suit the needs of the mission, particularly in effectively evading the detection of multiple radars. While it can also give better anti-radar attributes to the UA V and efficiently improved the convergence speed in the specific reconnaissance mission.},

Manual annotation, however, is time-consuming and, thus, has limited the potential for creating large-scale datasets. We tackle this challenge by presenting a procedure for the automatic creation of simulated UAV image sequences in urban areas and pixel-level annotations from publicly available data sources. We synthesize photo-realistic UAV imagery from Google Earth Studio and derive annotations from an open CityGML model that not only provides geometric but also semantic information. The first dataset we exemplarily created using our approach contains 144 000 images of Berlin, Germany, with four types of annotations, namely semantic labels as well as depth, surface normals, and edge maps. Based on this specific case, we demonstrate the entire pipeline and give a comprehensive overview of technical obstacles and solutions. In experiments, we evaluated the quality of our dataset and its potential application in monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation using deep learning methods. To facilitate the creation of further datasets, we provide our source code along with the produced dataset at https://github.com/sian1995/largescaleuavdataset.},

abstract={Road image segmentation is critical in a variety of applications, including road maintenance, intelligent transportation systems, and urban planning. Numerous image segmentation techniques, including popular neural network approaches, have been proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images recently. However, since these images include complex backgrounds, high-precision road segmentation from UAV images remains challenging. To address this issue, this study proposes a deep learning method called DeepLab V3+ semantic segmentation. Road images are captured and collected from several roads in Kedah and Selangor, Malaysia using a UAV. To segment the road from the background, the DeepLab V3+ with Resnet-50 backbone is utilised. Then, the performance is assessed by comparing segmented images by deep learning to manually segment images. Three metrics are used for the assessment; pixel accuracy (PA), mean area intersection by union (mIoU), and mean F1-score (MeanF1). The study also compares the segmentation performance with the DeepLab V3+ with mobile NetV2 for benchmarking purposes. Simulation results show that the DeepLab V3+ with Resnet-50 has performed better than the DeepLab V3+ with mobile NetV2 methods. The findings indicate that the DeepLab V3+ with Resnet-50 outperformed the DeepLab V3+ with mobile NetV2 for PA, mIoU, and MeanF1 by 1.39 %, 4.92 %, and 9.71 %, respectively.},

While in some situations, UAVs may be deployed simultaneously by different parties with opposite purposes, easily resulting in direct competitions against each other. In this case, how to use UAVs to pursue UAVs has become a hot spot. In order to analyze the behavior of UAV, building a realistic mathematical dynamic model is necessary. In this paper, we propose a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy control system based UAV dynamic model, which is exactly the same UAV control method in practice. To address the competition conundrum between UAVs, we formulate this problem into a pursuer-evader problem and leverage the reinforcement learning based machine learning method to solve this. The proposed deep Q network is based on traditional Q learning but able to address some deficiencies. Basically, deep Q network has three vital improvements: using neural network to describe the Q function, the architecture of double networks, and the experience replay.

The deep learning Faster R-CNN target detection algorithm is applied to the identification of hidden dangers of the lines in the aerial image captured by the UAV. The hidden danger refers to the excavation damage of the engineering vehicle. Based on the Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imagery (VEDAI) dataset, the engineering vehicle aerial dataset was produced. Through simulation training, the target detection of excavators, bulldozers and other engineering vehicles was realized in the aerial image. The detection accuracy is better than traditional machine learning target detection algorithms such as Deformable Part Model (DPM) and Histogram of Oriented Gradient + Local Binary Pattern + Support Vector Machine (HOG+LBP+SVM).

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more prevalent, more capable, and less expensive every day. Advances in battery life and electronic sensors have spurred the development of diverse UAV applications outside their original military domain. For example, Search and Rescue (SAR) operations stand to benefit greatly from modern UAVs since even the simplest commercial models are equipped with high-resolution cameras and the ability to stream video to a computer or portable device. As a result, autonomous unmanned systems (terrestrial, marine, and aerial) have begun to be employed for such typical SAR tasks as terrain mapping, task observation, and early supply delivery. However, these systems were developed before recent advances in artificial intelligence such as Google Deepmind's breakthrough with the Deep Q-Network (DQN) technology. Therefore, most of them rely heavily on Greedy or Potential-based heuristics, without the ability to learn. In this research, we investigate a possible approximation (called Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) for enhancing the performance of autonomous UAVs in SAR by incorporating newly-developed Reinforcement Learning methods. The project utilizes open-source tools such as Microsoft's state-of-the-art UAV simulator AirSim, and Keras, a machine learning framework that can make use of Google's popular tensor library called TensorFlow. The main approach investigated in this research is the Deep Q-Network.},

abstract={The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) delivery service is being increasingly used in logistics. However, it is challenging for a UAV to precisely identify the position for parcel delivering if it is only aided by the GPS, especially in some complex environments with weak signals and high interference. For this issue, we present a knowledge distillation empowered edge intelligence architecture, KeepEdge, to achieve visual information-assisted positioning for the UAV delivery services. Specifically, we integrate deep neural networks (DNN) into an edge computing framework to enable edge intelligence which empowers the UAVs to autonomously identify the expected delivery position. Deploying the DNN model and conducting model inference on UAVs however, requires high computing performance. To manage the trade-off between the limited resources onboard the UAVs and high-performance requirements, we employ knowledge distillation to produce a lightweight model with high accuracy based on the full model trained in the cloud. The lightweight model with significantly lower complexity and less inference latency is used onboard of the UAVs for accurate positioning. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves satisfactory performance for assisted positioning. A real-world case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed edge intelligence solution for UAV delivery services.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained wide research interests due to their technological advancement and high mobility. The UAVs are equipped with increasingly advanced capabilities to run computationally intensive applications enabled by machine learning techniques. However, because of both energy and computation constraints, the UAVs face issues hovering in the sky while performing computation due to weather uncertainty. To overcome the computation constraints, the UAVs can partially or fully offload their computation tasks to the edge servers. In ordinary computation offloading operations, the UAVs can retrieve the result from the returned output. Nevertheless, if the UAVs are unable to retrieve the entire result from the edge servers, i.e., straggling edge servers, this operation will fail. In this paper, we propose a coded distributed computing approach for computation offloading to mitigate straggling edge servers. The UAVs can retrieve the returned result when the number of returned copies is greater than or equal to the recovery threshold. There is a shortfall if the returned copies are less than the recovery threshold. To minimize the cost of the network, energy consumption by the UAVs, and prevent over and under subscription of the resources, we devise a two-phase Stochastic Coded Offloading Scheme (SCOS). In the first phase, the appropriate UAVs are allocated to the charging stations amid weather uncertainty. In the second phase, we use the z-stage Stochastic Integer Programming (SIP) to optimize the number of computation subtasks offloaded and computed locally, while taking into account the computation shortfall and demand uncertainty. By using a real dataset, the simulation results show that our proposed scheme is fully dynamic, and minimizes the cost of the network and UAV energy consumption amid stochastic uncertainties.},

pages={119-135},
abstract={Micro-UAV swarms usually generate massive data when performing tasks. These data can be harnessed with various machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve the swarm's intelligence. To achieve this goal while protecting swarm data privacy, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising enabling technology. During the model training process of FL, the UAV may face an energy scarcity issue due to the limited battery capacity. Fortunately, this issue is potential to be tackled via simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). However, the integration of SWIPT and FL brings new challenges to the system design that have yet to be addressed, which motivates our work. Specifically, in this paper, we consider a micro-UAV swarm network consisting of one base station (BS) and multiple UAVs, where the BS uses FL to train an ML model over the data collected by the swarm. During training, the BS broadcasts the model and energy simultaneously to the UAVs via SWIPT, and each UAV relies on its harvested and battery-stored energy to train the received model and then upload it to the BS for model aggregation. To improve the learning performance, we formulate a problem of maximizing the percentage of scheduled UAVs by jointly optimizing UAV scheduling and wireless resource allocation. The problem is a challenging mixed integer nonlinear programming problem and is NP-hard in general. By exploiting its special structure property, we develop two algorithms to achieve the optimal and suboptimal solutions, respectively. Numerical results show that the suboptimal algorithm achieves a near-optimal performance under various network setups, and significantly outperforms the existing representative baselines. considered.},

abstract={By leveraging our relative Micro-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle localization sensor UVDAR, we generated an automatically annotated dataset MIDGARD, which the community is invited to use for training and testing their machine learning systems for the detection and localization of Microscale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) by other MAVs. Furthermore, we provide our system as a mechanism for rapidly generating custom annotated datasets specifically tailored for the needs of a given application. The recent literature is rich in applications of machine learning methods in automation and robotics. One particular subset of these methods is visual object detection and localization, using means such as Convolutional Neural Networks, which nowadays enable objects to be detected and classified with previously inconceivable precision and reliability. Most of these applications, however, rely on a carefully crafted training dataset of annotated camera footage. These must contain the objects of interest in environments similar to those where the detector is expected to operate. Notably, the positions of the objects must be provided in annotations. For non-laboratory settings, the construction of such datasets requires many man-hours of manual annotation, which is especially the case for use onboard Micro-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. In this paper, we are providing for the community a practical alternative to that kind of approach.},

abstract={This paper investigates the autonomous control of massive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for mission-critical applications (e.g., dispatching many UAVs from a source to a destination for firefighting). Achieving their fast travel and low motion energy without inter-UAV collision under wind perturbation is a daunting control task, which incurs huge communication energy for exchanging UAV states in real time. We tackle this problem by exploiting a mean-field game (MFG) theoretic control method that requires the UAV state exchanges only once at the initial source. Afterwards, each UAV can control its acceleration by locally solving two partial differential equations (PDEs), known as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. This approach, however, brings about huge computation energy for solving the PDEs, particularly under multi-dimensional UAV states. We address this issue by utilizing a machine learning (ML) method where two separate ML models approximate the solutions of the HJB and FPK equations. These ML models are trained and exploited using an online gradient descent method with low computational complexity. Numerical evaluations validate that the proposed ML aided MFG theoretic algorithm, referred to as MFG learning control, is effective in collision avoidance with low communication energy and acceptable computation energy.

abstract={In this paper, the problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) deployment is investigated for visible light communication (VLC)-enabled UAV networks. Here, UAVs can simul-taneously provide communications and illumination services to ground users. In this model, ambient illumination distribution of the service area must be considered since it can cause interference over the VLC link and affects the illumination requirements of users. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem, which jointly considers UAV deployment, user association, power efficiency, and predictions of the illumination distribution. To solve this problem, we first need to predict illumination distribution to proactively determine the UAV deployment and user association so as to minimize total transmission power of UAVs. To predict the illumination distribution of the entire service area, a federated learning framework based on the machine learning algorithm of convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) is proposed. Compared to the centralized machine learning algorithms that requires complete illumination data for centralized training, the proposed algorithm enables the UAVs to train their local CAE with partial illumination data and cooperatively build a global CAE model that can predict the entire illumination distribution. Using these predictions, the optimal UAV deployment and user association policy that minimizes the total transmission power of UAVs is determined. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the transmission power of UAVs up to 14.8% and 25.1%, respectively, compared to the local CAE prediction models and the conventional optimal algorithm without illumination distribution predictions.},

abstract={The emerging Sixth Generation (6G) communication networks promising 100 to 1000 Gbps rates and ultra-low latency (1 millisecond) are anticipated to have native, embedded Artificial Intelligence (AI) capability to support a myriad of services, such as Holographic Type Communications (HTC), tactile Internet, remote surgery, etc. However, these services require ultra-reliability, which is highly impacted by the dynamically changing environment of 6G heterogeneous tiny cells, whereby static AI solutions fitting all scenarios and devices are impractical. Hence, this article introduces a novel concept called the softwarization of intelligence in 6G networks to select the most ideal, ultra-fast optimal policy based on the highly varying channel conditions, traffic demand, user mobility, and so forth. Our envisioned concept is exemplified in a Multi- Armed Bandit (MAB) framework and evaluated within a use case of two simultaneous scenarios (i.e., Neighbor Discovery and Selection (NDS) in a Device-to-Device (D2D) network and aerial gateway selection in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)- based under-served area network). Furthermore, our concept is evaluated through extensive computer-based simulations that indicate encouraging performance. Finally, related challenges and future directions are highlighted.},

abstract={This paper introduces a Multi-Agency DisAster Management (MADAM) framework for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted public safety systems, based on the principles of game theory and reinforcement learning. Initially, the information quality and criticality (IQC) provided by each agency to an UAV-assisted public safety network is introduced and quantified, and the concept of Value of Information (VoI) that measures each agency's positive contribution to the overall disaster management process is defined. Based on these, a holistic cost function is adopted by each agency, reflecting its relative abstention from the information provisioning process. Each agency aims at minimizing its personal cost function in order to better contribute to the disaster management. This optimization problem is formulated as a non- cooperative game among the agencies and it is proven to be an exact potential game, thus guaranteeing the existence of at least one Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE). We propose a binary log- linear reinforcement learning algorithm that converges to the optimal PNE. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through modeling and simulation under several scenarios, and its superiority compared to other approaches is demonstrated.},

Next, to address the uncertainty of mmWave channels and maintain line-of-sight links in a realtime manner, a distributional reinforcement learning approach, based on quantile regression optimization, is proposed to learn the propagation environment of mmWave communications, and, then, optimize the location of the UAV-IR so as to maximize the long-term downlink communication capacity.

abstract={Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are playing a vital and sustainable role in many verticals touching different aspects of our lives including civil, public, and military applications. WSNs majorly consist of a few to several sensor nodes, that are connected to each other via wireless communication links and require real-time or delayed data transfer. In this paper, we propose an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled data gathering mechanism for delay-tolerant WSN applications. The objective is to employ a self-trained UAV as a flying mobile unit collecting data from ground sensor nodes spatially distributed in a given geographical area during a predefined period of time. In this approach, two Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches, specifically Deep Deterministic Gradient Decent (DDPG) and Q-learning (QL) algorithms, are jointly employed to train the UAV to understand the environment and provide effective scheduling to accomplish its data collection mission. The DDPG is used to autonomously decide the best trajectory to adopt in an obstacle-constrained environment, while the QL is developed to determine the order of nodes to visit such that the data collection time is minimized. The schedule is obtained while considering the limited battery capacity of the flying unit, its need to return the charging station, the time windows of data acquisition, and the priority of certain sensor nodes. Customized reward functions are designed for each RL model and, through numerical simulations, we investigate their training performances. We also analyze the behavior of the autonomous UAV for different selected scenarios and corroborate the ability of the proposed approach in performing effective data collection. A comparison with the deterministic optimal solution is provided to validate the performance of the learning-based approach.},

Our objective is to design a task scheduling policy that minimizes offloading and computing delay of all tasks given the UAV energy capacity constraint. To this end, we first formulate the online scheduling problem as an energy-constrained Markov decision process (MDP). Then, considering the task arrival dynamics, we develop a novel deep risk-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm evaluates the risk, which measures the energy consumption that exceeds the constraint, for each state and searches the optimal parameter weighing the minimization of delay and risk while learning the optimal policy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the task processing delay by up to 30% compared to probabilistic configuration methods while satisfying the UAV energy capacity constraint.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will open up new application fields in smart city-based intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), e.g., traffic management, disaster rescue, police patrol, etc. However, the broadcast and line-of-sight nature of air-to-ground wireless channels give rise to a new challenge to the information security of UAV-to-vehicle (U2V) communications. This paper considers U2V communications subject to multi-eavesdroppers on the ground in urban scenarios. We aim to maximize the secrecy rates in physical layer security perspective while considering both the energy consumption and flight zone limitation, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, the transmit power of the UAV, and the jamming power sent by the roadside unit (RSU). This joint optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), considering time-varying characteristics of the wireless channels. A curiosity-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is subsequently utilized to solve the above MDP, in which the agent is reinforced by an extrinsic reward supplied by the environment and an intrinsic reward defined as the prediction error of the consequence after executing its actions. Extensive simulation results show that compared to the DRL without intrinsic rewards, the proposed scheme can have excellent performance in terms of the average reward, learning efficiency, and generalization to other scenarios.},

abstract={Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally. Finally, the developed algorithms were tested on a realistic scenario by means of a UAV test-bed.},

abstract={Multi-agent cooperative target tracking plays a significant role in distributed artificial intelligence for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Most existing tracking solutions using online path planning focus on general target trajectories. Such trajectories have strong regularity and are smooth with minimal fluctuations. However, in real UAV applications a target will change its trajectory frequently to prevent from being tracked, and thus its trajectory will fluctuate greatly and randomly. To this end, in this paper we consider a realistic scenario where the UAV target trajectory is changeable and random. For real-time target tracking, we formulate the tracking task as a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem, the objective of which is to optimize tracking performance under various constraints. To do so, we innovatively combine the adaptive differential evolution (ADE) algorithm with Nash optimization, and then propose a Nash-combined ADE method. Specifically, we use ADE to adaptively adjust the predicted trajectory of each UAV agent and Nash optimization to efficiently solve DMPC formulation for global optimization, which can improve the tracking accuracy and simultaneously reduce the computational complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs well in terms of tracking accuracy, UAV collision avoidance and tracking stability for realistic target trajectories.},

abstract={Satellite networks can provide Internet of Things (IoT) devices in remote areas with seamless coverage and downlink multicast transmissions. However, the large transmission latency, serious path loss, as well as the energy and resource constraints of IoT terminals challenge the stringent service requirements for throughput and latency in the 6G era. To address these problems, technologies including space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), machine learning, edge computing, and energy harvesting are highly expected in 6G IoT. In this article, we consider the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites to offer wireless-powered IoT devices edge computing and cloud computing services, respectively. To accelerate the communications, Terahertz frequency bands are utilized for communications between UAVs and IoT devices. Since the tasks generated by terrestrial IoT devices can be conducted locally, offloaded to the UAV-based edge servers or remote cloud servers through satellites, we focus on the computation offloading problem and consider deep learning techniques to optimize the task success rate considering the energy dynamics and channel conditions. A deep-learning-based offloading policy optimization strategy is given where the long short-term memory model is considered to address the dynamics of energy harvesting performance. Through the theoretical explanation and performance analysis, we discover the importance of emerging technologies including SAGIN, energy harvesting, and artificial intelligence techniques for 6G IoT.},

abstract={In this paper, a method for fault detection of physical impairment of UAV rotor blades is presented. Actuators in multirotor UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems are common subjects fault diagnosis methods which are an essential part of the active fault-tolerant control scheme. Defects in a propulsion system of the aerial vehicle lead to the loss of thrust generated by rotors and as a result, to the disturbance of thrust balance, higher power consumption and further degradation resulting in the possible crash of the vehicle. Authors propose a three-stage algorithm based on the signal processing and machine learning to detect the occurrence of rotor fault, determine its scale and type. The method is based on measurements of acceleration from the onboard IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor as unbalanced rotating parts commonly cause vibrations in mechanical systems. The acceleration signal is stored in a cyclic buffer and then processed by simple feature extraction algorithms in order to obtain a characteristic signature of the faulty state. Three different methods of feature extraction are considered in this article, along with the analysis of variable buffer length. Next, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to determine the occurrence and character of the rotor fault. The presented solution was verified in series of experiments proving its effectiveness.

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), have intrigued different people from all walks of life, because of their pervasive computing capabilities. UAV equipped with vision techniques, could be leveraged to establish navigation autonomous control for UAV itself. Also, object detection from UAV could be used to broaden the utilization of drone to provide ubiquitous surveillance and monitoring services towards military operation, urban administration and agriculture management. As the data-driven technologies evolved, machine learning algorithm, especially the deep learning approach has been intensively utilized to solve different traditional computer vision research problems. Modern Convolutional Neural Networks based object detectors could be divided into two major categories: one-stage object detector and two-stage object detector. In this study, we utilize some representative CNN based object detectors to execute the computer vision task over Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). State-of-the-art performance has been achieved in utilizing focal loss dense detector RetinaNet based approach for object detection from UAV in a fast and accurate manner.},

abstract={In this paper, we present the recent research in the development of AL drones by using an algorithm of deep learning (A subset of machine learning algorithms) and computer vision (CV) based on a drone camera, the study explores the potential use of drones not only in searching the victim person, animals, important properties during natural calamities like flood, volcanoes eruption, forest fire, cyclones, and earthquake, etc. but also it insights into much useful information to collect to ensure the future safety by using a machine learning algorithm. Preparing for and responding to disasters is a major logistical challenge. "Actionable Data" is the next powerful approach and reliable to the Al drones. As we know that drones often generate a huge amount of data - sometimes it produces a large amount of data that we can't handle at a time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are the only possible approach that can add value to our AI-based drone without putting any additional efforts to make UAVs more frequent automation. During search and rescue operations, UAVs played a crucial role over humans. As we know that UAVs can be sent to any desired location without any prior knowledge about the exact conditions in the target area. In this paper, we worked to reduce the number of factors that cause hindrance to the effective deployment of UAVs and increasing the duration of flight duration for the rescue operation. We also use the first Indian microprocessor Shakti class c which is installed in the board Artix-7.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be powerful Internet of Things components to execute sensing tasks over the next-generation cellular networks, which are generally referred to as the cellular Internet of UAVs. However, due to the high mobility of UAVs and shadowing in airto-ground channels, UAVs operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Therefore, UAVs need to improve the quality of service of sensing and communication without complete information, which makes reinforcement learning suitable for use in the cellular Internet of UAVs. In this article, we propose a distributed sense-and-send protocol to coordinate UAVs for sensing and transmission. Then we apply reinforcement learning in the cellular Internet of UAVs to solve key problems such as trajectory control and resource management.

abstract={With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) composed of multiple sensor nodes (SNs) have been able to provide a large number of high-quality services, such as continuous environmental monitoring, automatic control, and transmission of data for intelligent decision-making. SNs in WSNs are typically energy limited and often exist in large numbers, which are widely distributed in hard-to-reach areas. Hence, it is difficult to collect data from SNs without infrastructure support such as base stations (BSs). The low cost and high maneuverability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide an efficient solution for data acquisition in WSNs but with the challenge of control system of the UAV. In this paper, we proposed a deep reinforcement learning based UAV control system to intelligently solve the data harvesting problem in WSNs. Our optimization target is to jointly optimize the trajectory of the UAV and the bandwidth resources of the airborne base station to maximize the data acquisition success rate when the UAV is limited in energy. The objective function and constraints of this problem are highly non-convex. To solve this problem, we first modeled the movement of the UAV and the bandwidth allocation of the airborne base station in each time slot as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then we designed a deep reinforcement learning architecture to solve the above MDP. Compared with the existing data harvesting algorithms, the proposed method has a great improvement in data acquisition success rate.},

abstract={Unmanned vehicles that use vision sensors for perception to aid autonomous flight are a highly popular area of research. However, these systems are often prone to failures that are often hard to model. Previous work has focused on using deep learning to detect these failures. In this work, we build on these failure detection systems and develop a pipeline that learns to identify the correct trajectory to execute that restores the vision system and the unmanned vehicle to a safe state. The key challenge with using a deep learning pipeline for this problem is the limited amount of training data available from a real world system. Ideally one requires millions of data points to sufficiently train a model from scratch. However, this is not feasible for an unmanned aerial vehicle. The dataset we operate with is limited to 400-500 points. To sufficiently learn from such a small dataset we leverage the idea of transfer learning and non linear dimensionality reduction. We deploy our pipeline on an unmanned aerial vehicle flying autonomously through outdoor clutter (in a GPS denied environment) and show that we are able to achieve long durations of safe autonomous flight.},

abstract={Wildfires destroy thousands of hectares every summer all over the globe. To provide an effective response and to mitigate wildfires impact, firefighters require a real-time monitoring of the fire front. This paper proposes a cooperative reinforcement learning (RL) framework that allows a team of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to learn how to monitor a fire front. In the literature, independent Q-learners were proposed to solve a wildfire monitoring task with two UAVs. Here we propose a framework that can be easily extended to a larger number of UAVs. Our framework builds on two methods: multiple single trained Q-learning agents (MSTA) and value decomposition networks (VDN). MSTA trains a single UAV controller, which is then "copied" to each of the UAVs in the team. In contrast, VDN trains agents to learn how to cooperate. We benchmarked in simulations our two considered methods – MSTA and VDN – against two state-of-the-art approaches: independent Q-learners and a joint Q-learner. Simulation results show that our considered methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches in a wildfire front monitoring task with up to 9 fixed-wing and multi-copter UAVs.},

abstract={Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations (BSs) into terrestrial cellular networks has emerged as an effective solution to provide coverage and complement communication services in a fast and cost-effective manner. The three-dimensional (3D) trajectories of UAVs have a remarkable impact on the performance of such networks. On the other hand, UAVs are battery limited, and thus optimizing their energy consumption is of high importance. In this regard, we propose a novel trajectory design mechanism for rotary-wing UAV-BSs in 3D space to improve the energy efficiency of the network. In this approach, UAVs aim at maximizing an objective function which captures the tradeoff between energy consumption and throughput, while satisfying their ground users’ quality-ofservice requirements. Using reinforcement learning, we model our problem as a multi-armed bandit, and propose an upper confidence bound based algorithm to solve the problem. In our proposed mechanism, UAVs autonomously choose their velocities and update their locations adapted to the system conditions without requiring the prior and full knowledge of the system. Simulation results show that our proposed approach yields significant performance gains reaching up to 33∙85% in terms of improving the network throughput, and up to 95% of enhancing the energy efficiency compared to a learning based benchmark. Comparing to a non-learning based approach, our proposed approach improves the throughput and energy efficiency by 46∙61% and 110%, respectively.},

abstract={Due to the different seismic design of high and low-rise buildings, the seismic levels are often different in the same intensity area. Using remote sensing to distinguish various height buildings, and then further make targeted measures to reduce earthquake losses at all seismic levels, which can reduce the secondary disasters of earthquakes. Traditional architectural target detection models use artificially designed target features based on architectural contours, which not only require a lot of time and manpower to process the data, but also cause low detection accuracy due to inconsistent manual standards. The target detection model based on deep learning has high detection accuracy. However, for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing applications where real-time and accuracy requirements are relatively high, the acquired image information is less and the target features are not obvious, cause target detection accuracy to decrease. In order to improve the accuracy and speed of target detection, a building target detection model with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is proposed based on the YOLO V5 model, which improves the target classification accuracy and detection speed of building detection. The model is deployed on an automatic disaster monitoring platform to conduct a house environment target detection experiment. The comprehensive detection accuracy can reach 88.5%, and the detection speed is 26 frames/s, which meet the real-time and accuracy requirements of high-rise and low-rise building target detection.},

However, the efficiency still needs to be improved because the judgment of disaster damage by human is inefficient and fallible. So intelligent recognition method is considered to increase the efficiency and accuracy. For the training of intelligent recognition model based on deep learning network requires a large number of samples, a novel method is proposed in this paper. The Self Organizing Map (SOM) is introduced between the convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM), to reduce the number of training samples. Meanwhile, median filtering detection with Gaussian distribution is taken in the convolutional layer to decrease the influence of stochastic noise in the input picture. The dropout technique and multi winning neurons are introduced in the SOM to improve the clustering robust and reduce time consumption. Experimental results show that the proposed method shows good performance on the recognition of the damage images of the wire poles with complex backgrounds in the distribution network, and it is obviously superior to the traditional ways.},

abstract={In recent years, the objects detection algorithm of deep learning neural network has been widely used in scene monitoring fields such as intelligent transportation and ground observation. But scene changes always happen caused by the seasons and the ground feature cover change, which makes the training sample (source domain) different from the application scene (target domain), and causes the original effective model to generate a lot of false alarms. This paper proposes a domain adaptation algorithm for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) objects detection based on semi-supervised learning. Firstly applying the source domain model on target domain to generate pseudo-labels for semi-supervised learning, during fine-tuning the model with Pseudo-Label, the scale-aware loss is introduced to suppress false alarms in abnormal scale, which realize the domain adaptability of network model migration from source domain to target domain. Experiments on our dataset for monitoring ground objects show that: the proposed method avoids the catastrophic forgetting caused by the direct domain adaptation method without denoising, and maintains the target detection rate of the network model in different scenarios.},

One method of the smart road monitoring system is a fixed camera sensor as input and artificial intelligent as the analysis. However, these methods require a great infrastructure on highways such as: power supply, protective CPU, good power supply and stable computer network connections.

We chose Fixed-Wing UAV for its advantages: wide range and fast flight speed. The proposed system detects and classifies vehicles. Vehicles are detected and calcified using CNN's Deep Learning which uses the YOLO architecture. The level of traffic density is determined by the area of the road covered by vehicles to road area. We tested the proposed system using YouTube video and UAV video streaming. Both experimental scenarios have almost the same results.

abstract={With the wide applications of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the civilian and military fields, its operational safety has drawn much attention. A series of fault detection methods are studied to avoid disasters. Due to the capabilities of strong feature extraction and massive flight data processing, the deep learning-based methods have received extensive attention. However, restricted by UAV airborne size, weight, and power consumption, a significant challenge is posed to deploy these complicated detection methods in the airborne application, which requires to run in real time. In this article, a fault detection model acceleration engine (FDMAE) for UAV real-time fault detection is realized under the airborne constraint. First, a high-performance detection model is designed based on stacked long short-term memory networks, and fault detection is achieved by a statistical threshold in this method. Second, a model pruning method based on principal component analysis is proposed to improve computing efficiency. Finally, the pruned fault detection method is optimized and integrated as a flexible acceleration engine through high-level synthesis and deployed on an airborne embedded computing platform based on a field-programmable gate array. Real UAV flight data are used to verify the proposed FDMAE. By comparing accuracy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, speed, and power consumption, the effectiveness of the FDMAE is proven.},

abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence technology and the demand of air combat, autonomous maneuver decision of UAV has become a popular research direction. Scholars at home and abroad have researched on autonomous air combat maneuver decision of UAV in depth based on various technologies and have achieved some results, among which the maneuver decisions based on the reinforcement learning are more efficient. But at present, the simulation targets used to test the effectiveness of the UAV autonomous maneuver decision method are relatively fixed, which cannot reflect the complexity of the enemy's maneuver strategy under real air combat conditions. This paper designs and develops a set of UAV autonomous maneuver decision man-machine air combat system based on deep Q-learning network, which is built from three subsystem: air combat environment simulation subsystem, the manned aircraft operation simulation subsystem and UAV self-learning subsystem. It has been verified that the man-machine air combat system proposed in this paper can effectively simulate real air combat and verify the effectiveness of the UAV autonomous maneuver decision.},

abstract={Aerial inspection of agricultural regions can provide crucial information to safeguard from numerous obstacles to efficient farming. Farmland anomalies such as standing water, weed clusters, hamper the farming practices, which causes improper use of farm area and disrupts agricultural planning. Monitoring of farmland and crops through Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled smart systems has potential to increase the efficiency of modern farming techniques. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing is a powerful technique to acquire farmland images on a large scale. Visual data analytics for automatic pattern recognition from the collected data is useful for developing Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted farming models, which holds great promise in improving the farming outputs by capturing the crop patterns, farmland anomalies and providing predictive solutions to the inherent challenges faced by farmers. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework AgriSegNet for automatic detection of farmland anomalies using multiscale attention semantic segmentation of UAV acquired images. The proposed model is useful for monitoring of farmland and crops to increase the efficiency of precision farming techniques.},

abstract={Actuator is a critical part of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), for which accurate and speedy fault detection is of great significance in practical application. Data-driven method becomes more appealing due to its feasibility and high performance. However, the current fault detection method based on machine learning cannot realize feature selection and real-time detection, and its feature extraction and learning ability of time series is not high enough. To solve the above problems, we propose a new fault detection method based on maximal information coefficient and one dimensional convolutional neural network (MIC-1DCNN) approach. It combines the high feature extraction ability of one dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) for time series and the good feature selection ability of maximal information coefficient (MIC) for nonlinear data, which complete UAV actuator fault detection well and improve its efficiency greatly. The benchmark flight data set of the UAV is adopted for conducting experimental verification. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve satisfied performance in UAV actuator fault detection regarding speed and accuracy indices.},

abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence, multiagent algorithms have been applied to many real-time strategy games. Making plans on the human being is gradually passing away, especially in combat scenarios. Cognitive electronic warfare (CEW) is a complex and challenging work due to the sensitivity of the data sources. There are few studies on CEW. In the past, wargame simulations depended on differential equations and war theory, which resulted in high time and human resource costs. In the future, as other artificial intelligence theories are developed, artificial intelligence will play a more critical role in wargames. The capabilities of multiagent modeling to describe complex systems and predict actions in dynamic environments are superior to those of traditional methods. In this paper, we use a 3D wargame engine from China Aerospace System Simulation Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing) named All Domain Simulation (ACS), which supports land, sea, and air combat scenarios, to simulate combat. In the simulations, there are several unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) as attackers and several radar stations as defenders, and both have the ability to detect the others. In the game, several UAVs need to learn to detect targets and track targets separately, and we train the UAV's behavior by well-designed reward shaping and multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) with LSTM. We improved the RDPG algorithm and merged the MADDPG and RDPG algorithms. From the experimental results, we can see that the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm have been greatly improved.},

The Convolutional Support Vector Machine (CSVM) network was recently proposed as binary classifier for the detection of objects in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. The training phase of the CSVM is based on convolutional layers that learn the kernel weights via a set of linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This paper proposes the Multi-scale Convolutional Support Vector Machine (MCSVM) network, that is an ensemble of CSVM classifiers which process patches of different spatial sizes and can deal with multi-class classification problems.

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operators must maintain high levels of situation awareness on their area of operation. To achieve this, they use the a Command and Control (C2) map, which is shared among forces, and regularly overloaded with data that is irrelevant to their operational mission. Operators require distilled information at the right timing. Yet, the existing filtering mechanisms for C2 maps are layer-based and insufficient. We propose a new approach to automatically and dynamically filter information items on the map based on environmental and mission context. To achieve this, we introduce a three-tiers artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithm (GiCo-MAF), where we delineate the use of machine learning (ML) models to support UAV missions. For the GiCoMAF development, tagged data was collected in simulated experimental runs with professional UAS operators. Different types of ML models were evaluated and fitted into the algorithm. The models achieved a relatively high accuracy at modeling human preference and area of interest. The approach presented in this study can be further implemented to support time-critical spatial-temporal operational problems.},

This paper considers the design of two rate parameters, i.e., transmission rate and confidential information rate, and analyzes their impacts on security performance of physical layer. The physical layer security model of UAV swarm network is established by placing the eavesdroppers on the ground and assuming that they obey a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP). The expression of the secrecy outage probability and the connection outage probability is derived firstly, then the secrecy throughput is maximized by carefully choosing the two rate parameters under the on-off strategy and the non-on-off strategy, respectively, and the influence of density of eavesdroppers on security performance is analyzed.

abstract={The emerging Flying ad-hoc Network (FANET) has been used in many applications and services ranging from military to emergency rescue. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clustering is a significant technology in FANETs. In each cluster, the cluster head (CH) is responsible for cluster management. However, due to the frequent movement and limited energy of UAVs, one of the foremost challenges in FANETs is unstable communication performance of cluster. Hence, to cope with this issue, we propose a Mobility Aware Clustering scheme based on Swarm Intelligence (MACSI) for FANETs, which is enlightened by animal collective behavior. More specifically, the modified glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) algorithm based on chaos strategy is put forward for CH selection and cluster formation. It aims to help UAVs cooperate with each other to conduct missions and change their positions accordingly. In addition, a stable CH selection mechanism depends on energy, position and the movement relationship. Our proposal has been evaluated with respect to metrics as energy consumption and cluster life time. The experimental results obtained validate that, the proposed scheme has less energy consumption and extended cluster life time compared with existing clustering schemes.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are widely utilized for video capturing, processing and transmission have to address jamming attacks with dynamic topology and limited energy. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based UAV anti-jamming video transmission scheme to choose the video compression quantization parameter, the channel coding rate, the modulation and power control strategies against jamming attacks. More specifically, this scheme applies RL to choose the UAV video compression and transmission policy based on the observed video task priority, the UAV-controller channel state and the received jamming power. This scheme enables the UAV to guarantee the video quality-of-experience (QoE) and reduce the energy consumption without relying on the jamming model or the video service model. A safe RL-based approach is further proposed, which uses deep learning to accelerate the UAV learning process and reduce the video transmission outage probability. The computational complexity is provided and the optimal utility of the UAV is derived and verified via simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly improve the video quality and reduce the transmission latency and energy consumption of the UAV compared with existing schemes.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have gained major attention in recent years due to its numerous benefits. The navigation of UAVs is heavily reliant on sensors such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). However, sensor attacks that specifically target the GPS are a major concern. Equipment such as the software-defined radio can be used to launch GPS spoofing attacks. Existing techniques used to monitor the GPS and channel characteristics as a way to detect these attacks are insufficient due to the clear knowledge of the structure of GPS and channel characteristics which gives adversaries a blueprint to launch stealthy attacks. In this work, we developed various deep learning models that rely on UAV flight logs and telemetry data to detect GPS spoofing attacks in real time. We generate UAV data for different UAV models and use the data to train the models to detect the GPS spoofing attacks through classification. We developed two types of detectors: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) binary classifier and an LSTM autoencoder-based one-class classifier (OCC). For each type, we compared two variations namely a UAV-specific detector that is customized for different UAV types and a UAV-generalized detector that can work with any model of UAV. We test and compare the efficiency of detection models in simulation. Hardware validation experiments were also performed using Intel® NCS2. For the binary classifier, we get a detection accuracy of 97.79% for the UAV-generalized detector and up to 99.56% for the UAV-model-specific detector. While for the OCC, we get 94.98% for the UAV-generalized detector and up to 99.24% for the UAV-model-specific detector.},

abstract={Object tracking remains one of the fundamental problems of computer vision since it becomes difficult under some realistic conditions such as fast camera movement, occlusion and similar of objects to the tracked targets. As a real-world application, tracking objects using cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become very popular. With the increasing availability of small single board computers with high parallel processing power capabilities, tracking of objects by using onboard computers within UAVs in real-time has become feasible. Although these onboard computers allow a wide variety of computer vision methods to be executed on a UAV, there is still a need to optimize these methods for running time and power consumption. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method for a UAV to detect and track other UAVs efficiently. To detect the target UAV at the beginning of the video and in the case where the tracked UAV has been lost, we use the deep learning-based YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-Tiny models, which provide one of the best trade-offs between speed and accuracy in the literature. To track the detected UAVs in real-time, a kernelized correlation filter is used. Combining these two methods provides high accuracy and speed even on onboard computers. To train the neural nets and test our method, we have collected a new dataset composed of videos of various UAVs in flight, captured from another UAV. The performance of the proposed method has been compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the literature on this dataset. Additionally, we also tested the proposed trackers on aerial videos captured from UAVs. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid trackers achieve the state-of-the-art performance on all tested datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/bdrhn9/hybrid-tracker.},

abstract={With the rapid development of technology in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), more and more UAVs are used by power supply companies for power line inspection and maintenance.

Worse still, the geographical positions of abnormal power towers are difficult to be obtained so that the maintenance team has no direction to proceed. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method for detecting and locating abnormal power towers from the aerial images captured by UAVs. In this method, an objection detection algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is firstly designed to identify and detect abnormal power towers from aerial images. Secondly, the geographical positions of the detected abnormal power towers are approximated by UAV metadata recorded in aerial images (e.g. pixel size, altitude, pitch angle, roll angle, yaw angle, et al.) and several coordinate transformations. Compared with the classical image processing methods, the present method is automatic and end-to-end, and can be easily applied in the UAV based inspection of power transmission lines.},

However, almost all existing FL paradigms are still centralized (i.e., a central entity is in charge of ML model aggregation and fusion over the whole network), which could result in the issue of a single point of failure and are inappropriate to UAV networks with both unreliable nodes and links. Thus motivated, in this article, we propose a novel architecture called Decentralized Federated Learning for UAV Networks (DFL-UN), which enables FL within UAV networks without a central entity. We also conduct a preliminary simulation study to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the DFLUN architecture. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and potential research directions in the DFL-UN.},

abstract={In this study machine learning methods were applied to RGB data obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to assess this effectiveness in vineyard classification. The very high-resolution UAV-based imagery was subjected to a photogrammetric processing allowing the generation of different outcomes: orthophoto mosaic, crop surface model and five vegetation indices. The orthophoto mosaic was used in an object-based image analysis approach to group pixels with similar values into objects. Three machine learning techniques-support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN)-were applied to classify the data into four classes: grapevine, shadow, soil and other vegetation. The data were divided with 22% (n=240, 60 per class) for training purposes and 78% (n = 850) for testing purposes. The mean value of the objects from each feature were used to create a dataset for prediction. The results demonstrated that both RF and ANN models showed a good performance, yet the RF classifier achieved better results.},

abstract={Recently, rapid deployment on fifth-generation (5G) networks has brought great opportunities for the enabling data-intensive applications, and brings an extending expectation on the developments of 6G. A basic requirement to develop 6G networks is to reach data with low latency, low cost and high coverage in smart IoT. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel machine learning based approach to collect data from multiple sensor devices by cooperation between vehicle and UAV in IoT. Firstly, genetic algorithm is utilized to select vehicular collectors to collect massive data from sensor devices, which aims to maximize coverage ratio and to minimize employment cost. Secondly, we design a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based route policy to plan collection routes of UAVs with constrain energy, which simplifies the network model, accelerates training speeds and realizes dynamic planning of flight paths. The optimal collection route of an UAV is a series of outputs based on the proposed DRL-based route policy. Finally, our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme can comprehensively improve the coverage ratio of massive data collections and reduce collection costs in smart IoT for the future 6G networks.},

abstract={Recent ultra-fast development of artificial intelligence algorithms has demanded dedicated neural network accelerators, whose high computing performance and low power consumption enable the deployment of deep learning algorithms on the edge computing nodes. State-of-the-art deep learning engines mostly support supervised learning such as CNN, RNN, whereas very few AI engines support on-chip reinforcement learning, which is the foremost algorithm kernel for decision-making subsystem of an autonomous system. In this work, a Coarse-grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) like AI computing engine has been designed for the deployments of both supervised and reinforcement learning. Logic synthesis at the design frequency of 200MHz based on 65nm CMOS technology reveals the physical statistics of the proposed engine of 0.32mm2 in silicon area, 15.45 mW in power consumption. The proposed on-chip AI engine facilitates the implementation of end-to-end perceptual and decision-making networks, which can find its wide employment in autonomous driving, robotics and UAVs.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized to serve on-ground users with various services, e.g., computing, communication and caching, due to their mobility and flexibility. The main focus of many recent studies on UAVs is to deploy a set of homogeneous UAVs with identical capabilities controlled by one UAV owner/company to provide services. However, little attention has been paid to the issue of how to enable different UAV owners to provide services with differentiated service capabilities in a shared area. To address this issue, we propose a multi-agent imitation learning enabled UAV deployment approach to maximize both profits of UAV owners and utilities of on-ground users. Specially, a Markov game is formulated among UAV owners and we prove that a Nash equilibrium exists based on the full knowledge of the system. For online scheduling with incomplete information, we design agent policies by imitating the behaviors of corresponding experts. A novel neural network model, integrating convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks and a gradient-based policy, can be trained and executed in a fully decentralized manner with a guaranteed -Nash equilibrium. Performance results show that our algorithm has significant superiority on average profits, utilities and execution time compared with other representative algorithms.},

abstract={Thanks to the high mobility and rich sensing capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, they are increasingly leveraged to perform a series of military and civilian tasks today. Meanwhile, UAVs are also facing various security and safety concerns raised by both external attacks and internal hardware/software failures. Therefore, detecting the abnormal status of a UAV is a critical task to protect it against malicious adversaries and prevent potential crashes. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection system for UAVs by monitoring and analyzing their sensor data in real-time using deep learning approaches. The proposed system leverages the convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract and learn features automatically from raw sensor data and then process them to support anomaly detection. We construct a data set of UAV IMU sensor data using our UAV cybersecurity simulation platform to support the training of our CNN model. Different deep learning models are also evaluated and compared in this paper. We validate the performance of the proposed detection system using extensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates that our system achieves high detection accuracy under different conditions.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can pose a major risk for aviation safety, due to both negligent and malicious use. For this reason, the automated detection and tracking of UAV is a fundamental task in aerial security systems. Common technologies for UAV detection include visible-band and thermal infrared imaging, radio frequency and radar. Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) for image-based object detection open the possibility to use visual information for this detection and tracking task. Furthermore, these detection architectures can be implemented as backbones for visual tracking systems, thereby enabling persistent tracking of UAV incursions. To date, no comprehensive performance benchmark exists that applies DNNs to visible-band imagery for UAV detection and tracking. To this end, three datasets with varied environmental conditions for UAV detection and tracking, comprising a total of 241 videos (331,486 images), are assessed using four detection architectures and three tracking frameworks. The best performing detector architecture obtains an mAP of 98.6% and the best performing tracking framework obtains a MOTA of 98.7%. Cross-modality evaluation is carried out between visible and infrared spectrums, achieving a maximal 82.8% mAP on visible images when training in the infrared modality. These results provide the first public multi-approach benchmark for state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods and give insight into which detection and tracking architectures are effective in the UAV domain.},

abstract={Coupled with the rise of Deep Learning, the wealth of data and enhanced computation capabilities of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components enable effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models to be built. Beyond ground data sources, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based service providers for data collection and AI model training, i.e., Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS), is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. However, the stringent regulations governing data privacy potentially impedes data sharing across independently owned UAVs. To this end, we propose the adoption of a Federated Learning (FL) based approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative Machine Learning across a federation of independent DaaS providers for the development of IoV applications, e.g., for traffic prediction and car park occupancy management. Given the information asymmetry and incentive mismatches between the UAVs and model owners, we leverage on the self-revealing properties of a multi-dimensional contract to ensure truthful reporting of the UAV types, while accounting for the multiple sources of heterogeneity, e.g., in sensing, computation, and transmission costs. Then, we adopt the Gale-Shapley algorithm to match the lowest cost UAV to each subregion. The simulation results validate the incentive compatibility of our contract design, and shows the efficiency of our matching, thus guaranteeing profit maximization for the model owner amid information asymmetry.},
