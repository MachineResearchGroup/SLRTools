abstract={With the advancement of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV swarm has been showing its great security threats towards the ground facility. With current technologies, it is still challenging in unknown UAV swarm tracking and neutralization. In this paper, we propose an analytical method in predicting drone flying behavior based on the machine learning algorithm, which could be integrated into swarm behavior prediction. Radiofrequency (RF) signals emitted from the UAV are captured by software-defined radio (SDR) to form the time series data. By using conventional short-time Fourier transform (STFT), a time-frequency spectrum revealing the RF data energy distribution is obtained for analyzing the signal variance pattern formed by the two different types of UAV flying trajectory. The transformed time-frequency domain matrix would be applied in multiple machine learning classifier for telling the difference of different flying trajectory. The results present the applicability of using machine learning in predicting the flying features and modes of intruding UAV swarm. It shows the potential application of this method in realizing effective UAV swarm negation.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is more and more widely used in the field of civil and military information acquisition. GPS plays the most critical part of UAVs' navigation and positioning. However, since the communication channel of the GPS signals is open, attackers can disguise as real GPS signals to launch GPS spoofing attacks on civilian UAVs. At present, the detection schemes for GPS spoofing attacks can be divided into three categories respectively based on encryption and digital signatures, the characteristics of the GPS signal and various external characteristics of UAVs. However, there are some problems in these methods, such as low computing efficiency, difficulty in equipment upgrading, and limited application scenarios. To solve these problems, we propose a new GPS spoofing attack detection method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which is a machine learning algorithm. In order to improve the detection ratio, after the machine learning algorithm, we let the UAVs fly according to the path of a specific shape to accurately detect GPS spoofing attacks. This is also the first time machine learning has been used to detect GPS spoofing attacks. According to our algorithm, we can detect GPS spoofing attacks accurately and quickly in a short time. This paper describes in detail the algorithm we proposed to resist GPS spoofing attacks, and the corresponding experiments are carried out in the simulation environment. The experimental results show that our method can quickly and accurately detect UAV GPS spoofing attacks without requiring upgrades to existing equipment.},

abstract={Many mechanical parts of multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (MUAV) can easily produce non-smooth phenomenon and the external disturbance that affects the stability of MUAV. For multi-MUAV attitude systems that experience output dead-zone, external disturbance and actuator fault, a leader-following consensus anti-disturbance and fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme is proposed in this paper. In the design process, the effect of unknown nonlinearity in multi-MUAV systems is addressed using neural networks (NNs). In order to balance out the effects of external disturbance and actuator fault, a disturbance observer is designed to compensate for the aforementioned negative impacts. The Nussbaum function is used to address the problem of output dead-zone. The designed fault-tolerant controller guarantees that the output signals of all followers and leader are synchronized by the backstepping technique. Finally, the effectiveness of the control scheme is verified by simulation experiments.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly accessible to the public due to their high availability with affordable prices while being equipped with better technology. However, this raises a great concern from both the cyber and physical security perspectives since UAVs can be utilized for malicious activities in order to exploit vulnerabilities by spying on private properties, critical areas or to carry dangerous objects such as explosives which makes them a great threat to the society. Drone identification is considered the first step in a multi-procedural process in securing physical infrastructure against this threat. In this paper, we present drone detection and identification methods using deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN). These algorithms will be utilized to exploit the unique acoustic fingerprints of the flying drones in order to detect and identify them. We propose a comparison between the performance of different neural networks based on our dataset which features audio recorded samples of drone activities. The major contribution of our work is to validate the usage of these methodologies of drone detection and identification in real life scenarios and to provide a robust comparison of the performance between different deep neural network algorithms for this application. In addition, we are releasing the dataset of drone audio clips for the research community for further analysis.},

abstract={In this article, we study the pricing and resource management in the Internet of Things (IoT) system with blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and mobile-edge computing (MEC). The BaaS model includes the cloud-based server to perform blockchain tasks and the set of peers to collect data from local IoT devices. The MEC model consists of the set of terrestrial and aerial base stations (BSs), i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to forward the tasks of peers to the BaaS server. Each BS is also equipped with an MEC server to run some blockchain tasks. As the BSs can be privately owned or controlled by different operators, there is no information exchange among them. We show that the resource management and pricing in the BaaS-MEC system are modeled as a stochastic Stackelberg game with multiple leaders and incomplete information about actions of leaders/BSs and followers/peers. We formulate a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for the decision makings of BSs and peers. We also develop an unsupervised hierarchical deep learning (HDL) algorithm that combines deep $Q$ -learning (DQL) for BSs with the Bayesian deep learning (BDL) for peers. We prove that the proposed algorithms converge to stable states in which the peers' actions are the best responses to optimal actions of BSs.},

abstract={In this correspondence paper, we focus on a cellular network aided an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that serves as an aerial base station for multiple ground users. The UAV's trajectory design is investigated to maximize the expected uplink sum rate with inaccessibility to user-side information, such as locations and transmit power as well as channel parameters. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved with model-free reinforcement learning. Due to the continuous and deterministic action space, the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) algorithm is applied for the reinforcement learning model. Experiment results show that due to the great generalizability of the reinforcement learning model, the UAV is able to intelligently track the ground users with the learned trajectory despite being unaware of the user-side information and channel parameters, even when the ground users are mobile. The performance of the learned trajectory is fairly close to that of the optimized trajectory derived through conventional optimization problem solving with such information explicitly known. Moreover, we also show that the DPG algorithm converges efficiently with acceptable training time.},

We adopt reinforcement learning for assisting UAVs to learn collision avoidance without knowing the trajectories of other UAVs in advance. In addition, for each UAV, we use optimization theory to find out a shortest backward path that assures data collection from all associated IoT devices. To obtain an optimal visiting order for IoT devices, we formulate and solve a no-return traveling salesman problem. Given a visiting order, we formulate and solve a sequence of convex optimization problems to obtain line segments of an optimal backward path for heterogeneous ground IoT devices. We use analytical results and simulation results to justify the usage of the proposed approach. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is superior to a number of alternative approaches.},

abstract={Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising technology to unlock the full potential of UAVs in the future by reusing the cellular base stations (BSs) to enable their air-ground communications. However, how to achieve ubiquitous three-dimensional (3D) communication coverage for the UAVs in the sky is a new challenge. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by a new coverage-aware navigation approach, which exploits the UAV's controllable mobility to design its navigation/trajectory to avoid the cellular BSs' coverage holes while accomplishing their missions. To this end, we formulate an UAV trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of its mission completion time and expected communication outage duration, which, however, cannot be solved by the standard optimization techniques due to the lack of an accurate and tractable end-to-end communication model in practice. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a new solution approach based on the technique of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, by leveraging the state-of-the-art dueling double deep Q network (dueling DDQN) with multi-step learning, we first propose a UAV navigation algorithm based on direct RL, where the signal measurement at the UAV is used to directly train the action-value function of the navigation policy. To further improve the performance, we propose a new framework called simultaneous navigation and radio mapping (SNARM), where the UAV's signal measurement is used not only for training the DQN directly, but also to create a radio map that is able to predict the outage probabilities at all locations in the area of interest. This enables the generation of simulated UAV trajectories and predicting their expected returns, which are then used to further train the DQN via Dyna technique, thus greatly improving the learning efficiency.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained momentum as one of the potential solutions in 5G networks. Indeed, using UAVs as Aerial Base Stations (ABS) to assist the traditional cellular infrastructure and/or extend its coverage represents a high-potential flexible and cost-effective approach to provide on-demand communications in these new generations of networks. Yet, their effective deployment brings out many challenges, including their optimal 3D placement, coverage optimization, backhaul constraints, etc. Hence, we tackle these challenges by proposing a new framework for 3D positioning of an ABS swarm in order to extend the coverage of ground base stations (GBS). Unlike existing work that ignore ABS's limited backhaul capacity and how it restraints the number of users that can be served, we consider a multi-hop backhaul scheme that allows ABSs to remain connected to the core network through the GBSs directly, or other deployed ABSs. Under this setup, we aim to maximize the number of served UEs, by optimizing the ABS's placement, jointly with their association with UEs and backhauling base stations. Besides, our framework, named ASF for Adaptive Social Spider Optimization based framework, uses machine learning techniques to predict the users' mobility and enable ABSs to adjust their position according to their spatial distribution. Simulations show that ASF framework significantly improves the cellular network's coverage and provides access to 92\% of mobile users, as compared to other benchmark schemes that only serve 79% and 58% of users.},

abstract={Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm has been increasingly studied to collect data from ground sensors in remote and hostile areas. A key challenge is the joint design of the velocities and data collection schedules of the UAVs, as inadequate velocities and schedules would lead to failed transmissions and buffer overflows of sensors and, in turn, significant packet losses. In this paper, we optimize jointly the velocity controls and data collection schedules of multiple UAVs to minimize data losses, adapting to the battery levels, queue lengths and channel conditions of the ground sensors, and the trajectories of the UAVs. In the absence of the up-to-date knowledge of the ground sensors’ states, a Multi-UAV Deep Reinforcement Learning based Scheduling Algorithm (MADRL-SA) is proposed to allow the UAVs to asymptotically minimize the data loss of the system under the outdated knowledge of the network states at individual UAVs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MADRL-SA reduces the packet loss by up to 54% and 46% in the considered simulation setting, as compared to an existing DRL solution with single-UAV and non-learning greedy heuristic, respectively.},

abstract={This paper studies the problem of spectrum shortage in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network during critical missions such as wildfire monitoring, search and rescue, and disaster monitoring. Such applications involve a high demand for high-throughput data transmissions such as real-time video-, image-, and voice- streaming where the assigned spectrum to the UAV network may not be adequate to provide the desired Quality of Service (QoS). In these scenarios, the aerial network can borrow an additional spectrum from the available terrestrial networks in trade of a relaying service for them. We propose a spectrum sharing model in which the UAVs are grouped into two classes of relaying UAVs that service the spectrum owner and the sensing UAVs that perform the disaster relief mission using the obtained spectrum. The operation of the UAV network is managed by a hierarchical mechanism in which a central controller assigns the tasks of the UAVs based on their resources and determine their operation region based on the level of priority of impacted areas and then the UAVs autonomously fine-tune their position using a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize the individual throughput and prolong their lifetime. We analyze the performance and the convergence for the proposed method analytically and with extensive simulations in different scenarios.},

Low earth orbit (LEO) satellites provide access beams for UAVs, and the UAV transmits the collected data to the satellite via uplink. Due to the unknown and uncertain environment, it is difficult for large UAV to get an effective planned flight trajectory, and the presence of malicious jamming further exacerbates the complexity of trajectory control. To address this problem, a reinforcement learning (RL) based trajectory control approach is proposed to explore the unknown jamming environment and realize autonomous trajectory planning.

abstract={Technological evolutions in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry have granted UAVs more computing and storage resources, leading to the vision of UAVs-assisted edge computing, in which the computing missions can be offloaded from a cellular network to a UAV cloudlet. In this paper, we propose a UAVs-assisted computation offloading paradigm, where a group of UAVs fly around, while providing value-added edge computing services. The complex computing missions are decomposed as some typical task-flows with inter-dependencies. By taking into consideration the inter-dependencies of the tasks, dynamic network states, and energy constraints of the UAVs, we formulate the average mission response time minimization problem and then model it as a Markov decision process. Specifically, each time a mission arrives or a task execution finishes, we should decide the target helper for the next task execution and the fraction of the bandwidth allocated to the communication. To separate the evaluation of the integrated decision, we propose multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, where the target helper and the bandwidth allocation are determined by two agents. We design respective advantage evaluation functions for the agents to solve the multi-agent credit assignment challenge, and further extend the on-policy algorithm to off-policy. Simulation results show that the proposed MARL-based approaches have desirable convergence property, and can adapt to the dynamic environment. The proposed approaches can significantly reduce the average mission response time compared with other benchmark approaches.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted wireless communication has recently been recognized as an inevitably promising component of future wireless networks. Particularly, UAVs can be utilized as relays to establish or improve network connectivity thanks to their flexible mobility and likely line-of-sight channel conditions. However, this gives rise to more harmful security issues due to potential adversaries, particularly active eavesdroppers. To combat active eavesdroppers, we propose an artificial-noise beamforming based secure transmission scheme for a full-duplex UAV relaying scenario. In the considered scheme, we investigate a UAV-relay equipped with multiple antennas to securely serve multiple ground users in the presence of randomly located active eavesdroppers. We formulate a novel average system secrecy rate (ASSR) maximization problem under some quality of service (QoS) and mission time constraints. Since the ASSR optimization problem is too hard to solve by conventional optimization methods due to the unavailability of the environment's dynamics and complex model, we develop some model-free reinforcement learning-based algorithms, i.e., Q-learning, SARSA, Expected SARSA, Double Q-learning, and SARSA(λ), to efficiently solve the problem without substantial UAV-network data exchange. Using the proposed algorithms, we can maximize ASSR via finding an optimal UAV trajectory and proper resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that all the proposed learning-based algorithms can train the UAV-relay to learn the environment by iterative interactions, thus finding an optimal trajectory, intelligently. Particularly, we find that SARSA(λ) based proposed algorithm with λ = 0.1 outperforms the others in terms of the ASSR.},

We built these models using the machine learning algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (Mars), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, Ridge Regression (Ridge), and Cubist based on UAV hyperspectral data and heavy metal field fast detection data in typical potentially contaminated sites. The parameters of the hyperspectral data were original reflectivity, smoothed reflectivity, first-order derivative, second-order derivative, and the de-enveloping spectrum. The results showed that to classify soil zinc pollution risk, the machine learning model based on the second-order derivative spectrum performed better than the other hyperspectral parameter independent variables. The overall classification accuracy of the MARS model based on the second-order derivative spectrum was 89.29%. The XGBoost model based on the second-order derivative spectrum performed the best in estimating zinc content, with results of R2 = 0.59. When the zinc (Zn) content was less than 1000mg/kg, the model accuracy was stable. This method doesn't rely on soil samples, and thus avoids uncertainty caused by the selection of sensitive bands in heavy metal inversion. This method provides a basis for large-scale fast investigation of soil heavy metal pollution based on limited ground monitoring point data.},

abstract={In this paper, a new algorithm for detecting and identifying faults in a UAV system is proposed, this algorithm uses Color Images obtained from Time-Frequency-Amplitude (CITFA) graphs for faults classification. The most important innovations of CITFA algorithm are, image based processing and classification using deep neural network. In most systems, faults can cause irreparable costs. For this reason, detecting and identifying faults is one of the most important issues, today. In this paper, a variety of sensor and actuator faults are investigated. The paper focus is mostly on deep learning and time-frequency graphs. The selected system for fault detection and proposed algorithm implementation is a UAV system. After designing the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller for the system, a variety of faulty signals are made. Using the proposed algorithm, these signals are converted to images.

abstract={Next-generation communication networks tend to bring global connectivity, even in rural areas, disaster areas, etc., where terrestrial base stations are difficult or impossible to develop. For this reason, the aerial platform is considered a compulsory technology for future networks, where the aerial vehicles act as access points from the sky. In this paper, we study a mobile edge computing (MEC)-enhanced aerial serving network scenario that the aerial vehicles, such as drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), etc., are flying in the sky to serve remote areas, where have no terrestrial base station. In addition, a high-altitude platform (HAP) equipped with a computing server plays the role of mobile edge computing (MEC) that enhances the performance of the system. In this scenario, we consider a partial offloading scheme, where the aerial vehicles decide to choose the offloading destination and the offloading rate to minimize the total cost function for completing the tasks. Considering network dynamics, we use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to represent the problem, and propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based algorithm, named HAMEC, to solve the problem. The experimental results demonstrate that HAMEC outperforms benchmark schemes.},

abstract={This paper designs Artificial Intelligence (AI) method, to determine an optimal trajectory for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) mounted mobile base station to maximize its coverage of distinct users. Determining such an optimal trajectory for arbitrarily distributed users over an area is, in general, difficult and there is no closed-form solution. Since the users are arbitrarily located the method must adapt accordingly. To accomplish this, the problem is formulated in a way that is compatible with Reinforcement Learning (RL) and two AI approaches are designed to learn an optimal trajectory. The first uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) implemented with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) while the second is a reward-based greedy algorithm. It is shown that these new algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art previously proposed deep learning based approaches. Moreover, the simple AI-based greedy approach is shown to perform close to the DQN-aided DRL algorithm at a much lower computational complexity at least in the type of scenarios considered in this paper.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology is recognized as a promising solution to area coverage problems (ACPs) and has been extensively studied recently. In this paper, we study the 3D irregular terrain surface coverage problem with a hierarchical UAV swarm. We first build the 3D model of a random irregular terrain and propose a geometric way to project the 3D terrain surface into many weighted 2D patches. Then we develop a two-level hierarchical UAV swarm architecture, including the low-level follower UAVs (FUAVs) and the high-level leader UAVs (LUAVs). For FUAVs, we design a coverage trajectory algorithm to carry out specific coverage tasks within patches based on the star communication topology. For LUAVs, we propose a swarm deep Q-learning (SDQN) reinforcement learning algorithm to select patches. Moreover, an observation history model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the mean embedding method is integrated into SDQN to address the communication limitation problems of LUAVs. The numerical results show that FUAVs can cover the entire area of each patch with little redundancies, and the total coverage time of the SDQN is less than that of existing methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

In this context, time-consuming tasks such as crop monitoring may be solved in a more efficient and less error-prone manner. In particular, for estimating productivity and managing pests, a key task that may be automated is the characterization of crop regions into full-grown trees, tree seedlings, tree gaps, and background. In this paper, we address the classification of aerial images into these classes, targeting at samples from a citrus plantation acquired by UAVs. Although Deep Learning-based approaches have been used successfully for many classification problems, little is discussed on the effects of parameters tuning (involving features, classifiers, and sampling methods) for each specific problem. Therefore, our goal is to solve this task while addressing explainability, by running an experimental analysis that explores classical methods as well as Deep Learning-based approaches.},

abstract={Knowing the spatial distribution of endangered tree species in a forest ecosystem or forest remnants is a valuable information to support environmental conservation practices. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers a suitable alternative for this task, providing very high-resolution images at low costs. In parallel, recent advances in the computer vision field have led to the development of effective deep learning techniques for end-to-end semantic image segmentation. In this scenario, the DeepLabv3+ is well established as the state-of-the-art deep learning method for semantic segmentation tasks. The present paper proposes and assesses the use of DeepLabv3+ for mapping the threatened Dipteryx alata Vogel tree, popularly also known as cumbaru. We also compare two backbone networks for feature extraction in the DeepLabv3+ architecture: the Xception and MobileNetv2. Experiments carried out on a dataset consisting of 225 UAV/RGB images of an urban area in Midwest Brazil demonstrated that DeepLabv3+ was able to achieve in mean overall accuracy and Fl-score above 90%, and IoU above 80%. The experimental analysis also pointed out that the MobileNetv2 backbone overcame its counterpart by a wide margin due to its comparatively simpler architecture in view of the available training data.},

abstract={As a promising technique for realizing future wireless networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications have drawn numerous attentions. The performance of practical UAV communication systems is limited by the presence of inevitable jittering due to the inherent random wind gusts. The jittering introduces angle ambiguity which is challenging for aligning the information beams between the UAV-mounted base station (BS) and the user equipment (UE). This letter develops a learning-based predictive beamforming scheme to address the beam misalignment caused by UAV jittering. In particular, a deep learning approach is adopted to predict the angles between the UAV and the UE. By doing so, the UAV and the UE can prepare the transmit and receive beams in advance, which enables reliable UAV-based communication. Simulation results verify that the communication performance of the proposed scheme is robust to the presence of UAV jittering.},

abstract={Image and video analysis in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have been a recent interest in many applications since the images taken by UAV systems can provide useful information in many domains including maintenance, surveillance and entertainment. However, a constraint on UAVs is having limited battery power and recent developments in the artificial intelligence (AI) domain encourages many applications to run computationally heavy algorithms on the taken UAV images. Such applications drain the power from the on-board battery rapidly, while requiring strong computationally strong resources. An alternative to that approach is offloading heavy tasks such as object segmentation to a remote (edge) server and perform the heavy computation on that server. However, the effect of the communication system and the used channel introduce noise on the transferred data and the effect of the noise due to the use of such LTE communication system on pre-trained deep networks has not been previously studied in the literature. In this paper, we study one such scenario where the images taken by UAVs and (the same images) transferred to an edge server via an LTE communication system under different scenarios. In our case, the edge server runs an off-the-shelf pretrained deep learning algorithm to segment the transmitted image. We provide an analysis of the effect of the wireless channel and the communication system on the final segmentation of the transmitted image on such a scenario.},

abstract={To collect data of distributed sensors located at different areas in challenging scenarios through artificial way is obviously inefficient, due to the numerous labor and time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) emerges as a promising solution, which enables multi-UAV collect data automatically with the preassigned path. However, without a well-planned path, the required number and consumed energy of UAVs will increase dramatically. Thus, minimizing the required number and optimizing the path of UAVs, referred as multi-UAV path planning, are essential to achieve the efficient data collection. Therefore, some heuristic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) which works well for multi-UAV path planning have been proposed. Nevertheless, in challenging scenarios with high requirement for timeliness, the performance of convergence speed of above algorithms is imperfect, which will lead to an inefficient optimization process and delay the data collection. Deep learning (DL), once trained by enough datasets, has high solving speed without worries about convergence problems. Thus, in this paper, we propose an algorithm called Deep Learning Trained by Genetic Algorithm (DL-GA), which combines the advantages of DL and GA. GA will collect states and paths from various scenarios and then use them to train the deep neural network so that while facing the familiar scenarios, it can rapidly give the optimized path, which can satisfy high timeliness requirements. Numerous experiments demonstrate that the solving speed of DL-GA is much faster than GA almost without loss of optimization capacity and even can outperform GA under some specific conditions.},

With the enormous rise in the use of powerlines in complex terrains, vegetation encroachment of overhead powerlines has become an important issue that causes severe powerline failures. Some of the possibilities include falling of trees on or growing into the transmission lines that causes power outages or starting a fire in surrounding areas is a significant concern. This causes a significant threat to the security and stability of the power grids. Thus, it is significant to detect vegetation encroachment for ensuring the security and reliability in operating the power systems. As regular overhead inspections of powerlines are expensive and require a systematic inspection to overcome power outages. UAVs combined with deep learning methods are a viable option for addressing the vegetation encroachment problem that poses a significant risk of powerline failures.},

abstract={This paper investigates the feasibility of using an end-to-end lightweight convolutional neural network to estimate object pose for the micro unmanned aerial vehicles. While the deep learning methods have achieved great successes in object detection, tracking, segmentation, etc., only a few solutions in state-of-the-art methods are designed to estimate object pose. In this work, we propose a lightweight uncalibrated neural network that directly estimates the 4-DoF gate pose from UAV uncalibrated monovision. The proposed method is trained and tested in Gazebo simulation and on a micro racing drone equipped with an Intel UP board computer. The experimental results in both simulation and real-world flying demonstrated that the proposed method could provide the UAV a coarse pose of a gate for its dynamic path planning.},

abstract={Commonly, machine learning (ML) workflows for training and inferencing occur in resource rich environments. Draper Laboratory is pushing ML to the edge. This paper shows the concept of operations (CONOPs), design parameters, and constraints the team faced for edge implementation. The overarching requirement is to fully integrate the machine learning element into the small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone. Given the limited payload capacity and power available on small UAVs, integration of computing resources sufficient to host both ML and Autonomy functions is a challenge. Past efforts have relied on an Intel NUC as the primary processing unit. However, recent advances in GPUs provide greater computational power at low-SWaP, compatibility with ML algorithms, and sufficient CPU resources to host the UAVs autonomy element. More recently developed processing units, designed specifically for ML applications at the edge, enable scaled down variants of the algorithms for integration onto significantly smaller platforms. In this paper, we identify a common software architecting strategy that enables a micro UAV (~ 150 grams) supported by a traditional CPU and a small UAV (3 kg) configured with a GPU. Draper's automation strategy leverages the open-source Robotic Operating System (ROS). The ML models were built using open-source Python Pytorch libraries. We provide the flight test results for a vehicle detection algorithm. Future applications will include visual navigation and tracking.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication has drawn increasing attention recently. In this paper, we investigate 3D UAV trajectory design and band allocation problem considering both the UAV's energy consumption and the fairness among the ground users (GUs). Specifically, we first formulate the energy consumption model of a quad-rotor UAV as a function of the UAV's 3D movement. Then, based on the fairness and the total throughput, the fair throughput is defined and maximized within limited energy. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm, named as EEFC-TDBA (energy-efficient fair communication through trajectory design and band allocation) that chooses the state-of-the-art DRL algorithm, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), as its basis. EEFC-TDBA allows the UAV to: 1) adjust the flight speed and direction so as to enhance the energy efficiency and reach the destination before the energy is exhausted; and 2) allocate frequency band to achieve fair communication service. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that EEFC-TDBA outperforms the baseline methods in terms of the fairness, the total throughput, as well as the minimum throughput.},

abstract={Deploying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted base stations with a renewable energy charging infrastructure in a temporary event (e.g., sporadic hotspots for light reconnaissance mission or disaster-struck areas where regular power-grid is unavailable) provides a responsive and cost-effective solution for cellular networks. Nevertheless, the energy constraint incurred by renewable energy (e.g., solar panel) imposes new challenges on the recharging coordination. The amount of available energy at a charging station (CS) at any given time is variable depending on: the time of day, the location, sunlight availability, size and quality factor of the solar panels used, etc. Uncoordinated UAVs make redundant recharging attempts and result in severe quality of service (QoS) degradation. The system stability and lifetime depend on the coordination between the UAVs and available CSs. In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning time-step based algorithm for the UAV recharging scheduling and coordination using a Q-Learning approach. The agent is considered a central controller of the UAVs in the system, which uses the $\epsilon$-greedy based action selection. The goal of the algorithm is to maximize the average achieved throughput, reduce the number of recharging occurrences, and increase the life-span of the network. Extensive simulations based on experimentally validated UAV and charging energy models reveal that our approach exceeds the benchmark strategies by 381% in system duration, 47% reduction in the number of recharging occurrences, and achieved 66% of the performance in average throughput compared to a power-grid based infrastructure where there are no energy limitations on the CSs.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as an effective technology in future wireless networks. However, due to the non-convexity feature of joint trajectory design and power allocation (JTDPA) issue, it is challenging to attain the optimal joint policy in multi-UAV networks. In this article, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based approach is presented to achieve the maximum long-term network utility while satisfying the user equipments' quality of service requirements. Moreover, considering that the utility of each UAV is determined based on the network environment and other UAVs' actions, the JTDPA problem is modeled as a stochastic game. Due to the high computational complexity caused by the continuous action space and large state space, a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient method is proposed to obtain the optimal policy for the JTDPA issue. Numerical results indicate that our method can obtain the higher network utility and system capacity than other optimization methods in multi-UAV networks with lower computational complexity.},

The above optimization problem includes both integer and continues variables and it is challenging to solve. To address the above problem, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based trajectory control algorithm is proposed for managing the trajectory of each UAV independently, where the popular Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) method is applied. Given the UAVs' trajectories, a low-complexity approach is introduced for optimizing the offloading decisions of UEs.

Both the geographical sensing range and the spectrum sensing bandwidth of each UAV are limited due to onboard payload constraints, hence it becomes challenging to design effective and efficient channel rendezvous mechanisms. To address the challenge, this paper first observes and analyzes the effects of UAV relaying network topology and geographical sensing range on the rendezvous, and it is found that a joint exploitation of motion and frequency control is essential to achieve efficient rendezvous. Based on the important insight, this paper formulates the UAV relaying rendezvous problem and proposes a novel joint space-frequency rendezvous (JSFR) method for multi-UAV networks, incorporating with distributed reinforcement learning techniques. The simulation results show that the JSFR method may significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of rendezvous in UAV relaying networks, in terms of rendezvous probabilities and convergence rates.},

abstract={Maritime communication suffers from reactive jammer that keeps silent when the channel is idle and launches jamming signals as soon as sensing the activity on the channel to disrupt the maritime communication and even cause the maritime tracking and monitoring task failure. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based maritime anti-jamming communication scheme that applies the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the relay to forward the message between ships. This scheme enables both the transmitting ship and the UAV to select the power control policy without relying on the jamming model and the message generation model. Instead, the policies are chosen based on the current state consisting of the distances, the received signal strength indication, the received jamming power and the bit error rate (BER). We design two dueling neutral networks respectively to select the power control policy and update the network weights to reduce the overestimation. The dueling architecture consists of two streams that estimate the value of the current state and the state-dependent advantage function of the power control policy to accelerate the learning speed. A UAV-aided anti-jamming maritime communication game is formulated and the performance bound including the BER of marine messages and the energy consumption of the transmitting ship and the UAV is derived based on the Stackelberg equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the BER of the marine messages, and saves the energy consumption of the transmitting ship and the UAV to avoid being detected by the reactive jammer.},

abstract={One of the major research topics in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collaborative control systems is the problem of multi-UAV target assignment and path planning (MUTAPP). It is a complicated optimization problem in which target assignment and path planning are solved separately. However, recalculation of the optimal results is too slow for real-time operations in dynamic environments because of the large number of calculations required. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence method named simultaneous target assignment and path planning (STAPP) based on a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, which is a type of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. In STAPP, the MUTAPP problem is first constructed as a multi-agent system. Then, the MADDPG framework is used to train the system to solve target assignment and path planning simultaneously according to a corresponding reward structure. The proposed system can deal with dynamic environments effectively as its execution only requires the locations of the UAVs, targets, and threat areas. Real-time performance can be guaranteed as the neural network used in the system is simple. In addition, we develop a technique to improve the training effect and use experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract={The deployment of new technologies to ease the control and management of a massive data volume and its uncertainty is a very significant challenge in the industry. Under the name "Smart Factory", the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) aims to send data from systems that monitor and control the physical world to data processing systems for which cloud computing has proven to be an important tool to meet processing needs. unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now being introduced as part of IIoT and can perform important tasks. UAVs are now considered one of the best remote sensing techniques for collecting data over large areas. In the field of fog and edge computing, the IoT gateway connects various objects and sensors to the Internet. It function as a common interface for different networks and support different communication protocols. Edge intelligence is expected to replace Deep Learning (DL) computing in the cloud, providing a variety of distributed, low-latency and reliable intelligent services. In this paper, An unmanned aerial vehicle is automatically integrated into an industrial control system through an IoT gateway platform. Rather than sending photos from the UAV to the cloud for processing, an AI cloud trained model is deployed in the IoT gateway and used to process the taken photos. This model is designed to overcome the latency channels of the cloud computing architecture. The results show that the monitoring and tracking process using advanced computing in the IoT gateway is significantly faster than in the cloud.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recognition in the presence of WiFi interference using passive radio frequency (RF) detection. The proposed method relies on machine learning based RF recognition and considers the scenario in the bandwidth of the video signal (VS) and WiFi are identical. Our machine learning strategy involves extracting 31 features from the WiFi signal and the UAV VS, which are then input to the classifier. Among the 31 features, 30 are statistical in the time and frequency domain, while the remaining one involves the effective subcarrier feature. We evaluate four different machine learning (ML) classifier variants and demonstrate through simulation and experiments that the proposed method can accurately recognize UAV VS in the presence of WiFi interference. We also improve the feature-vector compactness and reduce the 31-feature vector to a 6-feature vector composed of the most significant features and demonstrate that the recognition performance of random forest method (RandF) classifier is not compromised. The most appealing performance for the 6-feature vector case is attained by the RandF, managing a recognition rate of 100% in the indoor experiment and 96.26% in the 2 km outdoor experiment. The recognition rate of the four ML classifiers is larger than 95.52% in the 2 km outdoor experiment, which is better than other UAV detection methods such as radar, acoustic and video.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are powerful tools for several applications like transportation and observation. The main reason is the enormous capabilities of such aerial vehicles in terms of mobility, autonomy, communication and processing power at a relatively low-cost. In recent years, due to the continuous development of UAV technology, it has broad prospects in regional coverage application. However, in practical applications, it is very difficult to get an actual mathematical model because of the limited data obtained. Therefore, we chose to use reinforcement learning to solve this problem. In this paper, we form a rule by Reinforcement Learning to cover the coverage of UAVs. We mainly solve two problems: (1) Reduce UAV energy consumption by reducing UAV action times. (2) Solve the huge problem of the dimension space of the value function by using the Actor-Critic algorithm. We compare our method with the traditional coverage method, the result shows that the UAV using the reinforcement learning model consumes less energy often when the same coverage area is completed.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been considered as effective flying base stations (FBSs) to provide on- demand wireless communications. Equipped with computation resource, UAVs are also capable of offering computation offloading opportunities for the mobile users (MUs) in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. However, due to the small hardware and load capacity, UAVs can only supply limited computation and energy resource. It is thus challenging for UAVs to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of MUs, while minimizing their total resource consumptions. Toward this end, instead of using all resource for every single task, we propose an intelligent resource allocation algorithm based on reinforcement learning, which enables UAVs to make energy-efficent and computation-efficent allocation decisions intelligently. Then, we take UAVs as learning agents by forming resource allocation decisions as actions and designing a reward function with the aim of minimizing the weighted resource consumptions. Each UAV performs the algorithm only based on its local observations without information exchange among different UAVs. Simulation results show that the proposed reinforcement learning based approach outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of weighted consumptions in a whole time period.},

A critical challenge in data collection with the autonomous UAV is the buffer overflows at the ground sensors and packet loss due to lossy airborne channels. Trajectory planning of the UAV is vital to alleviate buffer overflows as well as channel fading. In this work, we propose a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient based Cruise Control (DDPG-CC) to reduce the overall packet loss through online training of headings and cruise velocity of the UAV, as well as the selection of the ground sensors for data collection. Preliminary performance evaluation demonstrates that DDPG-CC reduces the packet loss rate by under 5% when sufficient training is provided to the UAV.},

abstract={The advances introduced by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are manifold and have paved the path for the full integration of UAVs, as intelligent objects, into the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper brings artificial intelligence into the UAVs data offloading process in a multi-server Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environment, by adopting principles and concepts from game theory and reinforcement learning. Initially, the autonomous MEC server selection for partial data offloading is performed by the UAVs, based on the theory of the stochastic learning automata. A non-cooperative game among the UAVs is then formulated to determine the UAVs' data to be offloaded to the selected MEC servers, while the existence of at least one Nash Equilibrium (NE) is proven by exploiting the power of submodular games. A best response dynamics framework and two alternative reinforcement learning algorithms are introduced that converge to an NE, and their tradeoffs are discussed. The overall framework performance evaluation is achieved via modeling and simulation, in terms of its efficiency and effectiveness, under different operation approaches and scenarios.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate a user-timeslot scheduling problem for downlink unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided networks, where the UAV serves as an aerial base station. We formulate an optimization problem by jointly determining user scheduling and hovering time to minimize UAV's transmission and hovering energy. An offline algorithm is proposed to solve the problem based on the branch and bound method and the golden section search. However, executing the offline algorithm suffers from the exponential growth of computational time. Therefore, we apply a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to design an online algorithm with less computational time. To this end, we first reformulate the original user scheduling problem to a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, an actor-critic-based RL algorithm is developed to determine the scheduling policy under the guidance of two deep neural networks. Numerical results show the proposed online algorithm obtains a good tradeoff between performance gain and computational time.},

As reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved great success in many challenges of planning and control, a research on path planning of UAVs for object tracking based on RL is presented, considering images from a visual sensor as the input. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a spatial soft-max layer are used to detect the object in the images. The tracking results of a filter CSR-DCF based on OpenCV are combined with the output of CNN to improve training efficiency and obtain better tracking performance. Three independent experiments are conducted with different conditions in simulated environments where a quadcopter is trained to track a ground robot based on V-REP. Valid results show that the UAV has good performance in the tracking work with MAE of 0.23m in x and 0.19m in y.},

abstract={In modern networks, edge computing will be responsible for processing and learning from the critical network- and user-generated data, such as wireless link usage, mobility information, application requests, and many others. The presence of Artificial Intelligence-based (AI) applications at the edge of the network will enable the network to predict necessary user behavior and its impact on network infrastructure, such as base station overloading. One of the main strategies for offloading users and base stations is to deploy UAV base stations, or flying base stations, which can dynamically provide service and connectivity. In this article, we introduce a framework for distributed learning over Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), which manages data applications in a fully distributed setting across edge servers, thus reducing the cost of collecting user information in a centralized server. We couple the proposed distributed learning with a novel similarity metric for user trajectories, which can aggregate neural network models with similar costs as other model aggregation techniques. However, the aggregation technique can achieve much higher accuracy. Furthermore, we apply the proposed distributed learning scheme to manage and deploy flying base stations to areas that experience high demand or poor user connectivity, thus optimizing connectivity in terms of user satisfaction, delay, and network throughput.},

abstract={This paper suggests a novel method of detecting and estimating the position of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a single monocular camera only. As the leverage of UAV is keep on increasing, the related research has been extremely developed. To successfully use a UAV in a variety of missions, a precise localization technique is essential. However, there is still a lack of research to accurately measure the vehicle's present altitude. Thus, this study conducted a simple but accurate altitude measurement method using a camera. First, UAV detection is initially proceeded by using a deep learning approach. After determining that the object displayed in the image is UAV, the altitude is calculated with a distance measuring formula using the camera's Field of View (FOV). Besides, zooming, cropping, and some image processing are performed to enhance the accuracy of the altitude value. As a result, average errors of less than 5% and errors of up to 60cm were obtained, which is an improvement over previous altitude measurement techniques. This method can calibrate the altitude of the UAV immediately in a relatively inexpensive and simple way.},

abstract={This paper studies the target searching problem using swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in unknown environments which information is unknown to the UAVs, other than features they detect through their sensors. Effective decision and control methods are required for UAVs that consider their limitations and characteristics when confronted with target searching problems. A cooperative target searching method is proposed for swarm UAVs based on an improved bean optimization algorithm (BOA) called Robot Bean Optimization Algorithm (RBOA). Compared with conventional BOAs used for optimal computation, RBOA has two main modifications for the cooperative control of swarm robots: 1) it accounts for the free motion space of individual UAVs using a Thiessen polygon; and 2) it adds a free space search mechanism to improve the efficiency of target searching. Based on the above improvements, and by integrating a multi-phase search mechanism and scheduling control strategy, a swarm UAV collaborative search simulation platform is built for experimental purposes. The results obtained from search simulations show that the RBOA can outperform adaptive robotic particle swarm optimization (A-RPSO) in target searches in complex and unknown environments, especially with fewer evolutionary generations and smaller numbers of robots. The RBOA, which is inspired by plant population evolutionary patterns, has fast and effective search capabilities, distributed collaborative interaction, and emergent swarm intelligence. It provides new ideas and support for research into the control of swarm UAVs and swarm robots.},

To address this issue, a novel method for deep-learning-aided localization of a multimodel system is proposed in this paper. The main contribution of the proposed algorithm is that a mode estimation network based on a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) is newly proposed to quickly and accurately estimate the multimodal system mode, which minimizes the delay. In addition, a federated Kalman filter with a selective reinitialization algorithm from the proposed BiLSTM is proposed for better estimation of multimodal systems. Simulation and flight test results of a UAV demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields better localization performance than the conventional IMM algorithm because the proposed mode estimation network has fast and accurate mode detection.},

abstract={Crop growth models and vegetation index (VI) based methods have been commonly used to estimate rice grain yield. However, the complicated model calibration procedure and the narrow time window limit the application of these two methods, respectively. The convolutional neural network (CNN) performs better than VI-based approaches on yield estimation at the ripening stage, but the generalization of CNN still needs to be improved. The objective of this study is to improve the generality of CNN in estimating plot-scale rice grain yield using high-resolution UAV-based RGB images. A new deep learning architecture with deep features decomposition is proposed. The results showed that the proposed network is more robust than the network without deep features decomposition when the phenological stage of the test set is different from the training set. The results indicate that the time-invariant features which only relate to rice yield can be decomposed by the proposed network, and demonstrate the stable performance of proposed CNN in a wider time window for rice grain yield forecasting.},

Most of these messages are broadcast in the UAV swarm. Therefore, in the UAV swarm network, the efficiency of broadcasting and rebroadcasting will determine the network efficiency of the entire network.

abstract={Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication has attracted increasingly attention recently. We consider a cellular-connected UAV carried with limited on-board energy during the mission period requires flying from its initial location to a pre-determined location before the on-board energy runs out. The work aims to minimize the total outage duration by exploiting the UAV's mobility to optimize its trajectory. Traditional methods for solving such problems usually require an accurate and tractable communication model, which is difficult to be realized due to the complexity of the communication system. Even if this problem is solved, the formulated problem is hard to be addressed by standard optimization techniques because of the non-convexity. To this end, we propose a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which only requires multiple interactions between the UAV and the environment, and can solve such problems well. Specifically, using dueling double deep Q network (dueling DDQN) with multi-step learning algorithm, the outage time of the UAV with different on-board energy and communication connectivity constrains is investigated to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed design with DRL contributing to significant performance enhancement compared with the benchmark.},

Specifically, we formulate the joint optimization of online UAV trajectory and caching content delivery as an infinite-horizon ergodic Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem to obtain a QoE-optimal solution based on the concept of request queues in wireless caching networks. By exploiting the fluid approximation approach, we first derive an optimal control policy from an approximated Bellman equation. Based on this, an actor-critic based online reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Finally, simulation results are provided to show that the proposed solution can achieve significant gain over the existing baselines.},

abstract={This paper proposes a cloud-assisted joint charging scheduling and energy management framework for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. For charging the UAVs those are extremely power hungry, charging towers are considered for plug-and-play charging during run-time operations. The charging towers should be cost-effective, thus it is equipped with photovoltaic power generation and energy storage systems functionalities. Furthermore, the towers should be cooperative for more cost-effectiveness by intelligent energy sharing. Based on the needs and setting, this paper proposes 1) charging scheduling between UAVs and towers and 2) cooperative energy managements among towers. For charging scheduling, the UAVs and towers should be scheduled for maximizing charging energy amounts and the scheduled pairs should determine charging energy allocation amounts. Here, two decisions are correlated, i.e., it is a non-convex problem. We re-formulate the non-convex to convex for guaranteeing optimal solutions. Lastly, the cooperative energy sharing among towers is designed and implemented with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and then intelligent energy sharing can be realized.

abstract={This paper studies the problem of trajectory design for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted emergency communications, where the ground base station (BS) may be no longer functioning and the UAV acts as an aerial BS to provide emergency communication services to the ground users. In the event of emergency situations, the user distribution and the geographical features of the target area may have changed dramatically while urgent demand for communications are raised by the surviving ground users. In this paper, we model UAV trajectory design problem as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) process and propose to adopt transfer learning to leverage previously learned knowledge so as to boost up the learning procedure. Simulation results validate that with limited interactions with the environment, the UAV can rapidly and effectively adapt its trajectory to the new environment and achieve much faster convergence speed than DRL based design.},

abstract={In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications, the UAV's limited energy supply and storage have triggered the development of intelligent energy-conserving scheduling solutions. In this paper, we investigate energy minimization for UAV-aided communication networks by jointly optimizing data-transmission scheduling and UAV hovering time. The formulated problem is combinatorial and non-convex with bilinear constraints. To tackle the problem, firstly, we provide an optimal algorithm (OPT) and a golden section search heuristic algorithm (GSS-HEU). Both solutions are served as offline performance benchmarks which might not be suitable for online operations. Towards this end, from a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) perspective, we propose an actor-critic-based deep stochastic online scheduling (AC-DSOS) algorithm and develop a set of approaches to confine the action space. Compared to conventional RL/DRL, the novelty of AC-DSOS lies in handling two major issues, i.e., exponentially-increased action space and infeasible actions. Numerical results show that AC-DSOS is able to provide feasible solutions, and save around 25-30% energy compared to two conventional deep AC-DRL algorithms. Compared to the developed GSS-HEU, AC-DSOS consumes around 10% higher energy but reduces the computational time from second-level to millisecond-level.},

abstract={Many software engineering tasks, such as testing, debugging, and anomaly detection can benefit from the ability to infer a behavioral model of the software. Most existing inference approaches assume access to code to collect execution sequences. In this paper, we investigate a black-box scenario, where the system under analysis cannot be instrumented, in this fashion. This scenario is particularly prevalent with control systems log analysis in the form of continuous signals. In this situation, an execution trace amounts to a multivariate time-series of input and output signals, where different states of the system correspond to different phases in the time-series. From an inference perspective, the challenge is to detect when these phase changes take place. Unfortunately, most existing solutions are either univariate, make assumptions on the data distribution, or have limited learning power. Therefore, we propose a hybrid deep neural network that accepts as input a multivariate time series and applies a set of convolutional and recurrent layers to learn the non-linear correlations between signals and the patterns over time. We show how this approach can be used to accurately detect state changes, and how the inferred {\color{blue}machine learning} models can be successfully applied to transfer-learning scenarios, to accurately process traces from different products with similar execution characteristics. Our experimental results on two UAV autopilot case studies (one industrial and one open-source) indicate that our approach is highly accurate (over 90\% F1 score for state classification) and significantly improves baselines (by up to 102\% for change point detection). Using transfer learning we also show that up to 90\% of the maximum achievable F1 scores in the open-source case study can be achieved by reusing the trained models from the industrial case and only fine tuning them using as low as 5 labeled samples, which reduces the manual labeling effort by 98\%.},

This problem is important for many applications such as vision-based swarming of UAVs, malicious UAV detection, and see-and-avoid systems for UAVs. Although deep learning methods have exhibited superior performance in many object detection tasks, their potential for UAV detection has not been well explored. As the first main contribution of this letter, we present a new dataset, named Det-Fly, which consists of more than 13 000 images of a flying target UAV acquired by another flying UAV. Compared to the existing datasets, the proposed one is more comprehensive in the sense that it covers a wide range of practical scenarios with different background scenes, viewing angles, relative distance, flying altitude, and lightning conditions. The second main contribution of this letter is to present an experimental evaluation of eight representative deep-learning algorithms based on the proposed dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive experimental evaluation of deep learning algorithms for the task of visual UAV detection so far. The evaluation results highlight some key challenges in the problem of air-to-air UAV detection and suggest potential ways to develop new algorithms in the future.

abstract={Due to the dynamic nature of connectivity in terrestrial vehicular networks, it is of great benefit to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in these networks to act as relays. As a result, a remarkable number of studies have exploited UAVs to bridge the communication gaps between terrestrial vehicles, and sometimes despite their unoptimized mobility, their restricted communication coverage, and their limited energy resources. However, it was noted that for an intermittently connected vehicular network, UAVs could not cover all sparse areas all the time. Even worse, when deploying enough UAVs to cover all these areas, the probability of inter-UAV collisions increases, and it will be complex to control their movements efficiently. Consequently, it is required to dispatch an organized and intelligent group of UAVs to perform communication relays in the long term while keeping their connectivity, minimizing their average energy consumption, and providing an efficient coverage strategy. To meet these requirements, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, called DISCOUNT (Dispatch of UAVs for Urban VANETs). Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. It has been shown that the proposed framework significantly outperforms two commonly-used baseline techniques and some reinforcement learning methods in terms of energy consumption, coverage, and routing performances.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the potential of providing reliable high-rate connectivity, are becoming a promising component of future wireless networks. A UAV collects data from a set of randomly distributed sensors, where both the locations of these sensors and their data volume to be transmitted are unknown to the UAV. In order to assist the UAV in finding the optimal motion trajectory in the face of the uncertainty without the above knowledge whilst aiming for maximizing the cumulative collected data, we formulate a reinforcement learning problem by modelling the motion-trajectory as a Markov decision process with the UAV acting as the learning agent. Then, we propose a pair of novel trajectory optimization algorithms based on stochastic modelling and reinforcement learning, which allows the UAV to optimize its flight trajectory without the need for system identification. More specifically, by dividing the considered region into small tiles, we conceive state-action-reward-state-action (Sarsa) and Q-learning based UAV-trajectory optimization algorithms (i.e., SUTOA and QUTOA) aiming to maximize the cumulative data collected during the finite flight-time. Our simulation results demonstrate that both of the proposed approaches are capable of finding an optimal trajectory under the flight-time constraint. The preference for QUTOA vs. SUTOA depends on the relative position of the start and the end points of the UAVs.},

abstract={The formation flights of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can improve the success probability of single-machine. Dynamic spectrum interaction solves the problem of the ordered communication of multiple UAVs with limited bandwidth via spectrum interaction between UAVs. By introducing reinforcement learning algorithm, UAVs can continuously obtain the optimal strategy by continuously interacting with the environment. In this paper, two types of UAV formation communication methods are studied. One method allows for information sharing between two UAVs in the same time slot. The other method is the adoption of a dynamic time slot allocation scheme to complete the alternate use of time slots by the UAV to realize information sharing. The quality of experience (QoE) is introduced to evaluate the results of UAV sharing, and the M/G/1 queuing model is used for priority and to evaluate the packet loss of UAV. In terms of algorithms, a combination of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and the long-short-term memory (LSTM) network is adopted to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. The experimental results show that, compared with the Q-learning and deep Q-network (DQN) methods, the proposed method achieves faster convergence and better performance with respect to the throughput rate.},

UAV-mounted mobile base stations (UAV-BSs) are an effective and cost-efficient solution for providing wireless connectivity where fixed infrastructure is not available or destroyed. However, UAV-BSs have their limitations and complications, for instance, limited available energy. In addition, when several UAV-BSs are deployed to provide coverage to a specific area, the possibility of inter-UAV collisions and the interference to ground users increase. We propose Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based methods to deploy UAV-BSs under energy constraints to provide efficient and fair coverage to the ground users, while minimising inter-UAV collisions and interference to ground users. The proposed methods outperform the baseline methods by an average increase of 38.94% in system fairness, 42.54% in individual user coverage, and 15.04% in total system coverage, in comparison with the baseline methods.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the problem of wireless service provisioning through a rotary-wing UAV which can serve as an aerial base station (BS) to communicate with multiple ground terminals (GTs) in a boost demand area. Our objective is to optimize the UAV control for maximizing the UAV.s energy efficiency, in which both aerodynamic energy and communication energy are considered while ensuring the communication requirements for each GT and backhaul link between the UAV and the terrestrial BS. The mobility of the UAV and GTs lead to time-varying channel conditions that make the environment dynamic. We formulate a nonconvex optimization for controlling the UAV considering the practical angle-dependent Rician fading channels between the UAV and GTs, and between the UAV and the terrestrial BS. Traditional optimization approaches are not able to handle the dynamic environment and high complexity of the problem in real-time. We propose to use a deep reinforcement learning-based approach namely Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to solve the formulated nonconvex problem of UAV control with continuous action space that takes into account the real-time of the environment including time-varying UAV-ground channel conditions, available onboard energy of the UAV, and the communication requirement of the GTs. However, the DDPG method may not achieve good performance in an unstable environment and will face a large number of hyperparameters. We extend our approach to use the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) method that can improve the performance of the UAV compared to the DDPG method in such a dynamic environment.},

abstract={Considerable attention has been given to leverage a variety of smart city applications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The rapid advances in artificial intelligence can empower UAVs with autonomous capabilities allowing them to learn from their surrounding environment and act accordingly without human intervention. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal scheduling framework for autonomous UAVs using reinforcement learning. The framework enables UAVs to autonomously determine their schedules to cover the maximum of pre-scheduled events spatially and temporally distributed in a given geographical area and over a pre-determined time horizon. The designed framework has the ability to update the planned schedules in case of unexpected emergency events. The UAVs are trained using the Q-learning (QL) algorithm to find effective scheduling plan. A customized reward function is developed to consider several constraints especially the limited battery capacity of the flying units, the time windows of events, and the delays caused by the UAV navigation between events. Numerical simulations show the behavior of the autonomous UAVs for various scenarios and corroborate the ability of QL to handle complex vehicle routing problems with several constraints. A comparison with an optimal deterministic solution is also provided to validate the performance of the learning-based solution.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with artificial intelligence (AI) have opened a revolutionized way for mobile crowdsensing (MCS). Conventional AI models, built on aggregation of UAVs' sensing data (typically contain private and sensitive user information), may arise severe privacy and data misuse concerns. Federated learning, as a promising distributed AI paradigm, has opened up possibilities for UAVs to collaboratively train a shared global model without revealing their local sensing data. However, there still exist potential security and privacy threats for UAV-assisted crowdsensing with federated learning due to vulnerability of central curator, unreliable contribution recording, and low-quality shared local models. In this paper, we propose SFAC, a secure federated learning framework for UAV-assisted MCS. Specifically, we first introduce a blockchain-based collaborative learning architecture for UAVs to securely exchange local model updates and verify contributions without the central curator. Then, by applying local differential privacy, we design a privacy-preserving algorithm to protect UAVs' privacy of updated local models with desirable learning accuracy. Furthermore, a two-tier reinforcement learning-based incentive mechanism is exploited to promote UAVs' high-quality model sharing when explicit knowledge of network parameters are not available in practice. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed SFAC can effectively improve utilities for UAVs, promote high-quality model sharing, and ensure privacy protection in federated learning, compared with existing schemes.},

Mean-shift tracking algorithm is suitable for UA V target tracking due to its small computation, fast speed and good robustness. There are some problems with mean-shift tracking based on uav: (1) The fast moving of the target and uav leads to the target easily being lost. We use the deep learning network pretrained in the dataset to predict the target location in the ground station to solve this problem. (2) From the perspective of UAV, the image size of the tracked target is easy to change, and the background is more complex. In view of this, we introduce the neighborhood background information of the target into the similarity measurement between the target and the candidate, propose a scale-estimation mechanism which relies solely on the mean-shift procedure for the Hellinger distance, and detect the size estimation to reduce the influence of background clutter.},

abstract={In this paper, the real-time deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations (BSs) for optimizing the throughput of mobile users is investigated for UAV networks. This problem is formulated as a time-varying mixed-integer non-convex programming (MINP) problem, which is challenging to find an optimal solution in a short time with conventional optimization techniques. Hence, we propose an actor-critic-based (AC-based) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to find near-optimal UAV positions at every moment. In the proposed method, the process searching for the solution iteratively at a particular moment is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). To handle infinite state and action spaces and improve the robustness of the decision process, two powerful neural networks (NNs) are configured to evaluate the UAV position adjustments and make decisions, respectively. Compared with heuristic algorithm, sequential least-squares programming and fixed UAVs methods, simulation results have shown that the proposed method outperforms these three benchmarks in terms of the throughput at every moment in UAV networks.},

abstract={Real-time detection and tracking moving ships as well as locating the helipad on that ship is still a challenge in critical missions at sea. By using VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) types, it allows both the ability to fly approaching the ship and also be able to land vertically on the helipad. This paper proposes a SITL (Software In The Loop) system to verify the automatic detection and tracking of ships moving at sea for the VTOL UAV during the mission and an algorithm to guide VTOL UAV mode selection in the process of approaching and landing on ships moving at sea. On-air images collected from the VTOL UAV’s camera in the X-Plane 11 simulation environment are used to train Deep Learning computer vision algorithms. Real-time ship detection algorithm with up to 125 FPS and 96% accuracy. From the results of the ship and helipad detection, we propose an algorithm to assist the transition of flight modes of VTOL UAV during the tracking and landing mission on a moving ship at sea.},

abstract={This paper proposes a smart graffiti clean-up system based on an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform. This smart clean system is based on edge detection and machine learning algorithms to realize the detection and tracking of graffiti image in real time. In Graffiti detection, we aim to build a model to detect graffiti on walls which can help navigate the UAV to the correct coordinate and estimate the area of the graffiti. The data set which contain graffiti images are trained using machine learning techniques which will be used for the detections of the graffiti patterns. This will automate the process of detecting the location of the graffiti based on the edge detection technique and the model will be able to estimate the area of the graffiti. To achieve obstacle detection, and collision, a smart navigation approach is also proposed with the help of LiDAR and external camera. The overall graffiti cleanup system contains hardware and software that allow the user to use spray enamel with the reach and scale of an autonomous UAV.},

abstract={Addressing the shortcomings of the classical reinforcement learning algorithms in solving the problem of multi-UAV formation transformation, such as large consumption of computing resources and slow convergence speed, this paper introduces heuristics and uses back propagation algorithms to construct a heuristic function required for multi-UAV formation convergence. When designing the action selection function of reinforcement learning algorithms, the idea of simulated annealing is also introduced, which enables the algorithm to fully explore the combination of convergence actions in the early stage so as to jump out of the local optimal trap, while ensuring the convergence of the algorithm in the later stage. The data of the final simulation experiment show that the improved heuristically-accelerated reinforcement learning algorithms can effectively reduce the consumption of UAV computing resources, improve the convergence speed the convergence quality when dealing with the problem of multi-UAV formation transformation.},
