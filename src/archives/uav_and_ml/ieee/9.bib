abstract={We study an energy-efficient unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multicast system, in which ground terminals (GTs) requiring a common information (CI) are grouped and a UAV flies to each group to deliver the CI using minimum energy consumption. A machine learning (ML) empowered joint multicast grouping and UAV trajectory optimization framework is proposed to tackle the challenging joint optimization problem. In this framework, we first propose the compressed-feature regression and clustering machine learning (C2ML) for multicast grouping. A support vector regression (SVR) is trained with the silhouette coefficient, a one- dimensional compressed feature regarding the distribution of GTs, to efficiently determine the number of groups that guides the K-means clustering to approach the optimal multicast grouping. With the C2ML- enabled multicast grouping, we solve the UAV trajectory optimization problem by formulating an equivalent centroid-adjustable traveling salesman problem (CA- TSP). An efficient CA-TSP inspired iterative optimization algorithm is proposed for UAV trajectory planning. The proposed ML-empowered joint optimization framework, which integrates the offline C2ML-enabled multicast grouping and the online CA-TSP inspired UAV- trajectory optimization, is shown to achieve excellent energy-saving performance.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology is a rapidly growing field with tremendous opportunities for research and applications. To achieve true autonomy for UAVs in the absence of remote control, external navigation aids like global navigation satellite systems and radar systems, a minimum energy trajectory planning that considers obstacle avoidance and stability control will be the key. Although this can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem, due to the complicated non-linear relationships between UAV trajectory and thrust control, it is almost impossible to be solved analytically. While deep reinforcement learning is known for its ability to provide model free optimization for complex system through learning, its state space, actions and reward functions must be designed carefully. This paper presents our vision of different layers of autonomy in a UAV system, and our effort in generating and tracking the trajectory both using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The experimental results show that compared to conventional approaches, the learned trajectory will need 20% less control thrust and 18% less time to reach the target. Furthermore, using the control policy learning by DRL, the UAV will achieve 58.14% less position error and 21.77% less system power.},

abstract={Cellular systems have to resist smart jammers that can optimize their selection of jamming channels and powers based on the estimated ongoing network states. In this article, we present an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided cellular framework against jamming, in which an UAV uses reinforcement learning to choose the relay policy for a mobile user whose serving base station is attacked by a jammer. More specifically, the UAV applies deep reinforcement learning and transfer learning to help cellular systems resist smart jamming without knowing the cellular topology, the message generation model, the server computation model and the jamming model, based on the previous anti-jamming relay experiences and the observed current communication status. The performance bound in terms of the bit error rate and the UAV energy consumption is derived from the Nash equilibrium of the studied dynamic relay game and verified via simulations. Simulation results show that this scheme can reduce the bit error rate and save the UAV energy consumption in comparison with the benchmark.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperation mechanism for secure communications, where the UAV transmitter moves around to serve the multiple ground users (GUs) while the UAV jammers send the 3D jamming signals to the ground eavesdroppers (GEs) to protect the UAV transmitter from being wiretapped. The 3D jamming guarantees the GEs not being interfered by the jamming signals. It is challenging to make a joint trajectory design and power control for a UAV team without central control. To this end, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach to achieve the maximum sum secure rate by designing the dynamic trajectory of each UAV. The proposed multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) technique is centralized training at high altitude platforms (HAPs) and distributed execution at each UAV, which enables the fully distributed cooperation among UAVs. Finally, the simulation results show the proposed method can efficiently solve the multi-UAV cooperation trajectory design problem in secure communication scenarios.},

abstract={In Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered sensor networks, a UAV can be employed to charge the ground sensors remotely via Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) and collect the sensory data. This paper focuses on trajectory planning of the UAV for aerial data collection and WPT to minimize buffer overflow at the ground sensors and unsuccessful transmission due to lossy airborne channels. Consider network states of battery levels and buffer lengths of the ground sensors, channel conditions, and location of the UAV. A flight trajectory planning optimization is formulated as a Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the UAV has partial observation of the network states. In practice, the UAV-enabled sensor network contains a large number of network states and actions in POMDP while the up-to-date knowledge of the network states is not available at the UAV. To address these issues, we propose an onboard deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the realtime trajectory planning of the UAV given outdated knowledge on the network states.},

abstract={With the advantages of flexibility and miniaturization, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely applied to operate sensing tasks in many complicated environments. Based on the airborne sensors, a UAV can capture multiple videos or snapshots for monitoring and data analysis. However, the scarce computing resource of one single UAV may cause an unacceptable execution delay for image processing, especially when a batch of images are captured in a very short period of time. To solve the challenge, we propose a UAV swarm based distributed computing collaboration structure to integrate the computing resource of UAVs for real-time sensing tasks. Specifically, a UAV is elected as the coordinator to conduct the resource scheduling strategy for the computing cooperation among the remaining UAVs. In order to improve the utilization of computing resource, different layers of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are computed by diverse UAVs. These UAVs can rapidly process the batch of images in a pipeline manner. Moreover, we formulate a non-linear programming model to minimize the batch execution time. A Distributed CNN based Resource Scheduling (DCRS) algorithm is proposed to obtain the minimal execution time based on deep reinforcement learning. Simulation results demonstrate that our schemes not only can reduce the execution time but also can improve the computing resource utilization significantly.},

abstract={Conventional terrestrial base stations (BSs) are prone to natural disasters and they are not flexible to cater to the sudden surge in the number of users in various locations within their coverage area. Therefore, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-carried BSs (UAV-BSs) have been proposed to overcome this problem, thanks to their advantages in flexible UAV-BS placement and simple deployment. However, the positioning of the UAV-BSs for maximum coverage with satisfactory received data rate is a challenging task. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a UAV-BS placement scheme which maximizes the communication coverage. To this end, we formulate the UAVBS placement optimization problem to maximize the coverage of multiple UAV-BSs in a given area, while taking into account the collision avoidance between the UAV-BSs. Then, an artificial intelligence technique known as simulated annealing is used to develop an algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms static UAV-BS placement in terms of quality of service and throughput.},

Based on the hardware platform, the improved visual inertia odometer (VIO) and the biological excitation neural network are used to improve the flight performance and the ability of autonomy. To solve the problem of the synchronization for VIO, a cubic spline interpolation function was employed. A biological excitation neural network was extended to solve UAV on-line path planning. It provides an on-board path planning approach for UAV in the 3D world considering the dynamic obstacles.

Several previous studies on learning controllers for UAVs have been conducted. However, most of these studies only carried out computer simulations to verify the effectiveness of the learning method. Conversely, we conducted our experiment using an actual quadrotor UAV. The experimental results demonstrate that the UAV can acquire knowledge to achieve stable hovering over a marker placed on the ground. We also compared the performances of a trained UAV (using the learning method) and a UAV controlled by a PID controller. The result indicates that a trained UAV can hover as stably as one controlled by the PID.},

abstract={In recent times, security issues pertaining to drones have received a great deal of attention from researchers in networking and communication circles, given their applications in the civilian and defence domains. Object collision avoidance over a trajectory is the only built-in security mechanism in the autopilot system of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This mechanism, however, cannot protect drones from signal spoofing and hacking attacks. Attacks on UAVs can be triggered from either the ground or flying vehicles in the transmission vicinity medium, by means of which attackers get to control flight operations or manipulate the UAV's autopilot system. An intermittent network connection that disrupts communication in UAVs exacerbates the problem. Hence, a deep learning-based, adaptive Intrusion Detection System is needed for a drone to identify its intruders and ensure its safe return-to-home (RTH). In the proposed IDS, Self-Taught Learning (STL) with a multiclass SVM is used to maintain the high true positive rate of the IDS, even in uncharted territory. A self-healing method in IDS recovery phase uses the Deep-Q Network, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for dynamic route learning to facilitate the drone's safe return home. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed IDS against cyber security attacks on UAVs in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with cognitive radio (CR) technology provides advantages such as coverage area, faster data rate, and improved traffic management. Conventional communication network suffers from ground reflections and to mitigate this, UAVs are used to serve the users. However, the non-line of sight paths in UAV based communication creates problems with channel effects. Hence it is essential to understand the type of fading that occurs in UAV based communication. Generally, the transmitted signal is affected by any one of the fading types such as flat fading, doubly selective fading, and frequency selective fading. In this work, wireless fading channels are classified using deep learning techniques. I and Q values of the modulation schemes are used as features for training and testing the models. Basic convolutional neural network (CNN) model and long short term memory (LSTM) are utilized for the classification and found that LSTM results better accuracy compared to basic CNN model. Computer simulations of proposed classification models are compared with conventional cumulants based classification results.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) detection and classification methods include the use of audio, video, thermal, RADAR and radio frequency (RF) signals. RF signals have the ability to detect UAVs at longer ranges but interference from other signals in the same frequency band such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi at 2.4GHz is a known limitation. The experiments in this paper evaluate the effect of real world Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signal interference on UAV detection and classification, using transfer learning via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature extraction and machine learning classifiers Logistic Regression (LR) and k Nearest Neighbour (kNN). 2 class UAV detection, 4 class UAV type and 10 class flight mode classification are evaluated with graphical representation from the time and frequency domain. Flight modes evaluated included mode 1 - switched on and connected to the controller, mode 2 - hovering and mode 3 - flying. Results show that Bluetooth signals are more likely to interfere with detection and classification accuracy than Wi-Fi signals but that accuracy can be maintained at over 96% by using frequency domain features with LR as the classifier. Time domain features were shown to be less robust than frequency domain features when interefence signals were introduced. In the presence of Bluetooth or Wi-Fi signals, 2 class UAV detection produced 100% accuracy, 4 class UAV type classification produced 99.9% (+/- 0.1%) and 10 class UAV flight mode classification produced 96.4% (+/- 0.5%) accuracy. Overall we have shown frequency domain features extracted from a CNN to be more robust than time domain features in the presence of interference and that high accuracy can be maintained using LR as a classifier with CNN derived features.},

abstract={Equipped with machine learning (ML) models, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms can execute various applications like surveillance and target detection. However, the connections between UAVs and cloud servers cannot be guaranteed, especially when executing massive data. Thus, traditional cloud-centric approach will not be suitable, since it may cause high latency and significant bandwidth consumption. In this work, we propose a federated learning (FL) framework via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for a UAV swarm which is composed of a leader-UAV and a group of follower-UAVs. Specifically, each follower-UAV updates its local model by using its collected data, and then all follower-UAVs form a NOMA-group to send their respectively trained FL parameters (i.e., the local FL models) to the leader-UAV simultaneously. We formulate a joint optimization of the uplink NOMA-transmission durations, downlink broadcasting duration, as well as the computation-rates of the leader-UAV and all follower-UAVs, aiming at minimizing the latency in executing the FL iterations until reaching a specified accuracy. Numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can outperform some baseline strategies.},

The possibility of classifying UAVs by mass by means of signal analysis is being considered. The possibility of spectral and correlation analysis in determining the parameters of the UAV is investigated. The proposed approach, in comparison with the currently used and developed approaches based on deep machine learning, does not require a large training base.},

Coverage monitoring of target area is an important topic in the field of multi UAV research. Through the research on multi UAV communication coverage network, this paper analyzes the factors affecting multi UAV coverage and extracts the mathematical model of maximum coverage under the condition of ensuring UAV connectivity.

abstract={Pairing image patches is to decide whether two image patches belong to the same scene but taken from different imaging conditions. It is a key procedure in the applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video images. The challenges in pairing UAV image patches derive from the complex imaging conditions on UAV platforms such as jitter, frequent undefined motion, viewpoint changes, and illumination changes. Available popular methods usually follow the flowchart: preprocess images at first, then extract hand-crafted features, and finally match the extracted features through evaluating an independently predefined similarity metric. These methods could only handle part of negative factors from the complex imaging conditions and thus cannot effectively handle the challenges in pairing UAV image patches. This study aims to handle the challenges through automatically and simultaneously learning more representative features and accurate metric. Especially, this study proposes a deep learning method to jointly learn the feature representations and similarity metric over the training samples obtained from various imaging conditions. The model structure of the proposed pairing system consists of three parts: two stream convolutional neural networks (CNNs), one similarity metric layer and one softmax layer. They are jointly trained through the usual back propagation algorithm. Moreover, to further improve the performance, this study develops a transfer learning strategy for the proposed deep model. Two new training datasets from satellite scenes and UAV scenes, respectively, are built to evaluate the proposed pairing system, and the experimental results show that our method outperforms the most recent approaches in pairing UAV video image patches.},

abstract={Autonomous obstacle avoidance flight is a key capability for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the automatic terrain following application, which ensures that the UAVs can perform complex, versatile and difficult movements in the flight. Existing obstacle avoidance methods such as the visual SLAM, generally require artificially specifying the feature values that need to be extracted and are susceptible to illumination and obstacle positions. While artificial intelligence technology has made breakthroughs in many fields, the advantages of the neural networks overcome these shortcomings. Therefore, we propose an autonomous obstacle avoidance algorithm using deep reinforcement learning method. Concretely, a virtual three-dimensional visual simulation environment is established firstly, which simulates the flight states of the UAV and output the state image in real time according to the control decision. A deep convolutional neural network is then built as the brain of the intelligent agent, which takes the state image of the UAV as input, and outputs the discretized control decision to control the UAV. Moreover, The Deep Q Network method is employed to train the convolutional neural network in an autonomous way, that is the intelligent agent can try to control the UAV to avoidance the obstacle by itself. After training, the UAV is controlled by the trained convolutional neural network to complete the autonomous obstacle avoidance task during the flight. This algorithm is realized through continuous self-learning and self-evolution, which enables the UAVs to utilize visual information in complex scenes, adjust flight height in real time according to terrain height and obstacle height. The research results will have a strong application prospects in both military and civilian areas.},

abstract={With the stringent requirement of receiving video from the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from anywhere in the stadium of sports events and the significant-high per-cell throughput for video transmission to virtual reality (VR) users, a promising solution is a cell-free multi-group broadcast (CF-MB) network with cooperative reception and broadcast access-points (AP). To explore the benefit of broadcasting user-correlated decode-dependent video resources to spatially correlated VR users, the network should dynamically schedule the video and cluster APs into virtual cells for a different group of VR users with overlapped video requests. By decomposing the problem into scheduling and association sub-problems, we first introduce the conventional non-learning-based scheduling and association algorithms, and a centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) association approach based on the rainbow agent with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate decisions from observation. To reduce its complexity, we then decompose the association problem into multiple sub-problems, resulting in a networked-distributed Partially Observable Markov decision process (ND-POMDP). To solve it, we propose a multi-agent deep DRL algorithm. To jointly solve the coupled association and scheduling problems, we further develop a hierarchical federated DRL algorithm with scheduler as meta-controller, and association as the controller. Our simulation results show that our CF-MB network can effectively handle real-time video transmission from UAVs to VR users. Our proposed learning architecture is effective and scalable for a high-dimensional cooperative association problem with increasing APs and VR users. Also, our proposed algorithms outperform non-learning based methods with significant performance improvement.},

In this study, we investigated the potential of UAV-borne RGB data and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate the leaf area index (LAI) of winter wheat during two cropping seasons. In this context, spectral RGB and geometric plant information based on a normalized surface model (nDSM) were used as input variables. The results of the study demonstrated the suitability of optical UAV data and CNNs for LAI estimation of winter wheat at different growth stages and under various lightning conditions. The combination of RGB data and plant structures provided the best overall prediction accuracy ( $r^{2} = 0.83$ ) compared to the models with only one input source (RGB: $r^{2} = 0.58$ , nDSM: $r^{2} = 0.75$ ). Especially the estimation of low and high LAI values was improved using the complementary image information. Moreover, the results showed that the CNN models outperformed two classical machine learning (ML) approaches in terms of accuracy.},

The purpose of the study is to investigate the problem of certifying stability of reinforcement learning policy when linked with nonlinear dynamical systems since conventional control methods often fail to properly account for complex effects. However, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been designed to monitor the robust stability of a UAV's position in three-dimensional space, such as altitude and longitude-latitude location, so that the UAV can fly over a moving platform in a stable manner. Plus, the input-output policy gradient method is regulated and capable of approving a large number of stabilization controllers to obtain robust stability by exploiting problem-specific structure. Inside the stability-certified parameter space, reinforcement learning agents will attain high efficiency while also exhibiting consistent learning behaviors over time, according to a formula assessment on a decentralized control task involving flight creation.},

The UAV flies over this region from a starting point to a destination. During its flight, the UAV wants to communicate to the ground devices for maximizing the cumulative collected data by optimizing the trajectory of the UAV subject to its flight time constraint. Due to uncertainty in the locations of the ground devices and the communication dynamics, an accurate system model is difficult to acquire and maintain. With the help of stochastic modelling, we present a reinforcement learning based automated trajectory optimization algorithm. By dividing the considered region into small grids with finite state space and action space, we apply the Q-learning based automated trajectory optimization approach for maximizing the cumulative collected data during its flight time. Simulation results demonstrate that the reinforcement learning approach can find an optimal strategy under the flight time constraint.},

abstract={Along with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted more and more attention from researchers. The quadrotor UAV is widely used because of free to hover, good performance, and small size. However, quadrotor UAV is still mostly controlled by human based on device-to-device communications due to the clear responsibility. Thus efficient and robust control strategy is required for high quality of safety. On the other hand, the energy consumption is a crucial issue for UAV, as the effective flight time is very short. Hence, at present, many researchers have devoted their efforts into studying minimum consumption either in time or energy of quadrotor UAV in constrained environments. In this paper, we mainly focus on tradeoff between duration and energy consumption to bring intelligence into control of UAV with safty. Firstly, we set the scenario to evaluate such problems. Then, we apply the speed control to minimize the time consumption based on the model derived from Newton's second law. Moreover, we have also demonstrated energy costs according to various time arrangements of the flight whose values are larger than the minimal duration value that has been computed in the second step.},

abstract={The emergence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is pervasive throughout society. A growing segment of usage is of a dubious nature for harassment, illegal activity and terrorism. Detection of unknown UAV's has become a requirement for many organizations and agencies to thwart the emergence of UAV's that are in some way threatening. To detect UAV, the use of acoustic signals has become an useful area of research. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one of several models of deep learning, applied in various fields such as image recognition and natural language processing. In this project, we design a system to detect the presence of possible detection and payload detection using CNNs on the basis of sound data generated from UAV flights. The sound of recorded drones is pre-processed into spectral data by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Mel-Frequency Cepstrum (MFCC) and given as the input value to the CNN model. The results show that it is possible to detect and differentiate UAVs which have standard weight and also with additional payload. In short, the project has two detection goals. One is the acoustic detection of a UAV, and the second is the determination if that UAV has a payload.},

abstract={As wireless networks are getting increasingly complex, there is a strong need to develop novel approaches and capabilities for high throughput communication and processing of wireless data. This need is more pressing as unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) are applied in new areas and innovations such as UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) swarms are developed. Millimeter-wave helps to meet the throughput demand as it provides the higher bandwidth that is needed for 5G wireless communication and beyond. But these higher frequencies also come with their own challenges, such as low signal penetration depth. The main challenge in modern wireless networks is to be able to accurately predict the dynamically changing radio environment. With the introduction of narrow beams in the mm-wave frequency, tracking of the beams is a great challenge. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum computing (QC) could be employed to resolve this problem of beam tracking. In this talk, the challenges in mm-wave wireless networks for vehicle-to-vehicle communication will be highlighted and the ideas involving recent developments in phased-array antenna, beam-steering, beam-alignment, and tracking will be discussed. We shall then critically evaluate the need for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum computing (QC) within the network architecture to provide the required capability for tasks such as beam-control, data-feed processing, resource, and interference management. The next-generation wireless networks need to be self-predictive and proactive to handle futuristic applications like holographic communication, haptic feedback, or any latency-dependent application. Especially in the context of rapidly changing environment where the UAVs are moving fast, AI and/or QC would play a crucial role to achieve a dynamically adaptive network. Next-generation wireless networks offer more capacity for the conveyance of relevant information from onboard instruments such as cameras or thermal sensors. Thus, there shall be a need for the efficient processing of potentially copious amounts of raw data for relevant information. For example, to deploy a drone swarm in a search and rescue operation, the use of QC or AI could improve the processing of received visual information with respect to processing speed. The application of AI and QC for mm Wave-UAV communications is a promising research direction to break through the traditional communication paradigm and integrate communication, computing, and storage resources.},

abstract={There have been increasing interests in employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones for telecommunication purpose. In such networks, UAVs act as base stations and provide downloading service to users. Compared with conventional terrestrial base stations, such UAV-BSs can dynamically adjust their locations to improve network performance. However, there exists two important issues in UAV networks, handoff overhead and UAV deployment. The handoff overhead issue is particularly important for UAVs because UAV BSs are connected to cellular BSs via wireless backhaul links, which are costly in terms of spectrum usage and energy consumption. Hence, it is highly desirable to eliminate any unnecessary handoff to minimise the waste of wireless backhaul. The UAV deployment, on the other hand, introduces a new tool for radio resource management, since BS positions are open for network optimisation. In this paper, a smart user association algorithm, named reinforcement learning handoff (RLH), is devised to reduce redundant handoffs in UAV networks and two methods of UAV mobility control are designed to co-operate with the proposed RLH algorithm to optimise the system throughput. In the RLH algorithm, users perform handoffs according to the reward of a reinforcement learning process. In UAV deployment two UAV mobility control methods are proposed respectively base on the SNR estimation and based on the K-Means approach. According to our simulation results, the RLH algorithm can reduce the number of handoffs by 75%.},

There have been a number of optimal algorithms proposed for the coverage path planning of single UAV, however, it is under-explored for multiple UAVs. As such, we leverage Deep reinforcement learning with Double Q-learning Networks (DDQN) to learn a global optimal control policy for a team of UAVs under certain power constraints to cooperate effectively to explore a wider area. Regarding the task area as a 2D plane, we divide it into a collection of uniform grid cells, which represent a section of the environment. The camera field of view of each UAV covers a cell area underneath the UAV. Simulation results demonstrate that wherever the start positions are, the UAV cluster can fully cover the whole task area under the energy constraints and achieve autonomous collaboration.

The development of convolutional neural network brings great vitality to the detection of small object just like seabird. Due to the complex background and tiny size of seabird in UAV imagery, it is difficult for single semantic segmentation model to detect seabirds accurately. Ensemble learning combines multiple individual learners with a certain strategy to form a committee, which can greatly improve the performance. To realize highly precise and automatic seabird detection from UAV imagery, this paper proposes a deep learning method which combines two semantic segmentation models, as distinct from those generic object detection methods using bounding boxes.

abstract={The success of an unmanned aerial vehicle's (UAVs) or drone's mission is contingent upon planning, command, control, tasking, and communications. Drone-mounted payloads impact UAV flight time. Depending upon the payload, flight times may vary. As such, it is important to know beforehand the expected flight time of a drone, in order to ensure a successful flight. Currently, there are no methods or algorithms for calculating or predicting a drone's flight time that takes into account varying payloads. Manufacturers' technical manuals usually provide only the best-case predictions of UAV flight time; these assume no additional mounted items (e.g., onboard wireless sensor modules, cameras, etc.). In this paper, we describe an empirical study of UAV flight events, and propose regression and deep learning (DL)-based methods to predict accurately the flight time of UAVs. Our methods take onto account both the payload weight and energy dissipation from the onboard battery. The payloads used in our study include gimbal-mounted RGB/thermal cameras, as well as onboard computers. It is expected that this work will provide important guidance to researchers and planners of UAVs.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) machine vision target tracking has a wide range of applications. The most important thing in machine vision target tracking is the real-time performance of the object detection algorithm. At present, the amount of computation of the mainstream target detection algorithms used is too large. The processing speed of the target detection algorithm to the image collected by the computer is too slow, which makes the UAV lack real-time tracking. Therefore, it is very necessary to use a fast object detection algorithm in machine vision target tracking in UAVs. YOLOv3-Tiny is an object detection method based on deep learning. YOLOv3-Tiny optimizes the network structure based on YOLOv3 and reduces the output of one scale. In this work, we use human images to train YOLOv3-Tiny to make it can recognize humans as tracking targets. Then, we use YOLOv3-Tiny to analyze the images collected by the UAV for target tracking. Finally, the control signal of the tracking system is output to the flight controller of the UAV. For the tracking effect of the system designed in the research, we tested the tracking system in a complex indoor environment. It is found that the UAV indoor target tracking system based on YOLOv3-Tiny can effectively achieve target tracking.},

abstract={Multi-agent combat scenarios often appear in many real-time strategy games. Efficient learning for such scenarios is an indispensable step towards general artificial intelligence. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have attracted much interests, but few of them have been shown effective for such scenarios. Most of previous research is focused on revising the learning mechanism of MARL algorithms, for example, trying different types of neural networks. The study of training techniques for improving the performance of MARL algorithms has not been paid much attention. In this paper we propose three efficient training techniques for a multi-agent combat problem which is originated from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) combat scenario. The first one is the scenario-transfer training, which utilizes the experience obtained in simpler combat tasks to assist the training for complex tasks. The next one is the self-play training, which can continuously improve the performance by iteratively training agents and their counterparts. Finally, we consider using combat rules to assist the training, which is named as the rule-coupled training. We combine the three training techniques with two popular multi-agent reinforcement learning methods, multi-agent deep q-learning and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (proposed by Open AI in 2017), respectively. The results show that both the converging speed and the performance of the two methods are significantly improved through the three training techniques.},

abstract={In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks, beam-steering guarantees reliable and steady connection between flying base stations and ground users with the challenge of strict angular deviation. In this paper, we investigate a joint optimization problem of beamforming and beam-steering in the multi-UAV mmWave networks, considering line-of-sight (LoS) communication for UAVs. For the hybrid beamforming optimization of massive MIMO mmWave, we propose a hybrid beamforming scheme based on the cross-entropy estimation with the robustness algorithm inspired by machine learning, which aims to optimize the hybrid precoding matrix. For the beam-steering optimization, we propose a novel mean field game (MFG)-based massive MIMO angle control scheme to model the optimal mmWave channel optimization problem between UAVs and ground users. In addition, when dealing with the problem of initial sensitivity and difficulty to solve the partial differential equations in the MFG, we utilize reinforcement learning to achieve the mean field equilibrium, which is described as the mean field learning game algorithm. Finally, a joint beamforming and beam-steering optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the system sum-rate. Simulation results show the significant improvements in sum-rate, energy efficiency, and spectral efficiency, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network that is convinced as a significant component of 5G and emerging 6G wireless networks is desired to accommodate multiple types of service requirements simultaneously. However, how to converge different types of services onto a common UAV network without deploying an individual network solution for each type of service is challenging. We tackle this challenge in this paper through slicing the UAV network, i.e., creating logical UAV networks customized for specific requirements. To this end, we formulate the UAV network slicing problem as a sequential decision problem to provide mobile broadband (MBB) services for ground mobile users while satisfying ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements of UAV control and non-payload signal delivery. This problem, however, is difficult to be directly solved mainly due to the sequence-dependent characteristic and the lack of accurate location information of mobile users and accurate and tractable channel gain models in practice. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel solution approach based on learning and optimization methods. Particularly, we develop a distributed learning method to predict mobile users’ locations, where partial user location information stored on each UAV is utilized to train user location prediction networks. To achieve accurate channel gain models, we design deep neural networks (DNNs) that are trained by signal measurements at each UAV. To cope with the challenging sequence-dependent characteristic of the problem, we develop a Lyapunov-based optimization framework with provable performance guarantees to decompose the original problem into a sequence of separate optimization subproblems based on the learned results. Finally, an iterative optimization scheme joint with a successive convex approximation technique is exploited to solve these subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the learning methods as well as the effectiveness of the Lyapunov-based optimization framework.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image stitching techniques based on position and attitude information have shown clear speed superiority over feature-based counterparts. However, how to improve stitching accuracy and robustness remains a great challenge since position and attitude parameters are sensitive to noise introduced by sensors and external environment. To mitigate this issue, this work presents a simple yet effective stitching algorithm for UAV images based on a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, we first conduct coarse registration using the position and attitude information obtained from GPS, IMU, and altimeter. Then, we introduce a novel offline calibration phase that is designed to regress the obtained global transformation matrix to the optimal one computed from feature-based algorithms, by using multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for fast correction. Consequently, the proposed method well integrates the complementary strengths of both parameter and feature-based methods, achieving an ideal speed–accuracy tradeoff. Moreover, to facilitate research on this topic, we establish a new dataset, named UAV-AIRPAI, that comprises over 100 UAV image pairs with position and attitude annotations to the community, opening up a promising direction for UAV image stitching. Extensive experiments on the UAV-AIRPAI dataset show that our method achieves superior accuracy compared to priors while running at a real-time speed of 0.0124 s per image pair. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/dededust/UAV-AIRPAI.},

abstract={In this paper, a new nonlinear controller for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed using neural networks (NNs) and output feedback. The assumption on the availability of UAV dynamics is not always practical, especially in an outdoor environment. Therefore, in this work, an NN is introduced to learn the complete dynamics of the UAV online, including uncertain nonlinear terms like aerodynamic friction and blade flapping. Although a quadrotor UAV is underactuated, a novel NN virtual control input scheme is proposed which allows all six degrees of freedom (DOF) of the UAV to be controlled using only four control inputs. Furthermore, an NN observer is introduced to estimate the translational and angular velocities of the UAV, and an output feedback control law is developed in which only the position and the attitude of the UAV are considered measurable. It is shown using Lyapunov theory that the position, orientation, and velocity tracking errors, the virtual control and observer estimation errors, and the NN weight estimation errors for each NN are all semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in the presence of bounded disturbances and NN functional reconstruction errors while simultaneously relaxing the separation principle. The effectiveness of proposed output feedback control scheme is then demonstrated in the presence of unknown nonlinear dynamics and disturbances, and simulation results are included to demonstrate the theoretical conjecture.},

The joint problem of prediction of users' track and 3-D deployment of the UAV is formulated for maximizing the sum transmit rate. A two-step approach is proposed for predicting the movement of users and for determining the dynamic 3-D placement of the UAV. Firstly, an echo state network (ESN) based prediction algorithm is utilized for predicting the future positions of users based on the real-world datasets collected from Twitter. Secondly, an iterative K-Means based algorithm is proposed for obtaining the optimal placement of UAV at each time slot based on the output of ESN model. Numerical results are illustrated for showing the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the prevalent algorithm on prediction tasks. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework are also investigated. Additionally, compared with static placement of the UAV, the advantage of dynamic 3-D deployment is demonstrated.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider a micro unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm network enabled by simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The network consists of one base station (BS) and multiple micro UAVs, where the BS aims to train a machine learning model over the data that resides on each UAV by utilizing federated learning (FL). Particularly, at each iteration of FL, the BS broadcasts both the global model and energy simultaneously to all UAVs, and each UAV relies on its harvested and battery-stored energy to train the received model and then upload it to the BS for global model aggregation. To improve the learning performance, we formulate a problem of maximizing the percentage of scheduled UAVs at each iteration of FL by jointly optimizing UAV scheduling and sub-channel assignment, as well as broadcasting/uploading time and power allocation. The formulated problem is a challenging mixed integer nonlinear programming problem and is NP-hard in general. By exploiting the special property of the problem structure, we develop a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm to efficiently solve the formulated problem. Numerical results show the advantages of our suboptimal algorithm.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms must exploit machine learning (ML) in order to execute various tasks ranging from coordinated trajectory planning to cooperative target recognition. However, due to the lack of continuous connections between the UAV swarm and ground base stations (BSs), using centralized ML will be challenging, particularly when dealing with a large volume of data. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to implement distributed federated learning (FL) algorithms within a UAV swarm that consists of a leading UAV and several following UAVs. Each following UAV trains a local FL model based on its collected data and then sends this trained local model to the leading UAV who will aggregate the received models, generate a global FL model, and transmit it to followers over the intra-swarm network. To identify how wireless factors, like fading, transmission delay, and UAV antenna angle deviations resulting from wind and mechanical vibrations, impact the performance of FL, a rigorous convergence analysis for FL is performed. Then, a joint power allocation and scheduling design is proposed to optimize the convergence rate of FL while taking into account the energy consumption during convergence and the delay requirement imposed by the swarm's control system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the FL convergence analysis and show that the joint design strategy can reduce the number of communication rounds needed for convergence by as much as 35% compared with the baseline design.},

Due to the complex and serious electromagnetic environment in the battlefield, how to identify the MAC protocol when demodulation is unrealistic and switch to this MAC protocol adaptively is challenging. In this paper, we propose Demodulation-free Random Access (DFRA) scheme which can help UAVs join in the UAV ad hoc networks without demodulating the property field of MAC protocol header. First, we propose an adaptive feature extraction algorithm and use it for machine learning based MAC protocol identification. Then, DFRA adopts an adaptive MAC switching framework to access the networks. We implement DFRA with USRP N210 and evaluate the performance by experiments. The results show that DFRA can guarantee access accuracy rate over 95% when demodulation is unrealistic.},

abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can potentially meet the high data-rate requirements of unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) networks. However, as the prerequisite of mmWave communications, the narrow directional beam tracking is very challenging because of the 3-D mobility and attitude variation of UAVs. Aiming to address the beam tracking difficulties, we propose to integrate the conformal array (CA) with the surface of each UAV, which enables the full spatial coverage and the agile beam tracking in highly dynamic UAV mmWave networks. More specifically, the key contributions of our work are threefold: 1) a new mmWave beam tracking framework is established for the CA-enabled UAV mmWave network; 2) a specialized hierarchical codebook is constructed to drive the directional radiating element (DRE)-covered cylindrical CA, which contains both the angular beam pattern and the subarray pattern to fully utilize the potential of the CA; and 3) a codebook-based multiuser beam tracking scheme is proposed, where the Gaussian process machine learning-enabled UAV position/attitude prediction is developed to improve the beam tracking efficiency in conjunction with the tracking-error aware adaptive beamwidth control. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed codebook-based beam tracking scheme in the CA-enabled UAV mmWave network, and demonstrate the advantages of CA over the conventional planner array in terms of spectrum efficiency and outage probability in the highly dynamic scenarios.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) millimeter wave (mmWave) technologies can provide flexible link and high data rate for future communication networks. By considering the new features of three-dimensional (3D) scattering space, 3D velocity, 3D antenna array, and especially 3D rotations, a machine learning (ML) integrated UAV-to-Vehicle (U2V) mmWave channel model is proposed. Meanwhile, a ML-based network for channel parameter calculation and generation is developed. The deterministic parameters are calculated based on the simplified geometry information, while the random ones are generated by the back propagation based neural network (BPNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN), where the training data set is obtained from massive ray-tracing (RT) simulations. Moreover, theoretical expressions of channel statistical properties, i.e., power delay profile (PDP), autocorrelation function (ACF), Doppler power spectrum density (DPSD), and cross-correlation function (CCF) are derived and analyzed. Finally, the U2V mmWave channel is generated under a typical urban scenario at 28 GHz. The generated PDP and DPSD show good agreement with RT-based results, which validates the effectiveness of proposed method. Moreover, the impact of 3D rotations, which has rarely been reported in previous works, can be observed in the generated CCF and ACF, which are also consistent with the theoretical and measurement results.},

abstract={With the envision of sixth generation (6G) network technology, varied artificial intelligence (AI) services gradually develop from the network center to the edge, which makes unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) a hot spot to provide auxiliary services of machine learning (ML) to empower terrestrial users intelligence. However, due to the sensitive privacy and limited resources, traditional centralized ML may not be used directly in such networks. As a promising distributed collaborative ML, fed-erated learning (FL) could be more suitable. Meanwhile, unlike conventional FL working on terrestrial networks, applying FL in UAV-assisted networks should strictly consider the impact of air-ground wireless channel caused by the maneuverability of UAVs, as well as the allocation of various network resources, including frequency and latency. To address these challenges, we propose to jointly optimize the UAV location and resource allocation, subject to the constraints of learning accuracy and training latency to minimize the energy consumption of terrestrial users. The for-mulated complicated non-convex problem is efficiently solved by an alternating optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) approaches after problem decomposition. Simulations results show that our proposed algorithm can reduce more overall users' energy consumption than three benchmarks while guaranteeing the learning accuracy within the maximum training latency.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled edge computing is a promising paradigm to provide task offloading service for computation-intensive applications. Catering for highly dynamic edge networks, learning agents are placed on the UAVs to perceive environmental changes and adjust edge service strategies. These multiple agents build distributed intelligence in edge service scheduling. However, the agents, which independently learn service strategies from scratch, always cost high computing resources, cause extra delays, and bring a critical challenge to UAVs' service efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a transfer learning empowered aerial edge network (AEN), which uses multi-agent machine learning to draw optimal service strategies, while leveraging transfer learning to share and reuse knowledge between the UAVs for saving resource costs and reducing training latency. Furthermore, we develop efficient transfer learning schemes where the edge resources are optimally scheduled for knowledge sharing and task offloading. Numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes maximize edge service utility while significantly improving machine learning efficiency.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used to perform search and tracking tasks in military and civil fields. To perform these tasks autonomously, a swarm of multiple UAVs need to be endowed with intelligence through machine learning (ML). However, the traditional centralized ML cannot be directly applied in UAV networks, since it is challenging to transmit raw data with limited bandwidth and energy budget. As a distributed manner, federated learning (FL) is more suitable for UAV networks than traditional ML schemes in order to boost edge intelligence for UAVs. Considering the limited energy supply of UAVs, we study how to minimize UAVs’ overall training energy consumption by jointly optimizing the local convergence threshold, local iterations, computation resource allocation, and bandwidth allocation, subject to the FL global accuracy guarantee and maximum training latency constraint. The formulated non-convex mixed integer programming problem is solved by a joint training and resource allocation optimization algorithm. In addition, we also study how to solve the problem considering fairness among different UAVs by changing the objective to minimizing the maximum energy consumption of UAVs, and extend the aforementioned approach to this problem. Our simulation results show that, while satisfying both the training accuracy and latency constraints, the proposed algorithm can reduce more UAVs’ overall training energy consumption and the maximum energy consumption in the UAV swarm than four baseline schemes.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to play a key role in intelligent transportation systems to complement the communication infrastructure in future smart cities. UAV-assisted vehicular networking research typically adopts throughput and latency as the main performance metrics. These conventional metrics, however, are not adequate to reflect the freshness of the information, an attribute that has been recently identified as a critical requirement to enable services such as autonomous driving and accident prevention. In this paper, we consider a UAV-assisted single-hop vehicular network, wherein sensors (e.g., LiDARs and cameras) on vehicles generate time sensitive data streams, and UAVs are used to collect and process this data while maintaining a minimum age of information (AoI). We aim to jointly optimize the trajectories of UAVs and find scheduling policies to keep the information fresh under minimum throughput constraints. The formulated optimization problem is shown to be mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and generally hard to be solved. Motivated by the success of machine learning (ML) techniques particularly deep learning in solving complex problems with low complexity, we reformulate the trajectories and scheduling policies problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the system state space considers the vehicular network dynamics. Then, we develop deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the vehicular environment and its dynamics in order to handle UAVs' trajectory and scheduling policy. In particular, we leverage Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for learning the trajectories of the deployed UAVs to efficiently minimize the Expected Weighted Sum AoI (EWSA). Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show the deployed UAVs adapt their velocities during the data collection mission in order to minimize the AoI.},

abstract={Recently, researchers show great interest in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) path planning problem due to development of artificial intelligence algorithms. However, the convergence of these kinds of heuristic methods can not be proved. Therefore, the UAV path planning problem has been modeled as a linear optimal control problem to ensure the convergence. But the computing time will increase exponentially as the scale of the problem enlarge. Hence, the Receding Horizon Control(RHC) is introduced to the problem to guarantee the efficiency. Nevertheless, how to choose a proper receding horizon span to keep balance between efficiency and accuracy becomes a new problem. An adaptive strategy is proposed to choose a proper parameter to meet the real-time requirement and fuel consuming in this paper. The strategy has better performance in the two simulation scenes, which indicates the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

abstract={Collaborative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networking has the characteristics of flexibility, efficiency, ubiquity, etc., which can enhance wireless network coverage and improve the quality of service to ground users. However, collaborative UAV networking has main challenges such as location deployment and energy optimization. For collaborative networking scenarios, it is necessary to focus on solving key issues such as algorithm convergence and time complexity. In response to the above problems, we propose to leverage hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with spatial attention mechanism to reduce time complexity according to actual application requirements of location deployment. Firstly, the convolutional neural network is used to improve the ability of discriminating state features. Then, an improved spatial attention mechanism is introduced to apply different weights to state features of different spatial locations, and focuses on the state features that are favorable for UAV deployment in spatial locations. Finally, the offline training state attention model is added to the state input of hybrid deep reinforcement learning for adaptive deployment training. The simulation results show that the training time of the algorithm can be greatly reduced while both mean opinion score (MOS) and energy consumption performance are reduced by about 10%.},

abstract={In this paper, we have proposed an energy-efficient unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted Internet of things (IoT) network where a low altitude UAV is employed as a mobile data collector. We develop a novel optimization framework that minimizes the total energy consumption of all devices by jointly optimizing the UAV’s trajectory, device association and respective transmit power allocation at every time slot while ensuring that every device should achieve a given transmission rate constraint. As this joint optimization problem is nonconvex and combinatorial, we adopt reinforcement learning (RL) based solution methodology that effectively decouples it into three individual optimization problems. The formulated problem is transformed as a Markov decision process (MDP) where UAV learns its trajectory according to its current state and corresponding action aiming to maximize the reward under the current policy. Finally, we conceive state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), a low complexity iterative algorithm for updating the current policy in the case of randomly deployed IoT devices which achieves good computational complexity-optimality tradeoff via numerical results. We find that the proposed methodology reduces the total energy consumption of all devices by 9.23%, 14.06%, and 15.87% in the case of 80, 100, and 120 available time slots of UAV respectively.},

While numerous approaches have been proposed to solve similar CPP problems, we leverage end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) to learn a control policy that generalizes over varying power constraints for the UAV. Despite recent improvements in battery technology, the maximum flying range of small UAVs is still a severe constraint, which is exacerbated by variations in the UAV's power consumption that are hard to predict. By using map-like input channels to feed spatial information through convolutional network layers to the agent, we are able to train a double deep Q-network (DDQN) to make control decisions for the UAV, balancing limited power budget and coverage goal.

abstract={A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided air-to-ground uplink non-orthogonal transmission framework is investigated for next generation multiple access. Occupying the same spectrum resource, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) users and ground users (GUs) are connected to terrestrial cellular networks via the uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocol. As the flight safety is important for employing UAVs in civil airspace, the collision avoidance mechanism has to be considered during the flight. Therefore, a joint optimization problem of the UAV trajectory design, RIS configuration, and uploading power control is formulated for maximizing the network sum rate, while ensuring the UAV’s fight safety and satisfying the minimum data rate requirements of both the UAV and GU. The resultant problem is a sequential decision making one across multiple coherent time slots. Besides, the unknown locations of obstacles bring uncertainties into the decision making process. To tackle this challenging problem, a sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to optimize the UAV trajectory, RIS configuration, and power control simultaneously. Moreover, considering the ambiguous uncertainties in the environment, a distributionally robust DRL algorithm is further proposed to provide the worst-case performance guarantee. Numerical results demonstrate that the two proposed DRL algorithms outperform the conventional ones in terms of learning efficiency and robustness. It is also shown that the network sum rate is significantly improved by the proposed RIS-NOMA scheme compared to the conventional RIS-orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme and the case where no RIS is deployed.},

The UAV's flight trajectory and scheduling of status updates are jointly optimized with the objective of minimizing the normalized weighted sum of Age of Information (NWAoI) values for different physical processes at the UAV. The problem is first formulated as a mixed-integer program. Then, for a given scheduling policy, a convex optimization-based solution is proposed to derive the UAV's optimal flight trajectory and time instants on updates. However, finding the optimal scheduling policy is challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the formulated problem. Therefore, to complement the proposed convex optimization-based solution, a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) is used to find the optimal scheduling policy. Since the state space of the MDP is extremely large, a novel neural combinatorial-based deep reinforcement learning (NCRL) algorithm using deep Q-network (DQN) is proposed to obtain the optimal policy. However, for large-scale scenarios with numerous nodes, the DQN architecture cannot efficiently learn the optimal scheduling policy anymore. Motivated by this, a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based autoencoder is proposed to map the state space to a fixed-size vector representation in such large-scale scenarios while capturing the spatio-temporal interdependence between the update locations and time instants. A lower bound on the minimum NWAoI is analytically derived which provides system design guidelines on the appropriate choice of importance weights for different nodes. Furthermore, an upper bound on the UAV's minimum speed is obtained to achieve this lower bound value. The numerical results also demonstrate that the proposed NCRL approach can significantly improve the achievable NWAoI per process compared to the baseline policies, such as weight-based and discretized state DQN policies.},

abstract={Aerial communication using directional antennas (ACDA) is a promising solution to enable long-distance and broad-band unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-UAV networking. The automatic alignment of directional antennas allows the transmission energy to focus in certain direction and significantly extends the communication range and rejects interference. Robust automatic alignment of directional antennas is not easy to achieve, considering practical issues such as the limited on-board sensing devices due to the physical constraints of UAV payload and power supplies, uncertain and varying UAV movement patterns, and unstable GPS and unknown communication environments. In this paper, we develop reinforcement learning (RL)-based online antenna control solutions for the ACDA system to conquer these challenges. The control solution adopts an uncertain UAV mobility modeling and intention estimation framework to capture and predict the uncertain intentions of UAV maneuvers and hence permit robust tracking. To account for an unstable GPS environment, the control solution features a learning of communication channel models to provide additional measurement signals in GPS-denied settings. A novel stochastic optimal control solution for nonlinear random switching dynamics is developed that integrates RL, an effective uncertainty evaluation method called multivariate probabilistic collocation method (MPCM), and unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate and validate the proposed solutions.},

abstract={This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless powered IoT network, where a rotary-wing UAV adopts fly-hover-communicate protocol to successively visit IoT devices in demand. During the hovering periods, the UAV works on full-duplex mode to simultaneously collect data from the target device and charge other devices within its coverage. Practical propulsion power consumption model and non-linear energy harvesting model are taken into account. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly optimize three objectives: maximization of sum data rate, maximization of total harvested energy and minimization of UAV's energy consumption over a particular mission period. These three objectives are in conflict with each other partly and weight parameters are given to describe associated importance. Since IoT devices keep gathering information from the physical surrounding environment and their requirements to upload data change dynamically, online path planning of the UAV is required. In this paper, we apply deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve online decision. An extended deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is proposed to learn control policies of UAV over multiple objectives. While training, the agent learns to produce optimal policies under given weights conditions on the basis of achieving timely data collection according to the requirement priority and avoiding devices' data overflow. The verification results show that the proposed MODDPG (multi-objective DDPG) algorithm achieves joint optimization of three objectives and optimal policies can be adjusted according to weight parameters among optimization objectives.},

abstract={Floating trash in the river presents a major environmental problem that endangers the lives of river inhabitants. However, conventional trash monitoring relies on labor-intensive manual inspection by dispatching inspectors to the filed, which is highly cost-ineffective. Despite that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely proposed for many real-time monitoring applications, limited power supply remains the most challenging bottleneck for such UAV-assisted monitoring applications. In this work, we propose an automated river trash monitoring system called SuperDock. SuperDock consists of a remote processing unit, a docking station and a UAV. SuperDock lands the UAV precisely onto the docking station followed by performing automated battery replacement. As a result, the UAV can continue the monitoring task after the battery replacement. Furthermore, SuperDock includes a deep learning-assisted river trash detection module based on YOLOv3 that runs much faster than the conventional Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). In addition, a data set has been generated for training and testing the deep learning network, specifically for the floating trash detection application. Finally, SuperDock enables the UAV to communicate wirelessly with a remote computer in a real-time manner. Experimental and simulation results show that SuperDock is highly effective in monitoring the floating trash in the river.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) fleets are the focus of various nations nowadays. Thus, it is expected to witness an explosion of reliability and safety critical UAV-based applications. Moreover, the recent surge of research on applied artificial intelligence and the industry advancement encourage the use of cooperative UAV fleets that offer potential collaborations even between UAVs from different organizations. The untrusted nature of the operation environments in addition to the high level of criticality of such applications require stringent secure protocols. There have been several security protocol proposals to ensure authentication, confidentiality and integrity, yet the overhead generated by these solutions and their impact on performance still severely hamper UAV endurance. In this paper, we propose to tackle the problem of secure communications within dynamic UAV fleets in open public networks using a pairing free Certificateless-Authenticated Group Key Agreement (CL-AGKA) scheme with constant rounds that meets efficiency and strong security. The formal security validation of the proposed protocol has been done by using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool (AVISPA). The aforementioned tool revealed that the proposed protocol is resilient against several attacks. More important, the computation cost has been significantly reduced thanks to the elimination of the expensive pairing operations and to the integration of the signature scheme into the key agreement to build one efficient algorithm.},

abstract={With the growing intelligence needed on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), seamless edge computing services for the sixth generation (6G) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications require three-dimensional (3D) and ubiquitous networking coverage to realize the intensive computing tasks and data offloading.

abstract={The collaboration of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has stimulated the emergence of a novel wireless network paradigm named UAV network. UAV network, compared with uncoordinated UAV systems could provide wider coverage, better monitoring, and understanding of the interested area, and smarter decision-making. However, realizing the full potential of UAV network in dynamic environments poses great challenges in topology/flocking control, energy conservation, and quality of service guarantee. In this backdrop, this paper proposes a swarm intelligence-inspired autonomous flocking control scheme for UAV networks. First, based on the concept of intelligent emergence of swarm agents, a swarm intelligence-inspired multi-layer flocking control scheme is built for the flocking control problem. Second, an integrated sensing and communication method is put forward to regulate how a UAV can calculate its distances to its neighbors and its deflection angle. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted on our simulator developed on OMNeT++ and the flocking prototype to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The simulation and experimental results have shown that the proposed scheme could realize efficient flocking control with low energy consumption and satisfied the quality of service.},

abstract={This article describes how swarm intelligence can be applied to an array of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for strategic deployment. In emergency or disaster-stricken areas, telecommunications and geospatial surveillance are strictly critical for situational control. Base stations may fail to work due to natural disasters. To be rapidly deployed, lightweight drones with multirotors that provide stability are used as mobile stations. An autonomous learning approach, “self-organizing maps (SOMs),” which can automatically and adaptively coordinate a large array of autonomous drones-self-organizing UAV array-based on requests from end users (EUs) is embedded inside the array. The size and the topology of a UAV array can be dynamically changed in response to various terrains and relocation of EUs. Moreover, with swarm intelligence, the UAV array is capable of reconfiguring its planar topology into a hierarchical one. Such a hierarchical topology divides the entire UAV array into subarrays and creates isolated heterogeneous networks. Thus, the UAV array can cope with diverse situations across geographical barriers by forming a flying ad hoc network.},

In the system we consider, each UAV makes decisions based on local observations, and does not communicate with other UAVs. The algorithm trains a routing policy using an Actor-Critic neural network with multi-resolution observations, including detailed local information and aggregated global information based on mean-field. The algorithm tackles the curse-of-dimensionality problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning and provides a scalable solution.

abstract={It has been recognized that fixed spectrum and channel allocation will lead to waste of spectrum resources when multiple agents communicate at the same time. Dynamic allocation of channels is proposed to maximize the utilization of spectrum resources. In the environment of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is necessary to ensure that each UAV can communicate successfully without interfering with other UAVs. Dynamic allocation of channels plays an important role in such systems. In this paper, we propose a dynamic channel allocation scheme based on deep reinforcement learning for multi-UAV systems. A slotted time system is used by all the UAVs. Di2642erent from the traditional method, the occupancy of each channel is scanned first in each time slot. Then a channel will be selected for data transmission, with feedback from the environment when the transmission is over. The proposed channel allocation scheme incorporates a long short-term memory (LSTM) into the deep reinforcement learning framework, to better learn from the past experience and better adapt to the the highly dynamic environment in a multi-UAV system. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional reinforcement learning method (Q- learning and Deep Q Network (DQN)), the proposed method achieves faster convergence and better performance with respect to average collision rate, average reward, and average successful communication rate.},

abstract={The boom of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is projected to fundamentally shift paradigms of transportations, logistics, agricultures, and public safety as a dominating unmanned application in following decades. To optimally process assigned tasks, each UAV requires prompt and ubiquitous information provisioning regarding the varying operation conditions, which renders exploiting base stations (BSs) of existing wireless infrastructures a tractable solution. To receive services from a BS, a UAV should stay within the coverage area of a BS, which however limits the operation range of a UAV. This obstacle thus drives the deployment of a special sort of UAV, known as an aerial base station (ABS), to relay signals between a BS and a UAV. Based on different flight paths of UAVs, an ABS should autonomously decide its own flight trajectory so as to maximize the number of UAVs which can receive wireless services. However, the inherently non-stationary environment renders the optimum autonomous deployment of an ABS a challenging issue. Inspired by the merit of interacting with the environment, we consequently propose a reinforcement learning scheme to optimize the flight trajectory of an ABS. To eliminate the engineering concern in the conventional Q-learning scheme that most state-action pairs may not be fully visited in the deployment of an ABS, in this paper, a state-amount-reduction (SAR) k-step Q-learning scheme is proposed to avoid the issue in the conventional Q-learning, so as to maximize the number of UAVs receiving services from an ABS. Through providing analytical foundations and simulation studies, outstanding performance of the proposed schemes is demonstrated as compared with that of the conventional reinforcement learning based ABS deployment.},

In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based control framework to prevent unauthorized UAVs from entering a target area in a dynamic game without being aware of the UAV attack model. This UAV control scheme enables a target estate to choose the optimal control policy, such as jamming the global positioning system signals, hacking, and laser shooting, to expel nearby UAVs. A deep reinforcement learning technique, called neural episodic control, is used to accelerate the learning speed to achieve the optimal UAV control policy, especially for estates with a large area, against complicated UAV attack policies. We analyze the computational complexity for the proposed UAV control scheme and provide its performance bound, including the risk level of the estate and its utility. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the risk level of the target estate and improve its utility against malicious UAVs compared with the selected benchmark scheme.},

In this paper, we provide a cost-effective solution for detecting insulators under the conditions of an uncluttered background, varied object resolution and illumination conditions using You Only Look Once (YOLO) deep learning neural network model from aerial images. We apply data augmentation to avoid overfitting with a training set size of 56000 image samples. It is demonstrated experimentally that this method can accurately locate insulator on UAV based real-time image data. The detected insulator images are then successfully subjected to insulator surface condition assessment for the presence of ice, snow and water using different classifiers.},

abstract={This paper presents a deep learning approach for the classification of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images acquired by different sensors and different locations of the earth surface. In a first step, the labeled and unlabeled UAV images under analysis are fed to a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) for generating initial deep feature representations. Then in second step, we learn robust domain-invariant features using an additional network composed of two fully connected layers. This network aims to tackle the data-shift problem by reducing the discrepancy between the labeled and unlabeled data distributions. For such purpose, the first layer projects the labeled data to the space of the unlabeled data, while the second layer maintains the discrimination ability between the different land-cover classes. Experimental results obtained on two datasets acquired over the cities of Trento and Toronto with spatial resolutions of 2 cm and 15 cm, respectively, are reported and discussed.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel attitude estimation for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed based on long and short term memory neural network (LSTM NN). The UAV is a strong coupling and multi-variable nonlinear complex system, in which the attitude estimation is nonlinear and the attitude data of the UAV is a time series sequence. LSTM NN is therefore selected due to its satisfied performance in time-based data prediction. The data samples to train the LSTM NN are collected during the test flight of a quadrotor. To improve the accuracy of the model, different configurations of the LSTM NNs are used for comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that the method for the UAV attitude estimation has higher accuracy and the potential of applying deep learning technique to the online UAV attitude estimation.},

abstract={Acoustic applications on a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) have been hindered by its low input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Such low SNR condition poses prominent challenges for beamforming algorithms, statistical methods, and existing mask-based deep learning algorithms. We propose the small model on low SNR (SMoLnet), a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) to suppress UAV noise in noisy speech signals recorded off a microphone array mounted on the UAV. The proposed SMoLnet employs a large analysis window to achieve high spectral resolution since the loud UAV noise exhibits a narrow-band harmonic pattern. In the proposed SMoLnet model, exponentially-increasing dilated convolution layers were adopted to capture the global relationship across the frequency dimension. Furthermore, we performed direct spectral mapping between noisy and clean complex spectrogram to cater to the low SNR scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed SMoLnet outperforms existing dilation-based models in terms of speech quality and objective speech intelligibility metrics for UAV noise reduction. In addition, the proposed SMoLnet requires fewer parameters and achieves lower latency than the compared models.},

abstract={Fast and accurate vehicle detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery is a meaningful but challenging task, playing an important role in a wide range of applications. Due to its tiny size, few features, variable scales and imbalance vehicle sample problems in UAV imagery, current deep learning methods used in this task cannot achieve a satisfactory performance both in accuracy and speed, which is obvious a classical trade-off problem. In this paper, we propose a single-shot vehicle detector, which focuses on accurate and real-time vehicle detection in UAV imagery. We make contributions in the following two aspects: 1) presenting a multi-scale feature fusion module to combine the high resolution but semantically weak features with the low resolution but semantically strong features, aiming to introduce context information to enhance the feature representation of the small vehicles; 2) proposing a dynamic training strategy (DTS) which constructs the network to learn more discriminative features of hard examples, via using cross entropy and focal loss function alternately. Experimental results show that our method can achieve 90.8% accuracy in UAV images and can run at 59 FPS on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU for the small vehicle detection in UAV images.},
