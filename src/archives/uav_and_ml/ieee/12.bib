abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be a key component of the next-generation wireless systems. Due to their deployment flexibility, UAVs are being considered as an efficient solution for collecting information data from ground nodes and transmitting it wirelessly to the network. In this paper, a UAV-assisted wireless network is studied, in which energy-constrained ground nodes are deployed to observe different physical processes. In this network, a UAV that has a time constraint for its operation due to its limited battery, moves towards the ground nodes to receive status update packets about their observed processes. The flight trajectory of the UAV and scheduling of status update packets are jointly optimized with the objective of achieving the minimum weighted sum for the age- of-information (AoI) values of different processes at the UAV, referred to as weighted sum-AoI. The problem is modeled as a finite- horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with finite state and action spaces. Since the state space is extremely large, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal policy that minimizes the weighted sum-AoI, referred to as the age-optimal policy. Several simulation scenarios are considered to showcase the convergence of the proposed deep RL algorithm. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that the proposed deep RL approach can significantly improve the achievable sum- AoI per process compared to the baseline policies, such as the distance-based and random walk policies. The impact of various system design parameters on the optimal achievable sum-AoI per process is also shown through extensive simulations.},

abstract={Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have a greater potential to be widely used in civil and military applications. Swarm of UAVs can be deployed in a multitude of 24/7 security and surveillance. The network management and pattern formation are crucial for multi-UAV formation control mechanisms while cautiously navigating the surveillance areas. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based Formation Flight Control for Navigation (FFCN) is used to efficiently build the UAV swarm, which decreases networking load by minimizing communication and processing involved in pattern formation. Moreover, through the leader-follower navigation, the network management of the swarm is substantially simplified. The leader-follower approach in FFCN is efficient for multi-UAV as the navigation system needs to find only the leader's trajectory. However, the failure of the leader due to actuator faults decreases the efficiency of the system. The proposed FFCN addresses the above by including a fault-tolerance mechanism, thus improving the system's reliability. Simulation results show that the FFCN model achieves faster convergence in less time with a lower collision rate. The model's usage reduced the collision rate to 3.4% in successful formation without colliding with other UAVs.},

abstract={The use of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has become crucial for modern networks. To ensure the targeted performance of such networks, diverse techniques were introduced to enhance system reliability. Many network designs have adapted the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide wider coverage and meet performance targets. However, the cybersecurity aspect of UAVs has not been fully considered. In this paper, we propose a lightweight intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) module for UAVs. The IDPS module is trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), specifically Deep Q-learning (DQN), to enable UAVs to autonomously detect suspicious activities and to take necessary action to ensure the security of the network. A customized reward function is used to take into consideration the dataset unbalanced nature, which encourages the IDPS module to detect minor classes. Also, considering the limited availability of resources for UAVs, a periodic offline-learning approach is introduced to ensure that UAVs are capable to learn and adapt to the evolution of intrusion attacks autonomously. Numerical simulations show the efficiency of the proposed IDPS in detecting suspicious activities and corroborating the advantages brought by the periodic offline learning in comparison with similar online learning approaches, in terms of accuracy and energy consumption.},

abstract={Deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations to support cellular networks can deliver a fast and flexible solution for serving high and varying traffic demand. In order to adequately leverage the benefit of UAVs deployment, their efficient placement is of utmost importance, and requires to intelligently adapt to the environment changes. In this paper, we propose novel learning-based mechanisms for the three-dimensional deployment of UAVs assisting terrestrial networks in the downlink for overloaded situations. The problem is modeled as a game among UAVs. To solve the game, we utilize tools from reinforcement learning, and develop low complexity algorithms based on the multi-armed bandit and satisfaction methods to learn UAVs' locations. Simulation results reveal that the proposed satisfaction based UAV placement algorithm can yield significant performance gains up to about 50% and 41% in terms of throughput and the number of outage users, respectively, compared to a learning based benchmark algorithm.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely adopted to support complex target tracking tasks for military and civilian applications, especially in open and unknown environments. In practical cases, the moving trajectory of the target cannot be known to the UAVs in advance, which brings great challenges to UAVs to realize real-time and effective tracking. In addition, the limited tracking ability of a single UAV can hardly meet the requirements of a high tracking success rate. To deal with these problems above, this paper establishes a multi-UAV cooperative target tracking system. Besides, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm is designed to enable UAVs to make flight action decisions intelligently to track the moving air target, according to the past and current position information of the target only. To further increase the detection coverage of the UAV network when tracking, spatial information entropy is introduced to the reward designing in this algorithm. Simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm yields impressive target tracking performances, and significantly outperforms several common DRL baselines in terms of the tracking success rate. The convergence of the algorithm is also verified by the simulations.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used to provide enhanced information coverage as well as relay services for ground Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. Considering the substantially limited processing capability, the IoT devices may not be able to tackle with heavy computing tasks. In this article, a multi-UAV-aided mobile-edge computing (MEC) system is constructed, where multiple UAVs act as MEC nodes in order to provide computing offloading services for ground IoT nodes which have limited local computing capabilities. For the sake of balancing the load for UAVs, the differential evolution (DE)-based multi-UAV deployment mechanism is proposed, where we model the access problem as a generalized assignment problem (GAP), which is then solved by a near-optimal solution algorithm. Based on this, we are capable of achieving the load balance of these drones while guaranteeing the coverage constraint and satisfying the quality of service (QoS) of IoT nodes. Furthermore, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is conceived for the task scheduling in a certain UAV, which improves the efficiency of the task execution in each UAV. Finally, sufficient simulation results show the feasibility and superiority of our proposed load-balance-oriented UAV deployment scheme as well as the task scheduling algorithm.},

The DSST contains two correlation filters, i.e., the scale filter and the translation filter to achieve satisfying tracking performance in terms of speed and accuracy when compared with the recently introduced tracking-by-detection strategy which relays on deep learning model of the convolutional neural network. Optical flow including the motion information is used to extract regions of interests (ROIs) which will be matched with a template to complete the anti-occlusion tracking.

abstract={The pine wilt disease (PWD) is one of the most dangerous and destructive diseases to coniferous forests. The rapid spread trend and strong destruction directly threaten the security of forests. The complex spread pattern and the hard labor process of diagnosis call for an effective way to detect the infected areas. In this paper, an airborne edge-computing and lightweight deep learning based system are designed for PWD detection by using imagery sensors. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is firstly utilized to realize a large-scale coverage of forests, which can substantially reduce the hard labor. Except for infected trees, a large number of irrelevant images are also acquired by the UAV, which will overload the burden of process and transmission. Then a lightweight improved YOLOv4-Tiny based method (named as YOLOv4-Tiny-3Layers) is proposed to filter these uninterested images by leveraging the computation capability of edge computing, which can realize a fast coarse-grained detection with a low missing rate. Finally, all the remaining images are transmitted to the ground workstation for the final fine-grained detection. Experimental results show that the proposed system can implement a fast detection with superior performance as compared to other methods, which helps to detect the infected pine trees in a quick manner.},

abstract={This work is related to building a Human Detection system based on Fully Connected One Shot (FCOS). It is one of the most recent Deep Learning approaches primitively built using single shot detection proposal. Unlike the double stage region-based object detection schemes this technique do not follow semantic segmentation, it does not undergo loss of the object information such as disappearance of the gradients and it does not require pre-defined anchors. This technique comprises strong feature extractors and reinforce multi scale object detection and it is very quick in the multithreaded GPU environments. Since our fundamental research is concentrated on object classification related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, as a first step we choose to detect the humans from thermal dataset. Therefore, we used thermal images and videos possessed from thermal cameras of UAV lm to 50m above ground level as our dataset in building the model and testing. The FCOS extracts the features of an object using its efficient per-pixel fashion. Finally, the performance analysis of these model in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) indicates that the modelling using FCOS performs in a promising way and it can be used in automatic human detection systems.},

In this work, a dataset of 6k synthetic depth maps of drones has been generated and used to train a state-of-the-art deep learning-based drone detection model. While many sensing technologies can only provide relative altitude and azimuth of an obstacle, our depth map-based approach enables full 3D localization of the obstacle. This is extremely useful for collision avoidance, as 3D localization of detected drones is key to perform efficient collision-free path planning. The proposed detection technique has been validated in several real depth map sequences, with multiple types of drones flying at up to 2 m/s, achieving an average precision of 98.7 %, an average recall of 74.7 % and a record detection range of 9.5 meters.},

abstract={Inspired by its success in financial sectors, the blockchain technique is emerging as an enabling technology for secure distributed control and management of wireless networks. In order to fully benefit from this distributed ledger technology, its limitations, cost, complexity and empowerment also have to be critically appraised. Depending on the specific context of the problem to be solved, these limitations have been handled to some extent through a clear dichotomy in the blockchain architectures, namely by conceiving both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. Permissionless blockchain requires massive computing power to achieve consensus, while its permissioned counterpart is energy efficient but would require trusted participants. To combine these benefits by gaining trust at a high energy efficiency, a novel mechanism is proposed for automatically learning the trust level of users in a public blockchain network and granting them access to a private blockchain network. In this context, machine learning is a very powerful tool capable of automatically learning the trust level. We have proposed reinforcement learning for bridging the dichotomy of blockchains in terms of striking a trust vs complexity trade-off in an unknown environment. Benefits and limitations of various forms of blockchain techniques are analyzed, followed by their reinforcement-aided evolution. We demonstrate that the proposed reinforcement learning aided blockchain is capable of supporting high-integrity autonomous operation and decision making in wireless networks. The win-win amalgamation of these techniques has been demonstrated for striking a compelling balance between the benefits of permissioned and permissionless blockchain networks through the case-study of the proposed blockchain based unmanned aerial vehicle aided wireless networks.},

abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence and integrated sensor technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are more and more applied in the air combats. A bottleneck that constrains the capability of UAVs against manned vehicles is the autonomous maneuver decision, which is a very challenging problem in the short-range air combat undergoing highly dynamic and uncertain maneuvers of enemies. In this paper, an autonomous maneuver decision model is proposed for the UAV short-range air combat based on reinforcement learning, which mainly includes the aircraft motion model, one-to-one short-range air combat evaluation model and the maneuver decision model based on deep Q network (DQN). However, such model includes a high dimensional state and action space which requires huge computation load for DQN training using traditional methods. Then, a phased training method, called “basic-confrontation”, which is based on the idea that human beings gradually learn from simple to complex is proposed to help reduce the training time while getting suboptimal but efficient results. Finally, one-to-one short-range air combats are simulated under different target maneuver policies. Simulation results show that the proposed maneuver decision model and training method can help the UAV achieve autonomous decision in the air combats and obtain an effective decision policy to defeat the opponent.},

UVs have various applications for homeland security, especially border patrol and surveillance. UGVs and UAVs have different strengths and limitations in these tasks. Generally, a UGV can operate for a long period but can only cover a limited area while a UAV can cover a larger area but operate for a shorter period. While there are also sophisticated UAVs that have a long aloft time, the cost of such a UAV is too high for wide deployment. To address these challenges, we propose a heterogeneous architecture for a UV system that unleashes the potential of UGVs and UAVs. As the UV system may be deployed into hostile environments, we also discuss the details of security enhancements. Furthermore, we discuss methods to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into the system considering the increased importance of AI technologies for homeland security tasks.},

abstract={Among UAV applications, real-time high-resolution video surveillance systems using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) especially gain our research interests, because high mobilities of UAVs and high qualities of videos can dramatically improve the surveillance performance and evolve the system, especially for artificial intelligence (AI)-based monitoring systems. However, it is challenging to transmit high-resolution videos to ground station in real-time and also impossible to perform AI detection based on these videos on UAVs. To address the challenges, we propose to take full advantages of mmWave communications and to apply it into UAV-based surveillance systems to transmit ultra-high-quality and ultra-high-resolution uncompressed 4 K videos. To increase energy efficiency of UAVs, we propose to offload all computations via mmWave from UAVs to ground station. Moreover, in addition to design of system architecture, proof-of-concept (PoC) prototype hardware of the proposed system is practically developed to demonstrate technical feasibilities of mmWave communication on UAVs and the enhancements to practical surveillance applications. The practical issues in the implementation and the necessary hardware/software applied in the prototype system are explained in detail in this paper.

abstract={Since unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be controlled remotely in the absence of a unified means of identity authentication, they are quite vulnerable for illegal control by unidentifiable users. Only by tracing the identity of UAV itself, or providing management to pilots, current UAV identity authentication mechanism is far from achieving “single machine for single person.” With the development of artificial intelligence, it is possible to achieve automatic UAV identification. Therefore, this article proposes a behavior-based intelligent UAV identification and security supervision. Based on location tracking and flying data acquisition provided by the airborne black box, the UAV's behavioral data are collected on real time. Then, a reliable identification of UAVs is completed through the behavioral modeling, and a warning is issued in the potential illegal cases. It provides the government with intelligent control and disposal decision basis for flying UAVs.},

abstract={Miniaturizing an autonomous robot is a challenging task - not only the mechanical but also the electrical components have to operate within limited space, payload, and power. Furthermore, the algorithms for autonomous navigation, such as state-of-the-art (SoA) visual navigation deep neural networks (DNNs), are becoming increasingly complex, striving for more flexibility and agility. In this work, we present a sensor-rich, modular, nano-sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), almost as small as a five Swiss Franc coin - called Fünfliber - with a total weight of 18g and 7.2cm in diameter. We conceived our UAV as an open-source hardware robotic platform, controlled by a parallel ultra-low power (PULP) system-on-chip (SoC) with a wide set of onboard sensors, including three cameras (i.e., infrared, optical flow, and standard QVGA), multiple Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors, a barometer, and an inertial measurement unit. Our system runs the tasks necessary for a flight controller (sensor acquisition, state estimation, and low-level control), requiring only 10% of the computational resources available aboard, consuming only 9mW - 13x less than an equivalent Cortex M4-based system. Pushing our system at its limit, we can use the remaining onboard computational power for sophisticated autonomous navigation workloads, as we showcase with an SoA DNN running at up to 18Hz, with a total electronics' power consumption of 271mW.},

In this paper, we propose a holistic anomaly detection system using deep neural networks for surveillance of critical infrastructures (e.g., airports, harbors, warehouses) using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). First, we present a heuristic method for the explicit representation of spatial layouts of objects in bird-view images. Then, we propose a deep neural network architecture for unsupervised anomaly detection (UAV-AdNet), which is trained on environment representations and GPS labels of bird-view images jointly. Unlike studies in the literature, we combine GPS and image data to predict abnormal observations. We evaluate our model against several baselines on our aerial surveillance dataset and show that it performs better in scene reconstruction and several anomaly detection tasks.

number={},
pages={1-15},
abstract={Environment perception by computing the depth is a key task for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) type systems. Due to the limited load they can carry, most drones are equipped with a single camera. This prevents general-purpose depth perception methods based either on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) or stereo reconstruction to be effectively used on such platforms. Due to the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods have become more and more trustworthy, so their usage on drones is convenient. However, very few such methods have been proposed in the literature, mainly due to the few existing constraints and high diversity that unstructured aerial environments pose. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach for MDE, capable to work on aerial images. The method initially proposes an original CNN, particularly adapted to such scenarios. This is done by finding an optimal feature extractor, introducing a new scene understanding module, a new loss and a novel softmax transformation layer that facilitate a better convergence. Furthermore, since both short- and long-range accuracy is required for a robust UAV perception, we introduce a learning-based correction method that redistributes the depth points across the entire depth interval. The proposed CNN gives accurate results, while the additional refinement further improves the accuracy with only a few additional computational resources (around 1–2 ms). We initially show the capabilities of our method on synthetic images captured in unstructured aerial scenarios. Then, we prove that our method can work in real-life situations, computing depth from a single image (at multiple pitch angles) captured by a drone flying in a series of field and forest-like environments. In all these situations, the depth is densely estimated with increased accuracy and reliability.},

The weights from the convolutional layer are calculated according to the performances of the primary classifiers in a validation phase. Two datasets with different images are used for classifier learning, validation, and testing, one consisting in images from satellite and another consisting in images from UAVs.

abstract={Since the invention in 2016, federated learning (FL) has been a key concept of artificial intelligence, in which the data of FL users needs not to be uploaded to the central server. However, performing FL tasks may not be feasible due to the unavailability of terrestrial communications and the battery limitation of FL users. To address these issues, we make use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless powered communications (WPC) for FL networks. In order to enable sustainable FL solutions, the UAV equipped with edge computing and WPC capabilities is deployed as an aerial energy source as well as an aerial server to perform FL tasks. We propose a joint algorithm of UAV placement, power control, transmission time, model accuracy, bandwidth allocation, and computing resources, namely energy-efficient FL (E2FL), aiming at minimizing the total energy consumption of the aerial server and users. The E2FL overcomes the original nonconvex problem by an efficient algorithm. We show that sustainable FL solutions can be provided via UAV-enabled WPC through various simulation results. Moreover, the outperformance of E2FL in terms of energy efficiency over several benchmarks emphasizes the need for a joint resource allocation framework rather than optimizing a subset of optimization factors.},

Moreover, security plays a crucial role in the commercial deployment of AVs. This paper focuses on the role of futuristic technologies in securing such a critical environment.

abstract={Remotely sensed multispectral (MS) images have been widely used in different areas of research in recent years, allowing their exploitation in many domains like precision agriculture. This study uses high-resolution RGB data, collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV/drone), equipped with a camera sensor and flown over an olive tree field in Extremadura (Spain), for land-cover classification purposes. Drone flights over large agricultural areas, collecting high spatial resolution images such as the scenario studied, can be tedious to process, requiring a large amount of random-access memory (RAM). To solve this issue, a new olive tree cover mapping approach is proposed by applying a spatial partitioning methodology that consists of splitting the image automatically, before processing. Each part (known as the raster window) is classified by using machine learning methods. Finally, a classification map is obtained after processing all windows. Among different supervised spectral classification methods, the following classifiers are considered: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN), with the ultimate goal of detecting olive trees and distinguishing them from other land-cover types available in the scene, such as soil, shadows, and weeds. In addition, our experimental results demonstrate that these classifiers can be used to avoid time-consuming fieldwork tasks, facilitating the analysis of agricultural fields with “a la carte” UAV flights resulting in high classification accuracy.},

Real-world observations of sheep show non-homogeneous responses to the presence of a herding agent. We present a portfolio of information-theoretic and spatial indicators to track the footprints of shoids with different parameters within the shoid flock. The portfolio is named the Centre of Influence to indicate that the aim is to identify the influential shoids with the highest impact on flock dynamics. We use both synthetic simulation-driven data and measurements collected from live sheep herding trials by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to validate the proposed measures. The resultant measures will allow us in our future research to design more efficient control strategies for the UAV, by polarising the attention of the machine learning algorithm on those shoids with influence footprints, to drive the flock to improve the herding of sheep.},

abstract={Asphalt roads are the basic component of a land transportation system, and the quality of asphalt roads will decrease during the use stage because of the aging and deterioration of the road surface.

In order to improve the efficiency of pavement inspection, currently some new forms of remote sensing data without destructive effect on the pavement are widely used to detect the pavement distresses, such as digital images, light detection and ranging, and radar. Multispectral imagery presenting spatial and spectral features of objects has been widely used in remote sensing application. In our study, the multispectral pavement images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were used to distinguish between the normal pavement and pavement damages (e.g., cracks and potholes) using machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest. Comparison of the performance between different data types and models was conducted and is discussed in this study, and indicates that a UAV remote sensing system offers a new tool for monitoring asphalt road pavement condition, which can be used as decision support for road maintenance practice.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has recently drawn more attention due to its ability to achieve the interconnections of massive physic devices. However, how to provide a reliable power supply to energy-constrained devices and improve the energy efficiency in the wireless powered IoT (WP-IoT) is a twofold challenge. In this paper, we develop a novel wireless power transmission (WPT) system, where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with radio frequency energy transmitter charges the IoT devices. A machine learning framework of echo state networks together with an improved k -means clustering algorithm is used to predict the energy consumption and cluster all the sensor nodes at the next period, thus automatically determining the charging strategy. The energy obtained from the UAV by WPT supports the IoT devices to communicate with each other. In order to improve the energy efficiency of the WP-IoT system, the interference mitigation problem is modeled as a mean field game, where an optimal power control policy is presented to adapt and analyze the large number of sensor nodes randomly deployed in WP-IoT. The numerical results verify that our proposed dynamic charging policy effectively reduces the data packet loss rate, and that the optimal power control policy greatly mitigates the interference, and improve the energy efficiency of the whole network.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel multiclass-target classification method for mmWave frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar operating in the frequency range of 77 - 81 GHz, based on custom range-angle heatmaps and machine learning tools. The elevation field of view (FoV) is increased by orienting the Radar antennas in elevation. In this orientation, the radar focuses the beam in elevation to improve the elevation FoV. The azimuth FoV is improved by mechanically rotating the Radar horizontally, which has antenna elements oriented in the elevation direction. The data from the Radar measurements obtained by mechanical rotation of the Radar in Azimuth are used to generate a range-angle heatmap. The measurements are taken in a variety of real-world scenarios with various objects such as humans, a car, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), also known as a drone. The proposed technique achieves accuracy of 97.6 % and 99.6 % for classifying the UAV and humans, respectively, and accuracy of 98.1 % for classifying the car from the range-angle FoV heatmap. Such a Radar classification technique will be extremely useful for a wide range of applications in cost-effective and dependable autonomous systems, including ground station traffic monitoring and surveillance, as well as control systems for both on-ground and aerial vehicles.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems with high-resolution video cameras are used for many operations such as aerial imaging, search and rescue, and precision agriculture. Multi-drone systems operating in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETS) are inherently insecure and require efficient security schemes to defend against cyber-attacks such as e.g., Man-in-the-middle, Replay and Denial of Service attacks. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based, end-to-end security framework viz., "DroneNet-Sec" that provides secure network-edge connectivity, and computation security for drone video analytics to defend against common attack vectors in UAV systems. The DroneNet-Sec features a dynamic security scheme that uses machine learning to detect anomaly events and adopts countermeasures for computation security of containerized video analytics tasks. The security scheme comprises of a custom secure packet designed with MAVLink protocol for ensuring data privacy and integrity, without high degradation of the performance in a real-time FANET deployment. We evaluate DroneNet-Sec in a hybrid testbed that synergies simulation and emulation via an open-source network simulator (NS-3) and a research platform for mobile wireless networks (POWDER). Our performance evaluation experiments in our holistic hybrid-testbed show that DroneNet-Sec successfully detects learned anomaly events and effectively protects containerized tasks execution as well as communication in drones video analytics in a light-weight manner.},

abstract={Establishing and training beams in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications is a challenging task. In this paper, a novel beam training method is proposed by employing the machine learning (ML) method. Firstly, we analyze the applicable conditions of ML and preplan an ideal relationship of received signals. The required beam patterns based on this ideal relationship can be obtained by using the Fourier series method (FSM). We then formulate the beam selection issue as a polynomial regression problem based on hand-crafted features. Especially, we utilize the denoising autoencoder (DAE) to modify the error caused by the channel noise. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that our proposed beam training algorithm is able to provide precise beam selection for the mmWave UAV communications.},

abstract={Analysis of interactions with remotely controlled devices has been used to detect the onset of hijacking attacks, as well as for forensics analysis, e.g., to identify the human controller. Its effectiveness is known to depend on the remote device type as well as on the properties of the remote control signal. This paper shows that the radio control signal sent to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a typical transmitter can be captured and analyzed to identify the controlling pilot using machine learning techniques. Twenty trained pilots have been asked to fly a high-end research drone through three different trajectories. Control data have been collected and used to train multiple classifiers. Best performance has been achieved by a random forest classifier that achieved accuracy around 90% using simple time-domain features. Extensive tests have shown that the classification accuracy depends on the flight trajectory and that the pitch, roll, yaw, and thrust control signals show different levels of significance for pilot identification. This result paves the way to a number of security and forensics applications, including continuous identification of UAV pilots to mitigate the risk of hijacking.},

abstract={In recent years, edge computing and deep learning have been successfully performed processing and classification tasks in a variety of fields including agriculture. Therefore, this research aims to use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for agriculture applications with integrating edge computing and deep learning techniques. This research experiment was carried out in the NCHU Experimental Farm. The DJI Matrice 100 drone with ASUS Tinker Board S embedded system, which connects a Logitech C925e webcam to capture images are used in this study. The ASUS Tinker Board S runs a folder monitoring program and sends images over the 4G LTE network to the backend server whenever new images are captured and stored. The backend server runs a pre-trained image semantic segmentation model and provides image inference service. The image inference results with the associated segmented image will be sent to the mobile device of the drone controller, and a dynamic flight control action can be triggered. The image semantic segmentation model adopts SegNet network architecture. For a comparison purpose, another network architecture, FCN-AlexNet, was also trained and validated. The preliminary results show SegNet outperformed FCN-AlexNet in image semantic segmentation tasks in terms of the evaluation between training and validation. The average inference speed of the semantic image segmentation model is 0.7s with segmentation identification accuracy is 89%. The promising results shed light on many agriculture applications, such as crop growth condition assessment, fertilizer management, and yield prediction. Additionally, this research provides possible solutions for the labor shortage issue of agriculture which is a common challenge in an aging community like Taiwan and many countries worldwide.},

abstract={Recent progress in the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) causes serious safety issues for mass events and safety-sensitive locations like prisons or airports. To address these concerns, robust UAV detection systems are required. In this work, we propose an UAV detection framework based on video images. Depending on whether the video images are recorded by static cameras or moving cameras, we initially detect regions that are likely to contain an object by median background subtraction or a deep learning based object proposal method, respectively. Then, the detected regions are classified into UAV or distractors, such as birds, by applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier. To train this classifier, we use our own dataset comprised of crawled and self-acquired drone images, as well as bird images from a publicly available dataset. We show that, even across a significant domain gap, the resulting classifier can successfully identify UAVs in our target dataset. We evaluate our UAV detection framework on six challenging video sequences that contain UAVs at different distances as well as birds and background motion.},

abstract={Real-time decision making with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) imagery is desired in many applications. Deep learning (DL) is a promising enabler for such applications thanks to its recent advancements. However, direct execution of DL models on UAVs, especially small and micro ones, would not only introduce severe delay but also significantly shorten the flight time of UAVs due to the high energy consumption. Realtime transmission of UAV images to ground edge devices for deep analysis can mitigate the computational complexity but may introduce severe interference to ground devices, in addition unpredictable delays due to the dynamic network conditions. To minimize real-time image transmission, this paper designs a new offloading prediction algorithm which first estimates nearfuture need for DL of each UAV and transmit images only when necessary. Holistic resource allocation is made at the edge based on the offloading likelihood analysis of multiple UAVs as well as available resources. Experimental results on real UAV video clips show that our design can save 92% of the communication costs with less than 4% false positive rate.},

abstract={The main reason for waste production is littering which also results in pollution. Knowingly or unknowingly, littering affects the climate and environment. And, it additionally costs the municipalities a huge amount of money every year to clean up the cities. Normally, garbage searching, collection and waste management is in the hands of the executives and authorities, for example, the municipality trucks work for urban communities, janitors for industries, etc. But, none of these systems are perfect. Because of the weaknesses of existing waste management system and less transparency in the garbage disposal system by the authorities, this paper aims to propose a solution for garbage checking in a wide manner. This paper presents an efficient solution for solid waste detection which will be made possible with the use of UAV i.e. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (for example, drone) which will assist the society by distinguishing places polluted with waste materials and will send the area details as a warning in the “Drone Cleanzilla” website.This system will utilize the ideas of image stitching, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks to detect garbage from the pictures captured by the drone. These images will be sent to Firebase using Raspberry Pi which is going to be installed in the drone. From Firebase cloud, “Drone Cleanzilla” website will fetch the images with time and location. This project will bring more transparency to the wastage cleaning system as all the details of waste along with pictures and location will be uploaded in our website which will be accessible to everyone with internet. This will alert the municipality and officials and they will have to responsibly take actions to clean the garbage. In future, we will also examine the future uses of this project which will handle both trash identification and collection by the government authorities.},

In this study, a low complexity and high accuracy hybrid vehicle detection method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with support of morphological operations is presented. Results on the COWC dataset show that the proposed architecture can detect vehicles with precision of 96% even though the number of neural network parameters is just above a hundred thousands. A comparison on number of parameters with respect to commonly used neural networks reveal that the proposed architecture uses significantly lower number of parameters. Performance evaluation and the comparison of the proposed method with YOLO-v4 show the success of the presented miniature CNN network.},

abstract={In recent years, the emergence of blockchain technology (BT) has become a unique, most disruptive, and trending technology. The decentralized database in BT emphasizes data security and privacy. Also, the consensus mechanism in it makes sure that data is secured and legitimate. Still, it raises new security issues such as majority attack and double-spending. To handle the aforementioned issues, data analytics is required on blockchain based secure data. Analytics on these data raises the importance of arisen technology Machine Learning (ML). ML involves the rational amount of data to make precise decisions. Data reliability and its sharing are very crucial in ML to improve the accuracy of results. The combination of these two technologies (ML and BT) can provide highly precise results. In this paper, we present a detailed study on ML adoption for making BT-based smart applications more resilient against attacks. There are various traditional ML techniques, for instance, Support Vector Machines (SVM), clustering, bagging, and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) can be used to analyse the attacks on a blockchain-based network. Further, we include how both the technologies can be applied in several smart applications such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Smart Grid (SG), healthcare, and smart cities. Then, future research issues and challenges are explored. At last, a case study is presented with a conclusion.},

abstract={The security threats caused by the popularity of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have received much attention. In this paper, a UAV detection and identification system based on WiFi signal and radio frequency (RF) fingerprint is proposed. The system firstly conducts UAV detection and after the UAV is detected, fractal dimension (FD), axially integrated bispectra (AIB), and square integrated bispectra (SIB) are extracted as UAV RF fingerprints due to their applicability and reliability. Furthermore, we propose weighted AIB and SIB fingerprints to identify UAVs. Since the high dimensionality of AIB and SIB features, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is applied to reduce the dimensionality of these two features. Then the neighborhood component analysis (NCA) algorithm is utilized to weight the dimensions of the two features, AIB and SIB. The extracted UAV fingerprints are stored as training data and test data, respectively. Finally, machine learning algorithms are utilized to identify UAVs. The identification results are as follows: In the indoor scenario, the average identification accuracy of three features (FD, AIB, SIB) are 100%, 97.23%, and 96.11%, respectively. In outdoor scenario, the identification accuracy of three features are 100%, 95.00%, and 93.50%, respectively.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles - UAVs, or drones - are now being operated by several military forces and currently, to a more limited extent, by civilian organizations.

Further expected development in battery capacity, construction materials and software, especially regarding machine learning algorithms and drone integration, will definitely increase UAVs' autonomous. Unique risks associated with UAVs like risk of hackers' attacks to intercept the control are also increasing. More incidents likely will occur once regulations are finalized that encourage more use that is widespread. Such incidents could result in multi-million dollar claims against businesses, operators and manufacturers. Blockchain is the basis technology for cryptocurrencies. However, Blockchain can have far larger applications in the field of UAVs, because Blockchain is highly distributed and publically viewable system of sequentially linked cryptographically.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of serving as flying base stations (BSs) for supporting data collection, machine learning (ML) model training, and wireless communications. However, due to the privacy concerns of devices and limited computation or communication resource of UAVs, it is impractical to send raw data of devices to UAV servers for model training. Moreover, due to the dynamic channel condition and heterogeneous computing capacity of devices in UAV-enabled networks, the reliability and efficiency of data sharing require to be further improved. In this paper, we develop an asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework for multi-UAV-enabled networks, which can provide asynchronous distributed computing by enabling model training locally without transmitting raw sensitive data to UAV servers. The device selection strategy is also introduced into the AFL framework to keep the low-quality devices from affecting the learning efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, we propose an asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) based joint device selection, UAVs placement, and resource management algorithm to enhance the federated convergence speed and accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework and algorithm achieve higher learning accuracy and faster federated execution time compared to other existing solutions.},

In order to have a comprehensive analysis of cellular traffic, an ML framework based on a Gaussian mixture model and a weighted expectation maximization algorithm is introduced to predict the potential network congestion. Then, the optimal deployment of UAVs is studied with the objective of minimizing the power needed for UAV transmission and mobility, given the predicted traffic. To this end, first, the optimal partition of service areas of each UAV is derived, based on a fairness principle. Next, the optimal location of each UAV that minimizes the total power consumption is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed ML approach can reduce power needed for downlink transmission and mobility by over 20% and 80%, respectively, compared with an optimal deployment of UAVs with no ML prediction.},

abstract={The commercialization of aerial image processing is highly dependent on the platforms such as UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). However, the lack of an automated UAV forced landing site detection system has been identified as one of the main impediments to allow UAV flight over populated areas in civilian airspace. This article proposes a UAV forced landing site detection system that is based on machine learning approaches including the Gaussian Mixture Model and the Support Vector Machine. A range of learning parameters are analysed including the number of Guassian mixtures, support vector kernels including linear, radial basis function Kernel (RBF) and polynormial kernel (poly), and the order of RBF kernel and polynormial kernel. Moreover, a modified footprint operator is employed during feature extraction to better describe the geometric characteristics of the local area surrounding a pixel. The performance of the presented system is compared to a baseline UAV forced landing site detection system which uses edge features and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) region type classifier. Experiments conducted on aerial image datasets captured over typical urban environments reveal improved landing site detection can be achieved with an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel using a combination of colour and texture features. Compared to the baseline system, the proposed system provides significant improvement in term of the chance to detect a safe landing area, and the performance is more stable than the baseline in the presence of changes to the UAV altitude.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the detection and classification of micro-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)using radio frequency (RF)fingerprints of the signals transmitted from the controller to the micro-UAV. In the detection phase, raw signals are split into frames and transformed into the wavelet domain to remove the bias in the signals and reduce the size of data to be processed. A naive Bayes approach, which is based on Markov models generated separately for UAV and non-UAV classes, is used to check for the presence of a UAV in each frame. In the classification phase, unlike the traditional approaches that rely solely on time-domain signals and corresponding features, the proposed technique uses the energy transient signal. This approach is more robust to noise and can cope with different modulation techniques. First, the normalized energy trajectory is generated from the energy-time-frequency distribution of the raw control signal. Next, the start and end points of the energy transient are detected by searching for the most abrupt changes in the mean of the energy trajectory. Then, a set of statistical features is extracted from the energy transient. Significant features are selected by performing neighborhood component analysis (NCA)to keep the computational cost of the algorithm low. Finally, selected features are fed to several machine learning algorithms for classification. The algorithms are evaluated experimentally using a database containing 100 RF signals from each of 14 different UAV controllers. The signals are recorded wirelessly using a high-frequency oscilloscope. The data set is randomly partitioned into training and test sets for validation with the ratio 4:1. Ten Monte Carlo simulations are run and results are averaged to assess the performance of the methods. All the micro-UAVs are detected correctly and an average accuracy of 96.3% is achieved using the k-nearest neighbor (kNN)classification. Proposed methods are also tested for different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)levels and results are reported.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received growing attention due to security threats issues. Though UAV detection and positioning systems are commonly used in various scenarios, most of the available systems are still suffering from low accuracy and susceptibility to the environment. Therefore, it is still necessary to design a highly accurate, versatile UAV detection and positioning system. In this paper, a UAV detection and positioning system based on multi-dimensional signal features is proposed. The first step of the system is to monitor the communication signal and channel state information (CSI) between the UAV and the controller. Subsequently the signal frequency spectrum (SFS), the wavelet energy entropy (WEE), and the power spectral entropy (PSE) are extracted as features. At the same time, machine learning algorithms combining the above features are applied to detect UAVs. After the UAV is successfully detected, the spatial features such as angle of azimuth (AOA) and angle of elevation (AOE) were extracted for UAV localization based on a super-resolution estimation algorithm. In conclusion, the Wireless Insite (WI) software was employed for long-distance positioning verification while the software-defined radio (SDR) was used for small-scale testing and verification. The experimental results show that the average detection rate of combining multiple features in the test environment is 95.58%, the median accuracy of 2D positioning is 0.76 m, and the median accuracy of 3D positioning is 1.2 m. In the WI simulation environment, the median accuracy of 2D positioning is 1.1 m, and the median accuracy of 3D positioning is 2.35 m.},

abstract={Research in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has gained attention from various communities because of their potential usage in improving safety and efficiency in different applications. An UAV has shown promising results in dangerous conditions such as forest fires, search and rescue, medical deliveries, wildlife monitoring and geophysical scanning. Some external conditions like slow or no internet connection areas such as rural, farm, forest, ocean, etc. may affect the performance of the UAVs. These conditions can be considered as lost-link problems. Several approaches have been conducted to resolve such issues by implementing robust on-board architecture, machine learning approaches and developing knowledge based reasoning systems. However, much of software architecture research has concentrated on UAV implementation in normal network condition. Thus, we propose a model for considering lost-link problems in software architecture. In this paper, we describe two interconnected architectures for client and server. The UAV as a client is controlled by microkernel based architecture and the server is developed using microservice architecture. Both of them are connected using a synchronizer component to collect, filter, analyze, predict, and mitigate an UAV when a lost-link problem occurs. Therefore, the UAV can still find an appropriate action to complete a mission as far as the sensor and actuator are not in a critical condition. Experiment results show that our approach yields high percentage of mission accomplishment, fault tolerance and performance in a lost-link situation.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as low-altitude flight base stations to satisfy the coverage requirements of wireless users in various scenarios. In practical applications, since the transmitted power and energy resources of the UAVs are limited and the propagation environments are complicated and time-variant, it is challenging to control a group of UAVs to ensure coverage performance while preserving the connectivity and safety of the UAV networks. To this end, a two-step environment-learning-based method is proposed for the intelligent deployment of the UAVs. First, a machine learning algorithm is used to establish an accurate prediction model of the link qualities from the UAVs to the users under a specific scenario for the next step. Then, a modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is employed to control the movements of the UAVs according to the predicted link qualities and to maximize the proportion of covered users. The prioritized experience replay mechanism is introduced to the standard DDPG algorithm to accelerate the deployment procedure. The coverage performance is analyzed in both the interference-free situation and the situation with co-channel interference. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has a higher convergence speed than the standard DDPG method. Additionally, the proposed deployment method can achieve higher coverage performance and better adaptability to the dynamic environment than three commonly used methods, the random method, the K-means-based method, and the statistical-channel-model-based method.},

abstract={Due to the advanced capabilities of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components such as vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs) and smart devices as well as the increasing amount of data generated, Federated Learning (FL) becomes a promising tool given that it enables privacy-preserving machine learning. However, the performance of the FL suffers from the failure of communication links and missing nodes. Therefore, we propose the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the communications between the IoV components and the FL server and thus improving the accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources for all iterations of the FL process. In this paper, we present a joint auction-coalition formation framework. The joint auctioncoalition formation algorithm is proposed to achieve a stable partition of UAV coalitions in which an auction scheme is applied. The auction scheme is designed to take into account the preferences of IoV components over heterogeneous UAVs. The simulation results show that the grand coalition, where all UAVs join a single coalition, is not always stable due to the profitmaximizing behavior of the UAVs. In addition, we show that as the cooperation cost of the UAVs increases, the UAVs prefer not to form any coalition.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have extensive civilian and military applications, but establishing a UAV network providing high data rate communications with low delay is a challenge. Millimeter wave (mmWave), with its high bandwidth nature, can be adopted in the UAV network to achieve high speed data transfer. However, it is difficult to establish and maintain the mmWave communication links due to the mobility of UAVs. In this paper, a beam management scheme utilizing angular domain information (ADI) is proposed to rapidly establish and reliably maintain the communication links for the mmWave UAV network. Firstly, Gaussian process machine learning (GPML)-enabled position prediction is proposed to facilitate coarse-ADI acquisition through the proposed UAV clustering algorithm. Then, with the proposed confined-ADI acquisition which removes the redundancy in the coarse-ADI acquisition, fast beam tracking with respectively the single-beam pattern and the multi-beam pattern is achieved. Finally, a data-driven beam pattern selection scheme is proposed for improving the spectrum efficiency. Simulation results verify the outstanding performance of the proposed beam management for mmWave UAV networks.},

abstract={For some specified targets, it is desired to identify the optimal configuration for the assignment of weapons for a given deployment of different types of weapon systems along with their required quantity in order to achieve a desired level of damage subject to the minimal cost and mission specific constraints. This problem, in its essence, is an NP-complete combinatorial optimization problem in the area of command and control research. In defense-related applications of artificial intelligence, this problem is referred as Weapon Target Assignment (WTA) problem. The problem can be formulated as a non-linear integer programming problem for which no exact methods exist to solve even the small size instances. Our focus is on the Dynamic Weapon Target Assignment (DWTA) problem. A discrete-event system simulation model is developed taking into account the resource constraints, resource capability constraints, strategy constraints and engagement feasibility constraints. Three different methods are employed; MMR, Reactive Tabu Search and a newly proposed artificial intelligence based simulation-optimization hybrid framework. A set of rules is generated based on the optimization module that is then employed for real-time control. The computational results show very promising prospects of the proposed approach, not only for DWTA but also for any real-time decision-making problem like Cooperative Unmanned Air Vehicle Mission Assignment etc.},

abstract={Palm tree detection using remote sensing images has received increasing attention in recent years, concerning the issues of sustainability, productivity and profitability. There has been significant progress in the research of using machine learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic palm tree detection. However, whether CNNs can actually outperform traditional human-engineered approaches in terms of classification accuracy and detection speed is yet unknown. In the present study, we have compared human-engineered features namely histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), local binary pattern (LBP) and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) with features extracted using pre-trained AlexNet model for detecting palm trees in high resolution images obtained via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Support vector machines (SVM) with linear and non-linear kernels were used to classify feature vectors obtained by different feature extractors. Haar-like features used in Viola-Jones framework was also tested in the study. Results showed that features extracted from the fifth convolutional layer of AlexNet achieved the highest accuracy of 96.1% using SVM with RBF kernel as classifier, which surpassed the accuracy obtained by fully-connected CNN, namely 95.6%. The results also suggest that SVM classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel using LBP as features is the optimal combination as it achieved comparable accuracy but higher detection speed than CNN approaches.},

This led us to the development of the EDNA drone, an aerial robotics solution designed to equip first responders in high-risk settings with lifesaving-edge tools for situational awareness and non-lethal conflict resolution. The EDNA is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that delivers the patent-pending “Predictive Probable Cause” technology. The EDNA drone is designed to provide automated real-time analysis to assist teams entering high-risk situations where gun violence may occur. By leveraging machine learning, biometric sensors, and advanced materials in the field and routing feedback to an intuitive augmented-reality interface, the EDNA will provide autonomous threat detection and bullet-stopping capabilities wherever those features are needed--to groups such as Police and Sheriff's Departments, Fire Departments, and EMT and emergency rescue teams. Data from the EDNA drone's sensors is fed to machine learning algorithms running on the drone in real-time. Through a neural network trained on past data, the EDNA is able to detect the presence and location of firearms and explosives, even through walls or other obstacles. Through the use of advanced metal foams and composite materials, the armored drone can even stop bullets-functionality which has obvious benefits for humanitarian deployment.},

We use an on-line real-time Genetic Algorithm to optimize the movements of an UAV swarm towards maintaining communication between the ground agents. The proposed approach models the ground agents and the UAVs as boids-based swarms, and optimizes the movement of the UAVs using different instances of the GA running independently on each UAV. The UAV coordination mechanism is an implicit one, embedded in the fitness function of the Genetic Algorithm instances. The behaviors of the individual UAVs emerge into an aggregated optimization of the overall network survivability. The results show that the proposed approach is able to maintain satisfactory network survivability levels regardless of the ground agents' movements, including for cases as complex as random walks.},

abstract={Situational awareness by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is important for many applications such as surveillance, search and rescue, and disaster response. In those applications, detecting and locating people and recognizing their actions in near real-time can play a crucial role for preparing an effective response. However, there are currently three main limitations to perform this task efficiently. First, it is currently often not possible to access the live video feed from a UAV's camera due to limited bandwidth. Second, even if the video feed is available, monitoring and analyzing video over prolonged time is a tedious task for humans. Third, it is typically not possible to locate random people via their cellphones. Therefore, we developed the Person-Action-Locator (PAL), a novel UAV-based situational awareness system. The PAL system addresses the first issue by analyzing the video feed onboard the UAV, powered by a supercomputer-on-a-module. Specifically, as a support for human operators, the PAL system relies on Deep Learning models to automatically detect people and recognize their actions in near real-time. To address the third issue, we developed a Pixel2GPS converter that estimates the location of people from the video feed. The result - icons representing detected people labeled by their actions - is visualized on the map interface of the PAL system. The Deep Learning models were first tested in the lab and demonstrated promising results. The fully integrated PAL system was successfully tested in the field. We also performed another collection of surveillance data to complement the lab results.},

abstract={This paper proposes a method for discovering new archaeological sites from existing satellite imagery, then building a 3-D computer model of those sites using a controlled UAV with an onboard camera. We use an unmanned vehicle and other remote surveillance sensors, coupled with onboard pattern recognition algorithms, to perform a coarse search, and subsequently a fine search to identify structures of interest. We assume the availability of two sensors. The first sensor is a low resolution camera that sweeps an area of interest, such as an imaging satellite. We process the low-resolution image data to identify tentative locations of interest and to provide confidence estimates with this identification. This information is provided to a control algorithm for an unmanned air vehicle, which plans a trajectory to inspect closely promising objects subject to fuel constraints. These close inspections provide sequences of images that are combined to give 3-D reconstructions of the area of interest, leading to accurate classification of the structure. In this paper, we describe the design of the three principal algorithms in this system: machine learning processing of coarse resolution data, the near-optimal path planning subject to fuel constraints, and the high-resolution 3-D modeling from multiple 2-D views of a site. We illustrate the performance of our system on sample LANDSAT satellite data, and using a quadrotor with an on-board camera in a laboratory environment.},

abstract={In this article, an optimized tracking control scheme is studied for the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (QUAV) system by combining both reinforcement learning (RL) and the backstepping technique. The RL aims to overcome the difficulty coming from solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, and it is performed via iterating both critic and actor each other, where the critic is for improving the control performance and the actor is for executing the control behavior. In mathematics, a QUAV system is composed of two connected subsystems that are, respectively, modeled by the translational and rotational dynamic equations, which are coupled via a rotation matrix; hence, the optimized tracking scheme is composed of two interconnected individual controls corresponding to the position and attitude, respectively. To achieve the two optimized position and attitude controls, the RL is constructed on the basis of the neural network (NN) approximation of the HJB equation's solution by utilizing NN's outstanding function approximation ability. Particularly, the position control is accomplished by introducing an intermediate control because the translational dynamic is an underactuated system. Since the proposed RL algorithm is significantly simple in comparison with the published methods, the optimized QUAV control can be easily executed in practical applications. Finally, the results are demonstrated by a Lyapunov stability analysis and a numerical simulation.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a powerful tool for various industrial and smart city applications. UAVs coupled with various sensors can perform many cognitive tasks such as object detection, surveillance, traffic management, and urban planning. Deep learning has emerged as a popular technique to speed up the processing of high-dimensional data like images and videos, which has led to several applications in surveillance and autonomous driving. However, the area of aerial object detection has been understudied. This work proposes a deep learning approach for detection of objects in aerial scenes captured by UAVs. Our work first categorizes the current methods for aerial object detection using deep learning techniques and discusses how the task is different from general object detection scenarios. We delineate the specific challenges involved and experimentally demonstrate the key design decisions that significantly affect the accuracy and robustness of models. We further propose an optimized architecture that utilizes these optimal design choices along with the recent Res-NeSt backbone to achieve superior performance in aerial object detection. Lastly, we propose several research directions to inspire further advancement in aerial object detection.},

abstract={Class 1 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known as drones, have become popular and accessible, which makes them tools for malicious purposes. As a result, there is an increasing demand for an effective defense system that can detect UAVs. In this paper, a UAV detection system with multiple acoustic nodes using machine learning models is proposed along with an empirically optimized configuration of the nodes for deployment. Features including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) were used for training. Support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) were trained with the data collected in person. Experiments were done to evaluate models' ability to find the path of the UAV that was flying. Sensing nodes were placed in four different configurations and the best of test set was chosen which maximizes the detection range without blind spots. STFT-SVM model showed the best performance and a semi-circle formation with 75 meters distance between a node and the protected area is found to be the optimized configuration.},

abstract={Accurate and timely crop yield estimation is critical for food security and sustainable development. The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers a new approach to acquire high spatio-temporal resolution imagery of farmland at a low cost. In order to realize the full potential of UAV platform and sensor, machine learning has been introduced to estimate crop yield, but the shortages of field measurements have troubled researchers. In this article, the CW-RF model, a new wheat yield estimation model suitable for the North China plain, was established using random forest, and the crop growth model (the CERES-wheat model) was chosen to simulate abundant training samples for random forest at field plot scale. According to CERES-wheat model simulation, the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) at the wheat jointing and heading stages were selected as the most sensitive parameters, and were retrieved from UAV hyperspectral imagery using the directional second derivative and angular insensitivity vegetation index methods, respectively. Then the retrieved LAI and LNC results were input into the CW-RF model to estimate winter wheat yield. The field validation in Luohe, Henan showed that the root-mean-squared error of the retrieved LAI and LNC were 6.27% and 12.17% at jointing stages, 9.21% and 13.64% at heading stages, respectively. The RMSE of estimated yield was 1,008.08 kg/ha, and the mean absolute percent error of estimated yield was 9.36%, demonstrating the available of the CW-RF model in wheat yield estimation at field plot scale. Apart from Luohe, validations in some other fields (e.g., Xiaotangshan, Beijing), prove the wide applicability of the CW-RF model. In addition, the UAV hyperspectral data were found to significantly improve the retrieval accuracy, and further improve CW-RF model estimation accuracy. In conclusion, this article showed that the CERES-Wheat model simulation can be important data source for machine learning-based wheat yield estimation model at field plot scale, and the hyperspectral sensor mounted on a UAV is a feasible remote sensing data acquisition mode for winter wheat growth monitoring and yield estimation.},

abstract={This paper furthers the state of the art of visual localization by harnessing recently developed scene recognition and understanding machine learning (ML) algorithms to rethink how vision can be used for navigation, particularly when combined with a realistic, minimalist, and robust multi-agent approach. The focus on visual navigation comes as GPS is increasingly unreliable (jammed, spoofed, or disabled), or unavailable (indoor, or extraterrestrial environments). GPS denial/unreliability is an area of active research in general, with unmanned parafoil systems being one UAV application. The landing locations for parafoil systems must be pre-programmed manually with global coordinates, which may be inaccurate or outdated, and offer no in-flight adaptability. This paper will introduce a novel and minimalist approach to visual navigation and multi-agent communication using semantic machine learning classification and geometric constraints. This approach enables localization and landing site identification for multiple communicating UAV systems deployed in GPS-denied environments. This is a capability extending beyond singleagent localization, as well as a novel landing site classification approach. A mathematical foundation using information theory provides the technical grounding for the algorithms presented, and simulation results demonstrate how multiple agents using the proposed algorithms make a significant improvement in localization accuracy and speed over a single agent. Desirable landing sites for UAVs generally, and autonomous parafoils in particular, constitute locations where payload survivability and accessibility are greatest. An on-board semantic representation and understanding of the operating environment will allow systems to automatically detect and classify these desirable and undesirable landing sites, enabling successful landing in a much larger class of scenarios than currently possible, in addition to a fail-safe capability when localization is not feasible. This paper will further introduce an algorithm enabling multiple agents to reproduce this classification of their environment on-line better and more rapidly than a single agent working alone, demonstrating the advantage of multiple agents in this context as well. This has applications to general UAV landing, whether powered or unpowered, on Earth or in extra-terrestrial environments.},

abstract={People recognition in aerial imagery is a complex problem since it involves cameras angles, which are subject to six degrees of freedom. Traditional classifiers used in pattern matching algorithms are not robust enough to deal with such issues. Thus it is necessary to use other techniques such as deep learning methods, e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), in order to cope with such a complex problem. However, in spite of providing potentially better recognition results, deep learning methods demand greater processing time, hindering its use on on-board embedded systems of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). This work is a step towards real-time (and possibly on-board) people recognition on aerial imagery. We propose a new approach based on CNN for real-time people recognition on aerial images obtained from cameras attached to small UAVs. This approach combines images from a low-cost thermal camera to detect candidate objects and CNN for the classification task. We have compared our approach with two traditional pattern matching approaches: saliency map detection and cascade classifiers. The obtained results show that, by using CNN, higher rates of correct classification within 95% of precision are obtained. These results have been obtained within real-time processing of 1.08 fps in the worst case on a hardware without any GPU processing.},

abstract={The goal of few-shot image learning is to utilize a very small amount of training examples in order to train a machine learning model to recognize a given number of image classes. While humans can perform such a task pretty much effortlessly, applying the same mechanism to deep learning visual recognition systems is a much more difficult task, having a wide range of real-world visual recognition applications. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of such few-shot methods in the context of drone vision cinematography for sports event filming, in order to recognize new image classes by taking into consideration the fact that this new class we wish to identify is a subclass of an already known class. More specifically we use UAV footage to recognize certain types of athletes, belonging to a subset of an original athlete class, utilizing only a handful of recorded images of this athlete subclass. We examine the effects of such methods on image recognition accuracy while proposing a novel approach for accuracy optimizations. The overall task is evaluated on actual cycling race UAV footage.},

We first formulate the issue as an optimization problem for minimizing the maximum outage probability. This is a nonlinear and nonconvex problem that is generally difficult to be solved. To this end, we propose a new approach for solving the optimization problem based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), considering two important reinforcement learning algorithms (i.e., Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)). Simulation results show that under the proposed approach, the UAVs can make optimal decisions to select the most suitable connection with MNOs for achieving the minimization of the maximum outage probability. Furthermore, the results also show that in our new approach, the A2C-based algorithm is better than the DQN-based one, especially when the number of MNOs increases, while the DQN-based algorithm can be executed in a shorter time.},

Aiming at the problem of the high average number of hops and low link connectivity, this paper adopts a fuzzy logic reinforcement learning-based routing algorithm for flying ad hoc networks. The fuzzy logic mainly determines the neighbor nodes of a node in real time. Reinforcement learning reduces the average number of hops of the route determined by fuzzy logic through continuous training.

Moreover, we consider the UAV can not only process the data collected with limited computation capacity but also send it back to the ground terminal for processing. To maximize the number of points of interest visited, we jointly optimize the trajectory and resource allocation of the UAV.

abstract={The regular detection of pavement cracks is critical for life and property security. However, existing deep learning-based methods of crack detection face difficulties in terms of data acquisition and defect counting. An automatic intelligent detection and tracking system for pavement cracks is proposed. Our system is formed of a pavement crack generative adversarial network (PCGAN) and a crack detection and tracking network called YOLO-MF. First, PCGAN is used to generate realistic crack images, to address the problem of the small number of available images. Next, YOLO-MF is developed based on an improved YOLO v3 modified by an acceleration algorithm and median flow (MF) algorithm to count the number of cracks. In a counting loop, our improved YOLO v3 detects cracks and the MF algorithm tracks the cracks detected in a video. This improved algorithm achieves the best accuracy of 98.47% and F1 score of 0.958 among other algorithms, and the precision-recall curve was close to the top right. A tiny model was developed and an acceleration algorithm was applied, which improved the detection speed by factors of five and six, respectively. In on-site measurement, three cracks were detected and tracked, and the total count was correct. Finally, the system was embedded in an intelligent device consisting of a calculating module, an automated unmanned aerial vehicle, and other components.},

abstract={Social airborne sensing (SAS) is emerging as a new sensing paradigm that leverages the complementary aspects of social sensing and airborne sensing (i.e., UAVs) for reliable information collection. In this paper, we present HeteroSAS, a heterogeneous resource management framework for "all-in-the-air" SAS in disaster response applications. Current SAS approaches use UAVs to only capture data, but carry out computation on ground-based processing nodes that may be unavailable in disaster scenarios and thus consider a single model of UAV along with only one type of task (i.e., data capture). In this paper, we explore the opportunity to exploit the complementary strengths of different UAV models to accomplish all stages of sensing tasks (i.e., data capturing, maneuvering, and computation) exclusively "in-the-air". However, several challenges exist in developing such a resource management framework: i) handling the uncertain social signals in presence of the heterogeneity of UAVs and tasks; and ii) adapting to constantly changing cyber-physical-social environments. The HeteroSAS framework addresses these challenges by building a novel resource management framework that observes the environment and learns the optimal strategy for each UAV using techniques from multi-agent reinforcement learning, game theory, and ensemble learning. The evaluation with a real-world case study shows that HeteroSAS outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of detection effectiveness, deadline hit rate, and robustness on heterogeneity.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently been proposed as flying base stations, called UAV-BSs, to provide reliable connections and extend the coverage of the existing wireless networks. The mobility of UAV-BSs leads to a dynamic network environment, in which the global network information is hard to be obtained. Since frequent information exchanges cause huge signaling overheads, it is difficult to deploy centralized algorithms in UAV networks. Hence, we propose a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for multi-user access control in UAV networks. In particular, each user makes its own access decisions independently based on the local network information, and maximizes the long-term throughput while avoiding frequent handovers. Simulation results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and shown the superiority of the proposed DRL framework over the state of arts.},

abstract={Unlike autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a higher dimensional configuration space, which makes the motion planning of multi-UAVs a challenging task. In addition, uncertainties and noises are more significant in UAV scenarios, which increases the difficulty of autonomous navigation for multi-UAV. In this letter, we proposed a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) based multi-UAV collision avoidance approach without explicitly modeling the uncertainty and noise in the environment. Our goal is to train a policy to plan a collision-free trajectory by leveraging local noisy observations. However, the reinforcement learned collision avoidance policies usually suffer from high variance and low reproducibility, because unlike supervised learning, RL does not have a fixed training set with ground-truth labels. To address these issues, we introduced a two-stage training method for RL based collision avoidance. For the first stage, we optimize the policy using a supervised training method with a loss function that encourages the agent to follow the well-known reciprocal collision avoidance strategy. For the second stage, we use policy gradient to refine the policy. We validate our policy in a variety of simulated scenarios, and the extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that our policy can generate time-efficient and collision-free paths under imperfect sensing, and can well handle noisy local observations with unknown noise levels.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider an Internet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over cellular networks, where UAVs work as aerial users to collect various sensory data, and send the collected data to their transmission destinations over cellular links. Unlike the terrestrial users in the conventional cellular networks, different UAVs have various communication requirements due to their sensing applications, and a more flexible communication framework is in demand. To tackle this problem, we propose a UAV-to-Everything (U2X) networking, which enables the UAVs to adjust their communication modes full dimensionally according to the requirements of their sensing applications. In this article, we first introduce the concept of U2X communications, and elaborate on its three communication modes. Afterwards, we discuss the key techniques of the U2X communications, including joint sensing and transmission protocol, UAV trajectory design, and radio resource management. A reinforcement learning-based mathematical framework for U2X communications is then proposed. Finally, the extensions of the U2X communications are presented.},

abstract={Due to their high mobility, flexible deployment and stable maneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been deemed as a promising and indispensable role for various emerging applications (e.g., dangerous area detection, dynamic target tracking, and map remote sensing). Compared to the static monitoring equipments, UAV-mounted high-definition camera and signal transceiver can be used cost-effectively as an on-demand aerial platform to detect the unknown region and send the real-time data back at the same time. However, these highlighted limitations of battery capacity and communication resource extremely affect the UAV’s performance such as flight endurance and data transmission. Motivated by the above conflicts, this paper aims to minimize the total energy consumed by the UAV during the region detection mission through jointly optimizing the collected data size, transmission time, and flying trajectory. Toward this end, we derive the optimal data collection and transmission time in closed forms via convex optimization, and propose a model-free reinforcement learning-based algorithm for training the UAV to plan its trajectory without knowing the environment information in advance. Simulation results validate the performance of our designs in terms of convergence, energy consumption, and energy efficiency.},

abstract={Due to the flexibility and low operational cost, dispatching unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect information from distributed sensors is expected to be a promising solution in Internet of Things (IoT), especially for time-critical applications. How to maintain the information freshness is a challenging issue. In this paper, we investigate the fresh data collection problem in UAV-assisted IoT networks. Particularly, the UAV flies towards the sensors to collect status update packets within a given duration while maintaining a non-negative residual energy. We formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find the optimal flight trajectory of the UAV and transmission scheduling of the sensors that minimizes the weighted sum of the age of information (AoI). A UAV-assisted data collection algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is further proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based algorithm can significantly reduce the weighted sum of the AoI compared to other baseline algorithms.},
