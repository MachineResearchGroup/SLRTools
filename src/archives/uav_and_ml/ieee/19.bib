abstract={With the progressive reduction of cost, in the market it is possible to find a very large assortment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) that are used in general for non-warlike activities. Unfortunately, it may happen that malicious subjects use these objects to cause damage or inconvenience, then the availability of solutions to predict these situations can be crucial for alerting the population and saving lives. In this work, we present a technique to identify drones from their micro-Doppler features, by analyzing their variations during the flight. The characterization of the features and how they evolve in time is useful to predict dangerous situations and classify the drone type, with the help of Machine Learning techniques.},

abstract={With the advancement of information and communication technology, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), popularly known as drones, have also increased. The drones have been noted for their wide range of applications such as military, search and rescue operation, disaster detection and monitoring, agriculture, and delivery. Each type of drone has different characteristics and functionality based on its application, making them a security threat for some city zone. Therefore, there is an essential need for efficient drone management based on their type and application in different zones. To do this, we proposed a Machine learning (ML) based Software Defined Network (SDN) drone management framework. In this framework, the SDN controller uses ML with the drone’s radio frequency feature to detect its type and application and, according to its application, authenticate it and assign communication rules. SDN controller records authentication information in a DAG-based Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) available for other SDN controllers. When a drone desires to migrate to another zone, the destination SDN controller can achieve authentication information by referring to DAG-based DLT, and there is no need for re-authentication. The experimental result shows authentication delay reduction in our proposed framework. Moreover, we adopted ML algorithms includes Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR), to evaluate our proposed framework in drone’s type classification. The result shows that the RF algorithm shows the best performance with 92.81% accuracy in the classification of the drone’s type.},

abstract={Radio Link Failure (RLF) is a challenging problem in 5G networks as it may decrease communication reliability and increases latency. This is against the objectives of 5G, particularly for the ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (uRLLC) traffic class. RLF can be predicted using radio measurements reported by User Equipment (UE)s, such as Reference Signal Receive Power (RSRP), Reference Signal Receive Quality (RSRQ), Channel Quality Indicator (CQI), and Power HeadRoom (PHR). However, it is very challenging to derive a closed-form model that derives RLF from these measurements. To fill this gap, we propose to use Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and specifically, a combination of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to find the correlation between these measurements and RLF. The RLF prediction model was trained with real data obtained from a 5G testbed. The validation process of the model showed an accuracy of 98% when predicting the connection status (i.e., RLF). Moreover, to illustrate the usage of the RLF prediction model, we introduced two use-cases: handover optimization and UAV trajectory adjustment.},

abstract={A complex system is characterized by emergence of global properties. These emergent properties are very difficult to anticipate just from complete knowledge of component behaviors. Characteristics of complex systems discussed in literature include emergence, hierarchical organization and numerosity. Recently, there has been an increase on the adoption of various neural network-based machine learning models to govern the functionality and behavior of systems. With this increasing system complexity, there is increasing challenge in attaining confidence in systems. The ease with which systems are getting interconnected is permeating numerous system-of-systems (SoS), wherein multiple independent systems are expected to interact and collaborate to achieve unparalleled levels of functionality. Traditional verification and validation approaches are often inadequate to bring in the nuances of potential emergent behavior in a system-of-system, which may be positive or negative. In this paper, we look for violations formally in the emergent behavior of a complex SoS. The case study pertains to a swarm of autonomous UAVs flying in a formation, and dynamically changing the shape of the formation, to support varying mission scenarios. We use a tool called CBMC which is a bounded model checker that looks at properties in a small defined region and bound and argues on its correctness. The effectiveness and performance of the approach are quantified.},

abstract={In the modern challenging urban environment, powered two wheelers (PTW) are selected for their everyday commuting. The way motorcycles and scooters travel through traffic is systematically emphasized in the recent relevant literature as being complex, especially in relation to overtaking. In this paper, meta-optimized Decision Trees, a special case of machine learning (ML) models, are developed in order to model the unconventional overtaking patterns of PTW drivers. Based on detailed naturalistic trajectory data collected using video footage from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in a three-lane arterial in Athens, Greece, two different models of PTW driving behavior are developed. The first model addresses the decision of the PTW driver to overtake or not the preceding vehicle. The second model focuses on PTW driver's intention to overtake or undertake (pass from the right) it. The developed decision tree models are further analyzed in relation to the revealed significant factors during overtaking. Following, the applicability of the developed algorithms in the context of intelligent transportation systems and connected vehicles is discussed, which reveals the importance of acquiring quality data using advanced equipment combined with advanced ML approaches for advanced modeling methods.},

Research into the sound of Cyber-Physical Systems has shown that audio side-channel information from a single microphone can be used to accurately model traditional primary state sensor measurements such as speed and gear position. Furthermore, data integration research has shown that information from multiple heterogeneous sources can be integrated to create improved and more reliable data. In this paper, we present a multi-microphone machine learning data fusion approach to accurately predict ascending/hovering/descending states of a multi-rotor UAV in flight. We show that data fusion of multiple audio classifiers predicts these states with accuracies over 94%. Furthermore, we significantly improve the state predictions of single microphones, and outperform several other integration methods. These results add to a growing body of work showing that microphone side-channel approaches can be used in Cyber-Physical Systems to accurately model and improve the assurance of primary sensors measurements.},

abstract={A Quadcopter is one type of UAV specifically widely used for search, rescue, reconnaissance, and others. The obstacle avoidance system in a navigation of quadcopter is needed to minimize human supervision. Obstacle avoidance systems can be created with dimension information of obstacle to choose avoidance directions. Due to power limitations in quadcopter flights, the choice of avoidance direction must consider energy efficiency. In this paper, the obstacle avoidance system in quadcopter navigation that flies in the 3D environment not only considers the dimensions of the obstacle, but also consumption energy and the distance between the quadcopter and the obstacle to choose avoidance direction (right, left or top). Efficient avoidance decisions are generated from KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) machine learning with 96.6 % accuracy and require 0.0068s computing time. Simulation show that the quadcopter can reach the target point without colliding with static obstacles. Quadcopter can also choose the efficient avoidance direction when obstacles are detected.},

abstract={This paper presents an adaptive robotic swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) enabling communications between separated non-swarm devices. The swarm nodes utilise machine learning and hyper-heuristic policy evolution to provide agility within the swarm, enabling each swarm member to select the most appropriate mobility policy for the environment given the swarm's abilities. The swarm evolution process of this study is found to successfully create different data transfer methods depending on the separation of non-swarm devices and the communication range of the swarm members. These methods are either human-designed, which the swarm adopts when most appropriate, or are novel hybridisations that the swarm creates for the problem. This paper also tests the swarm with individuals being removed during deployment. It is found that the swarm is immune to most alterations, though removal of specialised members of the heterogeneous swarm leads to temporary failure. The swarm evolution can then correct this failure by adjusting the swarm behaviour.},

abstract={In the scene of large crowd gatherings and challenging visiting places such as rough hills and high glass buildings, acquisition of the images through normal cameras is difficult and next to impossible. In all such scenarios, the drone becomes a useful acquisition sensor to capture the detailed information of the scene and the objects present there. With the rapid development of consumer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones, the utilization of these devices became extremely easy. The popular use-case of the drones can be seen for the surveillance to identify any possible threats in the large crowd gathering and recognize the different individuals present in the crowd. However, the images captured using the drones are generally taken from a significant distance to avoid any collision; hence these images generally suffer in quality such as low resolution, motion blur, and other environmental factors. The impact of these artifacts has been seen in the face recognition performance using several machine learning algorithms on large-scale drone databases namely Drone SURF. In this research, we intend to tackle the above artifacts by looking at the problem from the perspective of super-resolution of low-quality images. We have studied state-of-the-art (SOTA) super-resolution algorithms and see whether current methods are capable of handling the challenges of drone images. Apart from that, we have also evaluated another SOTA deep network developed for object detection for human segmentation in drone images. The proposed research provides interesting findings highlighting the limitations of existing works from the perspective of handling drone images. We would like the readers to go through the paper to find out the current limitations and possible future directions in drone image surveillance.},

It is vital to have the capability to navigate and identify objects at any time of the day, especially at night, when we encounter situations of low-light and dark conditions. This necessitates the ability to have a proper object detection model to predict the object in these conditions. We introduce a way to detect and classify objects in images taken with thermal cameras using different image processing techniques, pattern recognition, and machine learning algorithms. We have done a comparative study of two different models with appropriate hyper-parameter tuning that allows us to choose the right model for their application based on the constraints involved in the problem. We present an extensive study of the models based on the COCO evaluation metrics and other important loss metrics. Experimental results on the FLIR dataset confirm that we can use the pre-trained models in object detection to train, identify, and label objects in thermal images.},

Therefore, we propose a hybrid analog-digital system to solve the problem of continuous anomaly detection. In this paper, a series of pure analog ML methods including SVMs (linear, polynomial, Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Sigmoid kernels) as well as pure analog fully-connected Neural Network (NN) are presented. We validate our method with sensor data from a series of drone experiments to detect and identify causes of failure in real-time. The results show that RBF kernel provides at least 88.17 % and at most 99.99 % accuracy under different time window and crash-like scenarios with an extremely low False Negative (FN) ratio with sensor data especially in the z-axis.},

abstract={Event-based cameras have recently drawn the attention of the Computer Vision community thanks to their advantages in terms of high temporal resolution, low power consumption and high dynamic range, compared to traditional frame-based cameras. These properties make event-based cameras an ideal choice for autonomous vehicles, robot navigation or UAV vision, among others. However, the accuracy of event-based object classification algorithms, which is of crucial importance for any reliable system working in real-world conditions, is still far behind their frame-based counterparts. Two main reasons for this performance gap are: 1. The lack of effective low-level representations and architectures for event-based object classification and 2. The absence of large real-world event-based datasets. In this paper we address both problems. First, we introduce a novel event-based feature representation together with a new machine learning architecture. Compared to previous approaches, we use local memory units to efficiently leverage past temporal information and build a robust event-based representation. Second, we release the first large real-world event-based dataset for object classification. We compare our method to the state-of-the-art with extensive experiments, showing better classification performance and real-time computation.},

abstract={The development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, has introduced revolutionary changes in many areas over the past few years. However, aside from opening new possibilities, the usage of drones in an irresponsible and dangerous manner leads to many hazardous incidents. This paper presents a drone detection sensor with a continuous 2.400 GHz-2.483 GHz operational frequency range for detection methods based on passive radio frequency imaging techniques. The implementation based on Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Field Programmable Logic Array (FPGA) hardware that overcomes the 40 MHz real-time bandwidth limit of other popular SDRs is presented utilizing low-cost off-the-shelf components. Furthermore, a hardware realization of the signal processing chain for specific detection algorithms is proposed to minimize the throughput between SDR and the companion computer and offload software computations. The device validation is made in a laboratory and real-life scenario and presented in relation to the sensor used in other works. In addition to the increased real-time bandwidth, the measurements show a 9 dB reduction in detection sensitivity compared to the reference receiver, in line with the analog RF front-end specifications. The final analysis demonstrates the proposed device’s relevance as a sensor for obtaining machine learning datasets and as a part of a final anti-drone system.},

abstract={Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with on-board base station equipment can potentially provide connectivity in areas where the terrestrial infrastructure is overloaded, damaged, or absent. Use cases comprise emergency response, wildfire suppression, surveillance, and cellular communications in crowded events to name a few. A central problem to enable this technology is to place such aerial base stations (AirBSs) in locations that approximately optimize the relevant communication metrics. To alleviate the limitations of existing algorithms, which require intensive and reliable communications among AirBSs or between the AirBSs and a central controller, this paper leverages stochastic optimization and machine learning techniques to put forth an adaptive and decentralized algorithm for AirBS placement without inter-AirBS cooperation or communication. The approach relies on a smart design of the network utility function and on a stochastic gradient ascent iteration that can be evaluated with information available in practical scenarios. To complement the theoretical convergence properties, a simulation study corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

However, coverage extension faces crucial challenges such as user mobility and determining the best coordinates for new base station deployment. In this paper, we address this problem based on the prediction of users' spatial distribution that allows Aerial base stations (ABS) to adjust their position accordingly. We first analyze the performance of two machine learning schemes (Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based encoder-decoder and self-attention-based Transformer) for user mobility prediction based on a real DataSet. Then, we use these schemes to enhance the ABS deployment algorithm. Numerical results reveal significant gains when applying the proposed mobility prediction models over traditional deployment algorithms. In four hours of the day, both the Transformer and LSTM based models show, respectively, more than 31% and 22% gain in coverage rates compared to regular deployment schemes.},

To address this limitation of existing urban models, this paper presents two urban modeling techniques for an unmanned aircraft flight simulation in an urban environment. The first proposed urban modeling technique is an airborne LiDAR source-based approach that incorporates machine learning algorithms to identify the number of buildings and characterize them from the LiDAR information. The second proposed urban modeling technique is an artificial urban modeling technique without any airborne LiDAR resources that applies an adaptive spacing method, an iterative algorithm to define an artificial urban environment. Unlike the LiDAR source-based approach that creates an approximated urban model, the adaptive spacing-based urban modeling algorithm generates an artificial urban environment that is visually different from a reference city, but has similar the characteristics to it. To demonstrate the two proposed urban modeling techniques, numerical simulations are conducted using open-source datasets to construct several realistic urban models.},

abstract={Recent advances in communication and networking technologies are leading to a plethora of novel wireless services that range from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication to smart cognitive networks and massive Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Enabling these emerging applications over the fifth generation (5G) of wireless cellular systems requires meeting numerous challenges pertaining to spectrum sharing and management. In fact, most 5G applications will be highly reliant on intelligent spectrum management techniques, which should adapt to dynamic network environments while also guaranteeing high reliability and high quality-of-experience (QoE). In this context, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that include deep learning, convolutional neural networks, and reinforcement learning, among many others, is expected to play a very important role in paving the way towards truly AI-driven spectrum management, thus enabling tomorrow's smart city services. Therefore, it has become imperative to investigate and apply AI techniques to solve emerging spectrum management problems in various wireless networks.

abstract={Examines advancements in military technologies and explores the ramifications for both militarized zones and areas that are targeted for protection. Man has been using technology o improve the precision, pace, and proximity of combat throughout time. Yesteryear, technology afforded man new delivery mechanisms for gunpowder. Today, we use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to eliminate specific threats in distant and isolated territories while military personnel remain at safer distances. Yet, we are now relinquishing far more influence and decision-making to thinking machines. Devices are now equipped to fix, track, target, assess, and engage in the dull, dirty, and dangerous missions. As artificial intelligence continues to progress, military personnel may no longer directly control the remotely-operated devices, but rather supervise independent actions of robots. Assesses how these new technologies equipped with smaller weaponry and artificial intelligence affect the societies that are military targets.},
