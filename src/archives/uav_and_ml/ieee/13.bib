abstract={To provide ubiquitous connectivity and achieve high reliability in the under-served and under-connected areas, the integration of aerial and space communication infrastructures into terrestrial networks is envisioned as a promising solution. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in the role of aerial base stations (BSs), have been recommended to solve the coverage problem. In order to effectively leverage the advantages of UAVs deployment, UAV trajectory and resource management are required to effectively adapt to the network conditions. However, providing backhaul connectivity for terrestrial and aerial BSs deployed in these areas is another tremendous challenge. In this paper, we aim at jointly optimizing backhaul link and access link in a space-air-ground integrated network. We consider low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites as an effective backhaul solution. For access links, we manage the radio resource among UAVs and small cell BSs, and optimize the trajectories of UAVs in the network. To solve the problem in a distributed manner, we utilize the tools of reinforcement learning, and propose two approaches based on the multi-armed bandit and satisfaction algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches yield significant performance compared to the benchmark algorithms.},

abstract={In this article, we study the problem of air-to-ground ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for a moving ground user. This is done by controlling multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in real time while avoiding inter-UAV collisions. To this end, we propose a novel multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework, coined a graph attention exchange network (GAXNet). In GAXNet, each UAV constructs an attention graph locally measuring the level of attention to its neighboring UAVs, while exchanging the attention weights with other UAVs so as to reduce the attention mismatch between them. Simulation results corroborates that GAXNet achieves up to 4.5x higher rewards during training. At execution, without incurring inter-UAV collisions, G2ANet improves reliability of air-to-ground network in terms of latency and error rate.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider a cellular Internet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) where the sensory data can be transmitted to the mobile devices directly by overlaying UAV-to-Device (U2D) communications, or through the base station (BS) by cellular communications. Since the transmission modes of UAVs may influence their trajectories, we study the trajectory design problem for UAVs aiming to maximize the total utility in consideration of their transmission modes. This problem is a Markov decision problem (MDP) with a large state-action space, and thus, we propose a multi-UAV trajectory design algorithm using multi- agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve this problem. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve a higher total utility than the single-agent method.},

abstract={In precision farming, a very promising scenario is represented by a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) moving in a cultivated field and collecting high-resolution videos and hyperspectral images, requiring both localization and broadband communication. An effective approach to provide both localization and wideband communication exploits unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that may act as relays to ensure seamless connectivity with a base station (BS). In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm to find the best spatial configuration of a swarm of UAVs to localize a CAV in an unknown environment and assist the communication with a BS. The UAVs cooperate to estimate the position of the CAV exploiting only the received signal strength (RSS). A reward function, based on the distance between the UAVs and the CAV, and the estimated geometric diluition of precision (GDOP), is designed. Numerical results show how the proposed multi-agent Q-learning allows the UAVs to reach low root mean square error (RMSE) in the target localization, even without previous knowledge about the environment.},

abstract={The flying ad hoc network (FANET) is a new paradigm of wireless communication that governs the autonomous movement of UAVs and supports UAV-to-UAV communication. A FANET can provide an effective real-time communication solution for the multiple UAV systems considering each flying UAV as a router. However, existing mobile ad hoc protocols cannot meet the needs of FANETs due to high-speed mobility and frequent topology change. In addition, the complicated flight environment and varied flight tasks lead to the traditional built-in-rules protocols no longer meeting the demands of autonomy. Hence, we have proposed adaptive hybrid communication protocols including a novel position-prediction-based directional MAC protocol (PPMAC) and a self-learning routing protocol based on reinforcement learning (RLSRP). The performance results show that the proposed PPMAC overcomes the directional deafness problem with directional antennas, and RLSRP provides an automatically evolving and more effective routing scheme. Our proposed hybrid adaptive communication protocols have the potential to provide an intelligent and highly autonomous communication solution for FANETs, and indicate the main research orientation of FANET protocols.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be an integral part of wireless networks, and determining collision-free trajectories for multiple UAVs while satisfying requirements of connectivity with ground base stations (GBSs) is a challenging task. In this paper, we first reformulate the multi-UAV trajectory optimization problem with collision avoidance and wireless connectivity constraints as a sequential decision making problem in the discrete time domain. We, then, propose a decentralized deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is developed to encode the expected time to destination given the agent’s joint state (including the agent’s information, the nearby agents’ observable information, and the locations of the nearby GBSs). An SINR-prediction network is also designed, using accumulated SINR measurements obtained when interacting with the cellular network, to map the GBSs’ locations into the SINR levels in order to predict the UAV’s SINR. Numerical results show that with the value network and SINR-prediction network, real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed in various environments with high success rate.},

This framework uses Q-learning to choose the defense policy such as jamming the global positioning system signals (GPS) and hacking, and laser shooting. According to the defense history and the current security status of the target estate, this scheme can improve the UAV defense performance in the dynamic game without being aware of the UAV attack policy and environment model in the area of interests.

abstract={Owing to the enhanced flexibility in deployment and decreasing costs of manufacturing, the demand for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is expected to soar in the upcoming years. In this paper, we explore a UAV aided search and rescue (SAR) operation in indoor environments, where the GPS signals might not be reliable. We consider a SAR scenario where the UAV tries to locate a victim trapped in an indoor environment by sensing the RF signals emitted from a smart device owned by the victim. To locate the victim as fast as possible, we leverage tools from reinforcement learning (RL). Received signal strength (RSS) at the UAV depends on the distance from the source, indoor shadowing and fading parameters, and antenna radiation pattern of the receiver mounted on the UAV. To make our analysis more realistic, we model two indoor scenarios with different dimensions using a commercial ray tracing software. Then, the corresponding RSS values at each possible discrete UAV location are extracted and used in a Q-learning framework. Unlike the traditional location-based navigation approach that exploits GPS coordinates, our method uses the RSS to define the states and rewards of the RL algorithm. We compare the performance of the proposed method where directional and omnidirectional antennas are used. The results reveal that the use of directional antennas provides faster convergence rates than the omnidirectional antennas.},

abstract={In this paper, an interference-aware path planning scheme for a network of cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. In particular, each UAV acts as a cellular user equipment (UE) and aims at achieving a tradeoff between maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing both wireless latency and the interference caused on the ground network along its path. The problem is cast as a dynamic game among UAVs. To solve this game, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on echo state network (ESN) cells, is proposed. The introduced deep ESN architecture is trained to allow each UAV to map each observation of the network state to an action, with the goal of minimizing a sequence of time-dependent utility functions. Each UAV uses ESN to learn its optimal path, transmission power, and cell association vector at different locations along its path. The proposed algorithm is shown to reach a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium upon convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves better wireless latency per UAV and rate per ground UE while requiring a number of steps that is comparable to a heuristic baseline that considers moving via the shortest distance towards the corresponding destinations.},

abstract={Flying ad-hoc network (FANET) is one of the applications of next-generation wireless networks, including fifth generation (5G) networks. Due to the availability of high data rate and low latency, 5G supports applications with high resource requirement including FANET. In FANETs, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communicate with each other to form a network, however due to their high mobility and dynamicity, network topology varies frequently. UAVs have limited energy resources, and their energy is consumed for communication, such as data transmission and reception. In this paper, the optimal route is identified by considering UAVs with higher residual energy and stability in a 5G network in order to increase network lifetime, as well as reduce energy consumption and the number of broken links. The proposed algorithm applies an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning, and the effects of different learning rates are investigated.},

abstract={AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology has been widely used in smart systems which usually require computing services with high availability and fast response. However, the rapid growth of data and service requests generated by end devices brings critical challenges to the centralised cloud computing paradigm in terms of network bandwidth, reliability and response time. In addition, the problem of data privacy is arising due to a large amount of data being transferred to the cloud server. Recently, edge computing is becoming a popular platform for smart systems as its provisions computing services close to the end devices, and Federated Learning (FL) is emerging as a promising solution for AI applications to address the data privacy issue. Inspired by their success, in this paper, we propose an edge based FL framework named Fed-UAV to solve the person reidentification problem in the UAV delivery service which is a typical AI application in smart logistics. This framework enables the UAV to efficiently locate the target receivers, and effectively reduce the data transmission between the UAV and the cloud server to improve the response time and protect the data privacy. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets, and the experimental result successfully demonstrates that Fed-UAV can achieve both high accuracy and efficiency in person re-identification while protecting data privacy.},

abstract={In this paper we present a novel framework for geolocalizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using only their onboard camera. The framework exploits the abundance of satellite imagery, along with established computer vision and deep learning methods, to locate the UAV in a satellite imagery map. It utilizes the contextual information extracted from the scene to attain increased geolocalization accuracy and enable navigation without the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS), which is advantageous in GPS-denied environments and provides additional enhancement to existing GPS-based systems. The framework inputs two images at a time, one captured using a UAV-mounted downlooking camera, and the other synthetically generated from the satellite map based on the UAV location within the map. Local features are extracted and used to register both images, a process that is performed recurrently to relate UAV motion to its actual map position, hence performing preliminary localization. A semantic shape matching algorithm is subsequently applied to extract and match meaningful shape information from both images, and use this information to improve localization accuracy. The framework is evaluated on two different datasets representing different geographical regions. Obtained results demonstrate the viability of proposed method and that the utilization of visual information can offer a promising approach for unconstrained UAV navigation and enable the aerial platform to be self-aware of its surroundings thus opening up new application domains or enhancing existing ones.},

abstract={Nowadays unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely applied to a wealth of civil and military applications. Robust and high-throughput wireless communication is the crux of these UAV applications. Yet, air-to-ground links suffer from time-varying channels induced by the agile mobility and dynamic environments. Rate adaptation algorithms are generally used to choose the optimal data rate based on the current channel conditions. State-of-the-art approaches leverage physical layer information for rate adaptation, and they work well under certain conditions. However, the above protocols still have limitation under constantly changing flight states and environments for air-to-ground links. To solve this problem, we propose StateRate, a state-optimized rate adaptation algorithm that fully exploits the characteristics of UAV systems using a hybrid deep learning model. The key observation is that the rate adaptation strategy needs to be adjusted according to motion-dependent channel models, which can be reflected by flight states. In this work, the rate adaptation protocol is enhanced with the help of the on-board sensors in UAVs. To make full use of the sensor data, we introduce a learning-based prediction module by leveraging the internal state and an online learning algorithm by employing the pre-trained model that adapts the rate adaptation algorithm to different environments. We implement our algorithm on a commercial UAV platform and evaluate it in various environments. The results demonstrate that our system outperforms the best-known rate adaptation algorithm up to 53% in terms of throughput when the velocity is 2-6 m/s.},

abstract={Commercially available light-weight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present a challenge for public safety, e.g. espionage, transporting dangerous goods or devices. Therefore, countermeasures are necessary. Usually, detection of UAVs is a first step. Along many other modalities, acoustic detection seems promising. Recent publications show interesting results by using machine and deep learning methods. The acoustic detection of UAVs appears to be particularly difficult in adverse situations, such as in heavy wind noise or in the presence of construction noise. In this contribution, the typical feature set is extended to increase separation of background noise and the UAV signature noise. The decision algorithm utilized is support vector machine (SVM) classification. The classification is based on an extended training dataset labeled to support binary classification. The proposed method is evaluated in comparison to previously published algorithms, on the basis of a dataset recorded from different acoustic environments, including unknown UAV types. The results show an improvement over existing methods, especially in terms of false-positive detection rate. For a first step into real-time embedded systems a recursive feature elimination method is applied to reduce the model dimensionality. The results indicate only a slight decreases in detection performance.},

abstract={In this work the visual tracking of an evading UAV using a pursuer-UAV is examined. The developed method combines principles of deep learning, optical flow, intra-frame homography and correlation based tracking. A Yolo tracker for short term tracking is employed, complimented by optical flow and homography techniques. In case there is no detected evader-UAV, the MOSSE tracking algorithm re-initializes the search and the PTZ-camera zooms-out to cover a wider Filed of View. The camera's controller adjusts the pan and tilt angles so that the evader-UAV is as close to the center of view as possible, while its zoom is commanded in order to for the captured evader-UAV bounding box cover as much as possible the captured-frame. Experimental studies are offered to highlight the algorithm's principle and evaluate its performance.},

abstract={In the railway sector, track inspections are regularly needed to monitor the track conditions for potential hazards in order to ensure safety and security of life and property. Recently, conducting infrastructure inspections and monitoring using UAVs has gained attention in various industries including the railways. The rapid development of advanced deep learning and machine vision techniques have given rise to automated railway hazard detection systems based on UAV-based imagery. A major task in such systems is to localize or segment the railway tracks in UAV-based images. This paper investigates the effectiveness of a fully convolutional encoder-decoder type segmentation network called U-Net for the task of segmenting rail track regions from UAV-based images. Through experimental evaluations using a proprietary real-world dataset, we demonstrate U-Net's effectiveness in terms of mean Intersection over Union (IoU). Such methods of rail track segmentation are particularly useful in applications such as automated UAV navigation along rail tracks.},

Given the background of an image acquired by a PTZ-camera system, a border encompassing a moving object is computed relying on optical flow and the histogram of oriented gradients. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are trained off-line to decide on the existence of a UAV within this border. Particularly, the ResNet-50 model was trained using a collected data set with more than 50,000 registered positive images. Having identified a UAV, a visual servoing scheme is employed to adjust the PTZ-parameters in order for the border of a detected UAV to span as large as possible the cameras Field of View. The advocated servoing scheme is robust enough against the UAVs rapid maneuvers. Experimental studies are offered to highlight the efficiency of the suggested scheme.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are unmanned aircrafts operated by radio remote control and programmed control equipment. Due to their small size, low cost, and high flexibility, UAV s are widely used in military and civilian fields. Along with the broad applications of UAVs and the significant advancement of information technologies, they also face cyber threats. Among them, false spoofing is a typical cyber-attack. If this attack hits UAV s, it could result in damage to property and the release of private data or classified documents. In this paper, we propose the Double Shortcuts Zero-Bias Residual Network (Double Shortcuts ZB-ResNet) with small storage capacity and low time complexity for abnormal data detection of UAVs. It is designed by combining double shortcuts residual blocks and Zero-Bias (ZB) fully connected layer to anomaly detections. By comparing with the experimental results of the improved Convolutional Neural Networks with ZB layer, the detection accuracy of the Double Shortcuts ZB-ResNet model is improved by nearly two percentage points.},

abstract={This paper investigates the control of a massive population of UAVs such as drones. The straightforward method of control of UAVs by considering the interactions among them to make a flock requires a huge inter-UAV communication which is impossible to implement in real-time applications. One method of control is to apply the mean field game (MFG) framework which substantially reduces communications among the UAVs. However, to realize this framework, powerful processors are required to obtain the control laws at different UAVs. This requirement limits the usage of the MFG framework for real-time applications such as massive UAV control. Thus, a function approximator based on neural networks (NN) is utilized to approximate the solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. Nevertheless, using an approximate solution can violate the conditions for convergence of the MFG framework. Therefore, the federated learning (FL) approach which can share the model parameters of NNs at drones, is proposed with NN based MFG to satisfy the required conditions. The stability analysis of the NN based MFG approach is presented and the performance of the proposed FL-MFG is elaborated by the simulations.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been emerging as an effective solution for IoT data collection networks thanks to their outstanding flexibility, mobility, and low operation costs. However, due to the limited energy and uncertainty from the data collection process, speed control is one of the most important factors while optimizing the energy usage efficiency and performance for UAV collectors. This work aims to develop a novel autonomous speed control approach to address this issue. To that end, we first formulate the dynamic speed control task of a UAV as a Markov decision process taking into account its energy status and location. In this way, the Q-learning algorithm can be adopted to obtain the optimal speed control policy for the UAV. To further improve the system performance, we develop a highly-effective deep dueling double Q-learning algorithm utilizing outstanding features of the deep neural networks as well as advanced dueling architecture to quickly stabilize the learning process and obtain the optimal policy. Through simulations, we show that our proposed solution can achieve up to 40% greater performance, i.e., an average throughput of the system, compared with other conventional methods. Importantly, the simulation results also reveal significant impacts of UAV's energy and charging time on the system performance.},

abstract={Tobacco plant detection plays an important role in the management of tobacco planting. In this paper, a new algorithm based on deep neural networks is proposed to detect tobacco plants in images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (called UAV images). These UAV images are characterized by a very high spatial resolution (35 mm), and consequently contain an extremely high level of detail for the development of automatic detection algorithms. The proposed algorithm consists of three stages. In the first stage, a number of candidate tobacco plant regions are extracted from UAV images with the morphological operations and watershed segmentation. Each candidate region contains a tobacco plant or a nontobacco plant. In the second stage, a deep convolutional neural network is built and trained with the purpose of classifying the candidate regions as tobacco plant regions or nontobacco plant regions. In the third stage, postprocessing is performed to further remove the nontobacco plant regions. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a UAV image dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well on the detection of tobacco plants in UAV images.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, also called drones) have been widely deployed in our living environments for a range of applications such as healthcare, agriculture, and logistics. Despite their unprecedented advantages, the increased number of UAVs and their growing threats demand high-performance management and emergency control strategies. To accurately detect a UAV’s working state including hovering and flying, data collection from Radio Frequency (RF) signals is a key step of these strategies and has thus attracted significant research interest. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been applied for UAV state detection and shown promising potentials. While existing work mostly focuses on improving the DNN structures, we discover that RF signals’ pre-processing before sending them to the classification model is as important as improving the DNN structures. Experiments on a dataset show that, after applying proposed pre-processing methods, the 10-time average accuracy is improved from 46.8% to 91.9%, achieving nearly 50% gain comparing with the benchmark work using the same DNN structure. This work also outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN models, confirming the great potentials of data pre-processing for RF-based UAV state detection.},

To this end, we propose a new cooperative network platform and system architecture of multi-UAV surveillance.

Second, we provide the moving small target recognition technique and localization and tracking model using the fusion of multiple data sources. In addition, this article discusses the establishment of suitable algorithms based on machine learning due to the complexity of the monitoring area. Finally, experiments of recognition and tracking of multiple moving targets are addressed, which are monitored by multi- UAV and sensors.},

In this paper we propose a solution to determine the optimal 3D position of multiple UAVs in a capacity enhancement use-case, or in other words, when the ground network cannot cope with the user traffic demand. For this scenario, real data from the city of Milan, provided by Telecom Italia is utilized to simulate an event.

In our field experiments, a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) is deployed on the UAV to identify a target from the captured video frames and enable UAV to keep tracking. However, tracking in real time by the DNN requires a lot of computational resources. This motivates us to consider offloading this type of machine learning (ML) tasks to a mobile edge computing (MEC) server. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical ML tasks distribution framework for the UAV tracking system, where the UAV is embedded with lower layers of the pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model due to its limited computing capability, while the MEC server with rich computing resources will handle the higher layers of the CNN model. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the CNN inference delay while taking into account the communications delay, computing time, and ML error. Insights are provided to understand the tradeoff between communications and ML computing in offloading decisions. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ML tasks distribution framework with the optimized offloading strategy.},

To realize real-time patrolling, the speed of calculation and line position recognition is expected to be fast, so machine learning algorithm is considered as a good option.

However, the stringent regulations governing data privacy potentially impedes data sharing across independently owned UAVs. To this end, we propose the adoption of a Federated Learning (FL) based approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative Machine Learning for the development of IoV applications, e.g., for traffic prediction and car park occupancy management. Given the information asymmetry and incentive mismatches between the UAVs and model owner, we leverage on the self-revealing properties of a multi-dimensional contract to ensure truthful reporting of the UAV types, while accounting for the multiple sources of heterogeneity, e.g., in sensing and transmission costs. Then, we adopt the Gale-Shapley algorithm to match the lowest cost UAV to each subregion. The simulation results validate the incentive compatibility of our contract design and shows the efficiency of our matching.},

abstract={Due to a lack of environment awareness, today's low-altitude fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are limited to primitively follow user-defined waypoints. All high-level decision making is still performed by a human user. Fully-autonomous remote missions in complex environments however require true environment awareness both with respect to terrain and wind. While terrain-aware navigation is covered in existing literature, the real-time estimation and consideration of complex wind patterns onboard UAVs is not. This paper therefore presents the literature's first-ever local 3D wind field prediction method which can run in real time onboard a UAV. The selected method is a simple downscaling approach which retrieves low-resolution data from global weather models and then adjusts the wind field via potential flow theory such that terrain boundaries, mass conservation, and the atmospheric stratification are observed. Typical 3D wind fields of 1 km3 volume are calculated in below 10 seconds. Synthetic test cases such as the flow around a semi-cylinder, through a valley and over a ramp yield good results. A comparison with 3D LIDAR wind data collected over 10 days in the Swiss Alps shows an overall wind error reduction of 23% with respect to the zero-wind assumption that is mostly used for UAV path planning today. Overall, our initial research demonstrates the feasibility of real-time 3D wind field prediction onboard a UAV. However, the focus on low computation time means that the vertical wind prediction lacks accuracy. The paper therefore ends with a research outlook into real-time 3D wind field prediction through the fusion of machine learning techniques with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods.},

The developed GP filter estimates the UAV states accurately given delayed observation by learning the pattern of network-induced effects on UAV maneuvers. We validate that the GP filter produces the lower error rate than Kalman filter by analyzing error covariances. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a collaborative trajectory tracking task for two networked-UAVs and the better control performance is achieved.},

abstract={Applications of UAVs have attracted attention recently. Some operations are subject to a low-latency constraint due to high-speed UAVs in 3D space. As a result, low-latency and directional mmWave communications can be taken into account in UAV communications. To overcome mmWave hardware limitations and severe environmental conditions, UAVs can exploit hybrid analog-digital beamforming to improve data rates. For the purpose of being flexible in mission-oriented deployment, the movement of UAVs in 3D space is common but makes beamforming more challenging. The beamforming problem can be solved into two steps: predicting analog beams and then optimizing the corresponding digital weights in terms of SINR maximization. Borrowing the idea of machine learning (especially Q-learning) that uses experience to solve the prediction problem, we implement Q-learning-based beam prediction using coupling coefficients. Compared with other beam tracking methods given knowledge of channel or SINR, using coupling coefficients as observations is a more feasible and efficient solution to rapid beam tracking. The coupling coefficients can be further used to approximate SINR measurements given the selected analog beams. Using the proposed relationship between the SINR measurements and digital weights, we can easily obtain the optimal digital weights.},

abstract={The air-ground integrated network is a key component of future sixth generation (6G) networks to support seamless and near-instant super-connectivity. There is a pressing need to intelligently provision various services in 6G networks, which is challenging. To meet this need, in this article, we propose a novel architecture called UaalS, that is, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a intelligent service for the air-ground integrated network, featuring the UAV as a key enabler to boost edge intelligence with the help of machine learning (ML) techniques. We envision that the proposed UaalS architecture could intelligently provision wireless communication service, edge computing service, and edge caching service by a network of UAVs, making full use of UAVs' flexible deployment and diverse ML techniques. We also conduct a case study where UAVs participate in the model training of distributed ML among multiple terrestrial users, whose result shows that the model training is efficient with low energy consumption of UAVs. Finally, we discuss the challenges and some open research issues in UaaIS.},

abstract={In the context of Fifth Generation mobile networks (5G), Search and Rescue (SAR) missions using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can benefit from a dynamic, intelligent, and autonomous placement of both Network Functions (NFs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to quickly adapt in minimal human intervention scenarios. This article examines current 5G architectures and timely standardization efforts within this context. The contribution of this work is to identify associated 5G components and propose AI modules that enable efficient UAV-based SAR missions: the System Intelligence (SI) and Edge Intelligence (EI) concepts. SI is conceived as the entity responsible for defining and orchestrating the placement and processing tasks of NFs and AI systems, while EI is responsible for the optimization of AI-based end-user applications. The article also presents an open-source virtualized testbed that enables a concrete example of SI and EI roles in a SAR mission based on object detection with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this proof-of-concept, the DNN layers are partitioned and the tradeoffs between communication and computational costs are highlighted. For instance, the results indicate that the latency can severely degrade the UAV trajectory and different DNN partitioning options can reduce the required bit rate to transmit DNN scores by more than three times.},

abstract={Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are essential for detecting and tracking specific events, such as automatic navigation. The intelligent monitoring of people's social distances in crowds is one of the most significant events caused by the coronavirus. The virus is spreading more quickly among the crowds, and the disease cycle continues in congested areas. Due to the error that occurs when humans monitor their activity, an automated model is required to alert to social distance violations in crowds. As a result, this article proposes a two-step framework based on autonomous UAV videos, including human tracking and deep learning-based recognition of the crowd's social distance. The deep architecture is a modified-fast and lightweight ShuffleNet learning structure. First, the Kalman filter is used to determine the positions of individuals, and then the modified ShuffleNet is used to refine the bounding boxes obtained and determine the social distance. The social distance is calculated using the initial refinement of the bounding box obtained during the tracking step and the scale in frames of the human body. The observed average accuracy, average processing time (APT), and processed frame per second (FPS) for three congestion datasets were 97.5%, 84 milliseconds, and 11.5 FPS, respectively. Real-time decision-making was achieved by reducing the size and resolution of the frames. Additionally, the frames were re-labeled to reduce the computational complexity associated with detecting social distancing. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method could operate more quickly and accurately on various resolution frames of UAV videos with difficult conditions.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel strategy for weed monitoring, using images taken with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and concepts of image analysis and machine learning. Weed control in precision agriculture designs site-specific treatments based on the coverage of weeds, where the key is to provide precise weed maps timely. Most traditional remote platforms, e.g. piloted planes or satellites, are, however, not suitable for early weed monitoring, given their low temporal and spatial resolutions, as opposed to he ultra-high spatial resolution of UAVs. The system here proposed makes use of UAV-imagery and is based on: 1) Divide the image, 2) compute and binarise the vegetation indexes, 3) detect crop rows, 4) optimise the parameters and 4) learn a classification model. Since crops are usually organised in rows, the use of a crop row detection algorithm helps to separate properly weed and crop pixels, which is a common handicap given the spectral similitude of both. Several artificial intelligence paradigms are compared in this paper to identify the most suitable strategy for this topic (i.e. unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised approaches). Our experiments also study the effect of different parameteres: the flight altitude, the sensor and the use of previously trained models at a different height. Our results show that 1) very promising performance can be obtained, even when using very few labelled data and 2) the classification model can be learnt in a subplot of the experimental field at low altitude and then applied to the whole field at a higher height, which simplifies the whole process. These results motivate the use of this strategy to design weed monitoring strategies for early post-emergence weed control.},

pages={161161-161180},
abstract={Multi-constraint trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been widely used in military and civil fields. The existing path planning methods, such as swarm intelligence algorithm and graph-based algorithm, cannot incorporate the flying time and UAV kinematic model into evolution. To overcome such disadvantage, a method of solving trajectory planning under obstacles and multi-constraint is investigated in this paper. Firstly, the flying time is discretized as a certain number of Chebyshev points which are the optimized moments of control variable, and they can reduce the computational burden. The process of solution is divided into multi-phase, i.e., two points as a phase to generate the trajectory. Then, angular velocity is taken as control variable, and function of angular velocity is solved by cubic spline interpolation. Besides, functions of angle and position are obtained by integration. The results are substituted into the model consisted by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the UAV kinematic model to optimize. On this basis, the angular velocity, angle and position are calculated according to the allocated moments. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulation and comparison with existed method are carried out in obstacle environment. All the results illustrate that the multi-phase method can calculate the kinematic parameters of UAV accurately and plan smooth trajectories. Meanwhile, the proposed method is easier to meet the complicated constraints than the single-phase method. In addition, the dimensionality of solution is also enriched effectively.},

abstract={In recent years, the availability of low-cost and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) results in the use of them for different types of military and commercial applications. The crucial part of the autonomous UAVs is their online or offline path planning algorithms. In the literature, there are many types of solutions, which use evolutionary and/or swarm intelligence approaches. Ant colony optimization is one of the mostly used algorithms, which has been applied to solve different type of path planning problems. Mainly, most of these studies have focused on a single colony ant colony optimization (ACO), which can find better solutions in fewer computation times. However, it is able to converge to a sub-optimal solution in the planning process. One approach to avoid the premature convergence is the use of Multi-Colony ACO, in which a number of ant colonies try to find an optimal solution cooperatively by exchanging their valuable information with each other. In this paper, it is aimed to implement an obstacle avoidance UAV path planning by using Multi-Colony ACO algorithm. We experimentally investigate the use of Multi-Colony ACO approach results from an effective path planning for UAVs with a comparison to a single colony ACO approach.},

abstract={Solving the path planning problem of a UAV is a challenging issue especially if there are too many checkpoints to visit. Mainly, the brute force approach is used to find the shortest path in the mission area, which requires too many times to find a solution. Therefore, evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence techniques are used to find a feasible solution in an acceptable time. In this study, path planning problem of a UAV is solved by using a highly parallelized Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm on CUDA platform. The UAV path is constructed for disseminating keys and collecting data from a Wireless Sensor Network, which is previously defined. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, ACO is selected as a path planning algorithm. However, ACO is not satisfactory if the mission area becomes large and there are an excessive number of checkpoints and/or additional constraints. In order to increase the performance, some parallelization techniques must be used in high performance computing platforms. GPU architecture has emerged as a powerful and low cost architecture for enabling impressive speedups for scientific calculations. Therefore, the parallel structure is constructed on CUDA architecture. The experimental results are compared with the CPU performance of the serial algorithm, and they clearly show that the proposed approach have a great potential for acceleration of ACO and allow to solve many complex tasks such as UAV path planning problem. We also present the execution results with different parameter values to expose the results for the researchers.},

Therefore, how to reduce the failure rate of UAV sensors has become a hot research topic in recent years. In this paper, we use a publicly available dataset of UAV sensor failure data, we use the first 70 % as the training set and the remaining 30 % as the test set, and we use three models such as neural networks, support vector machines, and gradient boosters to detect the sensor data failures. Finally, we use three metrics, ME, RMSE, and MAE, to evaluate the prediction results of the models. The experimental results show that our proposed neural network model is more efficient. It can better help to detect whether the UAV sensors are faulty, thus reducing the cost and resources wasted on manual sensor detection. It also improves the detection efficiency and extends the service life of the sensors.},

Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient onboard object detection system based on an embedded NPU device. It can be deployed on a UAV to perform real-time scenario analysis. Firstly, a deep-learning network structure based on YOLOV3-Tiny is designed for object detection. Then it is compressed by a novel pruning strategy to obtain a “slim” object detector. Finally, a detection-reinitialization mechanism is introduced to realize the robust output of detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our model and algorithm achieve efficient performance of detection compared to the unoptimized benchmark. The proposed model achieves up to 0.591 mAP with a 6M parameter size. The complete system is tested in both simulation and real environments of the aerial manipulator grasping task. The effective detection frame ratio reaches 90%, and FPS achieves about 25.},

abstract={In this paper, we demonstrate that computer vision pipelines utilising deep neural architectures are well-suited to perform automated Holstein Friesian cattle detection as well as individual identification in agriculturally relevant setups. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply deep learning to the task of automated visual bovine identification. We show that off-the-shelf networks can perform end-to-end identification of individuals in top-down still imagery acquired from fixed cameras. We then introduce a video processing pipeline composed of standard components to efficiently process dynamic herd footage filmed by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We report on these setups, as well as the context, training and evaluation of their components. We publish alongside new datasets: FriesianCattle2017 of in-barn top-down imagery, and AerialCattle2017 of outdoor cattle footage filmed by a DJI Inspire MkI UAV. We show that Friesian cattle detection and localisation can be performed robustly with an accuracy of 99.3% on this data. We evaluate individual identification exploiting coat uniqueness on 940 RGB stills taken after milking in-barn (89 individuals, accuracy = 86.1%). We also evaluate identification via a video processing pipeline on 46,430 frames originating from 34 clips (approx. 20 s length each) of UAV footage taken during grazing (23 individuals, accuracy = 98.1%). These tests suggest that, particularly when videoing small herds in uncluttered environments, an application of marker-less Friesian cattle identification is not only feasible using standard deep learning components - it appears robust enough to assist existing tagging methods.},

abstract={Deep Learning-based object detectors enhance the capabilities of remote sensing platforms, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in a wide spectrum of machine vision applications. However, the integration of deep learning introduces heavy computational requirements, preventing the deployment of such algorithms in scenarios that impose low-latency constraints during inference, in order to make mission-critical decisions in real-time. In this paper, we address the challenge of efficient deployment of region-based object detectors in aerial imagery, by introducing an informed methodology for extracting candidate detection regions (proposals). Our approach considers information from the UAV on-board sensors, such as flying altitude and light-weight computer vision filters, along with prior domain knowledge to intelligently decrease the number of region proposals by eliminating false-positives at an early stage of the computation, reducing significantly the computational workload while sustaining the detection accuracy. We apply and evaluate the proposed approach on the task of vehicle detection. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art detection models can achieve up to 2.6x faster inference by employing our altitude-aware data-driven methodology. Alongside, we introduce and provide to the community a novel vehicle-annotated and altitude-stamped dataset of real UAV imagery, captured at numerous flying heights under a wide span of traffic scenarios.},

abstract={The flapping wing aerial vehicle (FWAV) is an unmanned aerial vehicle that is greatly affected by aerodynamic changes. The uncertainties of its aerodynamic model and the complicated external airflow disturbances make the existing controllers unable to meet the system performance requirements. Therefore, this paper presents a novel adaptive sliding mode controller framework based on cascade control and online learning. First, a virtual guided sliding surface was established to smooth the unstable output of the control quantity and eliminate chattering to avoid aggravating the airflow disturbances caused by the FWAV attitude changes. Then, a reinforcement learning method is designed to optimize the guided process established online, and actively compensates for unknown external disturbances and model uncertainties. Finally, this paper designs an attitude control system including an FWAV approximation model and unknown disturbances to verify the effectiveness of this adaptive framework. Compared with conventional controller optimization methods, simulation results show that the adaptive framework presented has better robustness and control accuracy, which can reduce the sensitivity of an FWAV to aerodynamic changes and attenuate chattering.},

It is assumed that the dynamics of a quadrotor is disturbed by the arbitrary, unstructured forces and moments caused by wind. To address this, the proposed control system is augmented with the multilayer neural networks, and the weights of the neural networks are adjusted online according to an adaptive law. By using the universal approximation theorem, it is shown that the effects of the unknown disturbances can be mitigated. More specifically, under the proposed control system, the tracking errors in the position and heading directions are uniformly ultimately bounded. These are developed directly on the special Euclidean group to avoid the complexities or singularities inherent to local parameterizations. The efficacy of the proposed control system is first illustrated by numerical examples. Then, several indoor flight experiments are presented to demonstrate that the proposed controller successfully rejects the effects of wind disturbances even for aggressive, agile maneuvers.},

abstract={Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning techniques have led to many applications in robotics. These techniques play a significant part in the development of artificially intelligent autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic systems, e.g., Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous cars. Object detection and tracking is an important pillar for such robotic systems. For object detection, a wide variety of deep learning frameworks have been proposed over the past few years. However, objects in the video from a UAV are small and thus very hard to localize and classify. This research proposes a deep learning framework based object detection approach named as BirdView Retina-Net (BV-RNet). BV-RNet is an object detection framework capable of efficiently detecting small-scaled objects from an aerial view-point. BV-RNet extracts dense features and optimizes pre-defined anchors for inference to learn features effectively. VisDrone dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the framework. We have compared the results of BV-RNet with past VisDrone challenge competitors and other commonly employed past object detection frameworks. We have reported that our algorithm achieves mean average precision (mAP) of 31.8 on test-dev dataset, which is among the highest mAP achieved so far on VisDrone. Furthermore, it also outperforms several of the top class-wise mAP of various classes when compared with VisDrone past challenge competitors.},

abstract={In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) self-adaptive region fuzzy guidance law based on radial basis function (RBF) neural networks for some attacking UAV was proposed. Firstly, 3D motion equations for pursuit-evasion of UAV and maneuvering target are given. Secondly, the proposed method was applied to decreasing the miss distance, which is mostly arisen from the fixed navigation rates of traditional proportional navigation guidance laws (TPNGLs). The line of sight (LOS) rate and the closing speed between the attacking UAV and the target are taken as inputs of the fuzzy controller. The output of the fuzzy controller is the commanded acceleration. Then a nonlinear, self-adaptive region function is introduced based on the RBF neural networks to change the region. This nonlinear function can be changed with the input variables, thus can realize dynamic change of the fuzzy variable region. Finally, two engagement scenarios were examined, and a comparison between TPNGLs and the proposed PNGLRBF was made, the simulation results show that the proposed 3D SRFGLRBF can achieve ideal miss distance than TPNGLs.},

abstract={Green communications can be crucial for saving energy in UAVs and enhancing their autonomy. The current work proposes to extract common sequential patterns of communications to gather each common pattern into a single several- fold message with a high-level compression. Since the messages of a pattern are elapsed from each other in time, the current approach performs a machine learning approach for estimating the elapsed times using off-line training. The learned predictive model is applied by each UAV during flight when receiving a several-fold compressed message. We have explored neural networks, linear regression and correlation analyses among others. The current approach has been tested in the domain of surveillance. In specific-purpose fleets of UAVs, the number of transmissions was reduced by 13.9 percent.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can now be considered as aerial base stations (BSs) to support ultra-reliable and low-latency communications by establishing line-of-sight (LoS) connections to ground users. Moreover, combining UAVs with millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) will be a promissing solution. It can provide potentially high capacity wireless services due to their aerial positions and their ability to deploy on demand at specific locations. In this paper, we propose a low-cost and energy-efficient hybrid precoding architecture for UAVs, where the antenna part is realized by lens array. We investigate an efficient and energy-saving hybrid precoding scheme with robustness, which is inspired by the cross-entropy (CE) optimization in machine learning and the relative error estimation optimization. As for each selection of the hybrid precoders for obtaining the optimized precoder, we regarded it as a training process in machine learning, in which the training target is the CE-loss function between the predicted precoders and the target precoders. It aims to minimize the relative error between the predicted and actual values for optimizing the probability distributions of the elements in the analog hybrid precoder. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve higher sum rate and energy efficiency.},

abstract={The advancement of the micro-electro-mechanical sensory industry and open source autopilot stacks, have dramatically reduced the cost and difficulty of making highly maneuverable UAVs. Such ease in flying drones has caused concerns about privacy, public safety, and security. One of the major threats is inadequate control of flying small drones over sensitive areas. In this research, we address this problem through a dual approach: detection and eviction. We propose a distributed system to identify the appearance and the approximate position of unwelcome drones using a wireless acoustic sensor network and machine learning algorithms. Next, we integrate software defined radio transceivers along with machine learning algorithm into a framework to specify and decode the UAV's telemetry protocols. Using decoded information, we can then send control commands to evict the trespassing drone away before sending aggressive surveillance UAVs.},

abstract={This paper looks into the problem of precise autonomous landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which is considered to be a difficult problem as one has to generate appropriate landing trajectories in presence of dynamic constraints, such as, sudden changes in wind velocities and directions, downwash effects, change in payload etc. The problem is further compounded due to uncertainties arising from inaccurate model information and noisy sensor readings. The problem is partially solved by proposing a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based controller that uses Least Square Policy Iteration (LSPI) to learn the optimal control policies required for generating these trajectories. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through both simulation and real-world experiments with actual Parrot AR drone 2.0. According to our study, this is the first time such experimental results have been presented using RL based controller for drone landing, making it a novel contribution in this field.},

abstract={Path planning is one of the key technologies for autonomous flight of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. Traditional path planning algorithms have some limitations and deficiencies in the complex and dynamic environment. In this article, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach for three-dimensional path planning by utilizing the local information and relative distance without global information. UAV can obtain the limited environmental information nearby in the actual scenario with limited sensor capabilities. Therefore, path planning can be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. The recurrent neural network with temporal memory is constructed to address the partial observability problem by extracting crucial information from historical state-action sequences. We develop an action selection strategy that combines the current reward value and the state-action value to reduce the meaningless exploration. In addition, we construct two sample memory pools and propose an adaptive experience replay mechanism based on the frequency of failure. The simulation experiment results show that our method has significant improvements over Deep Q-Network and Deep Recurrent Q-Network in terms of stability and learning efficiency. Our approach successfully plans a reasonable three-dimensional path in the large-scale and complex environment, and has the perfect ability to avoid obstacles.in the unknown environment.},

A desirable result processed designing an effective UAV path planning by getting the lowest duration to reach the target destination point using Double Dueling Deep Q Network (D3QN), a combination of double Q - learning and dueling architectures were used in this paper. The D3QN was used to approximate the Q values of actions to select the best action while the Gaussian noise (GN) layer is also added after the convolutional neural network and dense layer of the dueling network. The Gaussian Noise layer applies additive zero-centered Gaussian noise using a standard deviation of 1.0.

abstract={This work presents an innovative hybrid control scheme for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) model to improve the disturbances rejection capability and body jerk performance by utilizing an active force control (AFC)-based robust intelligent control system via a simulation study. The proposed intelligent control approach incorporates a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and an intelligent active force control (IAFC) element yielding a robust PID-IAFC scheme. A detailed mathematical model of a quadrotor system with six degrees of freedom (DOFs) was first derived using the Newton-Euler method taking into consideration the gyroscopic terms, disturbances, aerodynamics, and friction effects. In the derived model, the PID controller was first designed to stabilize the quadrotor model and achieve the required altitude and attitude motions. In addition, different types of external disturbances in the form of sinusoidal waves and repeated impulses (pulsating) were added. An AFC strategy, known as PID-AFC, was designed and incorporated into the PID controller, and was initially tuned heuristically. Then, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method employing an iterative learning (IL) algorithm was designed and implemented into the AFC (ILAFC) to estimate the control parameters automatically while on-line. Thereafter, the performance of the ILAFC was compared to the AFC with fuzzy logic (FL) which became known as FLAFC. Also, a self-tuning (ST) PID controller was designed and employed based on the FL method to automatically tune the PID gains based on the prescribed operating and loading conditions. Moreover, a comparative study of the system performance was carried out utilizing the PID, PID-AFC, ILAFC, FLAFC, and ST-FPID-AFC schemes to analyze the system characteristics. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the AFC-based intelligent controller was investigated in connection with the body jerk performance in the presence of external disturbances. The simulated results reveal the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy based on the IAFC technique in improving the disturbance rejection capability and body jerk performance by 17% in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances.},

abstract={Automatic power transmission line detection plays the key role in smart grid which has been widely applied into the path planning and navigation of intelligent inspection platforms, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), climbing robots, hybrid inspection robots, etc. Nevertheless, the power lines are always against complex background environment and different illumination conditions. And the power lines occupy a minimal portion image pixels in the aerial images compared with backgrounds which causes the foreground-background class imbalance issue. Therefore, robust and accurate vision-based power line detection still faces a certain challenge. Recently, deep learning has got fast development on pixel-level object segmentation due to strong contextual feature expression ability, especially U-shape network (U-Net) and its variants. However, it still exists a certain shortcomings owing to insufficient process of local contextual features to affect the segmentation precision. Meanwhile, multiple pooling operations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) also will cause the information loss. To address these issues, with the encoder-decoder architecture, a novel vision-based power line detection network is proposed in this paper to construct an end-to-end detection scheme of power lines from aerial images. To make the segmentation network capture the global contexts and emphasize target regions of power transmission lines, an attention block is proposed to be embedded into the proposed power line detection network to address the class imbalance issue. Meanwhile, faced with the insufficient process of local contextual feature maps of DCNNs, an attention fusion block is proposed for multi-scale feature fusion to acquire more rich information and improve the segmentation precision. Experiments on power lines show that the proposed power line detection network shows a good segmentation performance on real power line environment compared with other advanced detection methods.},

abstract={The deep neural networks are capable of processing large amounts of data for image processing applications like classification, segmentation and identification etc. Conditional- Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) is an example of Deep Learning (DL)-based image processing algorithm that is used widely for identifying targets in images. In a Deep Learning based image processing application the quality of the input image plays an important role. The quality and variations within the dataset helps the neural network filters to derive the best features for the classification and identification of the target in the image. Many deep learning approaches will have a preprocessing pipeline which improves the quality of the input training data. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of preprocessing methods to improve C-GAN's ability to detect epiphytes in images acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). These methods include 1) trimming the training images to include mostly the target plant, 2) generating annotation images with a thresholding technique, and 3) incorporating binary cross entropy loss function. Results obtained from this study shows that the percent occupancy of input images and annotation method plays an important role in identifying the target plant.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be integrated into the next generation wireless networks as new aerial mobile users, which can provide various live streaming applications such as surveillance, reconnaissance, etc. For such applications, due to the dynamic characteristics of traffic and wireless channels, how to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) is a challenging task. In this paper, with recent advances in scalable video coding (SVC), we study secure video streaming in wireless networks with UAVs. By jointly optimizing video levels selection and power allocation, the research tries to maximize the energy efficiency, which is the ratio of video quality to power consumption, while satisfying the secrecy timeout probability (STP) requirement. The aforementioned problem is modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). And then, the study employs a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, namely safe deep Q-learning network (safe-DQN), to solve the CMDP problem, in which a safety policies set is induced by constructing a Lyapunov function. Extensive simulation results with different system parameters show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with other existing reinforcement learning algorithms.},

abstract={The flying ad-hoc network (FANET) is a decentralized communication network for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Because of the wireless nature and the unique network properties, FANET remains vulnerable to jamming attack with additional challenges. First, a decision from a centralized knowledge base is unsuitable because of the communication and power constraints in FANET. Second, the high mobility and the low density of the UAVs in FANET require constant adaptation to newly explored spatial environments containing unbalanced data; rendering a distributed jamming detection mechanism inadequate. Third, taking model-based jamming defense actions in a newly explored environment, without a precise estimation of the transitional probabilities, is challenging. Therefore, we propose an adaptive federated reinforcement learning-based jamming attack defense strategy. We developed a model-free Q-learning mechanism with an adaptive exploration-exploitation epsilon-greedy policy, directed by an ondevice federated jamming detection mechanism. The simulation results revealed that the proposed adaptive federated reinforcement learning-based defense strategy outperformed the baseline methods by significantly reducing the number of en route jammer location hop counts. The results also showed that the average accuracy of the federated jamming detection mechanism, leveraged in the defense strategy, was 39.9% higher than that of the distributed mechanism verified with the standard CRAWDAD jamming attack dataset and the ns-3 simulated FANET jamming attack dataset.},

abstract={Based on the reinforcement learning theory, this paper establishes the learning model of the autonomous air combat maneuver decision of the UAV. Aiming at the problem that traditional reinforcement learning and DQN algorithm cannot deal with continuous action space, a policy gradient based DDPG algorithm is adopted, which enables the model to output continuous and smooth control values, thus improving the accuracy of autonomous control of UAV. The DDPG algorithm explores the action space by adding noise to the action values. The randomly generated initial action value combination contains a large number of invalid or low-quality individuals, which leads to inefficient learning and localization. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes to use the optimization algorithm to generate the air combat maneuver action value, and add the optimization action as the initial sample to the DDPG replay buffer. This method filters out a large number of invalid action values and guarantees the correctness of the action value. At the same time, the possibility of exploring diversity is preserved, and the learning efficiency of the DDPG algorithm is improved.},

abstract={Searching indoor environments in the presence of unknown obstacles with multiple UAV agents remains a challenge. This paper presents a framework for target-finding using a combination of traditional POMDP based planning and Deep Reinforcement Learning. The implementation breaks the problem into two separate stages of planning and control, with both stages modelled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Global decentralised planning is provided using a modern online POMDP solver, while a modern Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm is used to provide a policy for local control. Our results indicate that such a framework is capable of target-finding within a simulated indoor test environment in the presence of unknown obstacles, and once extended to real-world operation could enable UAVs to be applied in an increasing number of applications.},

abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide good performance for image recognition, speech recognition, and pattern recognition. However, a poisoning attack is a serious threat to DNN's security. The poisoning attack is a method to reduce the accuracy of DNN by adding malicious training data during DNN training process. In some situations such as a military, it may be necessary to drop only a chosen class of accuracy in the model. For example, if an attacker does not allow only nuclear facilities to be selectively recognized, it may be necessary to intentionally prevent UAV from correctly recognizing nuclear-related facilities. In this paper, we propose a selective poisoning attack that reduces the accuracy of only chosen class in the model. The proposed method reduces the accuracy of a chosen class in the model by training malicious training data corresponding to a chosen class, while maintaining the accuracy of the remaining classes. For experiment, we used tensorflow as a machine learning library and MNIST and CIFAR10 as datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the accuracy of the chosen class to 43.2% and 55.3% in MNIST and CIFAR10, while maintaining the accuracy of the remaining classes.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) edge network has connected lots of heterogeneous smart devices, thanks to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their groundbreaking emerging applications. Limited computational capacity and energy availability have been major factors hindering the performance of edge user equipment (UE) and IoT devices in IoT edge networks. Besides, the edge base station (BS) with the computation server is allowed massive traffic and is vulnerable to disasters. The UAV is a promising technology that provides aerial base stations (ABSs) to assist the edge network in enhancing the ground network performance, extending network coverage, and offloading computationally intensive tasks from UEs or IoT devices. In this paper, we deploy a clustered multi-UAV to provide computing task offloading and resource allocation services to IoT devices. We propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based approach to minimize the overall network computation cost while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) requirements of IoT devices or UEs in the IoT network. We formulate our problem as a natural extension of the Markov decision process (MDP) concerning stochastic game, to minimize the long-term computation cost in terms of energy and delay. We consider the stochastic time-varying UAVs’ channel strength and dynamic resource requests to obtain optimal resource allocation policies and computation offloading in aerial to ground (A2G) network infrastructure. Simulation results show that our proposed MADRL method reduces the average costs by 38.643%, and 55.621% and increases the reward by 58.289% and 85.289% compared with the different single agent DRL and heuristic schemes, respectively.},

abstract={Autonomous exploration is an essential task for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in unknown environments. Often, UAVs on these missions must first build a map of the environment via pure exploration and subsequently use (i.e. exploit) the generated map for downstream navigation tasks. Accomplishing these navigation tasks in two separate steps is not always possible and can potentially be disadvantageous for UAVs deployed in outdoor and dynamically changing environments. Current exploration approaches typically use a priori human-generated maps or heuristics such as frontier-based exploration. Other approaches use learning but focus only on learning policies for specific tasks and use sample inefficient random exploration or make impractical assumptions about full map availability. In this paper, we develop an adaptive exploration approach that allows for a trade off between exploration and exploitation in a single step using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We specifically focus on UAVs searching for areas of interest (AoIs) in an unknown environment. The proposed approach uses a map segmentation technique to decompose the environment map into smaller, tractable maps. DDQN and A2C algorithms are extended with a stack of LSTM layers and trained to generate optimal policies for the exploration and exploitation tasks, respectively. Then, an information gain function is repeatedly computed to determine the optimal trade-off between them. We tested our approach in 3 different tasks against 4 baselines. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of navigating through randomly generated environments and covering more AoI in less time compared to the baselines.},

abstract={Accidents often occur at sea, so effective maritime search and rescue is essential. In the current process of sea search and rescue, the operation efficiency of large search and rescue equipment is low and it cannot provide stable communication link. In this article, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are used to form a cognitive mobile computing network for co-operative search and rescue, and reinforcement learning (RL) is used to plan search path and improve communication throughput. Based on the scene of marine search and rescue, the grid method is used to model the search and rescue area. Meanwhile, an intragroup communication architecture based on UAVs and USVs is designed to assist intragroup communication by recognizing the link channel state between UAVs. Search and rescue path planning is carried out through the strategy iteration of Markov decision process (MDP). Furthermore, distributed RL is used to recognize the channel state and perform mobile computing, so as to optimize the data throughput in the communication group. The simulation results show that we have successfully completed the path planning task. Compared with conventional methods, RL based on different reward functions has better throughput performance under the same number of UAVs auxiliary communications.},

The users’ transmission powers are iteratively optimized and determined, while an Reinforcement Learning (RL)-empowered user-to-UAV association procedure is realized. The overall framework is evaluated via modeling and simulation regarding its proper operation, effectiveness and efficiency, under different scenarios.},

abstract={The integration of space and air components considering satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into terrestrial networks in a space-terrestrial integrated network (STIN) has been envisioned as a promising solution to enhancing the terrestrial networks in terms of fairness, performance, and network resilience. However, employing UAVs introduces some key challenges, among which backhaul connectivity, resource management, and efficient three-dimensional (3D) trajectory designs of UAVs are very crucial. In this paper, low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are employed to alleviate the backhaul connectivity issues with UAV networks, where we address the problem of jointly determining backhaul-aware 3D trajectories of UAVs, resource management, and associations between users, satellites and base stations (BSs) in an STIN while satisfying ground users' quality-of-experience requirements and provisioning fairness concerning users' data rates. The proposed approach maximizes a novel objective function with joint consideration for BS's load and fairness, which can be categorized as a non-deterministic polynomial time hard (NP-hard) problem. To tackle this issue, we leverage a reinforcement learning framework, in which our problem is modeled as a multi-armed bandit problem. Accordingly, BSs learn the environment and its dynamics and then make decisions under an upper confidence bound based method. Simulation results show that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmark methods in terms of fairness, throughput, and load.},

abstract={We address the mobility management of an autonomous UAV-mounted base station (UAV-BS) that provides communication services to a cluster of users on the ground while the geographical characteristics (e.g., location and boundary) of the cluster, the geographical locations of the users, and the characteristics of the radio environment are unknown. UAV-BS solely exploits the received signal strengths (RSS) from the users and accordingly chooses its (continuous) 3-D speed to constructively navigate, Le., improving the transmitted data rate. To compensate for the lack of a model, we adopt policy gradient deep reinforcement learning. As our approach does not rely on any particular information about the users as well as the radio environment, it is flexible and respects the privacy concerns. Our experiments indicate that despite the minimum available information the UAV-BS is able to distinguish between high-rise (often non-line-of-sight dominant) and sub-urban (mainly line-of-sight dominant) environments such that in the former (resp. latter) it tends to reduce (resp. increase) its height and stays close (resp. far) to the cluster. We further observe that the choice of the reward function affects the speed and the ability of the agent to adhere to the problem constraints without affecting the delivered data rate.},

abstract={The ability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to autonomously operate is constrained by the severe limitations of their on-board resources. The limited processing capacity and energy storage of these devices inevitably makes the real-time analysis of complex signals – the key to autonomy – challenging. In urban environments, the UAVs can leverage the communication and computation resources of the surrounding city-wide Internet of Things infrastructure to enhance their capabilities. For instance, the UAVs can interconnect with edge computing resources and offload computation tasks to improve response time to sensor input and reduce energy consumption. However, the complexity of the urban topology and large number of devices and data streams competing for the same network and computation resources create an extremely dynamic environment, where poor channel conditions and edge server congestion may penalize the performance of task offloading. This paper develops a framework enabling optimal offloading decisions as a function of network and computation load parameters and current state. The optimization is formulated as an optimal stopping time problem over a semi-Markov process. We solve the optimization problem using Dynamic Programming and Deep Reinforcement learning at different levels of abstraction and prior knowledge of the system underlying stochastic processes. We validate our results in a realistic scenario, where a UAV performs a building inspection task while connected to an edge server.},

Our approach is based on localization data and simple sparse range data to train the intelligent agent. We based our approach in two state-of-the-art Deep- Rl techniques for terrestrial robot: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC). We compare the performance with a classic geometric-based tracking controller for mapless navigation of UAVs. Based on experimental results, we conclude that Deep- Rl algorithms are effective to perform mapless navigation and obstacle avoidance for UAVs. Our vehicle successfully performed two proposed tasks, reaching the desired goal and outperforming the geometric-based tracking controller on the obstacle avoiding capability.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are often used in mission-critical applications, requiring a critical criterion in flight time. Unfortunately, severe power fluctuations, caused by specific flight patterns, degrade the deliverable capacity of the battery and hamper the flight time. A common approach to mitigating power fluctuations is to employ a hybrid energy storage system using a Li-ion battery with an ultracapacitor (UC). However, the conventional scheme poses inherent problems of low-energy density and power leakage due to the use of the UC and the supplementary hardware required for hybrid storage. In this article, we propose Hydrone, a reconfigurable battery architecture that maximizes the flight time of UAVs, overcoming the previous limitations. Hydrone addresses two key challenges that arise when hybrid energy storage is utilized in UAVs: 1) capacity loss and 2) power leakage. First, the proposed scheme compromises the capacity loss of hybrid storage by using a minimal capacity UC for use as a buffer to counteract the power fluctuations. Second, the power leakage of the hybrid battery is minimized by draining power from the UC only when it is necessary. To this end, the Hydrone architecture provides reconfigurability in hardware and offers two modes of battery operation, i.e., a battery-only mode and a hybrid mode. An appropriate operation is then selected at runtime depending on the flight situation and battery status. To switch modes, we employed a reinforcement learning-based switch control, reflecting the power fluctuation adequately on the flight and battery states. We implemented a hardware prototype to demonstrate the efficiency of Hydrone. Our extensive evaluation shows that the flight time of a UAV is prolonged up to 39% in our experiment setup.},

To tackle this challenge, we first propose a distributed sense-and-send protocol to coordinate the UAVs. Based on this protocol, we formulate the trajectory design problem for AoI minimization and propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to solve it, which we refer to as the compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm.

We propose a new end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approach to UAV-enabled data collection from Internet of Things (IoT) devices in an urban environment. An autonomous drone is tasked with gathering data from distributed sensor nodes subject to limited flying time and obstacle avoidance. While previous approaches, learning and non-learning based, must perform expensive recomputations or relearn a behavior when important scenario parameters such as the number of sensors, sensor positions, or maximum flying time, change, we train a double deep Q-network (DDQN) with combined experience replay to learn a UAV control policy that generalizes over changing scenario parameters. By exploiting a multi-layer map of the environment fed through convolutional network layers to the agent, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agent to make movement decisions for a variety of scenario parameters that balance the data collection goal with flight time efficiency and safety constraints. Considerable advantages in learning efficiency from using a map centered on the UAV's position over a non-centered map are also illustrated.},

On account of the coupled relationship between the three optimization variables, an alternating optimization approach is proposed to solve this problem. The original problem is divided into two sub-problems. The first one is that of optimizing the channel allocation and relay assignment with fixed relay deployment. Considering without central controller, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to solve this sub-problem. The second sub-problem is that of optimizing the relay deployment with fixed channel allocation and relay assignment. Assuming no knowledge of channel model and exact positions of the communication nodes, an online learning algorithm based on real-time capacity is proposed to solve this sub-problem. By solving the two sub-problems alternately and iteratively, the original problem is finally solved. Simulation results show that the UAVs-aided D2D network can achieve a high capacity via the joint optimization of relay deployment, channel allocation, and relay assignment.},

abstract={We present a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning formulation of the decentralized formation control problem for swarms of fixed-wing UAVs based on a relative state-space construction of obstacles and waypoints. Specifically, a modular state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) approach is applied to a set of behavioral swarm rules (i.e., Reynolds flocking, target seek, and obstacle avoidance). Q-tables are trained offline for each rule using a simulated model of the UAV plant over scenarios with randomized waypoints and obstacle locations. The greatest mass approach is applied to action selection for each UAV by selecting the relative heading that maximizes the weighted sum of Q-values across all Q-tables. To restrain the dimensionality of the state space, object-focused learning is applied during policy evaluation to instantiate multiple Q-tables for each detected neighbor UAV and obstacle. In comparison to existing behavioral swarm controllers, the controller learned via object-focused greatest mass SARSA (OF-GM-SARSA) is generalizable across multiple scenarios in terms of demonstrating desired swarm behaviors while providing a negliaible number of collisions.},

abstract={In the case of explosive content requests being generated by numerous vehicles in rush hour, the cellular downlink resources become insufficient. This paper considers two supplementary schemes for exploiting the uplink resources: One is letting vehicles cache the browsed contents so that the vehicles can share contents with one another; and the other is dispatching a cache-enabled UAV to transmit contents to the vehicles nearby. We formulate a joint optimization problem for maximizing the average data rate of vehicles, and then decompose it into the subproblems of client association and UAV scheduling. The client association aims at matching the vehicles to the resources, and the UAV scheduling is to update the UAV's caching and trajectory to adapt to the environment changing. The two subproblems focus respectively on the current condition and the long term profit, and are solved respectively by a matching-based algorithm and a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm. Our simulation results based on a real-world traffic data set demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approaches.},

abstract={This article investigates autonomous resource allocation of multiple UAVs enabled communication networks with the goal of maximizing long-term rewards. To model the uncertainty of environments, we formulate the long-term resource allocation problem as a stochastic game, where each UAV becomes a learning agent and each resource allocation solution corresponds to an action taken by the UAVs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that each agent discovers its best strategy according to its local observations using learning. More specifically, we propose an agent-independent method, for which all agents conduct a decision algorithm independently but share a common structure based on Q-learning. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed MARL algorithm provides acceptable performance compared to the case with complete information exchanges among UAVs.},
