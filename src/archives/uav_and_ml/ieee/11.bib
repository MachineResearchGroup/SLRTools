abstract={Based on hierarchical Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and Fuzzy Logic theory (FL), in this paper a Multilayer Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) has been developed with an application to active classification and transport of objects using an indoors Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The learning approach that follows the proposed ML-FELM is a forward two-step hierarchical methodology. First, by stacking a number of Fuzzy Autoencoders (FAEs), input data is projected into a feature representation space. Each FAE is functionally equivalent to a Mamdani Fuzzy Logic System of type-1 (T1 FLS). Finally, in the second stage, features achieved by stacking a number of FAEs are classified by using a Fuzzy ELM (FELM) based on T1 FLS theory and ELM. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ML-FELM, a number of other existing machine learning approaches were employed for the active classification and transport of four different geometrical objects. To further ensure the efficiency of the ML-ELM, a number of popular benchmark data sets for classification problems are also suggested. Based on our experimental results and compared to other deep learning strategies, the ML-FELM not only represents a fast machine learning approach, but also produces a high model accuracy for image classification.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of dynamical deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities for optimizing the energy efficiency of UAV-enabled networks is studied. In the studied model, the UAVs can simultaneously provide communications and illumination to service ground users. Since ambient illumination increases the interference over VLC links while reducing the illumination threshold of the UAVs, it is necessary to consider the illumination distribution of the target area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly optimizes UAV deployment, user association, and power efficiency while meeting the illumination and communication requirements of users. To solve this problem, an algorithm that combines the machine learning framework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. Using GRUs and CNNs, the UAVs can model the long-term historical illumination distribution and predict the future illumination distribution. Given the prediction of illumination distribution, the original nonconvex optimization problem can be divided into two sub-problems and is then solved using a low-complexity, iterative algorithm. Then, the proposed algorithm enables UAVs to determine the their deployment and user association to minimize the total transmit power. Simulation results using real data from the Earth observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the proposed approach can achieve up to 68.9% reduction in total transmit power compared to a conventional optimal UAV deployment that does not consider the illumination distribution and user association.},

abstract={The paper presents a study on offboard machine learning through edge computing for robotic applications. Edge or `fog' computing is being pursued as a supplement to cloud computing to provide the computing resources near the `edge' where it is needed most. In this paper a framework of such an edge computing system is presented for robotic applications. The system consists of a recent machine learning platform (Jetson TX2) integrated within a heterogeneous robotic environment of UAVs and mobile robots operated through robot operating system (ROS). The UAVs and the mobile robots are equipped with cameras for providing visual feedback of the surrounding to the main processor (Jetson TX2) for image processing and object classification. The UAVs and the robots have their individual local processors capable enough to handle local processing of other sensor data and providing interface for transmitting images to and receiving identification results from the offboard processor. The system has been developed around ROS which provides the communication between hardware and system drivers for UAVs and mobile robots. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using a UAV and a mobile robot to send images to the offboard process to identify a moving person and receive commands to follow him. The mobile robot follows the person and the UAV action is simulated using a simulator with parameters of a physical UAV.},

To fix this problem, we use a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) dynamic model as the prototype of various vehicles to learn the force and moment required for stability during training, and employs a deep neural network directly mapping the states to the actuator commands. The force and moment can be adjusted according to different conditions and applied to different axis multi-rotor. Using reinforcement learning, this paper demonstrate the flight control of quadrotor and hexrotor using trained policy in simulator to present the stability on different multi-rotor structure, and compared the performance with the one previously introduced by trained quadrotor.},

abstract={This study assesses machine learning methods for the classification of an intertidal reef using RGB and multispectral imagery acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). After the photogrammetric processing of the acquired data an orthophoto mosaic was generated, from the RGB imagery, and the reflectance of four bands (green, red, red edge and near infrared) from the multispectral data. Four machine learning classifiers were evaluated: support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN) naive Bayes (NB) and random forests (RF). The data was classified into four classes: sand; rock, barnacles, limpets; mussels, rock; and algae mixed. The classifiers were trained with RGB and with multispectral data. The pixel-based classification results demonstrated that when using multispectral data all classifiers overcame the performance achieved when using RGB data. NB classifier performed better in discriminating all classes and detecting submerged seaweeds. Such techniques present a valuable tool for accurately map the coastal zone.},

This study intended to tackle the fertilizer consumption inefficiencies by utilizing non-destructive remote sensing technologies, soil macronutrient distribution analysis, and a deep learning model. Specifically, an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) was used in a cornfield to capture the plant's reflectance information for retrieving the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. Consequently, the field's soil samples were examined for their Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and Carbon (NPKC) macronutrient constituencies. Finally, a Convolutional Neural Network-Regression model was developed to predict infield NPKC spatiotemporal variations in soil using the NDVI measurements. The deep learning model effectively determined the surpluses or shortages of the NPKC macronutrients within the cornfield throughout the growth stages. The model performed vigorously with R2 values of 0.93, 0.92, 0.98, and 0.83 in predicting N, P, K, and C levels in soil, respectively.},

volume={10},

pages={23545-23559},
abstract={Target tracking using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a challenging robotic problem. It requires handling a high level of nonlinearity and dynamics. Model-free control effectively handles the uncertain nature of the problem, and reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches are a good candidate for solving this problem. In this article, the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm (TD3), as recent and composite architecture of RL, was explored as a tracking agent for the UAV-based target tracking problem. Several improvements on the original TD3 were also performed. First, the proportional-differential controller was used to boost the exploration of the TD3 in training. Second, a novel reward formulation for the UAV-based target tracking enabled a careful combination of the various dynamic variables in the reward functions. This was accomplished by incorporating two exponential functions to limit the effect of velocity and acceleration to prevent the deformation in the policy function approximation. In addition, the concept of multistage training based on the dynamic variables was proposed as an opposing concept to one-stage combinatory training. Third, an enhancement of the rewarding function by including piecewise decomposition was used to enable more stable learning behaviour of the policy and move out from the linear reward to the achievement formula. The training was conducted based on fixed target tracking followed by moving target tracking. The flight testing was conducted based on three types of target trajectories: fixed, square, and blinking. The multistage training achieved the best performance with both exponential and achievement rewarding for the fixed trained agent with the fixed and square moving target and for the combined agent with both exponential and achievement rewarding for a fixed trained agent in the case of a blinking target. With respect to the traditional proportional differential controller, the maximum error reduction rate is 86%. The developed achievement rewarding and the multistage training opens the door to various applications of RL in target tracking.},

abstract={Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), as a promising application of extending cellular service from ground to low-altitude three-dimensional (3D) airspace, has received significant attention recently. However, its practical realization faces some critical challenges, such as the noncontinuous 3D cellular coverage in the sky, as well as the complex physical and radio environment when operating in urban area. In this paper, by exploiting the UAV’s highly controllable mobility, we study the UAV trajectory design problem to minimize the weighted sum of mission completion time and expected communication outage duration, while ensuring obstacle avoidance in complex environment. The formulated problem involves intractable cost function and constraint, which can not be solved by standard optimization techniques. To this end, we first study the performance upper bound based on the Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm under the ideal assumption that the perfect physical environment information and radio channel knowledge are available. For the practical scenario in the absence of such information, a novel framework with simultaneous environment sensing and channel knowledge mapping is proposed, which aims to construct both the physical environment and radio propagation maps to facilitate the reinforcement learning based path design. Numerical results show that the proposed technique can effectively avoid the coverage holes and physical obstacles, and approaches to the performance upper bound that assumes the perfect physical and radio environment information.},

Specifically, a UAV is powered by the laser beam transmitted from a GBS, and can further charge IoT devices wirelessly. Here, an interesting task offloading and energy allocation problem is investigated by maximizing the long-term reward subject to executed task size and execution delay, under constraints such as energy causality, task causality, and cache causality. A federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) framework is proposed to learn the joint task offloading and energy allocation decision while reducing the training cost and preventing privacy leakage of DRL training.

abstract={Heavy data load and wide cover range have always been crucial problems for big data processing in Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, mobile-edge computing (MEC) and unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) have emerged as promising techniques in IoT. In this article, we propose a three-layer online data processing network based on the MEC technique. On the bottom layer, raw data are generated by distributed sensors with local information. Upon them, UAV-BSs are deployed as moving MEC servers, which collect data and conduct initial steps of data processing. On top of them, a center cloud receives processed results and conducts further evaluation. For online processing requirements, the edge nodes should stabilize delay to ensure data freshness. Furthermore, limited onboard energy poses constraints to edge processing capability. In this article, we propose an online edge processing scheduling algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization. In cases of low data rate, it tends to reduce edge processor frequency for saving energy. In the presence of a high data rate, it will smartly allocate bandwidth for edge data offloading. Meanwhile, hovering UAV-BSs bring a large and flexible service coverage, which results in a path planning issue. In this article, we also consider this problem and apply deep reinforcement learning to develop an online path planning algorithm. Taking observations of around environment as an input, a CNN network is trained to predict action rewards. By simulations, we validate its effectiveness in enhancing service coverage. The result will contribute to big data processing in future IoT.},

We compare table-based and neural network (NN) approximations of the Q-function and analyze the results.

abstract={In this paper a full approach of modeling and control of a four rotor unmanned air vehicle (UAV) known as quad-rotor aircraft is presented. In fact, a PD and a PD optimized Neural Networks Approaches (PD-NN) are developed to be applied to control a quad-rotor. The goal of this work is to concept a smart Self-Tuning PD controller based on neural networks able to supervise the quad-rotor for an optimized behavior while tracking a desired trajectory. Many challenges could arise if the quad-rotor is navigating in hostile environments presenting irregular disturbances in the form of wind added to the model on each axis. Thus, the quad-rotor is subject to three dimensional unknown static/varying wind disturbances. The quad-rotor has to quickly perform tasks while ensuring stability and accuracy and must behave rapidly with regards to decision making facing disturbances. This technique offers some advantages over conventional control methods such as PD controller. Simulation results are obtained with the use of Matlab/Simulink environment and are founded on a comparative study between PD and PD-NN controllers based on wind disturbances. These later are applied with several degrees of strength to test the quad-rotor behavior. These simulation results are satisfactory and have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed PD-NN approach. In fact, this controller has relatively smaller errors than the PD controller and has a better capability to reject disturbances. In addition, it has proven to be highly robust and efficient facing turbulences in the form of wind disturbances.},

abstract={Aiming at an intelligent perception and obstacle avoidance of UAV in an environment, a UAV visual flight control method based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper. The method employs Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) to the UAV flight control decision network, and uses Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to train the network. The special gates structure of GRU is utilized to memorize historical information, and acquire the variation law of the environment of UAV from the time series data including image information of obstacles, UAV position and speed information to realize a dynamic perception of obstacles. Moreover, the basic framework and training method of the network are introduced, and the generalization ability of the network is tested. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better generalization ability and better adaptability to the environment.},

abstract={Autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in an unknown environment is a challenging task that attracts many researchers. There exist many solutions to the problem, one promising method is deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we investigate a deterministic policy based actor-critic learning framework on vision-based navigation of an autonomous UAV within a simulated environment. In particular, navigation with high-level input and continuous output is considered. In simulation, the observation of UAV is a depth image from front camera while the target information is a vector, to combine them together, we calculate the track angle between UAV and target, and encode it into a depth image together observation, making up to state representation. In the framework of our algorithm, actor network adopts convolutional layer to deal with high-level input, while critic network employs merge layer to balance state information and action information. The result of the experiment supports the idea of full control of an autonomous UAV through deep reinforcement learning as we solve the task successfully. Besides, comparison with other method was conducted to further explore the advantage of the method.},

abstract={There is a strong interest in utilizing commercial cellular networks to support unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to send control commands and communicate heavy traffic. Cellular networks are well suited for offering reliable and secure connections to the UAVs as well as facilitating traffic management systems to enhance safe operation. However, for the full-scale integration of UAVs that perform critical and high-risk tasks, more advanced solutions are required to improve wireless connectivity in mobile networks. In this context, integrated access and backhaul (IAB) is an attractive approach for the UAVs to enhance connectivity and traffic forwarding. In this paper, we study a novel approach to dynamic associations based on reinforcement learning at the edge of the network and compare it to alternative association algorithms. Considering the average data rate, our results indicate that the reinforcement learning methods improve the achievable data rate. The optimal parameters of the introduced algorithm are highly sensitive to the donor next generation node base (DgNB) and UAV IAB node densities, and need to be identified beforehand or estimated via a stateful search. However, its performance nearly converges to that of the ideal scheme with a full knowledge of the data rates in dense deployments of DgNBs.},

abstract={Energy-aware control for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is one of the major research interests in UAV based networking. Yet few existing works have focused on how the network should react around the timing when the UAV lineup is changed. In this work, we study proactive self-remedy of energy-constrained UAV networks when one or more UAVs are short of energy and about to quit for charging. We target at an energy-aware optimal UAV control policy which proactively relocates the UAVs when any UAV is about to quit the network, rather than passively dispatches the remaining UAVs after the quit. Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based self remedy approach, named SREC-DRL, is proposed to maximize the accumulated user satisfaction scores for a certain period within which at least one UAV will quit the network. To handle the continuous state and action space in the problem, the state-of-the-art algorithm of the actor-critic DRL, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), is applied with better convergence stability. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with the passive reaction method, the proposed SREC-DRL approach shows a 12.12% gain in accumulative user satisfaction score during the remedy period.},

abstract={Deploying wireless routers on the ground and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the air is believed to be a fast and efficient approach to providing the emergency communication service to disaster areas. The network lifetime is restricted to the lifetime of mesh networks of routers that are scattered across a complex disaster environment. We consider the problem of multi-UAVs relaying and moving with the goal of maximizing the network lifetime. UAVs must learn where to move in order to relay messages from the routers efficiently. However, under the dynamics of the router traffic, that is, the uncertainty of the environment, it is challenging for UAVs to find a movement mechanism that maximizes the network lifetime. By embracing the on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm Sarsa, we are able to demonstrate a greedy movement policy. Specifically, we study the trajectory planning of multiple UAVs in a dense wireless router mesh networks (WMNs) on the ground. UAVs can learn the unknown environment by a little movement of UAVs in each step, in which communication connections between routers with UAVs are retained. A Q-table of movement actions and environment states is formed after multiple attempts of movements. Simulation results show the proposal effectiveness comparing with other methods.},

abstract={Driven by the exploding computing service demands from various intelligent mobile applications, an increasing amount of research efforts have been devoted to mobile edge computing (MEC). Meanwhile, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have found a great success in assisting existing wireless systems due to their flexibility and low cost. The advancements in these two closely related fields foster the development of the recently advocated UAV-assisted MEC paradigm, which is expected to bring unprecedented performance gain to the existing ground-based MEC systems. Nonetheless, existing works on UAV-assisted MEC mainly focus on the single-UAV scenarios and often assume static system states. In this paper, UAV swarm assisted MEC is considered where multiple collaborative UAVs are employed to help the terrestrial edge server to provide better edge computing services. However, the complexity of using existing methods to find the best dynamic coordination strategy in UAV swarm assisted MEC becomes intractable when the number of UAVs increases. To resolve this challenge, a novel decentralized deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed in this work, which can reduce the complexity by orders of magnitude. In addition, simulations are conducted to show that by using the proposed algorithm, the UAV swarm can efficiently learn a good dynamic coordination strategy and thus achieve a significantly better performance than the baseline scheme.},

The proposed methodology consists of a convolutional neural network and a jitter compensation model. The neural network analyzes the deformed images and generates the attitude jitter vectors in two directions, which are utilized to correct the images through interpolation and resampling. The PatternNet and the small UAV data sets are introduced to train the neural network and to validate its effectiveness and accuracy. The compensation results on distorted remote sensing images obtained by satellites and UAVs reveal that the image distortion due to attitude jitter is clearly reduced and that the geometric quality is effectively improved. Compared to the existing methods that primarily rely on sensor data or parallax observation, no auxiliary information is required in our framework.},

abstract={Automatic flying target detection and tracking in video sequences acquired from a camera mounted on another Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is a challenging task due to the presence of non-stationary cameras in the system, dynamic motion of the moving target, and high-cost computation for real-time applications. In this paper, our aim is to automatically detect and track moving UAV by another one while simultaneously flying in the air. In order to provide efficiently in real-time applications, we develop a vision-based low-cost hardware system integrated with an independent ground control station. We initially created a new public dataset called ATAUAV that includes different types of UAV images obtained from videos recording in our experiments and searches on Google Images for the training process. Deep learning-based YOLOv3-Tiny (You Only Look Once) is used for target detection with the highest accuracy and fastest results. Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) adapted with YOLO, which runs on low-cost hardware, is used for real-time detected target tracking. We compared the performance of the proposed approach with different tracking algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides the highest accuracy rate as 82.7% and a mean fps speed as 29.6 on CPU.

The traditional identification method can solve most problems, but there are blind spots for low-altitude Uav. By contrast, the deep learning can better solve this problem, but the effect of CNN and other methods is poor in the case of fog. In order to solve this problem, we will apply CNN to dehaze the image. At the same time, for the sake of our subsequent recognition model is more accurate, more real-time, we put forward on the basis of the residual model, using the different sizes of convolution kernels, combining the Inception block and MobileNet[1] network. Our proposed model maintain the better identify accurate rate, increasing our recognition speed. Therefore, this paper aims to train multi-scale convolution model, which can effectively identify low-altitude and slow-speed Uav in fog. Experimental results show that this method is feasible.},

abstract={The use of semi-autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) to support emergency response scenarios, such as fire surveillance and search-and-rescue, has the potential for huge societal benefits. Onboard sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) allow these UAVs to operate autonomously in the environment. However, human intelligence and domain expertise are crucial in planning and guiding UAVs to accomplish the mission. Therefore, humans and multiple UAVs need to collaborate as a team to conduct a time-critical mission successfully. We propose a meta-model to describe interactions among the human operators and the autonomous swarm of UAVs. The meta-model also provides a language to describe the roles of UAVs and humans and the autonomous decisions. We complement the meta-model with a template of requirements elicitation questions to derive models for specific missions. We also identify common scenarios where humans should collaborate with UAVs to augment the autonomy of the UAVs. We introduce the meta-model and the requirements elicitation process with examples drawn from a search-and-rescue mission in which multiple UAVs collaborate with humans to respond to the emergency. We then apply it to a second scenario in which UAVs support first responders in fighting a structural fire. Our results show that the meta-model and the template of questions support the modeling of the human-on-the-loop human interactions for these complex missions, suggesting that it is a useful tool for modeling the human-on-the-loop interactions for multi-UAVs missions.},

abstract={Recent technical advancements in both fields of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) control and artificial intelligence (AI) have made a certain realm of applications possible. However, one of the main problems in integration of these two areas is the bottle-neck of computing AI applications on UAV’s resource limited platform. One of the main solution for this problem is that AI and control software from one side and computing hardware mounted on UAV from the other side be adopted together based on the main constraints of the resource limited computing platform on UAV. Basically, the target constraints of such adaptation are performance, energy efficiency, and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a strategy to integrate and adopt the commonly used object detection and tracking algorithm and UAV control software to be executed on a heterogeneous resource limited computing units on a UAV. For object detection, a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm is used. For object tracking, a novel algorithm is proposed that can execute along with object tracking via sequential stream data. For UAV control, a Gain-Scheduled PID controller is designed that steers the UAV by continuously manipulation of the actuators based on the stream data from the tracking unit and dynamics of the UAV. All the algorithms are adopted to be executed on a heterogeneous platform including NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded computer and an ARM Cortex M4. The observation from real-time operation of the platform shows that using the proposed platform reduces the power consumption by 53.69% in contrast with other existing methods while having marginal penalty for object detection and tracking parts.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are attracting increasing attention for applications such as video streaming, surveillance, and delivery using reliable line-of-sight (LOS) links. Nevertheless, due to the large radio-frequency (RF) transmission footprint from a UAV transmitted to ground nodes, UAV communications may significantly deteriorate the performance of cochannel ground communication links. With the lack of a dedicated spectrum, researchers need to design efficient spectrum-sharing policies for UAV communications to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and control interference-to-ground communications. One technique for spectrum sharing is spatial spectrum sensing (SSS), which enables devices to sense spatial spectrum opportunities and reuse them aggressively and efficiently by controlling the SSS radius. The goal of this article is to introduce the fundamentals, challenges, and applications of SSS for UAV spectrum access and discuss open research problems for realizing UAV spectrum sharing, including dynamic spectrum access for swarm UAV networks, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled UAV spectrum access, blockchain-based UAV spectrum access, multichannel access for UAVs, and the integration of UAVs into cellular networks.},

abstract={The 5th generation (5G) wireless network with Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered to be one of the most effective solutions for improving the communication coverage. However, UAV is easily affected by the wind, accompanied by a certain time delay during the air communication. Thus the inaccurate beamforming will be performed by the base station (BS), resulting in the unnecessary capacity loss. To address this issue, we propose a novel Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)-based arrival angle predictor to predict the specific communication location of UAV under the 5G Internet of Things (IoT) networks in this paper. Specifically, a grid-based coordinate system is applied during the data preprocessing to make the training process easier and more effective. Moreover, the RNN model with the highest accuracy can be saved during the training process to ensure the real-time prediction. Simulation results reveal that the RNN-based predictor we proposed is of high prediction accuracy, which is 98% in average. Therefore, a more precise beamforming can be performed by BS to reduce the unnecessary capacity loss, resulting in a more effective and reliable communication system.},

The datasets are from Multi-rotor UAV inspection of high voltage transmission lines. Three types of power tower components including the tower, tower base, and signs are selected as recognition targets.

abstract={A model to estimate Nitrogen nutrition level in corn crops (Zea mays) is presented. The model was based on the information provided by multi-spectral cameras in four bands (red, green, blue and near-infrared (808 nm). The model was validated with ground truth information obtained by destructive methods. For training phase, three different fertilization levels of the crops were used (70, 140 y 210 kg · N · ha/sup -1/) with three repetitions in two stages of growing (V10 and earring). Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology was used. UAV quad-copter type flying 70 meters above the crops and machine learning techniques were used for the prediction stage. Results shown that the model can estimate nitrogen levels with 80% of precision with low cost technologies (multi-spectral cameras and UAVs). This proposal aims to optimize the fertilization since it actually is applied uniformly in the crops. The proposed scheme is focused on areas where the nitrogen is insufficient, avoiding the waste and reducing the impact on the environment.},

abstract={This paper targets the promising area of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless networking, by which communication-enabled robots operate as flying wireless relays to help fill coverage or capacity gaps in the networks. In order to feed the UAV's autonomous path planning and positioning algorithm, a radio map is exploited, which must be, in practice, reconstructed from UAV-based measurements from a limited subset of locations. Unlike existing methods that ignore the segmented propagation structure of the radio map, this paper proposes a machine learning approach to reconstruct a finely structured map by exploiting both segmentation and signal strength models. A data clustering and parameter estimation problem is formulated using a maximum likelihood approach, and solved by an iterative clustering and regression algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate significant performance advantage in radio map reconstruction as compared to the baseline.},

abstract={With the increasing number and application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in urban areas, positioning of UAV has become one of the key technologies for maintaining city security and managing airspace resources. Time of arrival (TOA) based location technology is widely used for its high precision, but its performance may suffer from strong multipath and NLOS propagation in urban scenario. However, the NLOS components may also be useful for positioning if the propagation path can be analyzed in a map model. In this paper, a multipath fingerprint dataset for an urban area is built by ray tracing simulation. Based on this dataset, we propose a two-stage localization method on machine learning framework. Firstly, in the stage of coarse positioning, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm is applied to determine which region the UAV is located in. Then, in the fine positioning stage, a neural network is trained to predict the specific location within the region. The simulation results in a 600 × 600 m2 region show that 90% of the positioning error of this method is less than 16m.},

Moreover, a multiple degrees of freedom unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) usually has many physical parameters, and the method of obtaining them is challenging. Much research has been done in this area and a lot of methods have been applied to several UAVs. In this paper, we use particle swarm optimization (PSO) swarm intelligence algorithm to identify the inertia physical parameters of quadrotor helicopter. To primarily reduce complexity of the problem and simplify the design of parameter identification scheme, the dynamics of the whole system is decomposed into two subsystems by model transformation. Then using input and output data which come from model test, the model parameters of quadrotor helicopter are identified successfully. The simulating results validate that this scheme has not only good performance on convergence speed, but also low identification error.},

abstract={Significantly outperforming traditional machine learning methods, deep convolutional neural networks have gained increasing popularity in the application of image classification and segmentation. Nevertheless, deep learning-based methods usually require a large amount of training data, which is quite labor-intensive and time-demanding. To deal with the problem in generating training data, we propose in this paper a novel approach to generate image annotations by transferring labels from aerial images to UAV images and refine the annotations using a densely connected CRF model with an embedded naive Bayes classifier. The generated annotations not only present correct semantic labels, but also preserve accurate class boundaries. To validate the utility of these automatic annotations, we deploy them as training data for pixel-wise image segmentation and compare the results with the segmentation using manual annotations. Experiment results demonstrate that the automatic annotations can achieve comparable segmentation accuracy as the manual annotations.},

abstract={Reliable and flexible emergency networks are of paramount essence for disaster relief during or after the event of disasters due to the destruction or lack of terrestrial communication infrastructures. Thanks to fast deployment and flexible mobilities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) emerge as a promising paradigm to efficiently establish emergency networks and perform immediate disaster relief tasks in affected areas. However, in such UAV-assisted disaster relief networks (UDRNs), the limited onboard batteries and computational capacities of UAVs hinder them from performing computation-intensive missions. Moreover, critical security vulnerabilities arise in data transmission among UAVs owing to the untrusted environment, open communication channels, and unreliable misbehavior tracing. To this end, this article investigates UDRNs based on blockchain and machine learning to achieve secure and efficient data transmission. Specifically, we first present a lightweight blockchain-enabled collaborative aerial-ground networking framework to safeguard data delivery under disasters, where a credit-based delegated proof-of-stake consensus protocol is further devised to enhance consensus efficiency while promoting UAVs' honest behaviors. In addition, by harnessing the idle computing power of ground vehicles (referred to as vehicular fog computing), a novel reinforcement learning-based algorithm is developed to intelligently offload UAVs' computation missions to the moving vehicles in the dynamic environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the existing approaches, in terms of consensus security, user utility, task latency, and energy consumption. Finally, future research directions in this emerging area are discussed.},

abstract={The usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in civil and military applications continues to increase due to the numerous advantages that they provide over conventional approaches. Despite the abundance of such advantages, it is imperative to investigate the performance of UAV utilization while considering their design limitations. This paper investigates the deployment of UAV swarms when each UAV carries a machine learning classification task. To avoid data exchange with ground-based processing nodes, a federated learning approach is adopted between a UAV leader and the swarm members to improve the local learning model while avoiding excessive air-to-ground and ground-to-air communications. Moreover, the proposed de-ployment framework considers the stringent energy constraints of UAVs and the problem of class imbalance, where we show that considering these design parameters significantly improves the performances of the UAV swarm in terms of classification accuracy, energy consumption and availability of UAVs when compared with several baseline algorithms.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of optimizing the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities is studied. In the studied model, the UAVs can simultaneously provide communications and illumination to service ground users. Ambient illumination increases the interference over VLC links while reducing the illumination threshold of the UAVs. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the illumination distribution of the target area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the total transmit power while meeting the illumination and communication requirements of users. To solve this problem, an algorithm based on the machine learning framework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) is proposed. Using GRUs, the UAVs can model the longterm historical illumination distribution and predict the future illumination distribution. In order to reduce the complexity of the prediction algorithm while accurately predicting the illumination distribution, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to fit the illumination distribution of the target area at each time slot. Based on the predicted illumination distribution, the optimization problem is proved to be a convex optimization problem that can be solved by using duality. Simulations using real data from the Earth observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the proposed approach can achieve up to 22.1% reduction in transmit power compared to a conventional optimal UAV deployment that does not consider the illumination distribution. The results also show that UAVs must hover at areas having strong illumination, thus providing useful guidelines on the deployment of VLCenabled UAVs.},

abstract={With the increased deployment of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in both military and civilian fields, the authentication of the UAV surveillance and controlling data becomes critical due to the severe consequences of any forged data. With the highly dynamic operation environment, a flying UAV network may not be supported by the infrastructure network on the ground for security provision. Hence, it is vital to improving network security by utilizing on-site resources within a flying UAV swarm. In this paper, we utilize the physical-layer fingerprints to increase the difficulty for the attackers to impersonate the legitimate UAVs. A decentralized authentication scheme is proposed to avoid the single-point failure at the cluster head (CH) caused by the imperfect estimations. To mitigate the high computational cost of the decentralized authentication and to further improving the authentication accuracy, a situational-aware authentication customization algorithm is proposed at each UAV to compute the reliability of different attributes. Only the UAV with reliable attributes observations will contribute to the decentralized authentication process. Moreover, a soft authentication decision algorithm, which is compatible with customized regression models at each UAV, is proposed to further improve the system robustness. Hence, the proposed authentication algorithm can be customized at the system level and node level to maximize the overall authentication accuracy under a minimal extra computational cost based on the decentralized process. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly increased the accuracy by comparing to the other state-of-the-art machine learning-aided physical-layer authentication schemes.},

abstract={The authentication of flight data in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is highly critical because processing fake commands by the on-board flight controller can cause fatal consequences. Depending on the criticality level of the UAV mission, multi-layer authentication techniques can be useful to assure higher security levels. This paper proposes a technique for continuous authentication of flight data based on the behavior of the UAV operator, who flies the vehicle in a manual mode. In contrast to one-time authentication, this technique allows for an on-the-fly identification of malicious commands aiming at manipulating, hijacking, or crashing the UAV. The operator behavior is defined by the sequence of flight commands sent to the drone using a standard radio control transmitter. This is based on our assumption that every UAV operator has a distinctive pattern when it comes to controlling a UAV using transmitter's levers or joysticks. To verify this assumption, we captured 22,402 commands from five different operators, who flew a small multicopter UAV using a standard flight transmitter. Machine learning was applied to train a random forest classifier. The results show that the UAV operators can be identified with accuracies between 76% and 88% in a 10-tree configuration. These promising results pave the way for a comprehensive study towards implementing a real-time classifier on the UAV embedded system.},

abstract={In this paper, we study a three-dimensional (3D) spectrum sharing between device-to-device (D2D) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications. We consider that UAVs perform spatial spectrum sensing to opportunistically access the licensed channels that are occupied by the D2D communications of ground users. The objective of the considered 3D spectrum sharing networks is to maximize the area spectral efficiency (ASE) of UAV networks while guaranteeing the required minimum ASE of D2D networks. Using the tools from machine learning, we obtain the probability of spatial false alarm and the probability of spatial missed detection at the UAV, which helps us to characterize the density of active UAVs. Then, based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion, we further derive the coverage probability of D2D and UAV communications by leveraging the tools from stochastic geometry. In addition, the ASE of the D2D and UAV networks are also obtained. Simulation results show that a decrease in the spatial spectrum sensing radius of UAVs reduces the coverage probability of UAV communications but improves the ASE of UAV networks. Furthermore, the proposed tools allow obtaining the optimal spatial spectrum sensing radius of UAVs given certain network parameters.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely used in military and civil fields, and the collaborative multi-UAV network becomes increasingly popular. Cognitive radio (CR) is a feasible way to solve the problem that there is no authorized frequency band for UAV communication. However, the sensing performance of traditional algorithm based on a single artificial design feature is poor in the complex electromagnetic environment including low SNR, high noise-uncertainty, etc., which can not meet the requirement of the cognitive multi-UAV network. Spectrum sensing algorithms based on machine learning can obtain better performance and higher spectral efficiency (SE) by learning the potential feature and rules. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is widely accepted as naturally suitable for processing time series because of its structural characteristics. But the complexity of the algorithm based on LSTM is high due to its redundant structure, which is unsuitable for UAVs as the energy of UAV is always limited. In this paper, we propose a spectrum sensing algorithm based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU). We prove by theoretical derivation and simulation experiments separately that it can not only consume about 1/4 less energy for computation but also achieve slightly better sensing performance compare to the LSTM-based algorithm, which is meaningful. As cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) can obtain better performance and is suitable for multi-UAV scenarios, we combine the proposed algorithm with a collaborative model which can improve system stability and reach a longer working time than the traditional collaboration model. In general, we propose a high-efficiency CSS scheme based on GRU for a multi-UAV network, which has higher sensing performance, less implementation complexity, and we verify it by theory or simulation.},

abstract={Due to the advanced capabilities of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components such as vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs) and smart devices as well as the increasing amount of data generated, Federated Learning (FL) becomes a promising tool given that it enables privacy-preserving machine learning that can be implemented in the IoV. However, the performance of the FL suffers from the failure of communication links and missing nodes, especially when continuous exchanges of model parameters are required. Therefore, we propose the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the communications between the IoV components and the FL server and thus improving the accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources to provide services for all iterations of the FL process. In this paper, we present a joint auction-coalition formation framework to solve the allocation of UAV coalitions to groups of IoV components. Specifically, the coalition formation game is formulated to maximize the sum of individual profits of the UAVs. The joint auction-coalition formation algorithm is proposed to achieve a stable partition of UAV coalitions in which an auction scheme is applied to solve the allocation of UAV coalitions. The auction scheme is designed to take into account the preferences of IoV components over heterogeneous UAVs. The simulation results show that the grand coalition, where all UAVs join a single coalition, is not always stable due to the profit-maximizing behavior of the UAVs. In addition, we show that as the cooperation cost of the UAVs increases, the UAVs prefer to support the IoV components independently and not to form any coalition.},

abstract={The massive growth of Smart City and Internet of Things applications enables safety and security. The data those are produced from surveillance cameras in aerial devices such as unmanned aerial networks (UAVs) are needed to be transferred to ground stations for secure data analysis. When the scale of network is relatively large compare to the wireless communication coverage of device, it is not always available to transmit the data to the ground stations, thus distributed and autonomous algorithms are essentially desired. Based on the needs, we propose a novel algorithm that is for collecting surveillance data under the consideration of mobility and flexibility of UAV networks. Due to the battery limitation in UAVs, we selectively collect data from the UAVs by setting rules under the consideration of distance and similarity. As a sequence, the UAV devices have to compete for a chance to get data processing. For this purpose, this paper designs a Myerson auction-based deep learning algorithm to leverage the UAV’s revenue compare to traditional second-price auction while preserving truthfulness. Based on simulation results, we verify that our proposed algorithm achieves desired performance improvements.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently attracted significant attention due to their outstanding ability to be used in different sectors and serve in difficult and dangerous areas. Moreover, the advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence have increased the use of UAVs in various applications and solutions, such as forest fires detection and borders monitoring. However, using deep neural networks (DNNs) with UAVs introduces several challenges of processing deeper networks and complex models, which restricts their on-board computation. In this work, we present a strategy aiming at distributing inference requests to a swarm of resource-constrained UAVs that classifies captured images on-board and finds the minimum decision-making latency. We formulate the model as an optimization problem that minimizes the latency between acquiring images and making the final decisions. The formulated optimization solution is an NP-hard problem. Hence it is not adequate for online resource allocation. Therefore, we introduce an online heuristic solution, namely DistInference, to find the layers placement strategy that gives the best latency among the available UAVs. The proposed approach is general enough to be used for different low decision-latency applications as well as for all CNN types organized into pipeline of layers (e.g., VGG) or based on residual blocks (e.g., ResNet).},

abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models are increasingly deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT), paving the evolution of the IoT into the AI of things (AIoT). Currently, the predominant approach for AI model training is cloud-centric and involves the sharing of data with external parties. To preserve privacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed IoT devices, the machine learning paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed. The future FL network is envisioned to involve up to millions of distributed IoT devices involved in collaborative learning. However, communication failures and dropouts by nodes can lead to inefficient FL. Inspired by the UAV-assisted communications in 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNet), we propose the UAV-assisted FL in this article. The FL model owner may employ UAVs to provide the intermediate model aggregation in the sky and mobile relay of the updated model parameters from data owners to the model owner. This therefore increases the reach of FL to data owners that face uncertain network conditions and improves the communication efficiency. To incentivize the UAV service providers, we adopt the multi-dimensional contract incentive design as a case study. The incentive compatibility of the contract ensures that the UAVs only choose an incentive package corresponding to its type, for example, traveling cost. The simulation results show that the UAV-assisted FL achieves significant improvement in communication efficiency and validates the incentive compatibility of our contract design.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of data routing in flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) composed of multiple flying nodes, i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), supported by communication platforms. The objective is to exploit the mobility of UAVs in order to establish routing paths and transfer a message between two ground nodes at minimum transmission time. Assuming that the UAVs are already deployed to execute a given primary task, the cooperation of the UAVs in the data transfer process, considered as a secondary task, becomes subject to three conditions. First, the energy consumed by each UAV has to respect the allocated budget for the data routing process. Second, the UAVs cannot move out of the boundaries of a tolerated and well-defined region in order to maintain the operation of the primary task. Finally, the UAVs need to reduce their traveled distances in order to reduce the delay of the transfer. A mixed non-linear integer programming problem determining the routing path and the new locations of the UAVs participating in the data transfer process is formulated. Due to its nonconvexity, we proceed with a deterministic exploratory strategy inspired from the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm to meet the problem goals. Selected numerical results investigate the performance of the proposed solution for different scenarios and compare some of them to those of a metaheuristic approach based on swarm intelligence.},

abstract={Real-time trajectory prediction is the guarantee for effective control of quadrotor drones. In this paper, based on the deep learning method, a position distribution prediction algorithm of quadrotor drones based on gated recurrent neural network quantile regression (QRGRU) is proposed. On the basis of GRU, QRGRU improves the loss function. The trajectory data is used for training and predicting, including nine variables: latitude, longitude, altitude, speed in the x direction, speed in the y direction, vertical speed, heading angle, pitch angle, and roll angle. QRGRU can master the inherent laws of quadrotor UAV flight by training and learning the historical trajectory of quadrotor UAV. The results show that QRGRU effectively predicts the position distribution of quadrotor UAV. Compared with other methods, QRGRU improves the prediction accuracy, model reliability and sensitivity, shortens the prediction time, and has a good effect on multi-step prediction. The model provides conditions and more time for taking control measures in time.},

abstract={Presently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a broad spectrum of applications, in which regular monitoring of critical infrastructure assets is an important risk mitigation usage. This paper presents a novel approach for modeling leakage from natural gas pipelines using machine learning algorithms operating on the gas leakage detection (Methane) data collected using an UAV having a gas sensor and a light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) payload. The detection system has a lightweight design along with a small form factor to ensure compatibility with most autonomous mobile platforms like UAVs or wheeled robots. Two experiments were conducted to collect the gas leakage detection data at various loitering heights in real atmospheric conditions before applying the estimation algorithms. The first experiment measured natural gas leakage data in varying loitering radiuses and altitudes for leakage pressures around one pound per square inch (PSI), while the second experiment did the same for leakage pressures around two PSI. Real atmospheric conditions were incorporated along with additional aspects of propeller down-wash and environmental air movements that can influence leakage detection. Two estimation algorithms, viz., reduced support vector machine (RSVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were applied to the leakage data collected from the UAV experiments. It was found that the ANN approach resulted in more faster and accurate detection than RSVM that heavily depended on the kernel function for its performance. The efficacy of leakage detection of natural gas using a UAV payload was demonstrated, which is a faster and cost-effective alternative to the manual inspection process.},

abstract={Due to the flexible mobility and agility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be deployed as aerial base stations (BSs) in future air-ground integrated wireless networks, providing temporary and controllable coverage and additional computation capabilities for ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices with or without infrastructure support. Meanwhile, with the breakthrough of artificial intelligence (AI), more and more AI applications relying on AI methods such as deep neural networks (DNNs) are expected to be applied in various fields such as smart homes, smart factories and smart cities to improve our lifestyles and efficiency dramatically. However, AI applications are generally computation-intensive, latency-sensitive, and energy-consuming, making resource-constrained IoT devices unable to benefit from AI anytime and anywhere. In this paper, we study mobile edge computing (MEC) for AI applications in air-ground integrated wireless networks. Our goal is to minimize the service latency while ensuring the learning accuracy requirements and energy consumption. To achieve that, we take DNN as the typical AI application and formulate an optimization problem that optimizes the DNN model decision, computation and communication resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control, subject to the energy consumption, latency, computation and communication resource constraints. Considering the formulated problem is non-convex, we decompose it into multiple convex subproblems and then alternately solve them till they converge to the desired solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the system performance for AI applications.},

number={},
pages={732-743},
abstract={Most safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms depend on the accurate reward that is rarely available in wireless security applications and suffer from severe performance degradation for the learning agents that have to choose the policy from a large action set. In this paper, we propose a safe RL algorithm, which uses a policy priority-based hierarchical structure to divide each policy into sub-policies with different selection priorities and thus compresses the action set. By applying inter-agent transfer learning to initialize the learning parameters, this algorithm accelerates the initial exploration of the optimal policy. Based on a security criterion that evaluates the risk value, the sub-policy distribution formulation avoids the dangerous sub-policies that cause learning failure such as severe network security problems in wireless security applications, e.g., Internet services interruption. We also propose a deep safe RL and design four deep neural networks in each sub-policy selection to further improve the learning efficiency for the learning agents that support four convolutional neural networks (CNNs): The Q-network evaluates the long-term expected reward of each sub-policy under the current state, and the E-network evaluates the long-term risk value. The target Q and E-networks update the learning parameters of the corresponding CNN to improve the policy exploration stability. As a case study, our proposed safe RL algorithms are implemented in the anti-jamming communication of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to select the frequency channel and transmit power to the ground node. Experimental results show that our proposed schemes significantly improve the UAV communication performance, save the UAV energy and increase the reward compared with the benchmark against jamming.},

abstract={Use of unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has gained significant importance in the recent years because of their ability to remotely monitor and perform various tasks in an autonomous manner. However, the control unit of such UAVs fails to adapt quickly when the UAVs are exposed to unpredictable and violent external disturbances such as violent wind gusts and extreme weather conditions. The cost of such adaptation failures can be extremely high and therefore, in order to use any crash preventing strategy, it is imperative to design and use intelligent tools for the early detection of such failures. In this paper we present a machine learning based autonomous tool - AWG-Detector - that detects Anomalies due to Wind Gusts (AWG), in our adaptive Altitude control unit of an Aerosonde UAV. This adaptive Altitude control unit comprises of a PI based Roll controller and a Hybrid neuro-fuzzy based Pitch controller. Experimental results show that our AWG-Detector achieves an accuracy of more than 99% in detecting anomalies due to wind gusts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that targets the detection of Wind Gust anomalies in the Altitude control unit of an Aerosonde UAV by developing a comparison of five well-known machine learning techniques.},

By jointly reducing the price, latency and energy consumption, we propose a novel optimization framework for the secure MEC network, based on the deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we firstly employ several optimization criteria, where criterion I minimizes the linear combination of price, latency and energy consumption, criterion II minimizes the price with the constrained latency and energy consumption, criterion III minimizes the latency with the constrained price and energy consumption, while criterion IV minimizes the energy consumption with the constrained price and latency. For each criterion, we then propose an optimization framework which can dynamically adjust the task offloading ratio and bandwidth allocation ratio simultaneously, where a novel feature extraction network is proposed to improve the training effect. Simulation results are finally demonstrated to verify the effective of the proposed optimization framework.},

A service provider leases resources from the InP to serve the mobile users (MUs) with sporadic computation requests. Due to the limited number of channels and the finite shared I/O resource of the UAV, the MUs compete to schedule local and remote task computations in accordance with the observations of system dynamics. The aim of each MU is to selfishly maximize the expected long-term computation performance. We formulate the non-cooperative interactions among the MUs as a stochastic game. To approach the Nash equilibrium solutions, we propose a novel online deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme, which enables each MU to behave using its local conjectures only. The DRL scheme employs two separate deep Q-networks to approximate the Q-factor and the post-decision Q-factor for each MU. Numerical experiments show the potentials of the online DRL scheme in balancing the tradeoff between AoI and energy consumption.},

One unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacker exists in the system and it can listen to the confidential data transmission from the users to the CAP. We optimize the system design of the intelligent MEC network, by adaptively allocating the offloading ratio and wireless bandwidth, to reduce the linearly weighted cost of the latency as well as energy consumption (EnC). Specifically, starting from the deep reinforcement learning, we devise a deep Q-network (DQN) network to adjust the offloading ratio and transmission bandwidth, which can help calculate the computational tasks and suppress the eavesdropping from the UAV efficiently. We finally provide some simulation results to validate the proposed offloading strategy. In particular, the proposed offloading strategy can achieve a much lower cost compared to the conventional ones, in the terms of latency and EnC.},

In this article we propose a method based on deep reinforcement learning that only requires low-resolution images coming from a down looking camera in order to drive the vehicle. The proposed approach is based on a hierarchy of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) that are used as high-end control policy for the navigation in different phases. We implemented various technical solutions, such as the combination of vanilla and double DQNs trained using a form of prioritized buffer replay that separates experiences in multiple containers. The optimal control policy is learned without any human supervision, providing the agent with a sparse reward feedback indicating the success or failure of the landing. The results show that the quadrotor can autonomously land on a large variety of simulated environments and with relevant noise, proving that the underline DQNs are able to generalise effectively on unseen scenarios. Furthermore, it was proved that in some conditions the network outperformed human pilots.},

abstract={This paper studies the path design problem for cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which aims to minimize its mission completion time while maintaining good connectivity with the cellular network. We first argue that the conventional path design approach via formulating and solving optimization problems faces several practical challenges, and then propose a new reinforcement learning-based UAV path design algorithm by applying temporal-difference method to directly learn the state-value function of the corresponding Markov Decision Process. The proposed algorithm is further extended by using linear function approximation with tile coding to deal with large state space. The proposed algorithms only require the raw measured or simulation-generated signal samples as the input and are suitable for both online and offline implementations. Numerical results show that the proposed path designs can successfully avoid the coverage holes of cellular networks even in the complex urban environment.},

abstract={This paper investigates the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided air-to-ground uplink cellular network with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A major novelty of the proposed framework is that it introduces the new paradigm of flexibility on efficient spectrum sharing between aerial and ground cellular users by taking advantage of the aerial users’ high mobility, reconfigurable wireless environment as well as power-domain multi-user access. With the aim of maximizing network sum rate while guaranteeing users’ quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, a joint problem of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and RIS configuration design is formulated. The formulated problem is a sequential decision making one across multiple coherent time slots. Moreover, considering ground users’ random movement in practice, the decision making process involves uncertainties. To solve the formulated problem efficiently, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted to intelligently adjust the UAV’s trajectory and RIS configuration simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate that the network sum rate is significantly improved with the proposed NOMARIS scheme compared to conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) communication and the case where no RIS is deployed.},

abstract={This work presents a three-dimensional control algorithm using reinforcement learning to guide an attacking hunter drone capable of performing a global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) repeater attack on the GNSS receiver of a target invader drone. Considering the mission and movement requirements of the hunter drone, a Q-learning algorithm was developed, for which the table with the possible transitions of the states and actions is obtained by the actions that the vehicle can take considering directions and the respective consequences of each action. The learning capability of the proposed algorithm arises from the trial and error by an agent. The penalty calculation is based on the error of the invader position to the hunter's desired position of the attacked drone. The developed algorithm is tested using a software-in-the-loop (SITL) implementation, which is based on the Ardupilot platform. SITL simulations are performed in a developed testbed to emulate operational scenarios, where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is hijacked and then controlled by an attacking UAV until it reaches the final position desired by the hunter, usually a secure area where the vehicle can be captured without being destroyed. Results, including error metrics and action time, are discussed for different mission scenarios.},

abstract={The problem of balancing an inverted pendulum on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been achieved using linear and nonlinear control approaches. However, to the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been solved using learning methods. On the other hand, the classical inverted pendulum is a common benchmark problem to evaluate learning techniques. In this paper we demonstrate a novel solution to the inverted pendulum problem extended to UAVs, specifically quadrotors. This complex system is underactuated and sensitive to small acceleration changes of the quadrotor. The solution is provided by reinforcement learning (RL), a platform commonly applied to solve nonlinear control problems. We generate a control policy to balance the pendulum using Continuous Action Fitted Value Iteration (CAFVI) [1] which is a RL algorithm for high-dimensional input-spaces. This technique combines learning of both state and state-action value functions in an approximate value iteration setting with continuous inputs. Simulations verify the performance of the generated control policy for varying initial conditions. The results show the control policy is computationally fast enough to be appropriate of real-time control.},

We construct the physical model and air-ground link model to formulate an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the total channel capacity of the network. To address this non-convex problem, we proposed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (MADRL) based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to optimize the trajectory design and bandwidth assignment dynamically.

Considering the overlong solving time of the formulated problem and the sensitive delay requirements of vehicular applications, we transform the optimization problem using reinforcement learning and then design a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based solution. Through training the DDPG-based resource management model offline, optimal vehicle association and resource allocation decisions can be obtained rapidly. Simulation results demonstrate that the DDPG-based resource management scheme can converge within 200 episodes and achieve higher delay/quality-of-service satisfaction ratios than the random scheme.},

abstract={With rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, social network (SN) can use AI to extract useful knowledge of users to improve the quality of peoples lives. Although AI has achieved a very big breakthrough, it also faces many challenges for collecting data, such as larger data redundancy and higher energy consumption. To conquer those problems, a matrix completion-based Sampling Points Selection joint Intelligent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs) Trajectory Optimization (SPS-IUTO) scheme for data acquisition is proposed. In terms of space, for one column, the probability that a sample point is selected is inversely proportional to the number of sample points selected by all previous rows. In terms of time, the first step is that sampling points with higher degree are selected as dominator sampling points in each row and column. The second step is that sampling points with lower degree are selected as virtual dominator sampling points. The movement trajectory of the UAV is optimized using the proposed algorithm. As is shown in the experimental results, the proposed scheme can achieve significant improvement in terms of energy and redundant data.},

abstract={Interconnected everyday objects, either via public or private networks, are gradually becoming reality in modern life — often referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) or Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). One stand-out example are those systems based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Fleets of such vehicles (drones) are prophesied to assume multiple roles from mundane to high-sensitive applications, such as prompt pizza or shopping deliveries to the home, or to deployment on battlefields for battlefield and combat missions. Drones, which we refer to as UAVs in this paper, can operate either individually (solo missions) or as part of a fleet (group missions), with and without constant connection with a base station. The base station acts as the command centre to manage the drones' activities; however, an independent, localised and effective fleet control is necessary, potentially based on swarm intelligence, for several reasons: 1) an increase in the number of drone fleets; 2) fleet size might reach tens of UAVs; 3) making time-critical decisions by such fleets in the wild; 4) potential communication congestion and latency; and 5) in some cases, working in challenging terrains that hinders or mandates limited communication with a control centre, e.g. operations spanning long period of times or military usage of fleets in enemy territory. This self-aware, mission-focused and independent fleet of drones may utilise swarm intelligence for a), air-traffic or flight control management, b) obstacle avoidance, c) self-preservation (while maintaining the mission criteria), d) autonomous collaboration with other fleets in the wild, and e) assuring the security, privacy and safety of physical (drones itself) and virtual (data, software) assets. In this paper, we investigate the challenges faced by fleet of drones and propose a potential course of action on how to overcome them.},

abstract={The ocean is classified into several territorial regimes that span from internal waters, archipelagic waters, territorial seas, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and high seas. The relevant state authorities must perform surveillance of all ships that navigate through their respective territories to ensure the ship safety and prevent them from carrying out illegal activities such as illegal unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, illegal firearms smuggling, and piracy. Currently, maritime domain surveillance is carried out using a combination of Automatic Identification System (AIS), Coastal Radar System (CRS), and Long Range Camera (LRC). The massive amount of incoming data from these surveillance systems produce big maritime data. However, big maritime data is useless without artificial intelligence intervention. This research proposed an intelligent system that provides and analyzes ship path planning, identifies suspicious ships, track ships, and approaches and attacks target ships using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm. Artificial intelligence-based surveillance systems are developed in a single Integrated Coastal Marine Monitoring System, which is expected to perform quickly, precisely, and comprehensively.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to collect sensory data in remote wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Due to UAV’s maneuvering, scheduling a sensor device to transmit data can overflow data buffers of the unscheduled ground devices. Moreover, lossy airborne channels can result in packet reception errors at the scheduled sensor. This article proposes a new deep reinforcement learning-based flight resource allocation framework (DeFRA) to minimize the overall data packet loss in a continuous action space. DeFRA is based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), optimally controls instantaneous headings and speeds of the UAV, and selects the ground device for data collection. Furthermore, a state characterization layer, leveraging long short-term memory (LSTM), is developed to predict network dynamics, resulting from time-varying airborne channels and energy arrivals at the ground devices. To validate the effectiveness of DeFRA, experimental data collected from a real-world UAV testbed and energy harvesting WSN are utilized to train the actions of the UAV. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DeFRA achieves a fast convergence while reducing the packet loss by over 15%, as compared to the existing deep reinforcement learning solutions.},

One of the most promising frameworks for such a purpose is reinforcement learning. In this paper, a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, TEXPLORE, is developed as a high level control method for autonomous navigation of UAVs. The developed approach has been extensively tested with a quadcopter UAV in ROS-Gazebo environment. The experimental results show that our method is able to learn an efficient trajectory in a few iterations and perform actions in real-time. Moreover, we show that our approach significantly outperforms Q-learning based method.

abstract={The control of complex autonomous systems has significantly improved in recent years and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular in the research community. Although the use of UAVs is increasing, much work remains to guarantee fault- tolerant control (FTC) properties of these vehicles. Model-based controllers are the standard way to control UAVs, however obtaining models of the system and environment for every possible operating condition a UAV can experience in a real-world scenario is not feasible. Reinforcement Learning has shown promise in controlling complex systems but requires training in a simulator (requiring a model) of the system. Further, stability guarantees do not exist for learning-based controllers, which limits their large scale application in the real-world. We propose a novel hybrid FTC approach that uses a learned supervisory controller (together with low-level PID controllers) with key stability guarantees. We use a robust reinforcement learning approach to learn the supervisory control parameters and prove stability. We empirically validate our framework using trajectory-following experiments (in simulation) for a quadcopter subject to rotor faults, wind disturbances, and severe position and attitude noise.},

abstract={This work presents a semantic-aware path-planning pipeline for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using deep reinforcement learning for vision-based navigation in challenging environments. Driven by the maturity of works in semantic segmentation, the proposed path-planning architecture uses reinforcement learning to distinguish the parts of the scene that are perceptually more informative using semantic cues, in effect guiding more robust, repeatable, and accurate navigation of the UAV to the predefined goal destination. Assuming that the UAV performs vision-based state estimation, such as keyframe-based visual odometry, and semantic segmentation onboard, the proposed deep policy network continuously evaluates the optimal relative perceptual informativeness of each semantic class in view. A perception-aware path planner uses these informativeness values to perform trajectory optimization in order to generate the next best action with respect to the current state and the perception quality of the surroundings, essentially guiding the UAV to avoid flying over perceptually degraded regions. Thanks to the use of semantic cues, the policy can be trained in a large number of non-photorealistic randomly-generated scenes, and results to an architecture that is generalizable to environments with the same semantic classes, independently of their visual appearance. Extensive evaluations on challenging, photorealistic simulations reveal a remarkable improvement in robustness and success rate with the proposed approach over the state of the art in active perception.

We present an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework that controls UAV trajectory through a set of desired waypoints. A deep neural network is constructed to learn the optimal tracking policy and reinforcement learning is developed to optimize the resulting tracking scheme. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can achieve 58.14% less position error, 21.77% less system power consumption and 9.23% faster attainment than the baseline. The actor network consists of only linear operations, hence Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) based hardware acceleration can easily be designed for energy efficient real-time control.},

To deal with large state space sizes, we use function approximation to achieve faster convergence. The results show how the UAV can successfully carry out the task in a realistic urban SaR scenario. However, common approaches limit their work to target search. In practice, searching for mobile targets is not enough as their position may change before the rescue team arrives for evacuation. To address this, we uniquely combine YOLO with Optical flow to allow the UAV to track and follow the target victim. Extensive simulations demonstrate its application in SaR missions.},

The training process is outlined and key factors for its progression rate are considered, with the most important factor found to be limiting the number of variables in the observation vector, and including values for several previous time steps for these variables. The trained reinforcement learning (RL) controller is compared to a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, and is found to converge in more cases than the PID controller, with comparable performance. Furthermore, the RL controller is shown to generalize well to unseen disturbances in the form of wind and turbulence, even in severe disturbance conditions.},

abstract={This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based motion control method to provide unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with additional flexibility while flying across dynamic unknown environments autonomously. This method is applicable in both military and civilian fields such as penetration and rescue. The autonomous motion control problem is addressed through motion planning, action interpretation, trajectory tracking, and vehicle movement within the DRL framework. Novel DRL algorithms are presented by combining two difference-amplifying approaches with traditional DRL methods and are used for solving the motion planning problem. An improved Lyapunov guidance vector field (LGVF) method is used to handle the trajectory-tracking problem and provide guidance control commands for the UAV. In contrast to conventional motion-control approaches, the proposed methods directly map the sensorbased detections and measurements into control signals for the inner loop of the UAV, i.e., an end-to-end control. The training experiment results show that the novel DRL algorithms provide more than a 20% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art DRL algorithms. The testing experiment results demonstrate that the controller based on the novel DRL and LGVF, which is only trained once in a static environment, enables the UAV to fly autonomously in various dynamic unknown environments. Thus, the proposed technique provides strong flexibility for the controller.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have demonstrated their application value in many fields. With the rapidly interest in UAV technology, the body of research on autonomous route planning has enjoyed an accelerating rate of novel proposals and developments. Traditional roadmap-based global route planning algorithms and the local route planning algorithms easily trapped in local optimum are difficult to apply in unknown and complex environments. The reinforcement learning algorithm that perceives information through trial-and-error learning provides a new direction for the route planning of UAV. In this paper, a novel route planning algorithm based on improved Q-learning is proposed for UAV in an unknown environment. The prior knowledge is used to guide the UAV to select the action, and a new convergence method based on single state-action value difference is proposed to speed up the convergence rate. Finally, the simulation experiment results show that the proposed method is more effective than the original method, and the algorithm is feasible and effective for UAV route planning.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the emerging vital components of millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless systems. Accurate beam alignment is essential for efficient beam based mmWave communications of UAVs with base stations (BSs). Conventional beam sweeping approaches often have large overhead due to the high mobility and autonomous operation of UAVs. Learning-based approaches greatly reduce the overhead by leveraging UAV data, like position to identify optimal beam directions. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for UAV-BS beam alignment using deep Q-Network (DQN) in a mmWave setting. We consider uplink communications where the UAV hovers around 5G new radio (NR) BS coverage area, with varying channel conditions. The proposed learning framework uses the location information to maximize data rate through the optimal beam-pairs efficiently, upon every communication request from UAV inside the multi-location environment. We compare our proposed framework against Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) learning-based approach and the traditional exhaustive approach, respectively and also analyse the training performance of DQN-based beam alignment over different coverage area requirements and channel conditions. Our results show that the proposed DQN-based beam alignment converge faster and generic for different environmental conditions. The framework can also learn optimal beam alignment comparable to the exhaustive approach in an online manner under real-time conditions.},

abstract={To mitigate the long-term spectrum crunch problem, the FCC recently opened up the 6 GHz frequency band for unlicensed use. However, the existing spectrum sharing strategies cannot support the operation of access points in moving vehicles such as cars and UAVs. This is primarily because of the directionality-based spectrum sharing among the incumbent systems in this band and the high mobility of the moving vehicles, which together make it challenging to control the cross-system interference. In this paper we propose SwarmShare, a mobility-resilient spectrum sharing framework for swarm UAV networking in the 6 GHz band. We first present a mathematical formulation of the SwarmShare problem, where the objective is to maximize the spectral efficiency of the UAV network by jointly controlling the flight and transmission power of the UAVs and their association with the ground users, under the interference constraints of the incumbent system. We find that there are no closed-form mathematical models that can be used characterize the statistical behaviors of the aggregate interference from the UAVs to the incumbent system. Then we propose a data-driven three-phase spectrum sharing approach, including Initial Power Enforcement, Offline-dataset Guided Online Power Adaptation, and Reinforcement Learning-based UAV Optimization. We validate the effectiveness of SwarmShare through an extensive simulation campaign. Results indicate that, based on SwarmShare, the aggregate interference from the UAVs to the incumbent system can be effectively controlled below the target level without requiring the real-time cross-system channel state information. The mobility resilience of SwarmShare is also validated in coexisting networks with no precise UAV location information.},

abstract={In next-generation wireless networks, high-mobility unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are promising to provide content coverage, where users can receive sufficient requested content within a given time. However, trajectory planning for multiple UAVs to provide content coverage is challenging since 1) UAVs cannot provide content coverage for all users due to the limited energy and caching storage, and 2) the trajectory planning of UAV is coupled with each other. Moreover, the complete information based trajectory planning methods are unusable since UAVs cannot obtain prior information on the rapidly changing environment. In this paper, we investigate the multi-UAV trajectory planning for energy-efficient content coverage. We first formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem considering recharging scheduling, which aims to reduce the total length of trajectories of UAVs under the quality of service (QoS) constraints. To settle environment uncertainty, the trajectory planning problem is modeled as two coupled multi-agent stochastic games, whose equilibrium constitute the optimal trajectory. To obtain the equilibrium, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm, which can decouple the two games. We prove that the proposed algorithm can converge to the optimal solution of the Bellman equation with a higher rate compared to the centralized one. Moreover, simulation results show that the energy efficiency of the proposed algorithm is smaller than 5% compared the optimal, which is obtained with the prior information of environments.},
