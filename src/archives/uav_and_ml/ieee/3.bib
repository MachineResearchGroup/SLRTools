abstract={Real-time continuous workload assessment is important for researchers and developers of tools that aim to reduce human operators' cognitive workload, especially in dynamic environments, as the military environment, where task demands and workload change rapidly. Most workload measurement techniques provide a single retrospective value or require expensive high-end sensing equipment. This study aimed to introduce an affordable continuous machine learning (ML) based workload assessment tool, that can provide real-time workload scores. Using experienced military unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators in a simulated operational setting, muscle behavior represented by their interaction with a joystick was modeled to predict Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) scores. Data were obtained from six professional participants. Four machine learning (ML) modeling methodologies were tested on each participant's data. It has been shown that after running an ML setup phase for each participant, an already in use available tool as the UAV joystick controller can be used to predict SWAT scores at any given time. By implementing the approach presented in this study, researchers can more accurately evaluate various aspects of the human operator's cognitive workload, and developers can evaluate the progression of their solutions on operators' cognitive workload over time.},

abstract={During the last decade, the adoption of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for wireless networks has been rapidly growing for both civilian and military applications, due to their flexibility and mobility. In this paper, we consider their use as an aerial base station, then investigate the task of automatic signal recognition (ASR) through a deep learning (DL) approach, while considering spectrally efficient filtered multicarrier waveforms, including UFMC, F-OFDM, FBMC and GFDM compared to the legacy OFDM. This study has been done through series of simulations; in each one, different filter sizes, number of filters and number of convolutional layers have been applied. The best performance, with an overall accuracy of 0.93 at 2 dB signal to noise ratio (SNR), has been obtained when using smaller networks, with smaller filter sizes and higher number of filters.},

abstract={Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a method of data collection by recruiting mobile devices to accomplish various sensing tasks. The mobility and intelligence of mobile devices enable an efficient solution to large-scale sensing, e.g., smart city. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as mobile devices, can be used in MCS to perform many sensing tasks (e.g., monitoring). In addition, UAVs provide new business opportunities (e.g., package delivery) with its rapid increasing number. We aim to leverage the package delivery activities of UAVs to solve the task allocation problem of MCS. In the package delivery activities, UAVs must deliver the assigned packages to their destinations. During the package delivery, UAVs travel around to perform sensing tasks with time windows. In this case, the task allocation problem of MCS is considered as a trajectory design problem of UAVs. To plan the trajectories of UAVs, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach, specifically, double deep Q-network with prioritized experience replay (DDQN-PER). Finally, the results of our numerical simulations show that our proposed solution outperforms two baseline solutions in terms of profit and number of completed tasks.},

abstract={As a typical scenario in future generation communication network applications, UAV-assisted communication can perform autonomous data delivery for massive machine type communication (mMTC), where the data generated from Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be carried and delivered to the corresponding locations with no direct communication channels to the IoT devices. Wireless energy transfer technique can recharge the UAV when the system is in operation, assisting the UAV to continuously collect and deliver data. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) model to describe the energy and data transfer optimization problem for the UAV. To maximize the long-term utility of the UAV, the MDP model is solved by value iteration algorithm to obtain the optimal strategies of the UAV to collect data, deliver data, and receive transferred energy to replenish on-device battery energy storage. Furthermore, to tackle the issues of system state uncertainties, partially observable states, and large state space in UAV-assisted communication systems, we extend the MDP model and solve it by using a Q -learning and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) schemes. Simulations and numerical results validate that, compared with baseline schemes, the proposed MDP model with DRL based scheme can achieve better wireless energy and data transfer strategies in terms of the higher long-term utility of the UAV.},

abstract={Air ground integrated mobile cloud computing (MCC) provides unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) the capability to act as an aerial relay with more flexibility and resilience. In the cloud computing architecture, the data generated by ground users (GUs) can be offloaded to the remote server for fast processing. However, the heterogeneity of mobile tasks makes the data size distributed among GUs unbalanced. Besides, the energy efficiency of UAVs movement should be carefully considered for sustainable flight and obstacle avoidance. In general, such a joint trajectory issue can hardly be formulated as a convex optimization in unpredictable and dynamic environments. This paper proposes a potential game combined multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach to optimize multiple UAVs' trajectory with the consideration of GUs' offloading delay, energy efficiency as well as obstacle avoidance system. In specific, we first model the issue as a mixed integer non-linear problem (MINP), in which the service assignment between multi-user and multi-UAV is solved by potential game. The convergence to a Nash Equilibrium (NE) can be achieved by distributive service assignment update with infinite iteration. Then, we optimize the trajectory with obstacle avoidance at each UAV by MADDPG approach, which has a great advantage of centralized-training and decentralized-execution to reduce the global synchronized communication overhead. UAVs movement can be optimized in continuity rather than other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches generating discrete simple actions. Experiments demonstrate the proposed game-combined learning algorithm can minimize the offloading delay, enhance UAVs’ energy efficiency and avoid the obstacles at the same time.},

abstract={As the number of cases where human life and property are threatened by illegal use of UAV is rapidly increasing, a technology for detecting illegal UAV using deep learning algorithm is being researched. In order for the deep learning algorithm to work, an appropriate UAV object image size and quality are required. Unfortunately, in detecting a small UAV using a camera sensor, when the object image of the camera becomes small, the detection distance of the UAV is reduced due to the difficulty of detecting the UAV. Therefore, a large number of cameras are required to expand the detection distance. This paper suggests the methodology for configuring UAV surveillance area for image acquisition in terms of reducing the required number of cameras. Four methods for constructing the UAV surveillance area considering the optical limitations of the camera are proposed, and compared the proposed methods using a simple thin lens camera model.},

abstract={There have been a significant number of recent studies on autonomous landing in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Early studies employed a global positioning system (GPS) receivers for this purpose. However, because GPS signals cannot be used in certain urban environments, prior studies used vision-based marker detection. To accurately detect a marker, a high-resolution camera on a drone must obtain a high-quality image. This can not only be expensive but also increases the weight of the drone. In general, drones are only equipped with a frontal-viewing and fixed angle camera, and an additional downward-viewing camera becomes necessary for drone landing. Therefore, expensive and weighted high-resolution cameras are not feasible for use on drones. Nevertheless, most previous studies on vision-based drone landing use high-resolution images. To address such limitations, we propose a new method of drone landing using deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction and marker detection on an image captured by a cost-effective and low-resolution visible light camera. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits higher performance than the existing methods in terms of super-resolution reconstruction and marker detection.},

The artificial landmarks were constructed based on QR codes which stored a unique text string that refer to an absolute coordinate of the indoor environment. Machine learning approaches were applied to provide the system with the ability to detect the landmark through the vision streamed by the aircraft.

abstract={Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has been widely used as a cost-efcient way to collect data for smart cities, which typically starts with participant recruitment and task allocation. Previous work mainly focused on selecting a proper subset of humans for contributing sensing data. However, there often exist situations where humans are not able to reach the target areas, such as traffic jams or accidents. One solution is to complement manual data collection with autonomous data collection using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors. In this paper, we focus on the scenarios of UAV-assisted MCS and propose a highly efficient task allocation method, called UMA (UAV-assisted Multi-task Allocation method) to jointly optimize the sensing coverage and data quality. The method incentivizes and guides human participants to contribute high-quality sensing data. Meanwhile, the UAVs are employed to sense data from rarely sensed points of interest, and calibrate data contributed by human participants. The method leverages emerging deep reinforcement learning techniques for directing UAVs sensing and movement actions based on the human participants locations and tasks achievement. The results well justify the efficiency of UMA in terms of coverage completed ratio, calibrating ratio, task fairness and energy efficiency, compared with the state-of-the-art.},

We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a sequential model strategy that can effectively learn the policy represented by a sequence-to-sequence neural network for the UAV’s trajectory design in an unsupervised manner. Through extensive simulations, the obtained results show that the proposed DRL method can find the UAV’s trajectory that requires much less energy consumption when compared to other baseline algorithms and achieves close-to-optimal performance. In addition, simulation results show that the trained model by our proposed DRL algorithm has an excellent generalization ability to larger problem sizes without the need to retrain the model.},

abstract={Due to commercialization of the 5G network, many base stations need to enhance a reliable communication quality. Thus, many studies have still worked to provide mobility and economic benefits to the VAVs-Base Station (VAVs-BS) on behalf of ground base stations. In this paper, we propose a system to find a location where multiple users can have an optimal service throughput by considering users' requirements in Multi-VAVs communication. Based on the Air-To-Ground Path Loss Model, the virtual communication environment is established and Airtime Fairness is applied for equitable channel usage time distribution according to user requirements. Thus, we apply a collaborative algorithm with modified K-means that can distribute users to each VAV and solve communication overload problems. In addition, the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is applied to set an optimal location with the maximum throughput. As a result, the proposed systems allow the Multi-VAVs to be in the locations with high service throughput for users with different demands.},

abstract={UAV enabled terrestrial wireless networks enables targeted user-centric service provisioning to en-richen both deep urban coverage and target various rural challenge areas. However, UAVs have to balance the energy consumption of flight with the benefits of wireless capacity delivery via a high dimensional optimisation problem. Classic reinforcement learning (RL) cannot meet this challenge and here, we propose to use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimise both aggregate and minimum service provisioning. In order to achieve a trusted autonomy, the DRL agents have to be able to explain its actions for transparent human-machine interrogation. We design a Double Dueling Deep Q-learning Neural Network (DDDQN) with Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) and fixed Q-targets to achieve stable performance and avoid over-fitting, offering performance gains over naive DQN algorithms. We then use a big data driven case study and found that UAVs battery size determines the nature of its autonomous mission, ranging from an efficient exploiter of one hotspot (100% reward gain) to a stochastic explorer of many hotspots (60-150% reward gain). Using a variety of telecom and social media data, we infer driving Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and Quality-of-Service (QoS) metrics that are in contention with UAV power and communication constraints. Our greener UAVs (30-40% energy saved) address both quantitative QoS and qualitative QoE issues. Partial interpretability in the reinforcement learning is achieved using data features extracted in the hidden layers, offering an initial step for explainable AI (XAI) connecting machine intelligence with human expertise.},

abstract={In many delay-sensitive monitoring and surveillance applications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can act as edge servers in the air to coordinate with base stations (BSs) for in-situ data collection and processing to achieve real-time situation awareness. In order to ensure the long-term freshness requirements of situation awareness, a swarm of UAVs need to fly frequently among different sensing regions. However, nonstop flying and data processing may quickly drain the batteries armed in UAVs, hence an energy-efficient algorithm for UAVs' dynamic trajectory planning as well as proper data offloading decision is highly desirable. To better model the problem, we propose a freshness function based on the concept of Age-of-Information to express the freshness of situation awareness. We adopt a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with global-local rewards to solve the established continuous online decision-making problem involving many UAVs for achieving efficient collaborative control. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve the most efficient performance compared to six other baselines, i.e., our algorithm is able to significantly reduce the energy consumption while keeping the global situation awareness at a very fresh level under the fast changing environmental dynamics.},

abstract={Today, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have become very popular in military applications, commercial applications, and academic research. Flying ad hoc network (FANET) is a new type of ad hoc network, which groups small drones into an ad hoc form. These networks have unique characteristics, including moving in a 3D space, high mobility, frequent topological changes, limited resources, low density of nodes, and so on, which impose various challenges when designing a proper and efficient routing scheme. In this paper, we present a fuzzy logic-based routing scheme for flying ad hoc networks. The proposed routing scheme has two phases: route discovery phase and route maintenance phase. In the first phase, we propose a technique for calculating the score of each node in the network to prevent the broadcast storm problem and control the flood of the control messages, which have been broadcast to discover a new route in the network. This score is calculated based on various parameters such as movement direction, residual energy of nodes, link quality, and node stability. Moreover, in the route selection process, we design a fuzzy system to select routes with more fitness, less delay, and fewer hops for data transfer. The second phase includes two steps: preventing route failure in order to detect and modify paths at the failure threshold, and reconstructing failed routes in order to recognize and quickly replace these routes. Finally, the proposed routing scheme is implemented in NS2 to evaluate its performance and determine its efficiency. The simulation results are compared with three routing methods, namely ECaD, LEPR, and AODV. These results show that the proposed routing method outperforms other routing schemes in terms of end to end delay, packet delivery rate, route stability, and energy consumption. However, it has slightly increased the routing overhead.},

abstract={In this paper, an explainable intelligence model that gives the logic behind the decisions unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) makes when it is on a predefined mission and chooses to deviate from its designated path is developed. The explainable model is on a visual platform in the format of if-then rules derived from the Sugeno-type fuzzy inference model. The model is tested using the data recorded from three different missions. In each mission, adverse weather, conditions and enemy locations are introduced at random locations along the path of the mission. There are two phases to the model development. In the first phase, the Mamdani fuzzy model is used to create rules to steer the UAV along the designated mission and the rules of engagement when it encounters weather and enemy locations along and near its chosen mission. The data are gathered as UAV traverses on each mission. In the second phase, the data gathered from these missions are used to create a reverse model using a Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system based on the subtractive clustering in the data. The model has seven inputs (time, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, heading direction, engage in attack, continue mission, and steer UAV) and two outputs (weather conditions and distance from the enemy). This model predicts the outputs regarding the weather conditions and enemy positions whenever UAV deviates from the predefined path. The model is optimized with respect to the number of rules and prediction accuracy by adjusting subtractive clustering parameters. The model is then fine-tuned with ANFIS. The final model has six rules and root mean square error value that is less than 0.05. Furthermore, to check the robustness of the model, the Gaussian random noise is added to a UAV path, and the prediction accuracy is validated.},

The problem specification consists of a set of orders (each order contains a list of items with quantity) to be delivered to customers whose locations are known, also specified are locations of warehouses and drones. The aim is to minimize the time for completing a batch of order deliveries. The problem has some of the features of the Vehicle Routing Problem (as well as the Travelling Salesman Problem), however the increased number of constraints and dynamic nature of the problem are the distinguishing features in this setting. As most versions of the problem are NP-hard we employ a heuristics based approach since such an approach would be more suitable to solve large scale instances of the problem that might be encountered by a commercial delivery service. The proposed heuristics are compared with regard to the quality of solution and computation overhead.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), due to their high mobility and the ability to cover areas of different heights and locations at relatively low cost, are increasingly used for disaster monitoring and detecting. However, developing and testing UAVs in real world is an expensive task, especially in the domain of search and rescue, most of the previous systems are developed on the basis of greedy or potential-based heuristics without neural network. On the basis of the recent development of deep neural network architecture and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), in this research we improved the probability of success rate of searching target in an unstructured environment by combining image processing algorithms and reinforcement learning methods (RL). This paper aims at the deficiency of target tracking in unstructured environment, trying to propose an algorithm of stationary target positioning of UAV based on computer vision system. Firstly, a new input source is formed by acquiring depth information image of current environment and combining segmentation image. Secondly, the DQN algorithm is used to regulate the reinforcement learning model, and the specific flight response can be independently selected by the UAV through training. This paper utilizes open-source Microsoft UAV simulator AirSim as training and test environment based with Keras a machine learning framework. The main approach investigated in this research is modifying the network of Deep Q-Network, which designs the moving target tracking experiment of UAV in simulation scene. The experimental results demonstrate that this method has better tracking effect.},

abstract={Preventing illegal eavesdropping and establishing reliable and secure wireless communication is an urgent and challenging task. This paper studies the ground-to-UAV (G2U) communication system with a malicious eavesdropper. The optimization goal of this paper is to maximize the accumulated secrecy rate of the system by optimizing the UAV trajectory and connection sequence, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with finite states and actions, and implement the double deep Q network (DDQN) algorithm to solve it. To verify the effectiveness of the scheme, experiments are carried out in a simulation environment. Simulation results and numerical analysis demonstrate that the DDQN-based scheme can optimize the trajectory of the legitimate UAV, has a faster convergence speed and better security than the nature deep Q network (DQN) algorithm, and significantly improves the communication performance of the system.},

abstract={Thanks to the inherent characteristics of flexible mobility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will inevitably be integrated into 5G/B5G cellular networks to assist remote sensing for real-time assessment and monitoring applications. Most existing UAV-assisted data collection schemes focus on optimizing energy consumption and data collection throughput, which overlook the temporal value of collected data. In this article, we employ Age of Information (AoI) as a performance metric to quantify the temporal correlation among data packets consecutively sampled by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and investigate an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for UAV-assisted IoT networks. We aim to minimize the weighted sum of expected average AoI, propulsion energy of UAV, and the transmission energy at IoT devices, by jointly optimizing the UAV flight speed, hovering locations, and bandwidth allocation for data collection. Considering the system dynamics, the optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process. To cope with the multidimensional action space, we develop a twin-delayed deep deterministic (TD3) policy gradient-based UAV trajectory planning algorithm (TD3-AUTP) by introducing the deep neural network (DNN) for feature extraction. Through simulation results, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the deep $Q$ -network and actor–critic-based algorithms in terms of achievable AoI and energy efficiency.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the three-dimensional (3D) path planning problem for cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) taking into account the impact of 3D antenna radiation patterns. The cellular-connected UAV has a mission to travel from an initial location to a destination. In this process, there is a trade-off between the flight time and the expected communication outages duration, which requires planning a suitable route to avoid the weak coverage region. However, as the existing cellular networks are primarily designed for ground coverage, the communication coverage in the sky tends to be intermittent and irregular due to the potential for severe interference and obstructions (such by buildings), which brings great challenges to 3D path planning. To address this challenge, we first construct a 3D coverage map that stores the expected outage probability over each locations. We then propose a multi-step dueling DDQN (multi-step D3QN) based algorithm to design the local optimal UAV path by leveraging the constructed coverage map. In this algorithm, the UAV acts as the agent to learn the appropriate action to complete the flight mission. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for connectivity-aware UAV path planning and the superiority of 3D path design over its 2D counterparts.},

abstract={This paper investigates joint unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning and time resource allocation for minimum throughput maximization in a multiple UAV-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN). In particular, the UAVs perform as base stations (BS) to broadcast energy signals in the downlink to charge IoT devices, while the IoT devices send their independent information in the uplink by utilizing the collected energy. The formulated throughput optimization problem which involves joint optimization of 3D path design and channel resource assignment with the constraint of flight speed of UAVs and uplink transmit power of IoT devices, is not convex and thus is extremely difficult to solve directly. We take advantage of the multi-agent deep Q learning (DQL) strategy and propose a novel algorithm to tackle this problem. Simulation results indicate that the proposed DQL-based algorithm significantly improve performance gain in terms of minimum throughput maximization compared with the conventional WPCN scheme.},

Through a learning-based strategy, we propose a general novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm to reduce disconnectivity time, handover rate, and energy consumption of UAV by taking into account its time of task completion. By formulating the problem as a function of UAV's velocity, we show how each of these performance indicators (PIs) is improved by adopting a proper range of corresponding learning parameter, e.g. 50% reduction in HO rate as compared to a blind strategy. However, results reveal that the optimal combination of the learning parameters depends critically on any specific application and the weights of PIs on the final objective function.},

abstract={The emerging backscatter communication technology is recognized as a promising solution to the battery problem of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. For example, the wireless sensor network with backscatter communication technology can monitor the environment in remote areas without battery maintenance or replacement. Unfortunately, the transmission range of backscatter communication is limited. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-UAV-aided data collection scenario where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can fly close to the backscatter sensor node (BSN) to activate it and then collects the data. We aim to minimize the total flight time of the rechargeable UAVs when the collection mission is finished. During the data collection process, the UAVs can return to the charging station to recharge itself when the energy of UAV is not sufficient to complete the mission. To reduce the complexity of the task, we first use the Gaussian mixture model clustering method to divide the BSNs into multiple clusters. Then we consider the deterministic boundary and ambiguous boundary for the UAV flying regions, respectively. For the deterministic boundary scenario, we propose a single-agent deep option learning (SADOL) algorithm, where each UAV cannot fly beyond the deterministic boundary. For the ambiguous boundary scenario, we propose a multiagent deep option learning (MADOL) algorithm to enable the UAVs to cooperatively learn the ambiguous BSNs assignment. In the simulation, we compare the proposed algorithms with multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and deep Q-network (DQN) algorithms, which proves the proposed algorithms can achieve better performance.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have unlocked numerous sensing applications, which are expected to add billions of dollars to the world economy in the next decade. To further improve the Quality-of-Service in these applications, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project has considered the use of terrestrial cellular networks to support UAV sensing services, also known as the cellular Internet of UAVs. In this paper, we consider a cellular Internet of UAVs, where the sensory data can be transmitted either to the base station via cellular links, or to the mobile devices by underlay UAV-to-Device (U2D) communications. To evaluate the freshness of the sensory data, the concept of age of information (AoI) is adopted, in which a lower AoI implies fresher data. Since UAVs' AoIs are determined by their trajectories during sensing and transmission, we investigate the AoI minimization problem for UAVs by designing their trajectories. This problem is a Markov decision problem with an infinite state-action space, and thus we utilize multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to approximate the state-action space. Then, we propose a multi-UAV trajectory design algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve a lower AoI than a greedy algorithm, policy gradient algorithm, and overlay U2D scheme.},

Numerical results show a significant improvement of our proposed schemes compared with the conventional approaches in terms of EE, flexibility, and processing time.

abstract={Over the past decades, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in both military and civilian fields. In these applications, flocking motion is a fundamental but crucial operation of multi-UAV systems. Traditional flocking motion methods usually designed for a specific environment. However, the real environment is mostly unknown and stochastic, which greatly reduces the practicality of these methods. In this paper, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to realize the flocking motion of multi-UAV systems. Considering that the sim-to-real problem restricts the application of DRL to the flocking motion scenario, a digital twin (DT) enabled DRL training framework is proposed to solve this problem. The DRL model can learn from DT and be quickly deployed on the real-world UAV with the help of DT. Under this training framework, this paper proposes an actor-critic DRL algorithm named behavior-coupling deep deterministic policy gradient (BCDDPG) for the flocking motion problem, which is inspired by the flocking behavior of animals. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of BCDDPG. Simulation results show that BCDDPG achieves a higher average reward and performs better in terms of arrival rate and collision rate compared with existing methods.},

The influences of different loss functions and thresholds are studied on the detection accuracy of YOLOv4 to improve the detection performance of YOLOv4 on UAV.

abstract={The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for wireless networks is rapidly growing as key enablers of new applications, including: surveillance and monitoring, military, delivery of medical supplies, telecommunications, etc. In particular, due to their unique proprieties such as flexibility, mobility, and adaptive altitude, UAVs can act as mobile base stations to improve capacity, coverage, and energy efficiency of wireless networks. On the other hand, UAVs can operate as mobile terminals to enable many applications such as item delivery and real-time video streaming. In such context, data-driven Deep Learning-assisted (DL) approaches are gaining a growing interest to not only exploit the huge amount of generated data, but also to optimize the network operations, and hence ensure the QoS requirements of these emerging wireless networks. However, UAVs are resource-constrained devices especially in terms of computing and power resources, and traditional DL-assisted schemes are cloud-centric, which require UAVs' data to be sent and stored in a centralized server. This represents a critical issue since it generates a huge network communication overhead to send raw data towards the centralized entity, and hence may lead to network bandwidth and energy inefficiency of UAV devices. In addition, the transferred data may contain personnel data such as UAVs' localization and identity, which can directly affect UAVs' privacy concerns. As a solution, Federated Deep Learning (FDL), or distributed DL, was introduced, where the basic idea is to keep raw data where it is generated, while sending only users' local trained DL models to the centralized entity for aggregation. Due to its privacy-preserving and low communication overhead and latency, FDL is much more adequate for many UAVs-enabled wireless applications. In this work, we provide a general introduction of FDL application for UAV-enabled wireless networks. We first introduce the FDL concept and its fundamentals. Then, we highlight the possible applications of FDL in UAVs-enabled wireless networks by addressing the suitability and how to use FDL to deal with target challenges. Finally, we discuss about key technical challenges, open issues, and future research directions on FDL-based approaches in such context.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be extensively used as an integral part in the future generations of communication networks, to provide ubiquitous connectivity. The mobile nature of UAVs make them a tempting candidate to provide seamless connectivity in environments where the installation of conventional terrestrial base stations (BS) is not feasible. Nonetheless, there are major deployment issues related to optimal placement of UAV-mounted base stations (UAV-BSs) due to limited number of UAV-BSs, limited energy availability and trade-off between coverage area and its altitude. In this paper, we address UAV-BSs placement issues by proposing a novel Machine learning (ML) based intelligent deployment mechanism. More specifically, for intelligent deployment of UAV-BSs based on energy, computational power, nature of available data and criticality of the scenario, we use two different approaches: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Learning (DL), which is composed of sequential time series learning process. Moreover, to address the security and privacy challenges emanating from the wireless connectivity and untrusted broadcast nature of UAV-BSs, we propose a Blockchain-based novel information-sharing scheme. To evaluate the performance of our combined secure and intelligent proposed approach, we have improved energy consumption by almost twice in contrast with the normal deployment of UAV-BSs.},

To solve the problem of task offloading from UAV to the closest edge computation, many proposals have appeared, mainly based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation. While these solutions successfully learn how to reduce task completion time in the UAV context, some limitations appear when these models are applied in real scenarios, given the memory-hungry nature of RL. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective formalization that still enables a learning process, but reduces the required information and the training time. Our evaluation results confirm our hypothesis, showing a marked improvement when compared to other RL-based strategies and deep learning-based solutions.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are changing the way major industries conduct business in a globally friendly and efficient manner. Along with these economic benefits come major security challenges. Gatwick Airport is one example that cost £50 million. 1000 flights were cancelled over a 36hr period in 2018. Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting is an approach for UAV detection and classification associated with longer detection distances. Classification of a UAV flight mode would provide police commanders with information to assist risk assessment. For example, intelligence operations could be associated with a UAV flying while transmitting video. In this paper we introduce RF fingerprinting using Power Spectral Density (PSD) and spectrograms. This work utilises the open DroneRF dataset, made up of signals from the Parrot Bebop, Parrot AR and DJI Phantom 3 and further broken down into flight modes including switched on; hovering; flying with and without video transmission. Signal representations for each class are treated as images and transfer learning is implemented through the extraction of features using a VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained on the ImageNet database. Machine learning classifiers Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine and Random Forest are evaluated in these experiments for 2 classes (UAV present or not), 4 classes (UAV type) and 10 classifications (UAV flight modes). We show that PSD representation has higher accuracy than the use of time domain spectrograms, producing 100% accuracy for UAV detection and 88.6% accuracy for UAV type classification with LR. For 10 classification including flight modes, LR with PSD produced 87.3% accuracy which is a 40% increase on prior work in the field by A1-Sa'd et al.. Overall an approach has been introduced using transfer learning through CNN feature extraction and machine learning classification which performs with high accuracy compared with previous work on the same DroneRF dataset.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently attracted both academia and industry representatives due to their utilization in tremendous emerging applications. Most UAV applications adopt visual line of sight (VLOS) due to ongoing regulations. There is a consensus between industry for extending UAVs’ commercial operations to cover the urban and populated area-controlled airspace beyond VLOS (BVLOS). There is ongoing regulation for enabling BVLOS UAV management. Regrettably, this comes with unavoidable challenges related to UAVs’ autonomy for detecting and avoiding static and mobile objects. An intelligent component should either be deployed onboard the UAV or at a multiaccess-edge computing (MEC) that can read the gathered data from different UAV’s sensors, process them, and then make the right decision to detect and avoid the physical collision. The sensing data should be collected using various sensors but not limited to Lidar, depth camera, video, or ultrasonic. This article proposes probabilistic and deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL)-based algorithms for avoiding collisions while saving energy consumption. The proposed algorithms can be either run on top of the UAV or at the MEC according to the UAV capacity and the task overhead. We have designed and developed our algorithms to work for any environment without a need for any prior knowledge. The proposed solutions have been evaluated in a harsh environment that consists of many UAVs moving randomly in a small area without any correlation. The obtained results demonstrated the efficiency of these solutions for avoiding the collision while saving energy consumption in familiar and unfamiliar environments.},

abstract={This paper explores the use of a UAV for power-line inspection using a Deep Learning algorithm for detection. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are versatile with the potential to revolutionize multiple business domains, with benefits being discovered both inside and outside the world of utility and energy industries. They can reduce operational costs, improve worker safety, asset reliability, and decision making, also having semiautonomous flight capability. Utility and Energy companies have successfully deployed UAVs in inspections. Power-line companies usually perform regular visual inspections to check the status of their transmission lines mainly using helicopters equipped with external gimbals housing infrared and an ultraviolet camera to detect hot spots and corona discharges. This solution is quite expensive and dangerous for the crew. To resolve this, a powerline-detection segmentation algorithm based on transfer learning and an improved mask regional convolutional neural network (Mask RCNN), Mask RCNN Powerline Detector is proposed and is deployed on an UAV. For this Draganfly XP-4 was used as the UAV platform. The power-line detection system used a Deep Learning Resnet50 architecture as the backbone network, combined with the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture for feature extraction. The Region Proposal Network (RPN) was trained end-to-end to create region proposals for each feature map. This paper will present the development of the MRPD system, integration, and testing of the UAV.},

abstract={In this paper, we design a navigation policy for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) where mobile base stations (BSs) are deployed to improve the data freshness and connectivity to the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. First, we formulate an energy-efficient trajectory optimization problem in which the objective is to maximize the energy efficiency by optimizing the UAV-BS trajectory policy. We also incorporate different contextual information such as energy and age of information (AoI) constraints to ensure the data freshness at the ground BS. Second, we propose an agile deep reinforcement learning with experience replay model to solve the formulated problem concerning the contextual constraints for the UAV-BS navigation. Moreover, the proposed approach is well-suited for solving the problem, since the state space of the problem is extremely large and finding the best trajectory policy with useful contextual features is too complex for the UAV-BSs. By applying the proposed trained model, an effective real-time trajectory policy for the UAV-BSs captures the observable network states over time. Finally, the simulation results illustrate the proposed approach is 3.6% and 3.13% more energy efficient than those of the greedy and baseline deep Q Network (DQN) approaches.},

abstract={The integration of mobile and ubiquitous computing with deep learning methods is a promising emerging trend that aims at moving the processing task closer to the data source rather than bringing the data to a central node. The advantages of this approach range from bandwidth reduction, high scalability, to high reliability, just to name a few. In this paper, we propose a real-time deep learning approach to automatically detect and count vehicles in videos taken from a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). Our solution relies on a convolutional neural network-based model fine-tuned to the specific domain of applications that is able to precisely localize instances of the vehicles using a regression approach, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates, reasoning globally about the image when making predictions and implicitly encoding contextual information. A comprehensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our approach results in state-of-the-art performances. Furthermore, our solution achieves real-time performances by running at a speed of 4 Frames Per Second on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 board, showing the potentiality of this approach for real-time processing in UAVs.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted device-to-device (D2D) communications can be deployed flexibly thanks to UAVs' agility. By exploiting the direct D2D interaction supported by UAVs, both the user experience and network performance can be substantially enhanced at public events. However, the continuous moving of D2D users, limited energy and flying time of UAVs are impediments to their applications in real-time. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel model based on deep reinforcement learning in order to find the optimal solution for the energy-harvesting time scheduling in UAV-assisted D2D communications. To make the system model more realistic, we assume that the UAV flies around a central point, the D2D users move continuously with random walk model and the channel state information encountered during each time slot is randomly time-variant. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperform the existing solutions. The associated energy efficiency game can be solved in less than one millisecond by an off-the-shelf processor using trained neural networks. Hence our deep reinforcement learning techniques are capable of solving real-time resource allocation problems in UAV-assisted wireless networks.},

abstract={Identifying tiny objects from extremely low-resolution (LR) unmanned-aerial-vehicle-based remote sensing images is generally considered as a very challenging task, because of very limited information in the object areas. In recent years, there have been very limited attempts to approach this problem. These attempts intend to deal with LR image classification by enhancing either the poor image quality or image representations. In this article, we argue that the performance improvement in LR image classification is affected by the inconsistency of the information loss and learning priority on low-frequency (LF) components and high-frequency (HF) components. To address this LF-HF inconsistency problem, we propose a dual-stream representation learning generative adversarial network (DRL-GAN). The core idea is to produce enhanced image representations optimal for LR recognition by simultaneously recovering the missing information in LF and HF components, respectively, under the guidance of high-resolution (HR) images. We evaluate the performance of DRL-GAN on the challenging task of LR image classification. A comparison of the experimental results on the LR benchmark, namely HRSC and CIFAR-10, and our newly collected `WIDER-SHIP' dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our DRL-GAN, which significantly improves the classification performance, with up to 10% gain on average.},

In the second phase, a multilabel CRF model is applied to integrate spatial correlation between adjacent tiles and the correlation between labels within the same tile, with the objective to improve iteratively the multilabel classification map associated with the considered input UAV image.

abstract={In the current unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) for sensing services, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) transmit their sensory data to terrestrial mobile devices over the unlicensed spectrum.

In this paper, we consider a cellular Internet of UAVs to guarantee the Quality-of-Service (QoS), where the sensory data can be transmitted to the mobile devices either by UAV-to-Device (U2D) communications over cellular networks, or directly through the base station (BS). Since UAVs' sensing and transmission may influence their trajectories, we study the trajectory design problem for UAVs in consideration of their sensing and transmission. This is a Markov decision problem (MDP) with a large state-action space, and thus, we utilize multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to approximate the state-action space, and then propose a multi-UAV trajectory design algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve a higher total utility than policy gradient algorithm and single-agent algorithm.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate a backhaul framework jointly considering topology construction and power adjustment for self-organizing UAV networks. To enhance the backhaul rate with limited information exchange and avoid malicious power competition, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method to construct the backhaul framework where each UAV distributedly makes decisions. First, we decompose the backhaul framework into three submodules, i.e., transmission target selection (TS), total power control (PC), and multi-channel power allocation (PA). Then, the three submodules are solved by heterogeneous DRL algorithms with tailored rewards to regulate UAVs' behaviors. In particular, TS is solved by deep-Q learning to construct topology with less relay and guarantee the backhaul rate. PC and PA are solved by deep deterministic policy gradient to match the traffic requirement with proper finegrained transmission power. As a result, the malicious power competition is alleviated, and the backhaul rate is further enhanced. Simulation results show that the proposed framework effectively achieves system-level and all-around performance gain compared with DQL and max-min method, i.e., higher backhaul rate, lower transmission power, and fewer hop.},

abstract={In intensive obstacle environment, the available flying space is narrow, which makes it difficult to generate feasible path for UAVs within limited runtime. In this paper, a Q-learning-based planning algorithm is presented to improve the efficiency of single UAV path planning in intensive obstacle environment. By constructing the space-action state offline learning planning architecture, the proposed method realizes the rapid path planning of UAV, and solves the high time-consuming problem of reinforcement learning online path planning. Considering the time-consuming problem of Q-table re-training, a probabilistic local update mechanism is proposed by updating the Q-value of the states to reduce the high time-consuming of Q-table re-raining and realize the rapid update of Q-table. The probability of Q-value updating is up to the distance to the new obstacle. The closer the state is to the new obstacle, the higher its probability of re-training. Therefore, the flight trajectory can be quickly re-planned when the environment changes. Simulation results show that the proposed Q-learning-based planning algorithm can generate path for UAV from random start position and avoid the obstacles. Compared with the classical A* algorithm, the path planning time based on the trained Q table can be reduced from second to millisecond, which significantly improves the efficiency of path planning.},

To handle the information loss caused by the partial observability, we introduce a novel network architecture named Deep Recurrent Graph Network (DRGN), which could obtain extra spatial information through graph-convolution based inter-UAV communication, and utilize historical features with a recurrent unit. Based on DRGN and maximum-entropy learning, we propose a stochastic DRL policy named Soft Deep Recurrent Graph Network (SDRGN). In SDRGN, a heuristic reward function is elaborated, which is based on the local information of each UAV instead of the global information; thus, SDRGN reduces the training cost and enables distributed online learning. We conducted extensive experiments to design the structure of DRGN and examine the performance of SDRGN. The simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms four state-of-the-art DRL-based approaches and three heuristic baselines, and demonstrate the scalability, transferability, robustness, and interpretability of SDRGN.},

abstract={The datalink of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is vulnerable to external electromagnetic interference (EMI). The characteristic parameters of the EMI signal can be definitively detected by a developed monitoring platform mounted on the UAV, but it is impossible to determine the lost-link thresholds of the datalink in any state by experiment because the state of the datalink varies dynamically with the flight distance and the UAV's attitudes. In this case, whether a certain state of the UAV's datalink will be interrupted or not by the EMI cannot be evaluated. In this article, a method of EMI prediction for the UAV's dynamic datalink based on the Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed, two indicators, including the interfering frequency and the operation signal power of the datalink, are taken as the training inputs, and the lost-link thresholds of the datalink obtained by the EMI injection test are taken as the training targets. The results show that this method can effectively fit the training samples and determine a 95% confidence interval of the predictive outputs, which has a low predictive error, less than 2.2 dB. Compared with the methods of the layer recurrent neural network and support vector machine, the GPR method has higher predictive accuracy and a stronger generalization ability. Therefore, the detected EMI characteristic parameters can be used as new input samples to predict the lost-link thresholds in any condition. On this basis, the EMI margin can be calculated to evaluate the degree of the anti-EMI redundancy of the UAV's datalink, which can be used for the active adaptation of the UAV's datalink to EMI in the future.},

abstract={Large number of disturbances and uncertainties in the environment makes landing one of the tricky maneuvers in all the phases of flying an unmanned aerial vehicle. The situation even worsens at the time of emergencies. To allow safe landing of the UAVs on rough terrains with a lot of ground objects, an automatic landing site inspection and real-time pose correction system while landing is in demand in current world situation. This paper presents a method of detection of designated landing sites and autonomously landing in a safe environment. The airborne vision system is utilized with fully convolution neural network to recognize the landing markers on the landing site and object detection. Automatic pose correction algorithm is developed to position the drone for landing in a safe zone and as near to the landing marker as possible. The information from the onboard visual sensors and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is utilized to estimate pose for the perfect landing trajectory. A series of experiments are presented to test and optimize the proposed method.},

Based on the real-time landing speed and attitude, a novel type of soft grasping mechanism for dexterous perching is proposed to provide adhesive force and absorb impact force. During the critical perching phase, the dynamics of the perching actuator change with the touchdown conditions and the type of perching target.

To cope with the effects of network destruction in a disaster, we propose a real-time optimisation framework for resource allocation (e.g., power and number of UAVs) for CRNs assisted by UAV relays. The proposed optimisation scheme aims at optimising the network throughput of primary and secondary networks under the stringent constraint of maximum tolerable interference impinged on the primary users. We also propose a deep neural network (DNN) model to significantly reduce the execution time under real-time solution of mixed-integer UAV deployment problems. For both primary and secondary networks, our real-time optimisation algorithms impose low computational complexity, hence, have a low execution time in solving throughput optimisation problems, which demonstrates the benefit of our approached proposed for spectrum-sharing UAV-assisted mission-critical services.},

In this paper, to reduce such a laborious task, we propose a method to provide supportive information, i.e., the number of persons, the time and thumbnails, for finding victims via an aerial video with an object detection algorithm. Also, to use it in a SAR operation, we need to meet the requirements for a dataset and lightweight process.

abstract={Semantic segmentation of aerial videos has been extensively used for decision making in monitoring environmental changes, urban planning, and disaster management. The reliability of these decision support systems is dependent on the accuracy of the video semantic segmentation algorithms. The existing CNN-based video semantic segmentation methods have enhanced the image semantic segmentation methods by incorporating an additional module such as LSTM or optical flow for computing temporal dynamics of the video which is a computational overhead. The proposed research work modifies the CNN architecture by incorporating temporal information to improve the efficiency of video semantic segmentation. In this work, an enhanced encoder-decoder based CNN architecture (UVid-Net) is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video semantic segmentation. The encoder of the proposed architecture embeds temporal information for temporally consistent labeling. The decoder is enhanced by introducing the feature-refiner module, which aids in accurate localization of the class labels. The proposed UVid-Net architecture for UAV video semantic segmentation is quantitatively evaluated on extended ManipalUAVid dataset. The performance metric mean Intersection over Union of 0.79 has been observed which is significantly greater than the other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, the proposed work produced promising results even for the pretrained model of UVid-Net on urban street scene by fine tuning the final layer on UAV aerial videos.},

abstract={State-of-the-art drone technologies have severe flight time limitations due to weight constraints, which inevitably lead to a relatively small amount of available energy. Therefore, frequent battery replacement or recharging is necessary in applications such as delivery, exploration, or support to the wireless infrastructure. Mobile charging stations (i.e., mobile stations with charging equipment) for outdoor ad-hoc battery charging is one of the feasible solutions to address this issue. However, the ability of these platforms to charge the drones is limited in terms of the number and charging time. This paper designs an auction-based mechanism to control the charging schedule in multi-drone setting. In this paper, charging time slots are auctioned, and their assignment is determined by a bidding process. The main challenge in developing this framework is the lack of prior knowledge on the distribution of the number of drones participating in the auction. Based on optimal second-price-auction, the proposed formulation, then, relies on deep learning algorithms to learn such distribution online. Numerical results from extensive simulations show that the proposed deep-learning-based approach provides effective battery charging control in multi-drone scenarios.},

abstract={This study presents an approach to the problem of minimizing the impact of low vegetation on the accuracy of a UAV-derived DEM, based on the use of a deep neural network (DNN). It is proposed to use the U-Net network to determine corrections to the height of the raw point cloud so that the processed data reflect the actual earth’s surface. The implemented solution is therefore based on regression, not classification. As a result of the proposed processing method, the expected value of the land surface height is determined for each point of the unified point cloud. In addition, a second U-Net network is trained, enabling the uncertainty of the corrected heights of the land surface to be determined for each point of the unified cloud. The training set includes data from different seasons, which makes the models more resistant and allows for assessment of the impact of the season and more generally the related vegetation status on the model accuracy. The processing results can be used in DEM generation, and also for determining the vertical displacements of the terrain surface associated with underground mining, as well as natural phenomena such as landslides. A key advantage of the proposed processing method is the ability to predict the uncertainty of the results.},

abstract={This paper considers a wireless network consisting of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), deployed as aerial BSs, and a large number of terrestrial users randomly distributed in a dense urban area. The main objective of this work is to maximize the downlink rate of users along with clustering of users and 2D initial placement of UAVs, which effectively minimizes the clustering error. To achieve this goal, we estimate the next users’ locations with deep Echo State Network (ESN) to find the movement pattern of users with high accuracy. Then, we propose the single-and multi-agent actor-critic algorithms for UAVs’ initial deployment and trajectory design, where the multi-agent scheme employs an efficient bandwidth allocation. Simulation results supported by a real data set of the terrestrial users’ coordinates indicate that, when the deep ESN algorithm is used, the accuracy is 93.75% for longitude and 88.36% for latitude compared to the simple ESN performance. Moreover, the use of single-and multi-agent actor-critic algorithms display better performance in terms of downlink rate and convergence speed than value-based algorithms such as deep Q-network schemes.},

abstract={In the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, connectivity preservation is crucial for the cooperation of the UAVs. However, current artificial potential field (APF) schemes are not flexible enough to cope with complex communication environments, and the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) schemes take a centralized control approach, which has a high computing overhead for the large scale UAV network. Based on knowledge distillation, which can be used for transferring knowledge between the DRL models, we propose a cooperative reinforcement learning scheme for flexible and coverage-aware connectivity preservation with low computing overhead in UAV network. Each UAV trains its own deep reinforcement learning model, and simultaneously cooperates with other UAVs via knowledge distillation to optimize network connectivity as well as coverage performance. Simulations are conducted to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which shows that our algorithm can improve the full connectivity time by up to 50% while maintaining the similar coverage performance, compared to the baseline.},

abstract={In this paper, an interference-aware path planning scheme for a network of cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. In particular, each UAV aims at achieving a tradeoff between maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing both wireless latency and the interference caused on the ground network along its path. The problem is cast as a dynamic game among UAVs. To solve this game, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on echo state network (ESN) cells, is proposed. The introduced deep ESN architecture is trained to allow each UAV to map each observation of the network state to an action, with the goal of minimizing a sequence of time-dependent utility functions. Each UAV uses the ESN to learn its optimal path, transmission power, and cell association vector at different locations along its path. The proposed algorithm is shown to reach a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium upon convergence. Moreover, an upper bound and a lower bound for the altitude of the UAVs are derived thus reducing the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves better wireless latency per UAV and rate per ground user (UE) while requiring a number of steps that are comparable to a heuristic baseline that considers moving via the shortest distance toward the corresponding destinations. The results also show that the optimal altitude of the UAVs varies based on the ground network density and the UE data rate requirements and plays a vital role in minimizing the interference level on the ground UEs as well as the wireless transmission delay of the UAV.},

abstract={Users in heterogeneous wireless networks may generate massive amounts of data that are delay-sensitive or require computation-intensive processing. Owing to computation ability and battery capacity limitations, wireless users (WUs) cannot easily process such data in a timely manner, and mobile edge computing (MEC) is increasingly being used to resolve this issue. Specifically, data generated by WUs can be offloaded to the MEC server for processing, which has greater computing power than WUs. However, as the location of MEC servers is fixed, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been considered a promising solution in heterogeneous wireless networks. In this study, we design an UAV-assisted computation offloading scheme in an MEC framework with renewable power supply. The proposed model considers the instability of energy arrival, stochastic computation tasks generated by WUs, and a time-varying channel state. Owing to the complexity of the state, it is difficult to use traditional Markov decision process (MDP) with complete prior knowledge for offloading optimization. Accordingly, we propose UAV-assisted computation offloading for MEC based on deep reinforcement learning (UACODRL) to minimize the total cost, which is the weighted sum of the delay, energy consumption, and bandwidth cost. We first use the K-Means algorithm for classification to reduce the dimension of the action space. Subsequently, we use UACODRL to find the near-optimal offloading scheme to minimize the total cost. Simulations demonstrate that UACODRL converges satisfactorily and performs better than four baseline schemes with different parameter configurations.},

abstract={This article considers human-autonomy teams (HATs) in which two human team members interact and collaborate with an autonomous teammate to achieve a common task while dealing with unexpected technological failures that were imposed either in automation or autonomy. A Wizard of Oz methodology is used to simulate the autonomous teammate. One of the critical aspects of HAT performance is the trust that develops over time as team members interact with each other in a dynamic task environment. For this reason, it is important to examine the dynamic nature of teammate trust through real-time measures of team interactions. This article examines team interaction and trust to understand better how they change under automation and autonomy failures. Thus, we address two research questions: 1) How does trust in HATs evolve over time?; and 2) How is the relationship between team interaction and trust impacted by the failures? We hypothesize that trust in HATs will decrease as autonomy failures increase. We also hypothesize that team interaction would be related to the development of trust and recovery from the failures. The results implicate three general trends: 1) team interaction dynamics are linked to the development of trust in HATs; 2) trust in the autonomous teammate is only associated with recovery from autonomy failures; 3) team interaction dynamics are related to both automation and autonomy failure recovery.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of detection and classification of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of wireless interference signals using a passive radio frequency (RF) surveillance system. The system uses a multistage detector to distinguish signals transmitted by a UAV controller from the background noise and interference signals. First, RF signals from any source are detected using a Markov models-based naïve Bayes decision mechanism. When the receiver operates at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB, and the threshold, which defines the states of the models, is set at a level 3.5 times the standard deviation of the preprocessed noise data, a detection accuracy of 99.8% with a false alarm rate of 2.8% is achieved. Second, signals from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth emitters, if present, are detected based on the bandwidth and modulation features of the detected RF signal. Once the input signal is identified as a UAV controller signal, it is classified using machine learning (ML) techniques. Fifteen statistical features extracted from the energy transients of the UAV controller signals are fed to neighborhood component analysis (NCA), and the three most significant features are selected. The performance of the NCA and five different ML classifiers are studied for 15 different types of UAV controllers. A classification accuracy of 98.13% is achieved by k-nearest neighbor classifier at 25 dB SNR. Classification performance is also investigated at different SNR levels and for a set of 17 UAV controllers which includes two pairs from the same UAV controller models.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are vulnerable to smart attackers, who are selfish and subjective end-users and use smart radio devices to change their attack types and policies based on the ongoing UAV transmission and network states. In this paper, we apply prospect theory to formulate a subjective smart attack game for the UAV transmission, in which a smart attacker Eve makes subjective decisions to choose the attack type such as jamming, spoofing, and eavesdropping without knowing the attack detection accuracy of the UAV system, and the UAV transmit power on multiple radio channels is chosen to resist smart attacks. Reinforcement-learning-based UAV power allocation strategies are proposed to achieve the optimal power allocation against smart attacks without knowing the attack model and the channel model in the dynamic game. A deep Q-learning-based UAV power allocation strategy combines Q-learning and deep learning to accelerate the learning speed for the case with a large number of channel states and attack modes. Simulation results show that our proposed UAV power allocation strategy can suppress the attack motivation of subjective smart attackers and increase the secrecy capacity and the utility of the UAV system.},

The key interaction technology between humans and UAVs needs to focus on the human body language, which comprises rich interactive information, as it is the most natural, intuitive, and easy to master approach of interpersonal communication for humans. Therefore, the research on human motion estimation for UAV control is of considerable practical significance. Recently, deep learning has made breakthroughs in speech, image recognition and, other fields, and has crushed the performance of traditional methods in many fields. However, in the field of human motion estimation, deep learning has been progressing slowly. To overcome the limitations of the traditional methods and explore the application of deep learning methods in the field of motion estimation, this study proposes a method to estimate human arm motion using deep learning networks. We proposed a bidirectional two-layer LSTM fusion network to estimate the forearms' motion according to the hand position measured by HTC Vive. The performance was verified using a real data set. The average Euclidean distance similarity can reach up to 56%. In comparison with the traditional methods, the proposed method demonstrated wider applicability and better performance.},

abstract={In this paper, we apply the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique to improve the massive channel access of a wireless IoT network where solar-powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) relay data from IoT devices to remote servers. Specifically, IoT devices contend for accessing the shared wireless channel using an adaptive p-persistent slotted Aloha protocol; and the solar-powered UAVs adopt Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to decode multiple received data from IoT devices to improve access efficiency. To enable an energy-sustainable capacity-optimal network, we study the joint problem of dynamic multi-UAV altitude control and multi-cell wireless channel access management of IoT devices as a stochastic control problem with multiple energy constraints. We first formulate this problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), and propose an online model-free Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) algorithm based on Lagrangian primal-dual policy optimization to solve the CMDP. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm learns a cooperative policy in which the altitude of UAVs and channel access probability of IoT devices are dynamically controlled to attain the maximal long-term network capacity while ensuring energy sustainability of UAVs, outperforming baseline schemes. The proposed CDRL agent can be trained on a small network, yet the learned policy can efficiently manage networks with a massive number of IoT devices and varying initial states, which can amortize the cost of training the CDRL agent.},

abstract={As an important means of obtaining information of marine situation, the marine monitoring system relying on UAV has been paid more and more attention by all countries in the world, and the demand for tasks is growing continually. In UAV ad hoc networks, routing protocols with immutable routing policies that lack flexibility are generally incapable of maintaining effective performance due to the complicated and rapidly changing environmental situation and application requirements. In this paper, we propose an intelligent clustering routing approach (ICRA) for UANETs. The ICRA is composed of three components: the clustering module, the clustering strategy adjustment module and the routing module. In the clustering process, each node needs to calculate its utility. In order to maintain high topology stability and long network lifetime in different network states, the reinforcement learning based clustering strategy adjustment module needs continuous learning the benefits brought by adopting different strategies to calculate the nodes utility in a specific network state. With the learned knowledge, clustering strategy adjustment module could determine the optimal clustering strategy according to the current network state. In the routing phase, the proposed scheme can reduce the end-to-end delay and improve the packet delivery rate by introducing inter-cluster forwarding nodes to forward messages among different clusters. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify ICRA's robustness and superiority over existing schemes. The results demonstrate that ICRA could achieve better performance than its state-of-the-art counterparts with regard to the clustering efficiency, topology stability, energy efficiency and quality of service.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted great interest in the last few years owing to their ability to cover large areas and access difficult and hazardous target zones, which is not the case of traditional systems relying on direct observations obtained from fixed cameras and sensors. Furthermore, thanks to the advancements in computer vision and machine learning, UAVs are being adopted for a broad range of solutions and applications. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are progressing toward deeper and complex models that prevent them from being executed onboard. In this article, we propose a DNN distribution methodology within UAVs to enable data classification in resource-constrained devices and avoid extra delays introduced by the server-based solutions due to data communication over air-to-ground links. The proposed method is formulated as an optimization problem that aims to minimize the latency between data collection and decision-making while considering the mobility model and the resource constraints of the UAVs as part of the air-to-air communication. We also introduce the mobility prediction to adapt our system to the dynamics of UAVs and the network variation. The simulation conducted to evaluate the performance and benchmark the proposed methods, namely, optimal UAV-based layer distribution (OULD) and OULD with mobility prediction (OULD-MP), was run in an HPC cluster. The obtained results show that our optimization solution outperforms the existing and heuristic-based approaches.},

abstract={Achieving precise state estimation is needed for the unmanned aerial vehicle to perform a successful flight with a high degree of stability. Nonetheless, obtaining accurate state estimation is considered challenging due to the inaccuracies associated with the measurements of the onboard commercial-off-the-shelf inertial measurement unit. The immense vibration of the vehicle's rotors makes these measurements suffer from issues like large drifts, biases, and immense unpredictable noise sequences. These issues cannot be significantly tackled using classical estimators, and an accurate sensor fusion technique needs to be developed. In this paper, a deep learning (DL) framework is developed to enhance the performance of the state estimator. A deep neural network (DNN) is trained using a deep-learning-based technique to identify the associated measurement noise models and filter them out. The dropout technique is adopted for training DNN to avoid overfitting and reduce the complexity of nets computations. Compared to the classical estimation results, the proposed DL technique demonstrates capabilities in identifying the measurement's noise characteristics. As an example, an enhancement in estimating the attitude states at near hover is proven using this approach. Furthermore, an actual hover flight was performed to validate the proposed estimation enhancement method.},

abstract={Deep learning-based algorithms can provide state-of-the-art accuracy for remote sensing technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, potentially enhancing their remote sensing capabilities for many emergency response and disaster management applications. In particular, UAVs equipped with camera sensors can operating in remote and difficult to access disaster-stricken areas, analyze the image and alert in the presence of various calamities such as collapsed buildings, flood, or fire in order to faster mitigate their effects on the environment and on human population. However, the integration of deep learning introduces heavy computational requirements, preventing the deployment of such deep neural networks in many scenarios that impose low-latency constraints on inference, in order to make mission-critical decisions in real time. To this end, this article focuses on the efficient aerial image classification from on-board a UAV for emergency response/monitoring applications. Specifically, a dedicated Aerial Image Database for Emergency Response applications is introduced and a comparative analysis of existing approaches is performed. Through this analysis a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture is proposed, referred to as EmergencyNet, based on atrous convolutions to process multiresolution features and capable of running efficiently on low-power embedded platforms achieving upto 20× higher performance compared to existing models with minimal memory requirements with less than 1% accuracy drop compared to state-of-the-art models.},

The proposed method splits the UAV's data into smaller pieces and then extracts features by one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), and explores internal connections of the UAV's time series data by adding the long short-term memory (LSTM). So, a hybrid CNN-LSTM model is developed for the fault diagnosis of actuator faults.

Aiming at the problem of how to find the target position, this paper proposes a cooperative method to suppress eavesdropping nodes by using multi-agent method (SECM) in reinforcement learning. In our work, we introduce a UAV agent with a ranger of vision, which can find eavesdropping nodes through electromagnetic information and track their positions in real time. The UAV shares the eavesdropper’s position with the mobile jammer. Furthermore, fixed jammers are added in the scene to cooperate with the mobile jammer to pursue and form a cooperative strategy. The strategy can optimize the suppression efficiency. The simulation results show that the cooperative suppression eavesdropping algorithm proposed in this paper has better performance in detection than traditional Q-learning algorithm.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are the promising ``Flying IoT" devices of the future, which can be equipped with various sensors and cognitive capabilities to perform numerous tasks related to remote sensing, search and rescue operations, object tracking, segmentation of roads and buildings, surveillance, etc. However, these AI-driven tasks require heavy computation and may lead to sub-optimal performance with embedded processors on a power-constrained battery-operated drone. This work proposes a novel deep learning approach for performing robust semantic segmentation of aerial scenes captured by UAVs. In our setup, the power-constrained drone is used only for data collection, while the computationally intensive tasks are offloaded to a GPU cloud server. Our architecture performs robust semantic segmentation by learning the segmentation maps from jointly utilizing of aerial scenes along with the respective ``elevation maps" in a semi-supervised approach. We propose a three-tier deep learning architecture, wherein the first module aims at preliminary feature extraction from the aerial scenes using a backbone feature extractor. The second module captures the spatial dependency between the aerial scenes and their respective elevation maps in order to obtain better semantic information, which is achieved by a bi-directional LSTM. The third module is aimed at enhancing the performance of semantic segmentation through a semi-supervised approach with an encoder to generate segmentation maps and a decoder to reconstruct feature maps. This semi-supervised feature learning ensures robust extraction along with scalability. The proposed architecture was validated on real-world aerial datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results for aerial image segmentation.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm networks have been presented as a promising paradigm for conducting monitoring, and inter-connecting tasks in unattended or even hostile environments. However, harsh deployment scenario may make the UAVs susceptible to large-scale damage, and thus degrades the connectivity and performance of the network. None of existing technologies can effectively re-organize the surviving UAVs in a severely damaged UAV swarm into a unified UAV Swarm Network (USNET), this paper presents and analyzes the damage-resilience problem of USNETs for the first time, and put forwards a Swarm Intelligence-based Damage-Resilient (SIDR) mechanism. First, a damage model of USNETs and several metrics are defined before the problem is formally formulated. Second, the SIDR mechanism is detailed based on comprehensively utilizing the storage, communication, positioning, and maneuvering capabilities of UAVs. Third, a potential-field-based solution to the proposed SIDR mechanism is presented, aiming to recover a USNET rapidly and elastically. At last, an evaluation environment is built on the OMNeT++ platform, and the proposed SIDR mechanism is implemented. Extensive simulations are conducted in both dynamic and static scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that SIDR outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of resilience capability, convergence time and communication overhead. Even if a USNET is divided into multiple disjoint subnets with arbitrary shape, SIDR can aggregate the surviving nodes into a connected network while the network is still flying along the flight path during the recovery process.},

abstract={Recently, needs for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are attachable to the wall have been highlighted. As one of the ways to address the need, researches on various tilting multirotors that can increase maneuverability has been employed. Unfortunately, existing studies on the tilting multirotors require considerable amounts of prior information on the complex dynamic model. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning on quadrotors has been studied to mitigate this issue. Yet, these are only been applied to standard quadrotors, whose systems are less complex than those of tilting multirotors. In this paper, a novel reinforcement learning-based method is proposed to control a tilting multirotor on real-world applications, which is the first attempt to apply reinforcement learning to a tilting multirotor. To do so, we propose a novel reward function for a neural network model that takes power efficiency into account. The model is initially trained over a simulated environment and then fine-tuned using real-world data in order to overcome the sim-to-real gap issue. Furthermore, a novel, efficient state representation with respect to the goal frame that helps the network learn optimal policy better is proposed. As verified on real-world experiments, our proposed method shows robust controllability by overcoming the complex dynamics of tilting multirotors.},

By incorporating the insights of flocking control inspired by bird flocking in nature, the problem is structured as a Markov decision process and solved by deep reinforcement learning. In particular, coordination among agents is achieved by following a local interaction protocol that each agent only considers the relative position of the nearest two neighbors on its left side and right side. In addition, a flocking control-inspired reward scheme is designed for the emergence of flocking and navigation behaviors.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being broadly employed lately in different domains because of their unique features such as ease of mobility and feasibility. A high fidelity communication link is the basis for guaranteeing the robustness of the UAV network between its ends. To offer reliable models for utilization in designing UAV communication systems, in addition to the processes of planning, deploying, and operating these systems, accurate estimation of the prevailing radio channel framework parameters is required. In this work, we suggest and present a strategy for constructing an empirical path loss (PL) model for air-to-ground radio frequency channels relying on machine learning (ML). ML regression algorithms including K-nearest-neighbors (kNN), Regression Trees (RT) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are utilized in our versatile three-dimensional (3D) technique. To that end, we investigate the use of GPS coordinates (i.e., latitude, longitude, and altitude.) of both of the UAV transmitter and ground receiver, in addition to humidity, temperature and atmospheric pressure as features into the ML algorithm to predict the link PL. Hence, all environment parameters, and the corresponding implicit relationships are incorporated in the learning phase, and the subsequent prediction of the PL. The validity of our model and approach is verified through numerical results.},

abstract={We propose Nazr-CNN1, a deep learning pipeline for object detection and fine-grained classification in images acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for damage assessment and monitoring. Nazr-CNN consists of two components. The function of the first component is to localize objects (e.g. houses or infrastructure) in an image by carrying out a pixel-level classification. In the second component, a hidden layer of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to encode Fisher Vectors (FV) of the segments generated from the first component in order to help discriminate between different levels of damage. To showcase our approach we use data from UAVs that were deployed to assess the level of damage in the aftermath of a devastating cyclone that hit the island of Vanuatu in 2015. The collected images were labeled by a crowdsourcing effort and the labeling categories consisted of fine-grained levels of damage to built structures. Since our data set is relatively small, a pre-trained network for pixel-level classification and FV encoding was used. Nazr-CNN attains promising results both for object detection and damage assessment suggesting that the integrated pipeline is robust in the face of small data sets and labeling errors by annotators. While the focus of Nazr-CNN is on assessment of UAV images in a post-disaster scenario, our solution is general and can be applied in many diverse settings. We show one such case of transfer learning to assess the level of damage in aerial images collected after a typhoon in Philippines.},

abstract={This paper aims at the problems of small Radar Cross-Section (RCS) and short coherent accumulation time in radar detection of low altitude small UAVs. An Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) super-resolution imaging method based on Bayesian Statistical Machine Learning is proposed. The sparse prior characteristics of UAV with respect to the air-background is utilized by introducing a heavy-tailed Laplacian prior probability distribution, and a Bayesian posterior inference model is derived based on the Gaussian distribution assumption of observation system noise. In view of the non-conjugation of prior distribution, a hierarchical Bayesian model is introduced. Finally, the variational Bayesian expectation maximization algorithm is applied, and the posterior probability density function of the target is solved analytically. Meanwhile, the imaging defocus caused by the non-systematic translational error of the target is corrected, cooperatively. Compared with traditional methods, this method can effectively solve the problem of low imaging signal-to-noise ratio caused by the small RCS of UAV target and low imaging resolution caused by the short coherent accumulation time. The experimental results of simulation and radar data prove the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

abstract={To boost the performance of wireless communication networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) aided communications have drawn dramatically attention due to their flexibility in establishing the line of sight (LoS) communications. However, with the blockage in the complex urban environment, and due to the movement of UAVs and mobile users, the directional paths can be occasionally blocked by trees and high-rise buildings. Intelligent reflection surfaces (IRSs) that can reflect signals to generate virtual LoS paths are capable of providing stable communications and serving wider coverage. This is the first paper that exploits a three-dimensional geometry dynamic channel model in IRS-assisted UAV-enabled communication system. Moreover, we develop a novel deep learning based channel tracking algorithm consisting of two modules: channel pre-estimation and channel tracking. A deep neural network with off-line training is designed for denoising in the pre-estimation module. Moreover, for channel tracking, a stacked bi-directional long short term memory (Stacked Bi-LSTM) is developed based on a framework that can trace back historical time sequence together with bidirectional structure over multiple stacked layers. Simulations have shown that the proposed channel tracking algorithm requires fewer epochs to convergence compared to benchmark algorithms. It also demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is superior to different benchmarks with small pilot overheads and comparable computation complexity.},

abstract={The monitoring of migratory geese at known stopover sites is crucial to their habitat conservation but usually requires skilled manpower for counting large flocks of waterfowl. We used a UAV to count greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons). A single UAV flight could observe the entire lake from an altitude of 100 m above the water surface with little disturbance to the roosting geese. We used a deep learning to automatically count geese in the imagery. The counting accuracy ranged from -7% to -3% in three validation cases compared with manual counts on the UAV image. We conclude that the combination of UAV and deep leaning methods can yield goose counts with an accuracy of ±15%. The results suggest that this approach will be useful for monitoring geese or other waterfowl.},

abstract={A new communications infrastructure is needed for users to experience the contents of 5G-based VR/AR in High-Speed Train (HST). Therefore, it is proposed that the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can be used as a communication equipment on behalf of the general Rail-side Units (RSUs) supporting the communication of the HST. To maintain reliable communications, initial deployment and trajectory considered altitude and direction of UAV are determined. Also, limited energy in UAV is an important constraint on trajectory optimization. Thus, this paper proposes initial deployment and trajectory optimization techniques for stable communication between HST and Multi-UAV with the energy constraints of UAV. This paper uses Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), one of the methods of reinforcement learning, as a way to optimize the UAV trajectory. It also uses the Support Vector Machine to carry out optimal initial deployment based on data on the maximum UAV communication distance according to the speed of HST and the energy of UAV, which is the result of trajectory optimization. As a result, this study quickly and accurately derives the optimal trajectory of Multi-Uav according to the speed of HST and the energy of UAV and also maintain stable communication by optimal initial deployment.},

abstract={In this paper, we present an innovative workflow for retrieving biophysical traits of vegetation by means of inverting the radiative transfer model PROSAIL from UAV borne hyperspectral data. The approach makes use of spectral images acquired with a Fabry-Perot interferometer in the visible and near infrared spectral range. Even of the reduced spatial coverage of UAV acquisition, the high spatial resolution of such images makes model inversion computationally highly demanding. To overcome this, we made use of a machine learning method. Firstly, we generated look up tables by means of model forward runs based on variating model parameters according to prior knowledge. Random forests were then trained and applied to radiometrically calibrated UAV borne images. This allowed to retrieve model parameters for the area of interest (AOI). The approach showed to be computationally efficient and usable for ecosystems with high spatial variability.},

abstract={Acquiring the systems' model is a significant stride of controller design and development. Nevertheless, it is arduous sometimes to estimate a real-world system model such as a quadcopter UAV, which has non-linearity, difficult-to-measure, and complex characteristics. This condition caused system identification plays a crucial role in the quadcopter modeling. With the ease of obtaining the experimental flight data directly from the quadcopter, hence modeling of the quadcopter using system identification now is handy. Conforming to that, the development of machine learning algorithms specifically on the deep learning field, driven new perspectives on the system identification approach. In this paper, several deep learning architectures were applied to identify the quadcopter UAV system. Overall, results show that the CNN-LSTM model was the top-performed architecture with the average tested MSE and MAE equal to 0.0002 and 0.0030.},
