abstract={Agronomic inputs such as water , nutrients and fertilisers play a vital role in the health, growth and yield of crops. The lack of each of these inputs induces biotic and abiotic stress in the crop. Farmers are relying on groundwater because of decreased rainfall. The irrigation method can be improved by acquiring awareness of the health of crops and soils. In general, crop and soil quality is controlled by means of manual observation, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive and contributes to incorrect choices and substantial waste of resources. There is also an immediate need to automate the inspection process that will finally benefit farmers and agricultural scientists. In this paper, the identification of the water-stressed areas in the crop(maize) field has been studied, and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing is used to automate the crop health-monitoring process. We proposed a framework (model) based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify the stressed and normal/healthy areas in the maize crop field. The performance of the proposed framework has been compared with different models of CNN, such as ResNet50, VGG-19, and Inception-v3. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline models and successfully classify stressed and normal areas with 95 % accuracy on train data and 93 % accuracy with 0.9370 precision and 0.9403 F1 score on test data.},

abstract={Most of the remote sensing image captioning (IC) models are based on encoder–decoder frameworks where a convolutional neural network (CNN) encodes the image information and a recurrent neural network (RNN) decodes the image information into a sentence description. In order to achieve good accuracies, encoder–decoder frameworks relying on RNNs typically require a huge amount of annotated samples. Furthermore, they demand high and expensive computational power in order to have reasonable training and testing time. In this article, we aim to address these issues by introducing a novel decoder that is based on support vector machines (SVMs). In particular, instead of RNNs, we propose a novel network of SVMs to decode the image information into a sentence description. The proposed IC system is particularly interesting when just a limited amount of training samples is available. Experiments conducted on four different IC datasets confirm the promising capability of the proposed IC system to generate descriptions that are highly correlated with the image content. The proposed IC system is characterized by short training and inference times compared to other state-of-the-art models.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection system that uses unmanned aerial vehicle inspection as the main inspection method, optical images as the primary data source, and deep learning as the backbone of the data analysis. To facilitate the implementation of the system, we address three main challenges of deep learning in vision-based power line inspection: (i) the lack of training data; (ii) class imbalance; and (iii) the detection of small components and faults. First, we create four medium-sized datasets for training component detection and classification models. Furthermore, we apply a series of effective data augmentation techniques to balance out the imbalanced classes. Finally, we propose the multi-stage component detection and classification based on the Single Shot Multibox detector and deep Residual Networks to detect small components and faults. The results show that the proposed system is fast and accurate in detecting common faults on power line components, including missing top caps, cracks in poles and cross arms, woodpecker damage on poles, and rot damage on cross arms. The field tests suggest that our system has a promising role in the intelligent monitoring and inspection of power line components and as a valuable addition to smart grids.},

abstract={Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are deployed in a number of different emerging market segments as well as for recreational hobby flying. Driven by their ubiquitous availability, a large number of manufacturers offer UAV models in different form factors, control and load carrying capacities. This paper proposes a deep learning method to detect the type/model of the UAV using the transmitted RF signals, even when these signals follow proprietary medium access protocols whose headers cannot be decoded. The main contributions are as follows: (i) We show how the preamble portion of the packet is better suited for learning subtle protocol-specific differences, instead of randomly selecting any subset of the transmitted packet, (ii) we propose a pre-processing scheme that generates cross-correlation feature maps to enhance the classification accuracy, (iii) we develop a deep convolutional neural architecture that can be trained in data collected from static scenarios and then tested in practical hovering conditions with 98.2% accuracy of UAV model classification, demonstrating robustness to channel variations, and (iv) we extend this model towards a federated learning paradigm where sensors send individually trained models back to a central controller that combines them, without any appreciable loss of accuracy. Our evaluations are performed on an 8.9 GB dataset collected from static and flying UAVs, which we also release as part of the technical contributions of the work.},

year={2019},
volume={67},
number={9},
pages={6386-6400},
abstract={In this paper, the problem of content caching and transmission is studied for a wireless virtual reality (VR) network in which cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) capture videos on live games or sceneries and transmit them to small base stations (SBSs) that service the VR users. To meet the VR delay requirements, the UAVs can extract specific visible content (e.g., user field of view) from the original 360° VR data and send this visible content to the users so as to reduce the traffic load over backhaul and radio access links. The extracted visible content consists of 120° horizontal and 120° vertical images. To further alleviate the UAV-SBS backhaul traffic, the SBSs can also cache the popular contents that users request. This joint content caching and transmission problem are formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' reliability defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of each user satisfies the instantaneous VR delay target. To address this problem, a distributed deep learning algorithm that brings together new neural network ideas from liquid state machine (LSM), and echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. The proposed algorithm enables each SBS to predict the users' reliability so as to find the optimal contents to cache and content transmission format for each cellular-connected UAV. Analytical results are derived to expose the various network factors that impact content caching and content transmission format selection. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields 25.4% and 14.7% gains, in terms of reliability compared to Q-learning and a random caching algorithm, respectively.},

abstract={UAV development is being intensively developed by various groups to help overcome various types of problems. Object Detection is important in helping UAVs to do drone chasing and other competition that need visual approach based on image processing and deep learning. Unfortunately, the computational capabilities of the onboard processing unit that attached to the UAV are less than optimal for object detection due to storage and memory size constraints. This paper aims to create the new approach to improve the precision and recall during UAV detection by using web application to do real time detection. To decide a pre-trained model, it is necessary to compare which SSD pre-trained model is suitable to be deployed in this web application. The results obtained are that using the web application approach is better than the onboard processing approach with a high level of precision and recall with an average precision value of 0.85 and an average recall value of 0.837.},

abstract={Contemporary models of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are largely developed using simulators. In a typical scheme, a flight simulator is dovetailed with a machine learning (ML) algorithm. A good simulator provides a realistic environment for simulated aircraft. It also provides the ability to invoke and fly various models of aircraft. The ML algorithm, in turn, allows to find an appropriate set of control inputs that can be useful in flying the aircraft autonomously. Creating UAVs in this way has certain obvious benefits. The process of development can be accelerated largely by employing a testbed that allows a seamless dovetailing between the flight simulator and an ML algorithm of choice. However, an extensive testbed is largely missing from the academic landscape both in terms of implementation and technical details. This papers proposes a new testbed for the development of fully autonomous UAVs. The proposed system allows researchers to simulate UAVs for various scenarios.},

abstract={We consider an edge computing framework for online distributed learning in UAV swarm, which allows swarm to collect data and train machine learning (ML) models over the air. Usually, UAVs are used as sensors to collect and transmit data to ground for further processing. However, the overhead for raw data transmission are becoming unaffordable as the task gets complex and the timeliness gets increasingly rigorous. Therefore, We have proposed a new distributed online learning scheme to allow each UAV collect data locally as well as perform ML model training onboard. We have theoretically proved the convergence of the ML model to be trained, and the performance gap between central training method and proposed scheme is analyzed. Furthermore, we have bridged the sensing and transmission via the definition of importance of each UAV based on its contribution in training, where we extend the widely-used timeliness metric Age of Information (AoI) to Age of Updates (AoU), and thus the data freshness and data value in training process are combined together. The performance of the proposed distributed learning scheme is validated, and the difference between AoI and AoU are compared via simulations.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of joint caching and resource allocation is investigated for a network of cache-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that service wireless ground users over the LTE licensed and unlicensed bands. The considered model focuses on users that can access both licensed and unlicensed bands while receiving contents from either the cache units at the UAVs directly or via content server-UAV-user links. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem, which jointly incorporates user association, spectrum allocation, and content caching. To solve this problem, a distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of liquid state machine (LSM) is proposed. Using the proposed LSM algorithm, the cloud can predict the users' content request distribution while having only limited information on the network's and users' states. The proposed algorithm also enables the UAVs to autonomously choose the optimal resource allocation strategies that maximize the number of users with stable queues depending on the network states. Based on the users' association and content request distributions, the optimal contents that need to be cached at UAVs and the optimal resource allocation are derived. Simulation results using real datasets show that the proposed approach yields up to 17.8% and 57.1% gains, respectively, in terms of the number of users that have stable queues compared with two baseline algorithms: Q-learning with cache and Q-learning without cache. The results also show that the LSM significantly improves the convergence time of up to 20% compared with conventional learning algorithms such as Q-learning.},

abstract={Aviation communities are nowadays deploying automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) systems on aircraft to have more accurate and reliable air traffic control. This system broadcasts some of the aircraft telemetry data in the form of plaintext messages over unencrypted datalinks, which makes this system vulnerable to several cyber-attacks including jamming. To mitigate these attacks, the first step to take is to detect them. A few techniques have been proposed in the literature, but these techniques suffer from several limitations. This paper presents a comprehensive study highlighting the efficiency of machine learning based classifiers towards jamming attacks detection. Several supervised machine learning algorithms including support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, artificial neural network, and decision tree are used and their performance is compared. Features such as bit error rate, bad packet ratio, and energy statistic are utilized to train these models and to distinguish the received jamming signals from legitimate ones. The results show that the two-hidden-layer neural network with 15 neurons outperforms all the other algorithms.},

We processed full stage multispectral images from four site-years (two sites during two years) of a wheat breeding project, and determined the prediction accuracy of the image-based predicted yields and compared them to the harvested yields taken in the field. The results compared the wheat images throughout the season and validated the most crucial flying times for acquiring images were at late-heading, late-flowering, dough-development, and harvesting stages. The two most useful colour-bands for yield prediction were red and red-edge. We found that removing these bands significantly decreased the prediction correctness.

The proposed framework generates LED sequences with the help of embedded boards and utilizes image processing and deep learning for the decoding of the sensor data from the LED pattern image. The experiments are carried out with the images taken under various lighting conditions from different heights in the field.

abstract={US Army unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the future will be sustained for longer durations if damage in structural parts is continuously monitored from the damage-inception stage and continuously through vehicle life. Neural networks based machine learning (ML) are proposed, demonstrating that the length of a developing fatigue crack can be estimated continuously using the ultrasound signals. Using a 0.5-TB data set that was obtained from a carefully selected set of experiments, the ML was developed in three stages: 1) feature development, 2) outlier elimination and 3) role of the excitation frequency and exciter-receiver path in the ML of the crack length. In the first stage, the recorded 8000-point ultrasound signals were reduced, first, to 63 features comprising the major statistical features of the returned signal and the seven scales of a seven scale wavelet decomposition of the returned signal. Using an autoencoder algorithm, outliers in the input were identified and removed. A four-layer, 63-32-16-1 neural network based linear regression algorithm was used to predict the crack length from the input features. The results indicated that the ML algorithm gave correlation in the range of 99.43-99.97% when both the exciter-frequency and the exciter-receiver paths are fixed. For investigating the effects of the excitation frequency and the exciter-receiver path on the crack-length information in the returned signal, a similar neural network algorithm was used. One or two additional variables were added to the incoming samples' feature space depending on whether the excitation frequency or the exciter-receiver path or both were variables. ML for crack-length estimation showed promise for these situations, too. In the more practical first situation, where the exciter frequency is fixed and the exciter-receiver path is uncertain, the algorithm showed an accuracy in the range of 96.97-98.92%. This algorithm still gave a correlation above 85% when there was uncertainty in the excitation frequency and exciter-receiver paths, as well. This work thus demonstrates the potential for monitoring fatigue crack length growth throughout the life of a vehicle for an increased sustainment of the US Army UAVs.},

abstract={The traditional predictive correction algorithm requires a large number of iterative calculations for the predicted trajectory, which greatly occupies a large amount of computing resources, so that the real-time solution of the guidance command can not be guaranteed, and the guidance accuracy will have a large impact. And the prediction correction guidance requires the algorithm to have the ability of selfadaptation and intelligent learning. Therefore, this paper proposes a cross-cycle iterative hypersonic UAV predictive correction guidance method based on reinforcement learning. The parametric control variable (CVP) method is used to construct the parametric model of the guidance command. The actor-critic-based reinforcement learning method is used to solve the guidance command in real time, and the guidance information is effectively transmitted in the adjacent guidance solution cycle. The guidance error converges to within the allowable accuracy range during the cross-cycle iteration. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the proposed method has good adaptability to initial conditions and flight parameter uncertainty, and can guarantee the real-time performance of the guidance command while achieving high-precision guidance.},

abstract={Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become an important tool for efficient disaster response. Despite the virtues of UAVs in disaster response applications, various limitations (e.g., requiring manual input, finite battery life) hinder their mass adoption. In contrast, social sensing is emerging as a new sensing paradigm that utilizes signals provided by "human sensors" to gather awareness of the events occurring in the physical world. Despite being inherently broader in scope, a shortcoming of social sensing is the reliability of the sensing data that are contributed by humans. In this paper, we introduce the concept of jointly exploiting the reliability of drones and the scope of social sensing to efficiently uncover the truthful events during disasters. However, such a tight integration of social and physical sensing introduces several technical challenges. The first challenge is satisfying the conflicting objectives of event coverage of the application and energy conservation of drones. The second challenge is adapting to the dynamics of the physical world and social media. In this paper, we present a Social-media-driven Energy-Aware Drone (SEAD) sensing framework to address the above challenges. In particular, we develop a reinforcement learning-based drone dispatching scheme that adapts to the physical and social environments and launches an appropriate proportion of drones for event exploration. We further utilize a bottom-up game-theoretic task allocation approach to guide drones effectively to the event locations. The evaluation with a real-world disaster case study show that SEAD noticeably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of detection effectiveness and energy efficiency.},

abstract={The control problem for quadrotor UAVs is difficult and challenging due to the complex nonlinear dynamics and ever-changing disturbances. In this paper, a supplementary controller based on reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to improve the control performance of quadrotor UAVs. The proposed RL method is constructed by an actor-critic structure and some improved technologies, e.g., Q-learning, temporal difference, and experience replay. With the proposed method, the speed and stability of training can be improved greatly. On one hand, the supplementary controller can work together with the traditional controller online, which can guarantee the stability of the system. On the other hand, the model uncertainties and external disturbances could be restrained through online RL training. The Lyapunov theory is used to prove the convergence of the RL controller's weights theoretically. Finally, three simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

abstract={There is growing interest to explore the autonomous taxiing that can sense its environment and maneuver safely with little or no human input. This technology is like the one developed for driver less cars that synthesize information from multiple sensors, which sense surrounding environment to detect road surface, lanes, obstacles and signage. This paper presents application of computer vision and machine learning to autonomous method for the surface movement of an air vehicle. We present a system and method that uses pattern recognition which aids unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and enhance the manned air vehicle landing and taxiing. Encouraged with our previous results, we extend upon our research to include multiple object relevant to taxiing.

It is useful for training a deep neural network to learn to detect, count specific airport objects in a video or image. This paper details the procedure and parameters used to create training dataset for running convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a set of aerial images for efficient and automated object recognition. In this method, multiple airport surface signage dataset from satellite images are subjected to training for pattern recognition. This trained system learns and then identifies and locates important visual references from imaging sensors and could help in decision making during taxiing phase.},

abstract={On-board object detection is an important requirement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) when carrying out a variety of tasks such as obstacle avoidance, search and rescue, and automatic target recognition. One of the main difficulties of conducting object detection for a UAV is that, because the objects of interest are observed from altitude, this causes them to appear very small in images acquired from an onboard camera. In this work, we attempt to provide a solution to this difficulty, while also seeking to meet two other criteria that are important to the deployment of Artificial Intelligence with UAVs: firstly, the capability to operate in real-time; and secondly, the ability of the user to be able to trust the predictions it makes. To meet the challenge of small object detection we present the use of an image Tile Loader to enhance the capability of Deep Neural Network (DNN) style detectors, while minimising the processing time costs. Furthermore, we also introduce the practice of using Grad-CAM to provide better insights into a detection style architecture as a means to enhance trustworthiness.},

During the UAV inspection, the channel environment and the channel transmission coefficient between the UAV and the base station change in real time. In order to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of communication, the UAV terminal needs to estimate and track the changed channel transmission coefficient in real time, and feed it back to the base station.

abstract={Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has been proven an efficient technique in the present and upcoming cellular networks for improving network performance. Many a time, a direct D2D link may not be available due to longer distance or poor channel quality between two devices. Multi-hop D2D is an effective solution to overcome this limitation of direct D2D communication. Here relay devices help in forwarding data from transmitters to the receivers through single or multiple hops. However, finding suitable fixed relays and their locations is a complex problem, which does not have an efficient solution. In this paper, we have used UAVs (drones) that act as relays for forwarding data between two devices. The proposed approach serves more out of direct range D2D users resulting in a reduced churn rate of the system. We find the trajectory of such UAVs with the help of active user prediction using Neural Networks (NN) to serve all the D2D users by increasing the coverage range of D2D communications. We have estimated the number of active D2D users in every zone covered by each drone and intra and inter-drone communication trajectories. It is also shown that the packet loss ratio remains within the acceptable limit for the proposed trajectories of the UAVs by choosing a sufficient buffer length.},

abstract={Millimeter-wave (mmWave) hybrid analog-digital beamforming is a promising approach to satisfy the low-latency constraint in multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) systems, which serve as network infrastructure for flexible deployment. However, in highly dynamic multi-UAV environments, analog beam tracking becomes a critical challenge. The overhead of additional pilot transmission at the price of spectral efficiency is shown necessary to achieve high resilience in operation. An efficient method to deal with high dynamics of UAVs applies machine learning, particularly Q-learning, to analog beam tracking. The proposed Q-learning-based beam tracking scheme uses current/past observations to design rewards from environments to facilitate prediction, which significantly increases the efficiency of data transmission and beam switching. Given the selected analog beams, the goal of digital beamforming is to maximize the SINR. The received pilot signals are utilized to approximate the desired signal and interference power values, which yield the SINR measurements as well as the optimal digital weights. Since the selected analog beams based on the received power do not guarantee the hybrid beamforming achieving the maximization SINR, we therefore reserve additional analog beams as candidates during the beam tracking. When the candidates include the ideal beams, the combination of analog beams with their digital weights achieving the maximum SINR consequently provides the optimal solution to the hybrid beamforming.},

abstract={The applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military, intelligent transportation, agriculture, rescue operations, natural environment mapping, and many other allied domains has increased exponentially during the past few years. Some of the use cases of their applications range from aerial surveillance, data retrieval to their use in real-time communicative networks. Though UAVs were traditionally used only outdoors, many of its indoor applications like for rescue operations, inventory tracking in warehouses, etc., have recently emerged and these use cases are being actively explored. One of the major challenges for indoor drone applications is navigation and obstacle avoidance. Due to indoor operations, the global positioning system fails in accurate localization and navigation. To address this issue, we introduce a scheme that facilitates the autonomous navigation of UAVs (which have an onboard camera) in the indoor corridors of a building using deep-neural-networks-based processing of images. For a deep neural network, the selection of a good combination of hyperparameters for a better prediction is a complicated task. In this article, the hyperparameters tuning of a convolutional neural network is achieved by using genetic algorithms. The proposed architecture (DCNN-GA) is compared with state-of-the-art ImageNet models. The experimental results show the minimum loss and high performance of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={Individual tree detection is critical for forest investigation and monitoring. Several existing methods have difficulties to detect trees in complex forest environments due to insufficiently mining descriptive features. This study proposes a deep learning (DL) framework based on a designed multichannel information complementarity representation for detecting trees in complex forest using UAV laser scanning point clouds. The proposed method consists of two main stages: ground filtering and tree detection. In the first stage, a modified graph convolution network with a local topological information layer is designed to separate the ground points. Unlike most existing parametric methods, our ground filtering method avoids the optimal parameters selection to adapt to different kinds of environments. For tree detection, a top-down slice (TDS) module is first designed to mine the vertical structure information in a top-down way. Then, a special multichannel representation (MCR) is developed to preserve different distribution patterns of points from complementary perspectives. Finally, a multibranch network (MBNet) is proposed for individual tree detection by fusing multichannel features, which can provide discriminative information for MBNet to detect trees more accurately. MBNet was evaluated on seven forest areas [UAV light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data with the mean size of 14 $000~\text {m}^{2}$ and point density of 250 points/ $\text {m}^{2}$ ]. Experimental results showed that the proposed framework achieves excellent performance. Our method obtains promising performance with a mean recall of 89.23% and a mean F1-score of 87.04%.},

abstract={Small drones, also called mini-UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), have become very wide-spread. In security applications it is often desirable to detect and classify them. In this paper we employ radar micro-Doppler for detection and classification of small drones. Micro-Doppler are Doppler shifts generated by the movements of parts of the target. We have used radar measurements of small drones and birds, generated TVDs (Time Velocity Diagrams), and used a deep learning classifier to distinguish between drones and birds (target detection) and types of drones (target classification) with very good results. Our deep learning classifier is an improvement in classification performance compared to our earlier boosting and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifiers on the same data.},

abstract={Without an effective vaccine, treatment, or therapy, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading like fire and claiming lives. Countries began to adopt various strategies such as lockdown, mass testing, tracing, quarantine, sanitization, isolation, and treatment to contain COVID-19. However, it was soon realized that we need to take the help of powerful technologies to combat the spread of deadly COVID-19 until a vaccine or a drug is discovered. In this article, we discuss how the use of cutting edge technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big data, artificial intelligence (AI), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, blockchain, robotics, autonomous ground vehicles, communication technologies in screening, testing, contact tracing, spread analysis, sanitization, and protocol enforcements can help prevent the COVID-19 spread.},

abstract={There is an increasing demand on utilizing camera equipped drones and their applications in many domains varying from agriculture to entertainment and from sports events to surveillance. In such drone applications, an essential and a common task is tracking an object of interest visually. Drone (or UAV) images have different properties when compared to the ground taken (natural) images and those differences introduce additional complexities to the existing object trackers to be directly applied on drone applications. Some important differences among those complexities include (i) smaller object sizes to be tracked and (ii) different orientations and viewing angles yielding different texture and features to be observed. Therefore, new algorithms trained on drone images are needed for the drone-based applications. In this paper, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (RL) based single object tracker that tracks an object of interest in drone images by estimating a series of actions to find the location of the object in the next frame. This is the first work introducing a single object tracker using a deep RL-based technique for drone images. Our proposed solution introduces a novel reward function that aims to reduce the total number of actions taken to estimate the object's location in the next frame and also introduces a different backbone network to be used on low resolution images. Additionally, we introduce a set of new actions into the action library to better deal with the above-mentioned complexities. We compare our proposed solutions to a state of the art tracking algorithm from the recent literature and demonstrate up to 3.87 % improvement in precision and 3.6% improvement in IoU values on the VisDrone2019 data set. We also provide additional results on OTB-100 data set and show up to 3.15% improvement in precision on the OTB-100 data set when compared to the same previous state of the art algorithm. Lastly, we analyze the ability to handle some of the challenges faced during tracking, including but not limited to occlusion, deformation, and scale variation for our proposed solutions.},

abstract={Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently received increasing attention due to unprecedented ability achieved in playing games. Since then DRL has been successfully applied across different domains. Here we explore the potential of DRL in autonomous power transmission lines inspection. Regular inspection is essential to ensure an optimal efficiency void of hot spots or corona discharges, but challenging due to the extensive geographic scope of the electric network often crossing areas difficult to reach. Traditional inspection is done via helicopters equipped with infrared and ultraviolet cameras. This solution however is costly and dangerous for the crew making solutions based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) an attractive alternative. In this work we use realtime simulations based on AirSim to test several state-of-the-art DRL algorithms in controlling the flight of a quadrotor. The agent is trained on simple and complicated tracks under different landscapes and ambient conditions. Elements from imitation learning are used to speed up training. Visual disturbance is added to the drone in order to test the robustness of the learned policies as well as their adaptivity to different training conditions.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) specifically drones have been used for surveillance, shipping and delivery, wildlife monitoring, disaster management etc. The increase on the number of drones in the airspace worldwide will lead necessarily to full autonomous drones. Given the expected huge number of drones, if they were operated by human pilots, the possibility to collide with each other could be too high. In this paper, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture is proposed to make drones behave autonomously inside a suburb neighborhood environment. The environment in the simulator has plenty of obstacles such as trees, cables, parked cars and houses. In addition, there are also another drones, acting as moving obstacles, inside the environment while the learner drone has a goal to achieve. In this way the drone can be trained to detect stationary and moving obstacles inside the neighborhood and so the drones can be used safely in a public area in the future. The drone has a front camera and it can capture continuously depth images. Every depth image is part of the state used in DRL architecture. Also, another part of the state is the distance to the geo-fence (a virtual barrier on the environment) which is added as a scalar value. The agent will be rewarded negatively when it tries to overpass the geo-fence limits. In addition, angle to goal and elevation angle between the goal and the drone will be used as information to be added to the state. It is considered that these scalar values will improve the DRL performance and also the reward obtained. The drone is trained using Q-Network and its convergence and final reward are evaluated. The states containing image and several scalars are processed by a neural network that joints the two state parts into a unique flow. This neural network is named as Joint Neural Network (JNN) [1]. The training and test results show that the agent can successfully learn to avoid any obstacle in the environment. The results for three scenarios are very promising and the learner drone reaches the destination with a success rate 100% in first two tests and with a success rate 98% in the last test, this one with a total of three drones.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is vulnerable to jamming attacks, which may cause severe damage like communication outages. Due to the energy constraint, the source UAV cannot blindly enlarge the transmit power, along with the complex network topology with high mobility, which makes the destination UAV unable to evade the jammer by flying at will. To maintain communication with a limited battery capacity in the UAV networks in the presence of a greedy jammer, in this paper, we propose a distributed reinforcement learning (RL) based energy-efficient framework for the UAV networks with constrained energy under jamming attacks to improve the communication quality while minimizing the total energy consumption of the network. This framework enables each relay UAV to independently select its transmit power based on historical state-related information without knowing the moving trajectory of other UAVs as well as the jammer. The location and battery level of each UAV need not be shared with other UAVs. We also propose a deep RL based anti-jamming relay approach for UAVs with portable computation equipment like Raspberry Pi to achieve higher and faster performance. We study the Nash equilibrium (NE) and the performance bounds based on the formulated power control game. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can reduce the bit error rate (BER) and reduce energy consumption of the UAV network compared with the benchmark method.},

abstract={Taking the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission planning as the research background, we adopt the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) to establish an effective UAV path planning scheme under obstacle-avoidance constraint in this paper. UAV path planning is the basis and premise of UAV mission execution. The essence of UAV path planning is to obtain the feasible flight path planning from the starting point to the target point according to the specific task of UAV. Simultaneously, effective UAV path planning should reach the optimal performance while meeting the demand of different constraints. ACO is a swarm intelligence algorithm that ants cooperate with pheromone. That is, ACO has great scalability and robustness, which is compatible to UAV path planning problem. In this paper, taking the obstacle-avoidance constraint into consideration, we build an effective UAV path planning strategy based on ACO to acquire the shortest UAV route. Experiments and analyses demonstrate that, when the obstacle number gradually increased from one to three, the proposed algorithm can all achieve the optimal UAV path planning. Hence, the rationality and applicability of the proposed algorithm are verified. Besides, the proposed algorithm can still realize the optimal UAV path planning when further adding the obstacle number and increasing the complexity of multiple obstacles. Thus, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm are ulteriorly proved. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm has certain practical significance.},

abstract={Recently Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or Drones have gained enormous attention in applications like military, agriculture, industry, etc. One approach of controlling the operation of a drone is using hand gestures, which enables designing a low-cost system. However, the accuracy of such a system highly depends on the gesture recognition models. We can use a neural network-based gesture recognition model, which is a widely accepted image recognition scheme. In this work, we first design three deep neural network-based gesture recognition models: simple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), VGG-16, and ResNet-50 to uncover the best model for drone control. We evaluate the proposed models over our generated hand-gesture images in terms of their accuracy, precision, and complexity. The analysis reveals that each of the three models has its advantages and disadvantages while balancing between accuracy and complexity. For example, Simple CNN offers 92% accuracy on the testing set validation with the lowest validation loss compared to VGG-16 and ResNet-50. Thus, users can choose one of the proposed models to match their drone application.},

abstract={In order to improve the autonomous ability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to implement air combat mission, many artificial intelligence-based autonomous air combat maneuver decision-making studies have been carried out, but these studies are often aimed at individual decision-making in 1v1 scenarios which rarely happen in actual air combat. Based on the research of the 1v1 autonomous air combat maneuver decision, this paper builds a multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Firstly, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is used to achieve communication between UAV individuals, and the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model under the actor-critic architecture is established. Secondly, through combining with target allocation and air combat situation assessment, the tactical goal of the formation is merged with the reinforcement learning goal of every UAV, and a cooperative tactical maneuver policy is generated. The simulation results prove that the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model established in this paper can obtain the cooperative maneuver policy through reinforcement learning, the cooperative maneuver policy can guide UAVs to obtain the overall situational advantage and defeat the opponents under tactical cooperation.},

abstract={Recent advances in camera equipped drone applications and their widespread use increased the demand on vision based object detection algorithms for aerial images. Object detection process is inherently a challenging task as a generic computer vision problem, however, since the use of object detection algorithms on UAVs (or on drones) is relatively a new area, it remains as a more challenging problem to detect objects in aerial images. There are several reasons for that including: (i) the lack of large drone datasets including large object variance, (ii) the large orientation and scale variance in drone images when compared to the ground images, and (iii) the difference in texture and shape features between the ground and the aerial images. Deep learning based object detection algorithms can be classified under two main categories: (a) single-stage detectors and (b) multi-stage detectors. Both single-stage and multi-stage solutions have their advantages and disadvantages over each other. However, a technique to combine the good sides of each of those solutions could yield even a stronger solution than each of those solutions individually. In this paper, we propose an ensemble network, SyNet, that combines a multi-stage method with a single-stage one with the motivation of decreasing the high false negative rate of multi-stage detectors and increasing the quality of the single-stage detector proposals. As building blocks, CenterNet and Cascade R-CNN with pretrained feature extractors are utilized along with an ensembling strategy. We report the state of the art results obtained by our proposed solution on two different datasets: namely MS-COCO and visDrone with %52.1 mAPIoU=0.75 is obtained on MS-COCO val2017 dataset and %26.2 mAPIoU=0.75 is obtained on VisDrone test - set.

abstract={Sustainable agriculture is an important field where not much attention is given though it is highly necessary, so as to monitor the growth of crops for their efficient growth in most nutritious ways. For effective growth of crops, lot of chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides are used, however, excessive usage of them results in damage to land and water resources. The attack of pests is a major criteria which affect crop yield. Various crop monitoring technologies are available which are highly expensive and not all farmers can afford. Moreover in India, farmers are not capable of understanding the operation and handling of such sophisticated technology. In this paper, we propose a system which is cheaper and easy to operate with multiple application. The proposed system uses a technology which utilizes machine learning and ANN algorithms using UAV that helps us to locate regions that are affected by diseases and pesticides so that we can particularly focus on the regions that are affected and apply chemicals only in that particular area, with the entire system being cost effective. For this purpose, we divide the entire area into n x n segments and using image processing, the segmented areas are analysed and processed using Ardupilot and a central operating system to monitor using python and open CV, giving the simplest user interface for monitoring purposes.},

abstract={This article presents an automated design and optimization framework for electric transportation power systems (ETPS) enabled by machine learning (ML). The use of physical models, simulations, and optimization methods can greatly aid the engineering design process. However, when considering the optimal co-design of multiple interdependent subsystems that span multiple physical domains, such model-based simulations can be computationally expensive, and traditional metaheuristic optimization methods can be unreliable. Bayesian optimization (BO), an ML framework, paves one feasible pathway to realize an efficient design process practically. However, current state-of-the-art BO algorithms are non-compatible or perform poorly when applied to system-level ETPS design with multiple objectives and constraints. This article proposes a novel BO algorithm referred to as max-value entropy search for multiobjective optimization with constraints (MESMOC) to solve multiobjective optimization (MOO) problems with black-box constraints that can only be evaluated through design simulations. After a full presentation of the algorithm, MESMOC is applied to a realistic ETPS design case using a heavy-duty electric vertical-takeoff-landing (eVTOL) urban aerial vehicle (UAV) power system. Two MOO experimental trials show a drastic reduction in the number of design simulations to discover a high-quality Pareto front. In Trial 1, MESMOC uncovered the entire Pareto front while only requiring to explore ~4% of the design space. With expanded design parameters and larger design space in Trial 2, a near complete but high-quality Pareto front was uncovered. Both trials compared MESMOC to the popular genetic algorithm NSGA-II and another BO algorithm predictive entropy search for multi-objective Bayesian optimization with constraints (PESMOC), showing superior performance.},

abstract={This work examines the relationships among drone swarm characteristics and how they affect swarm performance. A swarm of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is implemented in simulation to cooperatively gather situational awareness data during the first few hours after a major natural disaster. The swarm is controlled by prioritized sets of relatively simple, reactive behaviors, the totality of which result in the emergence of a form of collective intelligence. The behaviors are designed to optimize the coverage area of a simulated camera mounted on each UAV. The behaviors are implemented in simulation on swarms of sizes from 10 to 50 UAVs. The UAVs are each assigned one of 3 different roles, or “personality types”: Social Searcher, Antisocial Searcher, or Relay. 100 different size and personality type distribution configurations were compared over 1000 simulation runs to determine explore the effect of swarm parameters on search success over the target area. The results show that the swarm is successful in locating over 90 % of survivors in less than 40 minutes using the most effective personality type distributions. Results also show that, within in the context of the particular simulation scenario, the addition of any number of Relay UAVs tends to decrease performance of the swarm when compared to a distribution that does not include any Relays. More generally, the work demonstrates the value of the novel approach of applying design of experiment principles to simulation experiments in order to explore optimal swarm configurations.},

The solution was modified from a centralized strategy developed in a previous work in order to be enhanced, so the proposed distributed strategy was tested considering the same experiments, configurations and conditions applied to the centralized approach in a simulated environment. To test the strategy, the planned activity to be performed was planting seeds, in a field composed by a grid of points that represents the places to be sown. Completion times and collision avoidance attempts were measured to test the effectiveness, as well as to perform a comparison between the distributed and centralized methods.

abstract={Main purpose of UAV path planning are shorten the distance, avoid flight threats and obstacles. Planning feasible path intervals is the basis of path planning. In long-distance, multi-obstacle path planning, it is more important to plan a reasonable distance and sufficient safety path. Therefore, aiming at the problem of complex track constraints in long-distance and multi-obstacle path planning, a new method of track initialization and adjustment named elastic track correction is proposed to make up for the limitations of current track initialization and solution space. Using wolf pack intelligence algorithm as validation algorithm, this paper compares the effectiveness of elastic track correction mechanism with that of general planning method, which proves that adding elastic correction mechanism to track planning algorithm can effectively improve the reliability of track planning, and can get a feasible solution of lower cost function.},

abstract={The swarm, a type of multi-agent system, has enjoyed a recent surge in popularity within the autonomous robotics field. Despite a variety of theoretical and simulated research work in the area of swarm theory and multi-agent artificial intelligence, the practical use of swarms remains limited. Though many limiting factors lie on the technical front, one limiting factor may be a lack of appreciation for swarm capabilities and applications as opposed to those of conventional robotics. To help address the latter limiting factor, this paper proposes a definition of a swarm in the context of autonomous robotics, describes many real-world problems that can be addressed through use of swarms, and details current applications of swarming robotic systems.},

abstract={This work continues a line of research examining the relationship between drone sensor swarm characteristics and performance of the swarm as a holistic system. A swarm of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) was implemented in simulation to cooperatively perform a Wide Area Search for survivors in a post-disaster scenario. The sensor swarm was controlled through a behavior-based artificially intelligent paradigm whereby each UAV executes one of three sets of simple, uncoupled search behaviors - Social Searcher, Antisocial Searcher, Relay. The relationship between proportions of these behavior sets and time to find 90% of survivors was examined in swarms of 10-50 UAVs. 100 different swarm size and role distributions were generated using Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) methodology. 1000 (100 swarm size x 10 replications) simulation runs revealed an effective distribution pattern which drones could follow to automatically reallocate roles based on current swarm size. Simulations also revealed multiple configurations of role distributions at various swarm sizes that could consistently locate over 90% of survivors in under 20 minutes.},

With several drones flying simultaneously, the challenge is to increase their level of automation and intelligence while avoiding collision, reducing communication level with these entities, and improving strategical organization to accomplish a specific task. In this sense, we propose a solution to coordinate a UAV swarm using bivariate potential fields with autonomous and distributed intelligence among drones for a cooperative target search application.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications and networks are of utmost concern. However, they have challenges such as the limited on-board energy and restricted transmit power. In this paper, we study a UAV-enabled communication scenario that a set of UAVs perform a virtual antenna array (VAA) to communicate with different remote base stations (BSs) by using collaborative beamforming (CB). To achieve a better transmission performance, the UAV elements can fly to optimal positions by using optimal speeds and adjust to optimal excitation current weights for performing CB transmissions. However, there are some trade-offs between energy consumption and transmission performance. Thus, we formulate a time and energy minimization communication multi-objective optimization problem (TEMCMOP) of CB in UAV networks to simultaneously minimize the total transmission time, total performing time of VAAs and total motion and hovering energy consumptions of UAVs by jointly optimizing the positions, flight speeds and excitation current weights of UAVs, as well as the order of communicating with different BSs. Due to the complexity and NP-hardness of the formulated TEMCMOP, we propose an improved multi-objective ant lion optimization (IMOALO) algorithm with chaos-opposition based learning solution initialization and hybrid solution update operators to solve the problem. Simulation results verify that the proposed IMOALO can effectively solve the formulated TEMCMOP and it has better performance than some other benchmark approaches.},

The paper proposes a cooperative reconnaissance strategy of the UAV group based on particle swarm optimization in uncertain environment. This strategy includes three parts: global search, local search, and cooperative search. In the simulation experiment, we can realize that the probability of discovering the areas where a certain number of reconnaissance objects is located exceeds 99%, and the obtained minimum value of the reconnaissance objective function differs from the actual minimum value by 0.14%. When the two UAV groups cooperate in reconnaissance, the time to complete the reconnaissance mission is reduced by 9.46% with no cooperation.},

abstract={To solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP) for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning, we propose two parallel optimization algorithms. One is the improved genetic algorithm (IGA), and the other is the particle-swarm-optimization-based ant colony optimization algorithm (PSO-ACO). As an indispensable part of UAV cooperative mission assignment, the research of UAV path planning has attracted much attention of scholars. In this paper, according to the characteristics of UAV path planning, we firstly establish a corresponding multi-objective multi-constrained combinatorial optimization model-TSP. In the TSP model, the UAV is considered as the travelling salesman, and the mission target is regarded as the travelling city. Then, considering that TSP is a complex NP-hard problem, this paper carries out two optimization algorithms as IGA and PSO-ACO to solve the TSP model, which both can obtain effective and reasonable UAV path planning schemes. IGA is a kind of evolutionary algorithm with implicit parallel ability and global optimization ability. Through the rational selection of encoding mode and fitness function, and valid setting of selection operator, crossover operator and mutation operator, IGA can solve the TSP with great convergence. PSO-ACO is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm with inherently parallel ability and self-organizing ability, which is perfect for solving TSP. Adopting the idea of particle optimization into ant colony optimization algorithm, ants in PSO-ACO system have the particle characteristics that can adjust the local optimal solution and global optimal solution after completing every single traversal. Finally, in the simulation part, based on the stochastic dynamic map, this paper builds the TSP model for UAV path planning. Through the comprehensive analyses of the optimization results of two proposed parallel optimization algorithms and one contrast approach, we can conclude that the proposed IGA and PSO-ACO algorithms are more rational and effective for solving UAV path planning problem compared with the contrast approach.},

In the absence of ground IoT infrastructure, deploying unmanned aerial vehicle base station (UAV-BS) can provide very efficient wireless communication services. With the expansion of UAV application scenarios, its intelligent requirements are also increasing. Therefore, the work of this paper expects that UAV-BS can independently complete tasks such as 3D hovering and trajectory planning. In this paper, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm and genetic algorithm in machine learning are used to train the UAV-BS. We study the influence of different parameters involved in the UAV communication network on the system performance, and verify that the network system with DDPG and genetic algorithm proposed by us has the best performance.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is mobile and has the advantage of being equipped with cameras, sensors, computing resources and devices for communication. By combining the advantage of communication technology and UAV, rapid response can be made at disaster area and used as a mobile base station in place where traffic demand is high, such as concert venue and sports stadium. In addition, by using data that have been collected by mounted sensors and cameras, the UAV can provide data-based application. However, these services usually use big data processing and machine learning techniques which require high computing power and the UAV is not sufficiently capable of process those applications due to lack of computing resources and battery limitation. To overcome this problem, the UAV can offload task to near Mobile Edge Server that can provide computing resources. Mobile Edge Server can be cellular base station, Wi-Fi access point and so on. When tasks occur in a specific area, one or more UAV need to move the location to acquire data and process. If data processing is too heavy to process at local, the UAV can cooperate mobile edge server. In this situation, we can find out two problems. (i)When the tasks occur, which UAV can process occurred task (ii) When UAV is assigned a task, then a mobile edge server can cooperate with UAV. In this paper, based on Hungarian algorithm which is one of matching algorithm, we propose optimal task-UAV-edge server matching algorithm which minimizes energy consumption and processing time.},

abstract={Recently, Combining communication technology with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been regarding as one of the promising techniques in the future network. Various services can be served through UAV, such as information collection in disaster area or traffic monitoring in smart city. However, on-board computation resource and the battery lifetime of UAV are limited. For that reason, there is a limit to perform analysis, such as, machine learning using collected data. In this situation, UAV can get help from an adjacent Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server that has computing resources. However, the closest MEC server does not always guarantee optimal computing performance and communication efficiency. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose the overall system of machine learning based UAV to MEC computation offloading for data analyzing. First, we define the problems into two. Firstly, we define two problems 1) matching UAV and task cluster in consideration of energy efficiency. 2) Finding optimal MEC server to offload the task to minimize the total processing time and energy consumption. Then, we apply a machine-learning algorithm to solve the two problems. In the simulation section, we analyze the proposed method and greedy method in terms of total energy consumption and total processing time. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism is efficient in total energy consumption of UAV and total processing time of tasks.},

abstract={Fast and accurate vehicle detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images remains a challenge, due to its very high spatial resolution and very few annotations. Although numerous vehicle detection methods exist, most of them cannot achieve real-time detection for different scenes. Recently, deep learning algorithms has achieved fantastic detection performance in computer vision, especially regression based convolutional neural networks YOLOv2. It's good both at accuracy and speed, outperforming other state-of-the-art detection methods. This paper for the first time aims to investigate the use of YOLOv2 for vehicle detection in UAV images, as well as to explore the new method for data annotation. Our method starts with image annotation and data augmentation. CSK tracking method is used to help annotate vehicles in images captured from simple scenes. Subsequently, a regression based single convolutional neural network YOLOv2 is used to detect vehicles in UAV images. To evaluate our method, UAV video images were taken over several urban areas, and experiments were conducted on this dataset and Stanford Drone dataset. The experimental results have proven that our data preparation strategy is useful, and YOLOv2 is effective for real-time vehicle detection of UAV video images.},

abstract={In air-to-ground communications, the network lifetime depends on the operation time of unmanned aerial vehicle-base stations (UAV-BSs) owing to the restricted battery capacity. Therefore, the maximization of energy efficiency and the minimization of outage ground users are important metrics of network performance. To achieve these two objectives, the location and transmit power of the UAV-BSs in the network must be optimized. This optimization problem may not be tractable in the conventional optimization framework because multiple UAV-BSs interact in a complicated manner. Hence, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and develop an algorithm to obtain a solution in a reinforcement learning framework. To avoid a central controller and high computational complexity, we employ a multi-agent distributed Q-learning algorithm to obtain a solution. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent Q-learning-based UAV-BS deployment and power control strategy to maximize energy efficiency and minimize the number of outage users in multi-UAV wireless networks. Through intensive simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can outperform benchmark algorithms in terms of average energy efficiency and number of average outage users in multi-UAV wireless networks.},

abstract={The rising popularity of ICT and the Internet has enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to offer advantageous assistance to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), realizing a relay node's role among the disconnected segments in the road. In this scenario, the communication is done between Vehicles to UAVs (V2U), subsequently transforming into a UAV-assisted VANET. UAV-assisted VANET allows users to access real-time data, especially the monitoring data in smart cities using current mobile networks. Nevertheless, due to the open nature of communication infrastructure, the high mobility of vehicles along with the security and privacy constraints are the significant concerns of UAV-assisted VANET. In these scenarios, Deep Learning Algorithms (DLA) could play an effective role in the security, privacy, and routing issues of UAV-assisted VANET. Keeping this in mind, we have devised a DLA-based key-exchange protocol for UAV-assisted VANET. The proposed protocol extends the scalability and uses secure bitwise XOR operations, one-way hash functions, including user's biometric verification when users and drones are mutually authenticated. The proposed protocol can resist many well-known security attacks and provides formal and informal security under the Random Oracle Model (ROM). The security comparison shows that the proposed protocol outperforms the security performance in terms of running time cost and communication cost and has effective security features compared to other related protocols.},

abstract={With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, the multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have attracted great attention in the fields of source detection and localization. However, as a real-time signal processing performance of the UAV is limited by the computing speed and accuracy of the embedded hardware, the effectiveness of source localization is greatly reduced. Aiming at improving the accuracy and computational efficiency of source localization, a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) weighted multi-UAV network source localization method is proposed based on the deep neural networks (DNN) and spatial spectrum fitting (SSF). The proposed source localization system is composed of UAVs equipped with a radar array. The source location can be achieved using the DOA of the sources signals of UAVs, but the accuracy and real-time performance of the conventional DOA estimation algorithms are not satisfactory, and the data fusion strategy of the conventional cross-location framework needs further improvement. In the proposed method, a DNN-based SSF denoted as the deep SSF (DeepSSF), is designed to achieve accurate DOA estimation. In the DeepSSF, the DOA estimation performance is guaranteed by the DNN’s strong nonlinear fitting ability and highly parallel structure. In addition, based on the obtained DOA information, the source is located once by every two UAVs. Finally, the source localization is realized based on the weighted CRB according to the principle that the more the DOA distribution deviates from zero, the lower the estimation accuracy. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed method.},

abstract={Low-cost real-time identification of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) dynamics is an active area of research supported by the surge in demand and emerging application domains. Such real-time identification capabilities shorten development time and cost, making UAVs' technology more accessible, and enable a wide variety of advanced applications. In this article, we present a novel comprehensive approach, called DNN-MRFT, for real-time identification and tuning of multirotor UAVs using the modified relay feedback test (MRFT) and deep neural networks (DNNs). The main contribution is the development of a generalized framework for the application of DNN-MRFT to higher order systems. One of the notable advantages of DNN-MRFT is the exact estimation of identified process gain, which mitigates the inaccuracies introduced due to the use of the describing function method in approximating the response of Lure's systems. A secondary contribution is a generalized controller based on DNN-MRFT that takes off a UAV with unknown dynamics and identifies the inner loops dynamics in-flight. Using the developed framework, DNN-MRFT is sequentially applied to the outer translational loops of the UAV utilizing in-flight results obtained for the inner attitude loops. DNN-MRFT takes on average 15 s to get the full knowledge of multirotor UAV dynamics, and without any further tuning or calibration, the UAV would be able to pass through a vertical window and accurately follow trajectories achieving state-of-the-art performance. Such demonstrated accuracy, speed, and robustness of identification pushes the limits of state of the art in real-time identification of UAVs.},

The point cloud generated is inadequate to form the full bearing geometry profile. Therefore, the proposed framework projects best-fit circles based on the point cloud curvature to form the full bearing geometry profile so that the required displacement measurement is available for extraction. Several experiments were conducted on a mock-up and actual operational site to validate the proposed framework's accuracy, its robustness and comparison with other state-of-the-art alternatives.},

abstract={In this article, we propose a hierarchical data collection scheme, toward the realization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided industrial wireless sensor networks. The particular application is that of agricultural monitoring. For that, we propose the use of hybrid compressed sampling through exact and greedy approaches. With the exact approach-to model the energy-optimal formulation-an improved linear programming formulation of the minimum cost flow problem was utilized. The greedy approach is based on a proposed balance factor parameter, consisting of data sparsity, and distance from cluster head to normal nodes. To improve node clustering efficiency, a hierarchical data collection scheme is implemented, by which nodes in different layers are adaptively clustered, and the UAV can be scheduled to perform energy-efficient data collection. Simulation results show that our method can effectively collect the data and plan the path for the UAV at a low energy cost.},

These air mesh networks can be suitable for providing communication services in disaster scenarios to ground nodes such as victims and first responders. However, the optimal deployment of UAVs is not an easy as the number of possible scenarios to position the UAVs may reach a computationally challenging level. The combination of global and local search optimization algorithms can be considered as a powerful way for dealing with the massive number of possible solutions. We propose a deployment approach based on a global search algorithm such as the genetic algorithm and a local search algorithm namely the hill climbing algorithm. We show that the combination of both optimization techniques provides promising results for optimal positioning of UAVs in disaster scenarios based on simulation examples.},

abstract={This paper presents the development and hardware implementation of an autonomous battery maintenance mechatronic system that significantly extends the operational time of battery powered small-scaled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A simultaneous change and charge approach is used to overcome the significant downtime experienced by existing charge-only approaches. The automated system quickly swaps a depleted battery of a UAV with a replenished one while simultaneously recharging several other batteries. This results in a battery maintenance system with low UAV downtime, arbitrarily extensible operation time, and a compact footprint. Hence, the system can enable multi-agent UAV missions that require persistent presence. This capability is illustrated by developing and testing in flight a centralized autonomous planning and learning algorithm that incorporates a probabilistic health model dependent on vehicle battery health that is updated during the mission, and replans to improve the performance based on the improved model. Flight test results are presented for a 3-h-long persistent mission with three UAVs that each has an endurance of 8-10 min on a single battery charge (more than 100 battery swaps).},

abstract={Multi-agent reinforcement learning is currently mainly used in many real-time strategy games. For example, StarCraft, UAV combat. Multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms have attracted widespread attention. In large-scale multi-agent environment, there is still the problem of state space explosion. Especially in transfer training, since the network input size is fixed, the existing network structure is difficult to adapt to large-scale scenario transfer training. In this paper, we use aggregation transfer training for multi-agent combat problems from aerial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) combat scenarios to extend the small-scale learning to large-scale and complex scenarios. We combine the graph neural network (GNN) with the MADDPG algorithm to process the agent observation with aggregation function and take it as input. It starts training from a small-scale multi-UAV combat scenario, gradually increases the number of UAV. The experimental results indicate that MADDPG methods for multi-agent UAV combat problems trained via aggregation transfer learning are able to reach the target performance more quickly, provide superior performance, compared with ones trained without aggregation transfer learning. The versatility of the confrontation model has also been improved.},

abstract={In cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, a minimization problem on the weighted sum of time cost and expected outage duration is considered. Taking advantage of UAV’s adjustable mobility, a UAV navigation approach is formulated to achieve the aforementioned optimization goal. Conventional offline optimization techniques suffer from inefficiency in accomplishing the formulated UAV navigation task due to the practical consideration of local building distribution and directional antenna radiation pattern. Alternatively, after mapping the navigation task into a Markov decision process (MDP), a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-aided solution is proposed to help the UAV find the optimal flying direction within each time slot, and thus the designed trajectory towards the destination can be generated. To help the DRL agent commit a better trade-off between sampling priority and diversity, a novel quantum-inspired experience replay (QiER) framework is proposed, via relating experienced transition’s importance to its associated quantum bit (qubit) and applying Grover iteration based amplitude amplification technique. Compared to several representative DRL-related and non-learning baselines, the effectiveness and supremacy of the proposed DRL-QiER solution are demonstrated and validated in numerical results.},

A branch and bound (BaB) based algorithm is proposed to obtain the per-slot optimization. To cope with the dynamic content requests and mobility of users in practical scenarios, the original optimization problem is transformed to a Stackelberg game. Specifically, the game is decomposed into a leader level user association sub-problem and a number of power allocation, UAV deployment and caching placement follower level sub-problems. The long-term minimization was further solved by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm. Simulation result shows that the content delivery delay of the proposed BaB based algorithm is much lower than benchmark algorithms, as the optimal solution in each time slot is achieved.

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been a focus area of the academic and industrial research community. They have been used in many military and civilian applications. Emergency communication is one of the essential requirements for first responders and victims in the aftermath of natural disasters. In such scenarios, UAVs may configure ad hoc wireless networks to cover a large area. In UAV networks, however, localization and routing are challenging tasks owing to the high mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and limited energy of UAVs. Here, we propose swarm-intelligence-based localization (SIL) and clustering schemes in UAV networks for emergency communications. First, we propose a new 3-D SIL algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that exploits the particle search space in a limited boundary by using the bounding box method. In the 3-D search space, anchor UAV nodes are randomly distributed and the SIL algorithm measures the distance to existing anchor nodes for estimating the location of the target UAV nodes. Convergence time and localization accuracy are improved with lower computational cost. Second, we propose an energy-efficient swarm-intelligence-based clustering (SIC) algorithm based on PSO, in which the particle fitness function is exploited for intercluster distance, intracluster distance, residual energy, and geographic location. For energy-efficient clustering, cluster heads are selected based on improved particle optimization. The proposed SIC outperforms five typical routing protocols regarding packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and routing overhead. Moreover, SIC consumes less energy and prolongs network lifetime.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly considered to act as base stations (BSs) for the future wireless networks. Some of the crucial UAV-assisted network design challenges are the network coverage, throughput, and energy efficiency. Therefore, fast, low-complexity, and efficient UAV placement and resource allocation strategies are imperative. This paper presents a novel variable height multi-UAV deployment strategy to exploit the 3D flexibility of UAVs as BSs. We propose a multi-tier variable height UAV-based network deployment and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art equal height deployment. Height optimization is performed to deliver energy efficiency and throughput maximization for each cell. The results show that our proposed method is more energy-efficient in a multi-cell UAV network than the most widely used height optimization method in the literature. In UAV networks, users at the cell edges can receive very poor signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) levels due to interfering UAVs. To cope with this problem, we adopt a fractional frequency reuse (FFR) scheme to compensate low SINR levels. We optimize the SINR threshold corresponding to each cell to maximize their spectral efficiency (SE), thereby improving the network's area spectral efficiency (ASE). The numerical results show that the proposed deployments provide significant gains in coverage density, SINR coverage probability, rate coverage, and ASE compared to equal height benchmark scheme. As the number of UAVs increases, the number of tiers need to increase to preserve the rate coverage of the network. Moreover, the performance of the proposed variable height model is expected to converge to that of equal height cellular design for a large number of UAVs.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a delay-aware Q-learning-based routing algorithm - XiA - for sending data from users to nearest Access Points (APs) through Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms communicating using 6G technology. These UAVs assist the ground networks in overcoming communication voids while maneuvering through different demographics. However, the communication links in the THz band have limited transmission range, causing the UAVs to frequently disconnect from the swarm. We overcome such issues by waiting until the UAV comes in contact with others in case of non-time-sensitive data. In the case of time-sensitive data, the UAVs send the data to the APs through Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. To empower XiA to adapt to the changing environments and expensive delays in LEO, we model the rewards by accounting for spreading and absorption in the 6G channels, and Doppler effect and pointing error in the satellite channel. We show our bias for the parameters through extensive simulations and prove that the Q-model in XiA achieves convergence under all conditions. Additionally, in comparison with state-of-the-art solutions, we observe that XiA offers an improved delay of 82%.},

abstract={Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN) is considered as the key structure of the next generation network.

In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based traffic offloading for SAGIN by considering the high mobility of nodes as well as frequent changing network traffic and link state. In the proposal, a double Q-learning algorithm with improved delay-sensitive replay memory algorithm (DSRPM) is proposed to train the node to decide offloading strategy based on the local and neighboring historical information. Furthermore, a joint information collection with hello package and offline training mechanism is proposed to assist the proposed offloading algorithm.

abstract={In this work, we consider the downlink of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted cellular network consisting of multiple cooperative UAVs, whose operations are coordinated by a central ground controller using the fronthaul communications, to serve multiple ground users. A problem of jointly designing UAV's location, transmit beamforming, as well as UAV-user association is formulated in the form of mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to maximize the sum user achievable rate while considering the constraints of limited fronthaul capacity. Solving the formulated problem is computationally hard owing to the its non-convex nature and the unavailability of channel state information (CSI) due to the undetermined and flexible movement of UAVs. To tackle these effects, we propose a novel algorithm exploiting the deep Q-learning approach to take the hassles of unavailable CSI for determining UAV's location and invoking the difference of convex (DC) based optimization method to efficiently solve for the UAV's transmit beamforming and UAV-user association given the determined UAV's location. The algorithm recursively solves the formulated problem until convergence. Numerical results show that our design outperforms the existing work in terms of algorithmic convergence and network performance and achieve a gain of up to 70% compared to the existing algorithms.},

In addition, the next hop selection based on local information can not always be conducive to the global message forwarding. In this letter, we propose an adaptive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted geographic routing with Q-Learning. The routing scheme is divided into two components. In the aerial component, the global routing path is calculated by the fuzzy-logic and depth-first-search (DFS) algorithm using the UAV-collected information like the global road traffic, which is then forwarded to the ground requesting vehicle. In the ground component, the vehicle maintains a fix-sized Q-table converged with a well-designed reward function and forwards the routing request to the optimal node by looking up the Q-table filtered according to the global routing path. The simulation results show the proposed approach performs remarkably well in packet delivering and end-to-end delay.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be an integral part of wireless networks. In this paper, we aim to find collision-free paths for multiple cellular-connected UAVs, while satisfying requirements of connectivity with ground base stations (GBSs) in the presence of a dynamic jammer. We first formulate the problem as a sequential decision making problem in discrete domain, with connectivity, collision avoidance, and kinematic constraints. We, then, propose an offline temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm with online signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) mapping to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is constructed and trained offline by TD method to encode the interactions among the UAVs and between the UAVs and the environment; and an online SINR mapping deep neural network (DNN) is designed and trained by supervised learning, to encode the influence and changes due to the jammer. Numerical results show that, without any information on the jammer, the proposed algorithm can achieve performance levels close to that of the ideal scenario with the perfect SINR-map. Real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed with high success rates, and collisions are avoided.},

abstract={With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology and the drastic growth of multi-UAV collaborative applications, research on UAV Ad-Hoc Network (UAVNET) has received extensive attention in recent years. Due to the decentralization nature and being prone to failure and high dynamics, the performance of traditional contention-based carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) protocols and variants is far from satisfaction for UAVNETs. In this paper, we propose an intelligent access mechanism based on actor-critic (AC) algorithm, called AC-CSMA, with aim of achieving low access collision rate and high throughput for UAVNETs in dynamic environments. The UAVs are modeled as decision-making agents without priori information about the network (e.g., the number of nodes, link conditions, and other agents' strategies). Individual UAV agents learn their optimal strategy by using the historical sensory information including the number of collisions or successful transmissions. Numerical results show that the proposed AC-CSMA mechanism significantly outperforms traditional access mechanism in terms of collision rate and throughput for UAVNETs without compromising access fairness.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted extensive interests from both academia and industry due to the potential wide applications with universal applicable nature of the deployment. However, currently the bottleneck for UAVs is the limited carried energy resources (e.g. oil box, battery), especially for electric-driven UAVs. For a system consisting of multiple UAVs using batteries, its stability depends on each UAV. Therefore, the lifetime of each UAV is expected to be extended. In this paper, we propose the concept of RF charging aerially for the UAV fleet. Specifically, in order to ensure the stability of the system, wireless charging is considered for enhancing the lifetime of each UAV. However, it may be unbalanced. Accordingly, the issue of charging scheduling arises. The problem is formulated as a Q-Learning problem in this paper. Agent constantly explores and optimizes its scheduling policy. Finally, it can adapt to different UAV distribution situations. We take the energy levels of UAVs as input, which is easy for implementation. We have compared with two other algorithms (RSA and LESA) and compared with the case of no-charging. The results show that comparing with no-charging, the stability of the system can be improved by up to 78%. Compared with RSA and LESA, system stability is increased by up to 30%-40%. In addition, our method is more flexible and applicable to fleet than other ways (such as return to base station, landing to power line, ground laser, etc) to supplement energy.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communications have several promising advantages, such as the ability to facilitate on-demand deployment, high flexibility in network reconfiguration, and high chance of having line-of-sight (LoS) communication links. In this paper, we aim to optimize the UAV control for maximizing the UAV's energy efficiency, in which both aerodynamic energy and communication energy are considered while ensuring the communication requirements for each ground terminal (GT) and backhaul link between the UAV and the terrestrial base station (BS). The mobility of the UAV and GTs lead to time-varying channel conditions that make the environment dynamic. We formulate a nonconvex optimization for controlling the UAV considering the practical angle-dependent Rician fading channels between the UAV and GTs, and between the UAV and the terrestrial BS. Traditional optimization approaches are not able to handle the dynamic environment and high complexity of the problem in real-time. We propose to use the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) method that can improve the performance of the UAV compared to the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method in such a dynamic environment as in this paper.},

abstract={We consider the downlink of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted cellular network consisting of multiple cooperative UAVs, whose operations are coordinated by a central ground controller using wireless fronthaul links, to serve multiple ground user equipments (UEs). A problem of jointly designing UAVs’ positions, transmit beamforming, as well as UAV-UE association is formulated in the form of mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to maximize the sum UEs’ achievable rate subject to limited fronthaul capacity constraints. Solving the considered problem is hard owing to its non-convexity and the unavailability of channel state information (CSI) due to the movement of UAVs. To tackle these effects, we propose a novel algorithm comprising of two distinguishing features: (i) exploiting a deep Q-learning approach to tackle the issue of CSI unavailability for determining UAVs’ positions, (ii) developing a difference of convex algorithm (DCA) to efficiently solve for the UAV’s transmit beamforming and UAV-UE association. The proposed algorithm recursively solves the problem of interest until convergence, where each recursion executes two steps. In the first step, the deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm allows UAVs to learn the overall network state and account for the joint movement of all UAVs to adapt their locations. In the second step, given the determined UAVs’ positions from the DQL algorithm, the DCA iteratively solves a convex approximate subproblem of the original non-convex MINLP problem with the updated parameters, where the problem’s variables are transmit beamforming and UAV-UE association. Numerical results show that our design outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of algorithmic convergence and network performance with a gain of up to 70%.},

abstract={The effective trajectory design of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is investigated for improving the capacity of the communication system. The aim is for maximizing real-time downlink capacity under the coverage constraint by reaping the mobility benefits of UAVs. The problem of three-dimension (3D) dynamic movement of UAVs under coverage constraint is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) problem, while a constrained Deep Q-Network (cDQN) algorithm is proposed for solving the formulated problem. In the proposed cDQN model, each UAV acts as an agent to explore and learn its 3D deploying policy. The aim of the proposed cDQN model is for obtaining the maximum capacity while attempting to guarantee that all ground terminals (GTs) are covered. In order to satisfy the coverage constraint, a primal-dual method is adopted for training primal variable and dual variable (lagrangian multiplier) in turn. Furthermore, in an effort to reduce the action space of the cDQN algorithm, prior information is utilized for eliminating the invalid actions by the action filter. Experiment results demonstrate that the cDQN algorithm is capable of converging after some training steps. Additionally, the UAVs are capable of adapting the movement of GTs under the coverage constraint according to the 3D deploying policy derived from the proposed cDQN algorithm.},
