We develop a novel predictive monitoring system for smart city applications, which consists of an RNN-based predictor with uncertainty estimation and a new specification language, named Signal Temporal Logic with Uncertainty. The solution first predicts a sequence of distributions representing city's future states with uncertainty estimation and then checks the predicted results against STL-U specified safety and performance requirements. The system supports decision making by providing a quantitative satisfaction degree with confidence guarantees. We receive promising results from evaluations on two large-scale city datasets, and on a case study on real-time predictive monitoring in a simulated smart city.",

The method is supervised, and uses different ensembles of either linear (logistic regression) or non-linear (random forests) classifiers. Experiments with data available from 2013 to 2017 for every citizen in Copenhagen receiving home care (27,775 citizens) show that prediction can achieve state of the art performance as reported in similar health related domains (AUC=0.715). We further find that competitive results can be obtained by using limited information for training, which is very useful when full records are not accessible or available. Smart city analytics does not necessarily require full city records. To our knowledge this preliminary study is the first to predict large increases in home care for smart city analytics.",ensemble learning; home care; smart city analytics

A new category of crowdsourcing-based urban anomaly reporting systems have been developed to enable pervasive and real-time reporting of anomalies in cities (e.g., noise, illegal use of public facilities, urban infrastructure malfunctions). An interesting challenge in these applications is how to accurately predict an anomaly in a given region of the city before it happens. Prior works have made significant progress in anomaly detection. However, they can only detect anomalies after they happen, which may lead to significant information delay and lack of preparedness to handle the anomalies in an efficient way. In this paper, we develop a Crowdsourcing-based Urban Anomaly Prediction Scheme (CUAPS) to accurately predict the anomalies of a city by exploring both spatial and temporal information embedded in the crowdsourcing data. We evaluated the performance of our scheme and compared it to the state-of-the-art baselines using four real-world datasets collected from 311 service in the city of New York. The results showed that our scheme can predict different categories of anomalies in a city more accurately than the baselines.",crowdsourcing; anomaly prediction; Bayesian inference; smart cities

Accessibility leads to improvements in human rights and business outcomes; due to inclusion of a broader range of the population. For example, adding braille writing to signs and installing ramps allow visually-impaired people and the wheel-chaired to navigate on their own.While digital-maps have evolved in recent years to become a part of our everyday life, available ones primarily cover vehicular roads only with limited, if any, accessibility information. This highly limits the range of applications they can support. In this paper, we present our vision for ubiquitous accessibility digital-maps for smart cities; where the maps' indoor and outdoor spaces are automatically updated with the various accessibility-features and marked to assess their accessibility levels for the different disability types such as vision-impairment, wheel-chaired, deafness, etc.To realize this vision, we describe an architecture for a crowd-sourcing-based system to automatically construct the accessibility maps.

Also, the application of artificial intelligence technology, which applied to multiple fields, has attracted many researchers, and a great deal of research is underway. Specifically, in many fields, including the network industry, the reinforcement learning technique has gained attention.

This information can be very valuable for transportation planing. For instance, knowing which parking spots are currently available close to my destination is very valuable in order to reduce the travel time and thus, maximize the resource usage and minimize the traffic load. The future development of this information is usually uncertain. However, algorithms for routing applications should consider that new information will become available during travelling along the computed path. In order to exploit the provided information to a full extend, it is not sufficient to compute a static route or travel plan because the optimality of the plan might degrade as the state of the environment might consistently change. We argue that in order to plan transportation and understand observed trajectories in smart environments, it is necessary to compute action policies (i.e. the most promising action for all situations and in particular, the encountered situations) instead of static routes. Analogously, it makes sense to understand human behaviour based on the sequence of decisions in the encountered situations. To compute and analyse policies, the field of reinforcement learning already provides a rich set of tools. We describe existing approaches of reinforcement learning in spatial tasks and highlight which new challenges arise from developing reinforcement learning techniques for smart environments.",routing; reinforcement learning; Markov decision process; real-time information; smart cities; artificial intelligence

First, we address the nosiness of the online photo collections, such as imprecise geolocation and uneven spatial distribution, by performing location and indoor/outdoor filtering, and semi-supervised dataset augmentation. Our indoor/outdoor classifier achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and approaches human-level accuracy.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is designed for IoT devices, and its received signal strength indicator (RSSI) has been used in distance and proximity estimation, though they are noisy and unreliable. In this study, we leverage the BLE TX power level in BLE models.We adopt a comparative analysis framework that utilizes our extensive data library of measurements. It considers commonly used state-of-the-art model, in addition to our data-driven proposed approach. The RSSI and TX power are integrated into several parametric models such as log shadowing and Android Beacon library models, and machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests and neural networks. Specific mobile apps are developed for the study experiment. We have collected more than 1.8 millions of BLE records between encounters with various distances that range from 0.5 to 22 meters in an indoor environment. Interestingly, considering TX power when estimating the distance reduced the mean errors by up to 46% in parametric models and by up to 35% in machine learning models.

We perform spatial hotspot detection and show that different emotions have distinct spatial distributions that match expectations. We also perform temporal analysis using the capture time of the photos. Our spatio-temporal hotspot detection correctly identifies emerging concentrations of specific emotions and year-by-year analyses of select locations show there are strong temporal correlations between the predicted emotions and known events.,emotion recognition; deep learning; geotagged photos; hotspot detection; spatio-temporal geographic analysis

These devices have low memory capacity and processing power, which makes them easy targets for attackers. The research community has proposed different approaches to deal with emerging variants of attacks on IoT devices using various machine learning techniques. However, these approaches rely heavily on the classifier’s categorization of a given record while ignoring its confidence. This paper proposes a verification-based scheme to reject IoT attacks by utilizing the classifier’s confidence. At the same time, existing studies are evaluated using traditional cross-validation approaches (e.g., k-fold), thus, not tested against unknown attacks. We propose using the leave-one-attack-out (LOAO) cross-validation scheme to evaluate the generalizability of the application to unknown attacks. The experiments are performed on Med BIoT, a publicly available dataset consisting of three IoT attacks. The system’s robustness is evaluated in terms of Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) and Equal Error rates (EERs).

However, the fidelity and amount of sensors deployed at different geo-communities are closely related to their socioeconomic conditions, demographics, and entrenched geographic patterns, causing inequal sensing opportunities across communities. The biased sensing data contain distorted spatio-temporal patterns of undersensed community, inducing unfairness in subsequent algorithmic prediction and decision-making. This work characterize this unfairness propagation chain of sensing - learning - decision-making process. We introduce the first formal mathematical definitions to quantify and decouple community-level unfairness induced by joint cascading effects of sensing inequality and algorithmic bias. Our real-world experiments with vehicular crowdsensing system in Cangzhou, China verifies that sensing inequality, especially community-level gap of sensor fidelity, result in large fairness gap in spatio-temporal data imputation task. Our preliminary results show that sensing inequality amplifies the algorithmic bias. This work is a critical first step in formally defining and understanding unfairness propagation in intelligent spatio-temporal urban monitoring system.",fairness; crowdsensing systems; urban monitoring

Apache Storm, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Kafka Streams and Hazelcast Jet are some of the popular stream processing engines.

Then, the pre-processed streams are forwarded to other stream processing engines like Apache Kafka for real stream processing.

Nevertheless, most of the current solutions concerning this are either insufficiently aligned with the corresponding real-life business processes, or are too expensive, or are not enough ""interdisciplinary"". We propose an approach that is claimed to be not only easy-to-implement but also not expensive to facilitate. The approach allows for clustering the ""observed"" moving vehicles and the data gathering is essentially based on a Forward Scattering (FS) radar. Such a solution offers a number of features such as: relatively simple hardware, an enhanced target radar cross section (compared to traditional radar), a long coherent interval of the receiving signal, robustness to stealth technology, and possible operation using non-cooperative transmitters. Further, a FS-based vehicle detection would not pollute the radio distribution with additional radio signals. Finally, the presence of GPS signals anywhere allows for a worldwide use. The data-analytics-related tasks (that are essentially driven by Machine Learning) are realized using tools, such as IBM SPSS Statistics and K-Means Cluster Analysis. The strengths of the proposed approach are partially justified by experimental data that is however only limited to the approach itself. Said otherwise, broader validation studies have not yet been conducted, such that the proposed approach is ""compared"" to other existing solutions. This is planned as future research. Still, the initial results obtained inspire us already to expect that the proposed signal processing of GPS signal shadows combined with Machine Learning can be successfully applied in practice for clustering moving objects in general, and in particular - for clustering vehicles in the context of road traffic.",signal processing; estimation; clustering

More importantly, these factors may change over time and conflict with each other which makes the recommendations produced by current parking recommender systems ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel problem called multi-objective parking recommendation. We present a solution by designing a multi-objective parking recommendation engine called MoParkeR that considers various conflicting factors together.

Then an anomaly classification network is introduced to predict the abnormal score for each category.

It is helpful to alleviate the impact of the imbalance of abnormal categories in the test phase and obtain more accurate localization results.

This paper provides a new method for access control in IoT based on the booming technology ""Block Chain,"" which helps the user in accessing or controlling their data. The contribution consists of a description of the model used to show how a blockchain is used for creating access control methods. To implement the method, the blockchain is taken as the decentralized access manager. The proposed method is validated with respect to the previous related work. Finally, the limitations and future work of the paper are discussed. Access Control Systems are proved to provide access control to critical resources.

These systems allow complex queries on streaming data to be distributed across multiple worker nodes in a cluster.DSPS often provide the tools to add/remove resources and take advantage of cloud infrastructure to scale their operation. However, the decisions behind this are generally left to the administrators of these systems. There have been several studies focused on finding optimal operator deployments of DSPS operators across a cluster. However, these systems often do not optimise with regard to a given Service Level Agreement (SLA) and where they do, they do not take incoming workload into account. To our knowledge there has been little or no work based around proactively scaling the DSPS with regard to incoming workload in order to maintain SLAs.This PhD will focus on predicting incoming workloads using time series analysis. In order to assess whether a given predicted workload will breach a SLA the response of a DSPS work flow to incoming workload will be modelled using a queuing theory approach. The intention is to build a system that can tune the parameters of this queuing theoretic model, using output metrics such as end-to-end latency and throughput, as the DSPS is running. The end result will be a system that can identify potential SLA breaches before they happen, and initiate a proactive scaling response.Initially, Apache Storm will be used as the test DSPS, however it is anticipated that the system developed during this PhD will be applicable to other DSPS that use a graph-based description of the streaming work flow e.g. Apache Spark and Flink.",latency modelling; workload modelling; distributed stream processing; auto-scaling; queueing theory

To deal with massive RDF streams on the server-side, distributed RDF stream systems have been intensively studied, where many user queries are processed simultaneously using multiple computing nodes. For making query processing more efficient, it is important to cope with the changes of RDF streams in data rate and data distribution. However, the state-of-the-art methods cannot cope with it. To this problem, we propose a cost model for distributed RDF query processing and a dynamic load-balancing method based on the model.

Several researchers have proposed different approaches to reduce privacy risks. However, most of the existing solutions still suffer from various drawbacks, such as huge bandwidth utilization and network latency, heavyweight cryptosystems, and policies that are applied on sensor devices and in the cloud. To address these issues, fog computing has been introduced for IoT network edges providing low latency, computation, and storage services. In this survey, we comprehensively review and classify privacy requirements for an in-depth understanding of privacy implications in IoT applications. Based on the classification, we highlight ongoing research efforts and limitations of the existing privacy-preservation techniques and map the existing IoT schemes with Fog-enabled IoT schemes to elaborate on the benefits and improvements that Fog-enabled IoT can bring to preserve data privacy in IoT applications. Lastly, we enumerate key research challenges and point out future research directions.",fog computing; context privacy; IoT privacy; Fog-enabled IoT; Internet of Things; Content privacy

Clustering techniques required by these domains differ from traditional clustering methods due to the high economic and social costs of spurious results (e.g., false alarms of crime clusters). As a result, statistical rigor is needed explicitly to control the rate of spurious detections. To address this challenge, techniques for statistically-robust clustering (e.g., scan statistics) have been extensively studied by the data mining and statistics communities. In this survey, we present an up-to-date and detailed review of the models and algorithms developed by this field. We first present a general taxonomy for statistically-robust clustering, covering key steps of data and statistical modeling, region enumeration and maximization, and significance testing. We further discuss different paradigms and methods within each of the key steps.

This study performs a systematic literature review of the state of the art of SLA-specific management for Cloud-hosted BDAAs. The review surveys the challenges and contemporary approaches along this direction centering on SLA. A research taxonomy is proposed to formulate the results of the systematic literature review. A new conceptual SLA model is defined and a multi-dimensional categorization scheme is proposed on its basis to apply the SLA metrics for an in-depth understanding of managing SLAs and the motivation of trends for future research.",SLA metrics; SLA; service level agreement; Big data; service layer; big data analytics application

SDN can provide connectivity between Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in a flexible and automated way, whereas NFV can use SDN as part of a service function chain. There are many studies designing NFV/SDN architectures in different environments. Researchers have been trying to address reliability, performance, and scalability problems using different architectural designs. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focuses on integrated NFV/SDN architectures, with the following goals: (i) to investigate and provide an in-depth review of the state of the art of NFV/SDN architectures, (ii) to synthesize their architectural designs, and (iii) to identify areas for further improvements. Broadly, this SLR will encourage researchers to advance the current stage of development (i.e., the state of the practice) of integrated NFV/SDN architectures and shed some light on future research efforts and the challenges faced.",quality of service; resource scheduling; cloud computing; network function virtualization; Software-defined networking; resource provisioning; network virtualization; elasticity; reliability; security; service-level agreement; resource management; mobile networks; scalability; autonomic management

Surv.,ACM,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is present in many participants from the energy, health, manufacturing, transport, and public sectors. Many factors catalyze IIoT, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and intelligent decentralized manufacturing. However, the convergence between IT, OT, and IoT environments involves the integration of heterogeneous technologies through protocols, standards, and buses. However, this integration brings with it security risks. To avoid the security risks, especially when systems in different environments interact, it is important and urgent to create an early consensus among the stakeholders on the IIoT security. The default Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) offers a mechanism to measure the severity of an asset's vulnerability and therefore a way to characterize the risk. However, CVSS by default has two drawbacks. On the one hand, to carry out a risk analysis, it is necessary to have additional metrics to the one established by CVSSv3.1. On the other hand, this index has been used mostly in IT environments and although there are numerous efforts to develop a model that suits industrial environments, there is no established proposal. Therefore, we first propose a survey of the main 33 protocols, standards, and buses used in an IIoT environment. This survey will focus on the security of each one. The second part of our study consists of the creation of a framework to characterize risk in industrial environments, i.e., to solve both problems of the CVSS index. To this end, we created the Vulnerability Analysis Framework (VAF), which is a methodology that allows the analysis of 1,363 vulnerabilities to establish a measure to describe the risk in IIoT environments.",Industrial Security; Industrial Internet of Things; Attack Patterns; CVSS; Information Technologies; Risk analysis; Cybersecurity pillars; IIoT; Operational Technologies

Current state-of-art frameworks (e.g. Apache Flink [1]) enable each operator to work in isolation by creating data copies, at the expense of increased memory utilization. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of deduplication techniques to address the challenge of reducing memory footprint for window-based stream processing without significant impact on performance. We design a deduplication method specifically for window-based operators that rely on key-value stores to hold a shared state. We experiment with a synthetically generated workload while considering several deduplication scenarios and based on the results, we identify several potential areas of improvement. Our key finding is that more fine-grained interactions between streaming engines and (key-value) stores need to be designed in order to better respond to scenarios that have to overcome memory scarcity.",sliding-window aggregations; Apache Flink; streaming analytics; Big Data; memory deduplication

To maintain Moore's-Law scaling of integration value, the industry is urgently exploring beyond-silicon and beyond-CMOS device, interconnect and memory options, as well as heterogeneous, ""More than Moore"" integration and packaging technologies. This coincides with a turning point for the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) field, which has for 50+ years been a key enabler of the semiconductor industry's amazing growth. Maturation of the EDA industry and its related academic research efforts inevitably result in a spiral of declining valuations (multiples), venture capital investments, research funding, and student interest. To counter this trajectory, the EDA field's business models, research portfolios, and funding models have been going through various diversifications, but in a rather ad-hoc manner. This begs the question of how the paradigms and research methodologies of EDA can be leveraged for design automation (DA) in other, emerging domains. Arguably, more efficient evolution and growth as a community requires a more systematic, coherent effort -- as well as forward-looking vision -- to steer by. In this paper, we review initial efforts of a new IEEE CEDA technical activity group dedicated to this purpose. These efforts span the cataloguing of past and current research trends, development of new metrics of research impact, and visions for future applications of EDA paradigms in broader design automation contexts. It is hoped that these efforts will be useful to the EDA community as it continues to evolve beyond its ""E-roots"".",

Auton. Adapt. Syst.,ACM,"Crowdsourcing has recently been significantly explored. Although related surveys have been conducted regarding this subject, each has mainly consisted of a review of a single aspect of crowdsourcing systems or on the application of crowdsourcing in a specific application domain. A crowdsourcing system is a comprehensive set of multiple entities, including various elements and processes. Multiagent computing has already been widely envisioned as a powerful paradigm for modeling autonomous multi-entity systems with adaptation to dynamic environments. Therefore, this article presents a novel multiagent perspective and approach to understanding crowdsourcing systems, which can be used to correlate the research on crowdsourcing and multiagent systems and inspire possible interdisciplinary research between the two areas. This article mainly discusses the following two aspects: (1) The multiagent perspective can be used for conducting a comprehensive survey on the state of the art of crowdsourcing, and (2) the multiagent approach can bring about concrete enhancements for crowdsourcing technology and inspire future research directions that enable crowdsourcing research to overcome the typical challenges in crowdsourcing technology. Finally, this article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the multiagent perspective by comparing it with two other popular perspectives on crowdsourcing: the business perspective and the technical perspective.",crowdsourcing elements; multiagent systems; Crowdsourcing systems; crowdsourcing processes

Surv.,ACM,"The rapid evolution of mobile devices, their applications, and the amount of data generated by them causes a significant increase in bandwidth consumption and congestions in the network core. Edge Computing offers a solution to these performance drawbacks by extending the cloud paradigm to the edge of the network using capable nodes of processing compute-intensive tasks. In the recent years, vehicular edge computing has emerged for supporting mobile applications. Such paradigm relies on vehicles as edge node devices for providing storage, computation, and bandwidth resources for resource-constrained mobile applications. In this article, we study the challenges of computation offloading for vehicular edge computing. We propose a new classification for the better understanding of the literature designing vehicular edge computing. We propose a taxonomy to classify partitioning solutions in filter-based and automatic techniques; scheduling is separated in adaptive, social-based, and deadline-sensitive methods, and finally data retrieval is organized in secure, distance, mobility prediction, and social-based procedures. By reviewing and analyzing literature, we found that vehicular edge computing is feasible and a viable option to address the increasing volume of data traffic. Moreover, we discuss the open challenges and future directions that must be addressed towards efficient and effective computation offloading and retrieval from mobile users to vehicular edge computing.",data retrieval; Computation offloading; vehicular cloud

Auton. Adapt. Syst.,ACM,"Background: Self-awareness has been recently receiving attention in computing systems for enriching autonomous software systems operating in dynamic environments.Objective: We aim to investigate the adoption of computational self-awareness concepts in autonomic software systems and motivate future research directions on self-awareness and related problems.Method: We conducted a systemic literature review to compile the studies related to the adoption of self-awareness in software engineering and explore how self-awareness is engineered and incorporated in software systems. From 865 studies, 74 studies have been selected as primary studies. We have analysed the studies from multiple perspectives, such as motivation, inspiration, and engineering approaches, among others.Results: Results have shown that self-awareness has been used to enable self-adaptation in systems that exhibit uncertain and dynamic behaviour. Though there have been recent attempts to define and engineer self-awareness in software engineering, there is no consensus on the definition of self-awareness. Also, the distinction between self-aware and self-adaptive systems has not been systematically treated.Conclusions: Our survey reveals that self-awareness for software systems is still a formative field and that there is growing attention to incorporate self-awareness for better reasoning about the adaptation decision in autonomic systems. Many pending issues and open problems outline possible research directions.",research challenges; software architecture; Adaptation processes; self-properties; self-aware software; self-adaptive software; systematic literature review; survey
