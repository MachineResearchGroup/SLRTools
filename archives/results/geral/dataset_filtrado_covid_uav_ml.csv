The Centralized Cloud Server (CCS) provides the facility to compute critical tasks at the central data server, but it consumes more time due to the distance between CSS and edge device. In this article, we discuss the advantages of edge computing over cloud computing to overcome latency and reliability issues in critical applications. Moreover, the idea of processing and analyzing massive applications at the edge comes up with the requirement of building intelligence at the edge to compute complex tasks within a negligible time. Edge intelligence offers intelligence at the edge to process large datasets for critical computations and to overcome storage issues. Also, the performance tolerant connectivity and low-speed rate issues with 4G and 5G can be solved using a 6G wireless network. The 6G connected edge intelligence application offers ultra-low-latency, security, and reliability mechanisms that could be helpful in COVID-19 pandemic situations. We have also discussed the demonstration of aforementioned massive application in the form of a case study on combating COVID-19 situations using 6G-based edge intelligence. The case study depicts the benefits of using 6G (latency: 10−100μs) over 4G (latency: <10ms) and 5G (latency: <5ms) communication networks. The proposed 6G-enabled scheme is compared against the traditional 4G and 5G networks to designate its efficiency in terms of communication latency and network mobility. Eventually, we then analyzed various open issues and research challenges in this emerging research area for future gains and insights.",Edge intelligence; 6G; Ultra-reliable low-latency; COVID-19; Internet of drones; Holographic communication

The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, earlier witnessed by the citizens of China alone, has now become a matter of grave concern for virtually every country in the world. The scarcity of resources to endure the COVID-19 outbreak combined with the fear of overburdened healthcare systems has forced a majority of these countries into a state of partial or complete lockdown. The number of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases has been increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world, with reportedly more than 3 million confirmed cases as of 30 April 2020. Adding to these woes, numerous false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in regards to coronavirus, are being circulated regularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19. In response to such acts, we draw on various reliable sources to present a detailed review of all the major aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct health implications associated with the outbreak of COVID-19, this study highlights its impact on the global economy.

The adoption of the IoT has brought about tremendous innovation opportunities in industries, homes, the environment, and businesses. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of the IoT have sparked concerns for wide adoption and applications. Unlike traditional information technology (I.T.) systems, the IoT environment is challenging to secure due to resource constraints, heterogeneity, and distributed nature of the smart devices. This makes it impossible to apply host-based prevention mechanisms such as anti-malware and anti-virus. These challenges and the nature of IoT applications call for a monitoring system such as anomaly detection both at device and network levels beyond the organisational boundary. This suggests an anomaly detection system is strongly positioned to secure IoT devices better than any other security mechanism. In this paper, we aim to provide an in-depth review of existing works in developing anomaly detection solutions using machine learning for protecting an IoT system. We also indicate that blockchain-based anomaly detection systems can collaboratively learn effective machine learning models to detect anomalies.",cybersecurity; anomaly detection; the Internet of Things; machine learning; deep learning; blockchain

It is similar to influenza viruses and raises concerns through alarming levels of spread and severity resulting in an ongoing pandemic worldwide. Within eight months (by August 2020), it infected 24.0 million persons worldwide and over 824 thousand have died. Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are very helpful in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. This work investigates the drone-based systems, COVID-19 pandemic situations, and proposes an architecture for handling pandemic situations in different scenarios using real-time and simulation-based scenarios. The proposed architecture uses wearable sensors to record the observations in Body Area Networks (BANs) in a push–pull data fetching mechanism. The proposed architecture is found to be useful in remote and highly congested pandemic areas where either the wireless or Internet connectivity is a major issue or chances of COVID-19 spreading are high. It collects and stores the substantial amount of data in a stipulated period and helps to take appropriate action as and when required. In real-time drone-based healthcare system implementation for COVID-19 operations, it is observed that a large area can be covered for sanitization, thermal image collection, and patient identification within a short period (2 KMs within 10 min approx.) through aerial route. In the simulation, the same statistics are observed with an addition of collision-resistant strategies working successfully for indoor and outdoor healthcare operations.

As an IoT-enabled paradigm, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) can offer more possibilities for data collection to support various IoT applications and services. As an extension, MCS can be used for data gathering amid COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Bridging Artificial Intelligence and IoT can achieve not only maintaining low infection rates of COVID-19 but can also facilitate an effective rapid testing strategy to reduce community spread. In this research, an intelligent strategy to deploy autonomous vehicle-based mobile testing facilities is proposed to enable early detection of infected cases based upon MCS data acquired through smart devices via wireless communications such as Wifi, LTE and 5G. To this end, a Self Organizing Feature Map is designed to manage MCS-based data for planning of the autonomous mobile assessment centers. Pre-identified zero-day locations and worst-case scenario are considered to determine the best combination for MCS participation rate and budget limitations. Numerical results demonstrate that once 30% of MCS participants are recruited, it becomes possible to cover the pre-identified zero-day locations and enable detection of infected cases under the worst case scenario to determine the AV routes more efficiently than other options for a certain number of neurons in SOFM. The worst-case scenario demonstrates that 30% participant rate ensures detection of infected cases in 27 days for 81 stops even infected cases are outside of the autonomous vehicle testing coverage.",COVID-19; Pandemic; Mobile crowdsensing; Autonomous vehicle; Mobile assessment center; Route planning; Participatory systems; Decision making; Machine learning; Self organizing feature map

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided mobile relaying technology is one of the effective means of provisioning service in such situations. In this paper, as the part of the rescuing operation in a certain disaster spot, we consider a mobile relaying technique, where an UAV acts as a relay node to ferry data between two disconnected floating or fixed nodes. For the sake of simplicity and low cost, amplify-and-forward relaying capability is adopted for the UAV. We consider the maximization of end-to-end throughput of such a system by optimizing the source/UAV power allocation as well as the trajectory of the UAV while considering practical mobility constraints (on the speed and initial/final locations of the UAV) as well as signal causality constraints. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, and hence intractable to solve. Therefore, similar to the existing solution approach, we solve the problem via an iteration-based solution strategy, however we solve the source/UAV power allocation and the UAV trajectory design problems per iteration in a different manner. For the source/UAV power allocation problem, we provide heuristic solutions while considering both the availability and absence of a buffer at the UAV node. On the other hand, for the given power assignment, we adopt the geometric programming (GP)-based approach upon the transformation of variables and constraints. Furthermore, under the free initial and final UAV locations, jointly optimal power allocation and UAV trajectory are derived. Through extensive simulation, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme while comparing with one existing work.",amplify-and-forward (AF) mobile relay; power optimization; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); trajectory design

This paper proposes a method for forming a profile of access subject authentication allowing differentiated development of adaptive algorithms to verify the legitimacy of operations. This eliminates the disadvantages of existing traditional authentication methods based on the use of explicit verification methods associated with the fact that in order to establish the authenticity of the user are used identifying characteristics that can be compromised by attackers.

The intelligent monitoring of people's social distances in crowds is one of the most significant events caused by the coronavirus. The virus is spreading more quickly among the crowds, and the disease cycle continues in congested areas. Due to the error that occurs when humans monitor their activity, an automated model is required to alert to social distance violations in crowds. As a result, this article proposes a two-step framework based on autonomous UAV videos, including human tracking and deep learning-based recognition of the crowd's social distance. The deep architecture is a modified-fast and lightweight ShuffleNet learning structure. First, the Kalman filter is used to determine the positions of individuals, and then the modified ShuffleNet is used to refine the bounding boxes obtained and determine the social distance. The social distance is calculated using the initial refinement of the bounding box obtained during the tracking step and the scale in frames of the human body. The observed average accuracy, average processing time (APT), and processed frame per second (FPS) for three congestion datasets were 97.5%, 84 milliseconds, and 11.5 FPS, respectively. Real-time decision-making was achieved by reducing the size and resolution of the frames. Additionally, the frames were re-labeled to reduce the computational complexity associated with detecting social distancing. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method could operate more quickly and accurately on various resolution frames of UAV videos with difficult conditions.",Social factors;Human factors;Monitoring;Videos;COVID-19;Kalman filters;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);COVID-19;social distancing;deep transfer learning;tracking;modified ShuffleNet.

The charm and beauty of coral reefs attract tourists, and they play a vital role in preserving biodiversity, ceasing coastal erosion, and promoting business trade. However, they are declining because of over-exploitation, damaging fishery, marine pollution, and global climate changes. Also, coral reefs help treat human immune-deficiency virus (HIV), heart disease, and coastal erosion. The corals of Australiaâ€™s great barrier reef have started bleaching due to the ocean acidification, and global warming, which is an alarming threat to the earthâ€™s ecosystem. Many techniques have been developed to address such issues. However, each method has a limitation due to the low resolution of images, diverse weather conditions, etc. In this paper, we propose a bag of features (BoF) based approach that can detect and localize the bleached corals before the safety measures are applied. The dataset contains images of bleached and unbleached corals, and various kernels are used to support the vector machine so that extracted features can be classified. The accuracy of handcrafted descriptors and deep convolutional neural networks is analyzed and provided in detail with comparison to the current method. Various handcrafted descriptors like local binary pattern, a histogram of an oriented gradient, locally encoded transform feature histogram, gray level co-occurrence matrix, and completed joint scale local binary pattern are used for feature extraction. Specific deep convolutional neural networks such as AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception v3, and CoralNet are being used for feature extraction.

Many blockchain technologies have been proposed or implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to uncover and summarise the main feature of these technologies. Objective: This study aims to explore proposed or implemented blockchain technologies used to mitigate the COVID-19 challenges as reported in the literature. Methods: We conducted a scoping review in line with guidelines of PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). To identify relevant studies, we searched 11 bibliographic databases (e.g., EMBASE and MEDLINE) and conducted backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. The study selection and data extraction were conducted by 2 reviewers independently. Data extracted from the included studies was narratively summarised and described. Results: 19 of 225 retrieved studies met eligibility criteria in this review. The included studies reported 10 used cases of blockchain to mitigate COVID-19 challenges; the most prominent use cases were contact tracing and immunity passports. While the blockchain technology was developed in 10 studies, its use was proposed in the remaining 9 studies. The public blockchain technology was the most commonly utilized type in the included studies. All together, 8 different consensus mechanisms were used in the included studies. Out of 10 studies that identified the used platform, 9 studies used Ethereum to run the blockchain. Solidity was the most prominent programming language used in developing blockchain technology in the included studies. The transaction cost was reported in only 4 of the included studies and varied between USD 10−10 and USD 5. The expected latency and expected scalability were not identified in the included studies. Conclusion: Blockchain technologies are expected to play an integral role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Many possible applications of blockchain were found in this review; however, most of them are not mature enough to reveal their expected impact in the fight against COVID-19. We encourage governments, health authorities, and policymakers to consider all blockchain applications suggested in the current review to combat COVID-19 challenges. There is a pressing need to empirically examine how effective blockchain technologies are in mitigating COVID-19 challenges. Further studies are required to assess the performance of blockchain technologies’ fight against COVID-19 in terms of transaction cost, scalability, and/or latency when using different consensus algorithms, platforms, and access types.",Blockchain; Novel coronavirus; COVID-19; 2019-nCov; SARS-CoV-2

In accordance, mobile applications, robots and drones, social media platforms (such as search engines, Twitter, and Facebook), television, and associated technologies deployed in tackling the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak are discussed adequately, emphasizing the current-state-of-art. A collective discussion on reported literature, press releases, and organizational claims are reviewed. This review addresses and highlights how these effective modern technological solutions can aid in healthcare (involving contact tracing, real-time isolation monitoring/screening, disinfection, quarantine enforcement, syndromic surveillance, and mental health), communication (involving remote assistance, information sharing, and communication support), logistics, tourism, and hospitality. The study discusses the benefits of these digital technologies in curtailing the pandemic and ‘how’ the different sectors adapted to these in a shorter period. Social media and television’s role in ensuring global connectivity and serving as a common platform to share authentic information among the general public were summarized. The World Health Organization and Governments’ role globally in-line with the prevention of propagation of false news, spreading awareness, and diminishing the severity of the COVID-19 was discussed. Furthermore, this collective review is helpful to investigators, health departments, Government organizations, and policymakers alike to facilitate a quick and effective pandemic response.",Healthcare; Disinfection; Real-time monitoring; SARS-CoV-2; Technology

Earlier it was a serious issue in china whereas now it is being witnessed by citizens all over the world. Scientists are working hard to find treatment and vaccines for the coronavirus, also termed as covid. With the growing literature, it has become a major challenge for the medical community to find answers to questions related to covid-19. We have proposed a machine learning-based system that uses text classification applications of NLP to extract information from the scientific literature. Classification of large textual data makes the searching process easier thus useful for scientists. The main aim of our system is to classify the abstracts related to covid with their respective journals so that a researcher can refer to articles of his interest from the required journals instead of searching all the articles. In this paper, we describe our methodology needed to build such a system. Our system experiments on the COVID-19 open research dataset and the performance is evaluated using classifiers like KNN, MLP, etc. An explainer was also built using XGBoost to show the model predictions.",COVID-19; Text classification; KNN; MLP; XGBoost; Explainability

In this regard, we focus on an ultra-dense wireless network consisting of Femto Access Points (FAPs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), known as caching nodes, where there are more than one possible caching node to handle user's request. To efficiently cope with the dynamic topology of wireless networks and time-varying behavior of ground users, our focus is to develop an efficient connection scheduling framework, where ground users are autonomously trained to determine the optimal caching node, i.e., UAV or FAP. Our aim is to minimize users' access delay by maintaining a trade-off between the energy consumption of UAVs and the occurrence of handovers. To achieve these objectives, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem and propose the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Q-Network-based Connection Scheduling (CQN-CS) framework. More specifically, to solve the constructed multi-objective connection scheduling problem, a deep Q-Network model is developed as an efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to train ground users to handle their requests in an optimal and trustworthy fashion within the coupled UAV-based femtocaching network. The effectiveness of the proposed CQN-CS framework is evaluated in terms of the cache-hit ratio, user's access delay, energy consumption of UAVs, handover, lifetime of the network, and cumulative rewards.

The various diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and pests limit citrus production. Citrus gummosis disease, caused by the fungus Phytophthora spp., is the main fungal disease of citrus in Brazil. The lesions caused to the trunk and roots by Phytophthora spp. lead losses in production, foot and root rot, brown fruit rot, canopy discoloration and leaf yellowing. Remote sensing is a nondestructive detection technology, that has been used to detect phytosanitary problems in agricultural crops. Multi and hyperspectral sensors on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively applied in agriculture. In this study, the capability for the detection of citrus gummosis was evaluated in two data sets. The first one considered hyperspectral images acquired with a 25 band sensor covering a spectral range from 500 nm to 840 nm, and the second data set was a simulated 3 band of multispectral sensor. The results indicated a better performance for the detection of citrus gummosis with the hyperspectral images than with three bands multispectral images. The high dimensionality of the hyperspectral data and the detailed spectral information allowed a more accurate classification of citrus gummosis infected plants. The classification maps were validated with field data and achieved an accuracy of 0.79 (F-score = 0.55) for the health map produced with multispectral data and an accuracy of 0.94 (F-score = 0.85) for the health map produced by the hyperspectral data.",Citrus gummosis; Remote sensing; Precision agriculture; Health map

We apply the suggested method to several benchmark functions to show its efficiency. The outcomes reveal that our algorithm performs superior to most existing algorithms in the literature in most benchmarks. Moreover, we apply our algorithm for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic in the US.

Here, we first analyzed the spectral differences between MDMV-infected red leaves and healthy leaves and constructed a sensitive index (SI) for measurements. Next, based on the characteristic bands (RÎ») associated with leaf anthocyanins (Anth), we determined vegetation indices (VIs) commonly used in plant physiological and biochemical parameter inversion and established a vegetation index (VIc) by utilizing the combination of two arbitrary bands following the construction principles of NDVI, DVI, RVI, and SAVI. Furthermore, we developed classification models based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) in order to distinguish the red leaves from healthy leaves. Finally, we performed UR, MLR, PLSR, PCR, and SVM simulations on Anth based on RÎ», VIs, VIc, and RÎ» + VIs + VIc and indirectly estimated the severity of MDMV infection based on the relationship between the reflection spectra and Anth. Distinct from those of the normal leaves, the spectra of red leaves showed strong reflectance characteristics at 640 nm, and SI increased with increasing Anth. Moreover, the accuracy of the two VIc-based classification models was 100%, which is significantly higher than that of the VIs and RÎ»-based models. Among the Anth regression models, the accuracy of the MLR model based on RÎ» + VIs + VIc was the highest (R2c = 0.85; R2v = 0.74). The developed models could accurately identify MDMV and estimate the severity of its infection, laying the theoretical foundation for large-scale remote sensing-based monitoring of this virus in the future.",plant disease; band selection; machine learning; anthocyanin; hyperspectral reflectance; linear discriminant analysis; precision crop protection

It has severely shrunk the global economy in the year 2020, including India. The blue economy and especially the small-scale fisheries sector in India have dwindled due to disruptions in the fish catch, market, and supply chain. This research presents the applicability of satellite data to monitor the impact of COVID-19 related lockdown on the Indian fisheries sector. Three harbors namely Mangrol, Veraval, and Vankbara situated on the north-western coast of India were selected in this study based on characteristics like harbor&rsquo;s age, administrative control, and availability of cloud-free satellite images. To analyze the impact of COVID in the fisheries sector, we utilized high-resolution PlanetScope data for monitoring and comparison of &ldquo;area under fishing boats&rdquo; during the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown phases. A support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm was used to identify the area under the boats. The classification results were complemented with socio-economic data and ground-level information for understanding the impact of the pandemic on the three sites. During the peak of the lockdown, it was found that the &ldquo;area under fishing boats&rdquo; near the docks and those parked on the land area increased by 483%, 189%, and 826% at Mangrol, Veraval, and Vanakbara harbor, respectively. After phase-I of lockdown, the number of parked vessels decreased, yet those already moved out to the land area were not returned until the south-west monsoon was over. A quarter of the annual production is estimated to be lost at the three harbors due to lockdown. Our last observation (September 2020) result shows that regular fishing activity has already been re-established in all three locations. PlanetScope data with daily revisit time has a higher potential to be used in the future and can help policymakers in making informed decisions vis-&agrave;-vis the fishing industry during an emergency situation like COVID-19.",COVID-19; fishing; harbors; marine resources; food security; PlanetScope

Spatial and temporal analyses of beachgoer behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic,article,Ocean & Coastal Management,ScienceDirect,"Tourism localities worldwide continue to grapple with how best to sustain coastal visitation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging epidemiological science illustrates the risk of disease transmission is lower outdoors than indoors, and exposure is likely lower in outdoor, coastal environments due to dispersion and dilution of respiratory droplets through regular air flow. That said, it remains unclear how beachgoer behavior affects the likelihood of disease transmission. During summer 2020, we analyzed publicly-available beachcam video data and collected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery at the recreational beach oceanfront in Virginia Beach, U.S.A. Data were collected over 24 days, documenting tourists' and recreationists’ behaviors related to the public health guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Public Health and City of Virginia Beach. Specifically, using a sample test area of beach and adjoining boardwalk, we investigated diurnal patterns of beach and boardwalk use, the location and density of use, as well as the presence of face coverings (i.e., masks) on boardwalk users. Results from beachcam analyses indicate a curvilinear trend in beach use, peaking in the mid-afternoon, while boardwalk use remained consistent throughout the day. Beachcam observations were corroborated by UAV photography and spatial analysis, indicating concentrated use of the beach adjoining shoreline above high tide, with onethird of the landward adjacent upper beach vacant. Among boardwalk pedestrians, few (8.7%) were observed wearing facial coverings. These findings point to both indirect and direct strategies coastal managers can implement to communicate when, where, and how to reduce the potential for transmission while accessing beach amenities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19; Coastal tourism; Physical distancing; Outdoor recreation; Indirect and direct management

This narrative takes sociomaterial arrangements for granted and conceptualizes technology affordance - the problem-solving capability of a technology - as a standard built-in feature that automatically activates during technology deployment, leading to undiversified and predetermined collective benefits. This paper demonstrates that not everything is as it seems; implementing a technology is a necessary but insufficient condition for triggering its potential problem-solving capability. The potential affordance and effects of a technology are mediated by the sociomaterial arrangements that users assemble to connect their goals to the materiality of technological artifacts and socio-organizational context in which technology deployment takes place. To substantiate this argument and illustrate the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements, we build on sociomateriality and technology affordance theory, and we present the results of a systematic review of Covid-19 literature in which 2187 documents are examined. The review combines text data mining, co-occurrence pattern recognition, and inductive coding, and it focuses on four digital technologies that public authorities have deployed as virus containment measures: infrared temperature-sensing devices; ICT-based surveillance and contact-tracing systems; bioinformatic tools and applications for laboratory testing; and electronic mass communications media.

Although ultraviolet light and chemical sprays are routines for indoor disinfection, they irritate humans, hence can only be used when the facility is unoccupied. Stationary air filtration systems, while being irritation-free and commonly available, fail to protect all occupants due to limitations in air circulation and diffusion. Hence, we present a novel collaborative robot (cobot) disinfection system equipped with a Bernoulli Air Filtration Module, with a design that minimizes disturbance to the surrounding airflow and maneuverability among occupants for maximum coverage. The influence of robotic air filtration on dosage at neighbors of a coughing source is analyzed with derivations from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. Based on the analysis, the novel occupant-centric online rerouting algorithm decides the path of the robot. The rerouting ensures effective air filtration that minimizes the risk of occupants under their detected layout. The proposed system was tested on a 2 × 3 seating grid (empty seats allowed) in a classroom, and the worst-case dosage for all occupants was chosen as the metric. The system reduced the worst-case dosage among all occupants by 26% and 19% compared to a stationary air filtration system with the same flow rate, and a robotic air filtration system that traverses all the seats but without occupant-centric planning of its path, respectively.

A mask manufacturer often receives a large amount of orders that must be processed within a short response time. It is of critical importance for the manufacturer to schedule and reschedule mask production tasks as efficiently as possible. However, when the number of tasks is large, most existing scheduling algorithms require very long computational time and, therefore, cannot meet the needs of emergency response. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural network, which takes a sequence of production tasks as inputs and produces a schedule of tasks in a real-time manner. The network is trained by reinforcement learning using the negative total tardiness as the reward signal. We applied the proposed approach to schedule emergency production tasks for a medical mask manufacturer during the peak of COVID-19 in China. Computational results show that the neural network scheduler can solve problem instances with hundreds of tasks within seconds. The objective function value obtained by the neural network scheduler is significantly better than those of existing constructive heuristics, and is close to those of the state-of-the-art metaheuristics whose computational time is unaffordable in practice.",Emergency production; Flow shop scheduling; Neural network; Reinforcement learning; Public health emergencies

Increasing ship traffic in ports leads to the growing emission of air pollutants, which influences the air quality and public health in the surrounding areas. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted relevant regulations (e.g., Annex VI of IMO's pollution prevention treaty (MARPOL) and mandatory energy-efficiency measures) to address ship emissions. To ensure the effective implementation of such regulations and measures, air emission detection and monitoring has become crucial. In this paper, a dynamic multitarget path planning model is developed to realize multi-UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) performing synergistic detection of ship emissions in ports. A path planning algorithm under a dynamic environment is developed to establish the model. This algorithm incorporates a Tabu table into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve its optimization ability, and it obtains the initial detection route of each UAV based on a “minimum ring” method. This paper describes a multi-UAVs synergistic algorithm to formulate the path reprogramming time in a dynamic environment by judging and cutting the “minimum ring”. This finding proves the improved efficiency of air pollution detection by UAVs. It provides useful insights for maritime and port authorities to detect ship emissions in practice and to ensure ship emission reduction for better air quality in the postpandemic era.",UAVs; Ship emissions; Air pollution; Path planning; Dynamic multiobjective; PSO

In this context, bacteriophages are investigated as potential sustainable biocontrol agents. Here, recent advances in phage biocontrol are reviewed and considered within the framework of integrated plant protection strategies. This shows that understanding the pathogen’s biology is crucial to develop a targeted strategy, tailored to individual pathosystems and driven by biotechnological insights. Moreover, the potential synergy of phages in contemporary farming practices based on the Internet of Things is proposed, potentially enabling a timely and cost-efficient treatment of plants at an early stage of the disease. Finally, these prospects are placed in the regulatory context of virus-oriented integrated pest control.",

Accordingly, 5G systems and 5G-enabled e-health solutions are paramount. This paper highlights methodologies to effectively utilize 5G for e-health use cases and its role to enable relevant digital services.

In this context, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be occasionally used to watch these activities, to ensure that health measures are applied, and to trigger alerts when an anomaly is detected. Consequently, we propose in this paper a complete UAV framework for intelligent monitoring of post COVID-19 outdoor activities. Specifically, we propose a three-step approach. In the first, captured images are analyzed using machine learning to detect and locate individuals. The second step consists of a novel coordinates mapping approach to evaluate distances among individuals and cluster them, while the third step provides an energy-efficient and reliable UAV trajectory to further inspect clusters for restrictions violation. Obtained results provide important insights towards the efficient design of the framework: 1) Efficient detection of individuals depends on the angle from which the images were captured, 2) coordinates mapping is very sensitive to estimate errors in individuals’ bounding boxes, and 3) UAV trajectory design algorithm 2-Opt is recommended for practical real-time deployments due to its low-complexity and near-optimal performance.",Autonomous aerial vehicles;Cameras;Surveillance;Social factors;Human factors;COVID-19;Detectors;Object detection;clustering;unmanned aerial vehicle;computer vision;image coordinates mapping

This study was conducted to (1) develop protocol to predict maize streak virus (MSV) and grain yield using UAV-derived multispectral data; and (2) identify the suitable predictor variables and ideal phenological stages for MSV and grain yield prediction. Twenty-five maize varieties were evaluated under artificial MSV inoculation. Manual scoring and multispectral imaging measurements were performed at mid-vegetative, flowering and mid-grain filling stages. UAV-derived data were acquired in the multispectral bands of Green (0.53–0.57 μm), Red (0.64–0.68 μm), Red-edge (0.73–0.74 μm) and Near-Infrared (0.77–0.81 μm). Eight vegetation indices were determined: NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), NDVIred-edge, GNDVI (green normalized difference vegetation index), SR (simple ratio), CIgreen (green chlorophyll index), CIred-edge (red-edge chlorophyll index), SAVI (soil-adjusted vegetation index) and OSAVI (optimized SAVI). Finally, predictions of MSV and grain yield were performed with 36 models using multiple regression, decision trees and linear regression. Frequently selected variables for MSV prediction were Green band at vegetative (61.5%), Red band at vegetative (68.4%) and flowering (80.4%), and GNDVI at mid-vegetative (88.7%). The best MSV predictors were GNDVI (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.85), CIgreen (r = 0.83; RMSE = 0.86) and Red band (r = 0.77; RMSE = 0.99) measured at mid-vegetative stage. Six out of 36 models were selected as ideal for predicting maize grain yield: RF-REF-NIRF (r = 0.69; RMSE = 0.65); NDVIREG-GNDVIG (r = 0.74; RMSE = 0.56); RV-NIRV (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.37); and the tree with the largest correlations are RV-NIRV-RF (r = 0.86; RMSE = 0.32); GNDVIV-OSAVIV (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.36); GV-RV-NIRV (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.35); the last two of which were at mid-vegetative stage. We conclude that UAV-based multispectral remote sensing is a reliable tool for phenotyping MSV disease and grain yield prediction, and mid-vegetative appear to be the most ideal phenological stage for MSV and grain yield prediction.",Maize; UAV; Multispectral data; Remote sensing; Maize streak virus; High-throughput phenotyping; Yield prediction

A key priority in this regard is the effective monitoring of the affected systems' state after a DE has occurred. Earlier work shows relevant strengths of drone technology for that purpose. In this paper, we take a functional perspective of this technology, for the sake of considering monitoring services and addressing DE. We conceptualize those services and provide explicit insight as it concerns the alignment between user needs and technological (drone-specific) solutions. Further, we zoom in, considering adaptation features, sensing features, and data analytics features accordingly. Finally, we present our general implementation vision that puts drones in a system-of-systems perspective. Since this is work-in-progress, validation is left for future research.",Resilience; Disruptive events; Societal impact; Drone technology
