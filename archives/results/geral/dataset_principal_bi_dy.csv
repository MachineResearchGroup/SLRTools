Starting from the characteristics of SLI, in particular of syntactic impairment, and from the need to develop metalinguistic awareness, assuming that the latest researches in computer programming assessing it as a language are right, we show the theoretical possibility to treat linguistic impairments, for what concerns linguistic and social difficulties, through the use of visual programming, in particular of Scratch. This study does not have an application in the field yet, but we believe in the importance of sharing these ideas.",syntactical treatment; Scratch; metalinguistic awareness; programming; bilingualism; Specific Language Impairment; SLI

This work seeks to change this through early detection via machine learning models that predict dyslexia by observing how people interact with a linguistic computer-based game. We designed items of the game taking into account (i) the empirical linguistic analysis of the errors that people with dyslexia make, and (ii) specific cognitive skills related to dyslexia: Language Skills, Working Memory, Executive Functions, and Perceptual Processes. . Using measures derived from the game, we conducted an experiment with 267 children and adults in order to train a statistical model that predicts readers with and without dyslexia using measures derived from the game. The model was trained and evaluated in a 10-fold cross experiment, reaching 84.62% accuracy using the most informative features.",machine learning; diagnosis; serious games; linguistics; dyslexia; screening; early detection

In this work, we present an approach for universal screening of dyslexia using machine learning models with data gathered from a web-based language-independent game. We designed the game content taking into consideration the analysis of mistakes of people with dyslexia in different languages and other parameters related to dyslexia like auditory perception as well as visual perception. We did a user study with 313 children (116 with dyslexia) and train predictive machine learning models with the collected data. Our method yields an accuracy of 0.74 for German and 0.69 for Spanish as well as a F1-score of 0.75 for German and 0.75 for Spanish, using Random Forests and Extra Trees, respectively. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that risk of dyslexia is screened using a language-independent content web-based game and machine-learning. Universal screening with language-independent content can be used for the screening of pre-readers who do not have any language skills, facilitating a potential early intervention.",universal screening; visual; web-based assessment; language-independent; auditory; pre-readers; detection; dyslexia; gamification; serious games

Although the new algorithm used for this unique feature is language independent, our first prototype is for Spanish. To evaluate DysWebxia we carried out two different user studies. One to evaluate the quality of the synonyms on demand that included 32 participants with dyslexia and 38 strong readers without dyslexia, and another one to evaluate the usability of the app based on 12 participants. Our results show that the quality of the synonyms generated by the new algorithm outperforms a frequency based baseline, and that the participants found DysWebxia very usable.

In the United States and Spain, dyslexia is associated with a large percentage of school drop out. Current methods to detect risk of dyslexia are language specific, expensive, or do not scale well because they require a professional or extensive equipment. A central challenge to detecting dyslexia is handling its differing manifestations across languages. To address this, we designed a browser-based game, Dytective, to detect risk of dyslexia across the English and Spanish languages. Dytective consists of linguistic tasks informed by analysis of common errors made by persons with dyslexia. To evaluate Dytective, we conducted a user study with 60 English and Spanish speaking children between 7 and 12 years old. We found children with and without dyslexia differed significantly in their performance on the game. Our results suggest that Dytective is able to differentiate school age children with and without dyslexia in both English and Spanish speakers.",early detection; linguistics; assessment; screening; dyslexia; diagnosis; games

The barriers that may be faced can be linked to the way the system is designed and content is written. There may be complex language or a layout that is dense, cluttered and lacks clear markers regarding the key points being made. Many organizations have provided guidance for web developers and authors offering suitable ways to ensure those accessing a website or service will have a pleasurable experience. However, it appears that there are still websites hosting pages with dense text, convoluted instructions and little support for those with low levels of literacy. When considering poor reading skills, the cause may be due to many factors including a lack of education, sensory and /or intellectual impairments and specific difficulties such as dyslexia. This means that the vast majority of online content may be hard to understand for a significant proportion of the world’s population. Moreover, these individuals may also lack digital skills, with little realization that assistive technologies and the availability of supportive access strategies can be helpful in these situations. This paper aims to introduce the idea of enhancing readability of web content by using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as linked data, natural language processing and image recognition to make available a wide range of automatically mapped multilingual symbols that can be used to clarify text content. In the past only a few symbol sets have been mapped and it was not possible to consider their appropriateness for text to symbol translations in a wide range of languages and cultural settings.",literacy support; readability; artificial intelligence; multilingual symbols

Our research aims at exploring the use of Conversational Agents (CAs) to support linguistic assessment and training among children with language impairment. One of the open research issues in this arena concerns the identification of the most appropriate form of ""embodiment"" of the CA for children to interact with. To this end, we evaluated the linguistic performance of 14 neuro-typical children and 3 children with language impairment comparing different CAs - physical object and virtual character - with ""traditional"" human interaction. Based on our analysis, we identify insights for the design of CA: the physicality does influence the performance of linguistic tasks for children with linguistic impairment. In addition, children seem to show a preference for the physical CA and perceived it as smarter than the virtual one.",speech therapy; children perception; linguistic assessment; conversational agent

In this paper, we propose a graph-based method commonly used in information retrieval to improve word-level alignments in order to align a source narrative to narrative retellings elicited in a clinical setting. From these alignments, we automatically extract narrative recall scores which can then be used for diagnostic screening. The significant reduction in alignment error rate (AER) afforded by the graph-based method results in improved automatic scoring and diagnostic classification. The approach described here is general enough to be applied to almost any narrative recall scenario, and the reductions in AER achieved in this work attest to the potential utility of this graph-based method for enhancing multilingual word alignment and alignment of comparable corpora for more standard NLP tasks.",

However, little is known about how to support these students in CS/CT instruction, especially at this young age. TIPP&amp;SEE, a meta-cognitive strategy that scaffolds learning by proceduralizing engagement through example code, may offer some support.

These applications are designed to capture each character and mouse movement as isolated events as an indicator of cognitive processes. The current research project explores the possibilities of aggregating the logged process data from the letter level (keystroke) to the word level by merging them with existing lexica and using NLP tools. Linking writing process data to lexica and using NLP tools enables researchers to analyze the data on a higher, more complex level.In this project the output data of Inputlog are segmented on the sentence level and then tokenized. However, by definition writing process data do not always represent clean and grammatical text. Coping with this problem was one of the main challenges in the current project. Therefore, a parser has been developed that extracts three types of data from the S-notation: word-level revisions, deleted fragments, and the final writing product. The within-word typing errors are identified and excluded from further analyses. At this stage the Inputlog process data are enriched with the following linguistic information: part-of-speech tags, lemmas, chunks, syllable boundaries and word frequencies.",

At these early ages, young learners are developing cognitive abilities foundational to their education. While other discipline-based education fields, such as math, science, and reading, have long studied the role of cognitive abilities, such as short-term working memory and long-term retrieval, in their respective fields, similar research in computer science education is relatively sparse. In this exploratory study, we examined the relationship between cognitive abilities and CS/CT performance of fourth-grade students (ages 9-10) who underwent either an introductory CT curriculum based on Use–&gt;Modify–&gt;Create or the same curriculum with additional scaffolding from the TIPP&amp;SEE metacognitive learning strategy. Our analysis revealed performance on CT assessments to be weakly correlated with working memory and long-term retrieval, with correlations increasing as the CT concepts grew more complex. This suggests that scaffolding beyond TIPP&amp;SEE may be needed with more complex CT concepts. We also found that when using TIPP&amp;SEE, students scoring below average on cognitive ability tests performed as well as students in the control condition with average cognitive ability scores.

While written language and nonverbal behaviors have been previously studied, the present analysis takes the novel approach of examining the rarely-studied modality of spoken language of individuals with psychosis as naturally used in social, face-to-face interactions. Our analyses expose a series of language markers associated with psychotic symptom severity, as well as interesting interactions between them.

Additionally, we develop predictive models of psychotic symptom severity, which achieve significant predictive power on both positive and negative psychotic symptom scales.

Asian Low-Resour. Lang. Inf. Process.,ACM,"In today’s era of digitization, social media platforms play a significant role in networking and influencing the perception of the general population. Social network sites have recently been used to carry out harmful attacks against individuals, including political and theological figures, intellectuals, sports and movie stars, and other prominent dignitaries, which may or may not be intentional. However, the exchange of such information across the general population inevitably contributes to social-economic, socio-political turmoil, and even physical violence in society. By classifying the derogatory content of a social media post, this research work helps to eradicate and discourage the upsetting propagation of such hate campaigns. Social networking posts today often include the picture of Memes along with textual remarks and comments, which throw new challenges and opportunities to the research community while identifying the attacks. This article proposes a multimodal deep learning framework by utilizing ensembles of computer vision and natural language processing techniques to train an encapsulated transformer network for handling the classification problem. The proposed framework utilizes the fine-tuned state-of-the-art deep learning-based models (e.g., BERT, Electra) for multilingual text analysis along with face recognition and the optical character recognition model for Meme picture comprehension. For the study, a new Facebook meme-post dataset is created with recorded baseline results. The subject of the created dataset and context of the work is more geared toward multilingual Indian society. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in the identification of social media meme posts featuring derogatory content about a famous/recognized individual.",deep learning; Social media analysis and security; Indic languages; transformer network; derogatory content; NLP

In response, a growing body of research advocates for assets-based design, an approach that seeks to build upon what the individuals and community already have. The emphasis on positioning assets rather than needs at the center of the process can complicate designers' decisions on what activities to foster, how to conduct them, and what outcomes to expect. In this paper, we reflect on two different assets-based design endeavors with vulnerable populations. Our reflections present assets-based design as an ongoing process that prioritizes the formation and evolution of a collective of assets-based thinkers who continually learn about their assets and ways to use them to attain desirable change. From that reflection, we contribute three methodological commitments for assets-based design to the growing CSCW scholarship on supporting vulnerable communities to attain emancipatory transformations: (1) embedding trust-building elements throughout the journey; (2) facilitating the formation of an interdependent collective; and (3) making moves towards incremental transformations. Further, we contribute a discussion on the change of perspective that entails for researchers and designers interested in undertaking assets-based design. In particular, we underscore the need to recognize the value of work before the work, to see technology as an intermediary rather than an inevitable end, and embrace impact in the shape of slow incremental transformation.",capacities; vulnerable population; participatory design; asset-based

Intervention targeted 32 words (16 cognates, 16 non-cognates) using four storybooks (8 words/book) and interactive activities that highlighted similarities across languages. Pre- and post-intervention measures in Spanish and English included tasks of word definition and cognate facilitation. Results As a group, children showed improvement in definition quality and cognate naming in Spanish. There was a positive correlation between definition quality and cognate naming for the typically developing children, but not for the children with DLD.

People had heard of language impairment and autism the same way - most frequently through the media, including Internet, and less frequently through their child’s school or a medical professional. Discussion The study confirms that awareness of language impairment and knowledge of the breadth of its manifestations are low. It also suggests opportunities for how to increase awareness, including greater media coverage of language impairment and more efficient use of venues such as schools and healthcare. Ways in which cultural and linguistic differences may influence public awareness efforts are discussed, including the translatability of clinical labels and scientific terms. These may impact the acceptance of a common term and definition across all countries. As awareness campaigns are gaining momentum, the findings of this study can serve as a baseline against which to compare future findings.",Language impairment; Children; Developmental language disorder; Awareness; Public; Europe

Fein,2018,Language abilities in monolingual- and bilingual- exposed children with autism or other developmental disorders,article,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,ScienceDirect,"Background Parents and providers are sometimes concerned that exposure to two languages will impair language acquisition in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other developmental disorders (DD). However, research to date suggests that language milestones and abilities are unaffected by this exposure. The current study explored language abilities in toddlers with ASD or DD exposed to one versus multiple languages, prior to intervention. To our knowledge, this is the largest investigation of language learning in bilingual-exposed (BE) children with ASD. Methods Participants were 388 children evaluated as part of a larger study on the early detection of ASD. Parents were asked to list all languages that primary caretakers use to communicate with their child. One hundred six BE children (57 ASD, 49 DD) were compared to 282 monolingual-exposed (ME) children (176 ASD, 106 DD). The Mullen Scales of Early Learning assessed nonverbal and verbal abilities. Multiple regression was used to evaluate the relationship of BE to language abilities, beyond the influence of nonverbal cognitive abilities, diagnosis, and socioeconomic status. Results Results showed greater language impairment in ASD than DD, but no main effect for language exposure group nor any interaction of language group by diagnosis. Results remained consistent after controlling for socioeconomic status. Conclusion This study suggests that bilingual caregivers can communicate with their children in both languages without adverse effects on their children’s language functioning.",Autism; Bilingual; Language ability; Developmental delay

Children described ten objects arranged in a picture, being some of them ambiguous. Verbal exchanges were transcribed and coded in CHAT format. Results showed that children with SLI produced fewer initial and final correct messages than their age-matched controls and adults used the same type of communicative regulations with both groups. Furthermore, morphosyntactic level assessed at age 7 did not predict the number of correct messages in the referential communication task one year later. We believe that the key difficulty in this task for children with SLI might not be exclusively linguistic and involves the analysis of the communicative context, the ability to extract the relevant information and to consider the adults’ perspectives in order to allow them do the task correctly. Resumen El objetivo del presente trabajo fue analizar la calidad de los mensajes producidos por niños bilingües con Trastorno Específico del Lenguaje (TEL), hablantes de catalán y español, en una tarea de comunicación referencial, en comparación con niños controles de la misma edad a los 8 años de edad. La tarea de los niños consistía en describir la colocación de diversos objetos de un dibujo, algunos de ellos ambiguos, a un adulto que no veía la imagen. Los intercambios verbales fueron transcritos y codificados en formato CHAT. Los resultados mostraron que los niños con TEL producían menos mensajes correctos iniciales y finales que sus controles de edad. Los adultos utilizaron el mismo tipo y cantidad de mensajes para regular la comunicación con ambos grupos. Por otra parte, el nivel morfosintáctico a la edad de 7 años no predijo el número correcto de los mensajes en la tarea de comunicación referencial un año después. Creemos que la principal dificultad en esta tarea para los niños con TEL no es exclusivamente lingüística, e implica el análisis del contexto comunicativo, la capacidad de extraer la información relevante y considerar la perspectiva del adulto con el fin de hacer la tarea correctamente.",Pragmatics; Visual perspective; Morphosyntax; Language difficulties; Pragmática; Perspectiva visual; Morfosintaxis; Dificultades del lenguaje

However, both regarding children with DLD and bilingual children, findings are mixed and few studies have investigated the combination of DLD and bilingualism in relation to EF. Aims This study investigated the effects of DLD and bilingualism on children’s EF development. Methods Monolingual and bilingual children with DLD and typical development (TD; N = 32 in each group) were tested three times with yearly intervals (MAGE = 71 months at time 1). Verbal and visuospatial working memory, selective attention, and inhibition were assessed. Results Monolinguals and bilinguals with DLD had weak working memory and inhibition skills at each time point compared to TD peers, which could partly be explained by verbal short-term memory limitations. Positive effects of bilingualism emerged when controlling for Dutch vocabulary and morphology skills, and were most pronounced at time 1. Conclusions Monolinguals and bilinguals with DLD have similar and persistent EF deficits, which are partly secondary to verbal short-term memory weaknesses. Bilinguals performed better on EF than monolinguals when Dutch language knowledge was controlled for. This effect was found regardless of DLD and was most prominent at age 5–6 years.",Developmental language disorder; Bilingualism; Executive functioning; Working memory; Attention; Development

However, studies on the neurobiological basis of dyslexia in adulthood are scarce compared to paediatric studies. Aim This review investigates the neurobiological basis of dyslexia in adulthood. Development Using PsycINFO, a database of psychology abstracts, we identified 11 studies on genetics, 9 neurostructural studies, 13 neurofunctional studies and 24 neurophysiological studies. Results from the review show that dyslexia is highly heritable and displays polygenic transmission. Likewise, adult neuroimaging studies found structural, functional, and physiological changes in the parieto-occipital and occipito-temporal regions, and in the inferior frontal gyrus, in adults with dyslexia. Conclusion According to different studies, aetiology in cases of adult dyslexia is complex. We stress the need for neurobiological studies of dyslexia in languages with transparent spelling systems.

However, the reproducibility, task-dependency, and presence of these brain anomalies in childhood rather than adulthood remain debated. We probed the large-scale organization of ventral visual and spoken language areas in dyslexic children using minimal target-detection tasks that were performed equally well by all groups. In 23 normal and 23 dyslexic 10-year-old children from two different socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds, we compared fMRI activity to visually presented houses, faces, and written strings, and to spoken sentences in the native or in a foreign language. Our results confirm a disorganization of both ventral visual and spoken language areas in dyslexic children. Visually, dyslexic children showed a normal lateral-to-medial mosaic of preferences, as well as normal responses to houses and checkerboards, but a reduced activation to words in the visual word form area (VWFA) and to faces in the right fusiform face area (FFA). Auditorily, dyslexic children exhibited reduced responses to speech in posterior temporal cortex, left insula and supplementary motor area, as well as reduced responses to maternal language in subparts of the planum temporale, left basal language area and VWFA. By correlating these two findings, we identify spoken-language predictors of VWFA activation to written words, which differ for dyslexic and normal readers. Similarities in fMRI deficits in both SES groups emphasize the existence of a core set of brain activation anomalies in dyslexia, regardless of culture, language and SES, without however resolving whether these anomalies are a cause or a consequence of impaired reading.",Child; MRI; Brain; Speech; Reading; Face; SES

Our data showed larger amplitudes of negative-going waveforms in non-dyslexic children than dyslexic children over occipital/occipitotemporal electrodes at about 220ms after stimulus onset. This electrophysiological response has previously been identified in adult readers and labeled as the N170 component. Notably, as reflected by the topographic maps children irrespective of group processed the linguistic stimuli bilaterally and we did not observe any differences in ERP parameters in words and pseudowords within groups. Contrarily, behavioral responses indicate that words were more quickly recognized than pseudowords irrespective of group. By applying post-hoc ROI analyses based on a source estimation approach (sLORETA) we observed that non-dyslexic participants, when compared to dyslexic children, demonstrated significantly stronger current density over the left hemispheric inferior temporal lobe when processing pseudowords. We concluded that impaired reading is reflected by the decreased amplitude of the early lexical component N170. The lack of a left hemispheric processing preference in both groups and similar activation for words and pseudowords can be considered a lack of reading experience and less established reading system in children. Our results indicate that dyslexic children commit fewer specialized neuronal circuits for processing print and confirm the reasoning that acquiring reading skills requires cortical reorganization over occipitotemporal regions.",ERP; N170; Dyslexia; Reading of words and pseudowords; sLORETA; Dual route theory of reading

Little is known about parental experiences across countries. Participation in the COST Action IS1406 ‘Enhancing children’s oral language skills across Europe and beyond’ provided an opportunity to conduct cross-cultural qualitative interviews. The aims were to explore how parents construe inclusion and/or exclusion of their child and how parents involve themselves in order to facilitate inclusion. Method Parents from nine countries and with a child who had received services for speech-language disorder participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews. We used thematic analysis to analyze the data. Results Two overarching themes were identified: ‘Language disabilities led to social exclusion’ and ‘Promoting pathways to social inclusion’. Two subthemes were identified Interpersonal relationships are important and Deliberate proactiveness as stepping stones for social inclusion. Conclusions Across countries, parents report that their children’s hidden disability causes misunderstandings that can lead to social exclusion and that they are important advocates for their children. It is important that the voices and experiences of parents of children with developmental disabilities are understood and acknowledged. Parents’ recommendations about how to support social inclusion need to be addressed at all levels of society.",Cross-cultural; Social inclusion; Parental perspectives; Childhood speech and language disorders; Qualitative interviews

Twin and family studies have indicated a genetic component, while genome-wide studies have implicated a number of susceptibility genes, most of which have direct or indirect roles in neuronal migration. Reelin (RELN) has important biological functions facilitating migration of neurons. Polymorphisms in RELN have been implicated in related disorders like autism and schizophrenia but have not been examined in dyslexia. We hypothesized that not only RELN, but its interactors in the neuronal migration pathway may play roles in the etiology of dyslexia. Twenty two functional variants across six RELN signalling genes (RELN, VLDLR, APOER2, DAB1, LIS1 and NDEL1) and two dyslexia candidate genes (DCDC2 and ROBO1) were analyzed for association in twenty six nuclear and three extended families with individuals affected with dyslexia. Univariate association analysis was suggestive of association (puncorrected = 0.01) with rs362746 in RELN which however did not withstand Bonferroni corrections (pcorrected = 0.21). Multimarker tests indicated significant association (p = 0.037), based on which we tested for haplotype associations. Although there were no significant haplotypic associations, we found that a three marker unit with rs3808039 and rs2072403 flanking and independently in linkage disequilibrium with rs362746 was significantly overtransmitted (risk allelic combination – TAT) to dyslexia affected individuals in the sample (p = 0.002).

Yet, given that the brain reorganises during reading acquisition, it is unknown when and how these reading routes emerge and whether neural deficits in dyslexia predate reading onset. Using diffusion MRI in 36 pre-readers with a family risk for dyslexia (FRD+) and 35 well matched pre-readers without a family risk (FRD−), our results show that phonological predictors of reading are sustained bilaterally by both ventral and dorsal tracts. This suggests that a dorsal and left-hemispheric specialisation for phonological aspects of reading, as observed in adults, is presumably gradually formed throughout reading development. Second, our results indicate that FRD+ pre-readers display mainly white matter differences in left ventral tracts. This suggests that atypical white matter organisation previously found in dyslexic adults may be causal rather than resulting from a lifetime of reading difficulties, and that the location of such a deficit may vary throughout development. While this study forms an important starting point, longitudinal follow-up of these children will allow further investigation of the dynamics between emerging literacy development and white matter connections.",Dyslexia; Preschool children; Reading network; Diffusion weighted imaging; Developmental neuroscience

However, most have focused on phonological awareness as a risk factor for dyslexia, although there is considerable diversity in the underlying causes of this reading difficulty. Specifically, the relationship between phonology, derivational morphology, and dyslexia in the Finnish language remains unclear. In the present study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure the brain responses to correctly and incorrectly derived Finnish nouns in 34 first grade Finnish children (21 typically developing and 13 with familial risk for dyslexia). In addition, we compared longitudinally the morphological information processing of 27 children (16 typically developing and 11 at-risk for dyslexia) first at pre-school age and then at first grade age. The task consisted of 108 pairs of sentences, including a verb and its root with the derivational suffix/-jA/. Correctly and incorrectly derived forms were presented both as real words and pseudowords. The incorrectly derived nouns contained a morpho-phonological violation in the last vowel of the noun before the derivational suffix. The brain activation of the typically developing children in response to morphological information processing showed sensitivity to the morphologically correct vs. incorrect contrast only in the cases of the real words. Children at-risk for dyslexia showed sensitivity to the morphological information processing both for real words and pseudowords. However, no significant differences between the groups emerged either for the correct vs. incorrect morphological contrast or for the correctly and incorrectly derived forms separately. Interestingly, in our previous study, cluster-based permutation tests showed significant developmental behavioral and brain differences between the children at pre-school age and at first-grade age in the morphological information processing of real words and pseudowords.

The narrative performance in Dutch as measured by mean length of utterance and number of ungrammatical sentences was found to be generally worse for children learning Dutch as a second language, for children suffering from SLI, and for younger children.

Studies on typical healthy participants have shown that power fluctuations of neural oscillations in beta band (15–25 Hz) reflect an essential mechanism for tracking rhythm or entrainment and relate to predictive timing and attentional processes. Here we investigated whether adults with dyslexia have atypical beta power fluctuation. Methods The electroencephalographic activities of individuals with dyslexia (n = 13) and typical control participants (n = 13) were measured while they passively listened to an isochronous tone sequence (2 Hz presentation rate). The time–frequency neural activities generated from auditory cortices were analyzed. Results The phase of beta power fluctuation at the 2 Hz stimulus presentation rate differed and appeared opposite between individuals with dyslexia and controls. Conclusions Atypical beta power fluctuation might reflect deficits in perceiving and tracking auditory rhythm in dyslexia. Significance These findings extend our understanding of atypical neural activities for tracking rhythm in dyslexia and could inspire novel methods to objectively measure the benefits of training, and predict potential benefit of auditory rhythmic rehabilitation programs on an individual basis.",Dyslexia; Electroencephalography (EEG); Beta oscillation; Auditory perception; Entrainment

In this sense, the 2D:4D finger ratio is considered an indirect indicator of prenatal exposure to testosterone. Previous studies have related it to linguistic competence and aggressive behaviour, and could be a candidate for a biological marker of language impairment. The aim was to compare the value of the 2D:4D ratio in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) with those of children with typical language development, as well as to establish to what extent this biological index correlates with the behaviour (linguistic, cognitive, social,...) in both groups. Subjects and methods 2D:4D ratio, language, cognition and social behaviour were compared in a group of children with SLI (n=15), with a group of children without language difficulties (n=16) of the same age (between 5 and 8 years), gender (male), and socio-cultural level. Results Children with SLI showed significantly higher values of 2D:4D ratio of the right hand, and a negative correlation between this ratio and their linguistic competence. Although the children with SLI showed impaired adaptive abilities, but not more aggressive behaviour, these measurements did not correlate with the 2D:4D index. Nevertheless, social behaviour correlated with language and cognition competence. Conclusions A higher value of the biological 2D:4D ration (lower intrauterine exposure to testosterone) seems to be associated with language difficulties in boys with SLI, but not with their behavioural difficulties. Their behavioural difficulties seem to be a consequence of their linguistic difficulties and their level of cognition. Resumen Introducción Encontrar marcadores biológicos del trastorno específico del lenguaje facilitaría su detección e intervención precoz. En este sentido, el índice digital D2:D4 es considerado un indicador indirecto de la exposición prenatal a la testosterona, y estudios previos lo han relacionado con la competencia lingüística y la conducta agresiva, por lo que podría ser un candidato a marcador biológico. El objetivo es comparar el valour de este índice digital en niños con trastorno específico del lenguaje (TEL) frente a sujetos con desarrollo típico del lenguaje, estableciendo en qué medida correlacionan los valores del índice biológico con la conducta (lingüística, cognitiva, social…) de dichos sujetos. Sujetos y métodos Se comparó el índice D2:D4, el lenguaje, la cognición y la conducta social en un grupo de niños con TEL (n=15) con un grupo de niños sin dificultades del lenguaje (n=16) de la misma la misma edad (entre 5–8 años), sexo (masculino) y nivel sociocultural. Resultados Los niños con TEL mostraron valores significativamente más altos en el índice D2:D4 de la mano derecha, y una correlación negativa entre el índice D2:D4 de la mano derecha y la competencia lingüística. Aunque los niños con TEL mostraron peores habilidades adaptativas y conductas internalizantes, aunque no mayor agresividad, estas medidas no se correlacionaron con el índice D2:D4, y sí con los valores de lenguaje y de cognición. Conclusiones Un valour más alto del índice biológico D2:D4 (menor exposición intrauterina a la testosterona) parece estar asociado con las dificultades del lenguaje de los niños con TEL, pero no con sus dificultades conductuales. Las dificultades conductuales de estos niños parecen ser consecuencia de sus dificultades lingüísticas y de su nivel de cognición.",Adaptive behaviour; Social adjustment; Androgen exposure; Biomarker; Testosterone; Developmental language disorders; Conducta adaptativa; Ajuste social; Androgenización; Biomarcador; Testosterona; Trastornos del desarrollo del lenguaje

Specifically, we aimed at disentangling two hypotheses. If phonological processing drives novel word learning and if phonological processing is impaired in students with dyslexia, they should perform lower than skilled readers not only in the phonological categorization tasks but also in the matching and semantic tasks. By contrast, if students with dyslexia use semantic knowledge to compensate for their phonological deficits, should be able to reach the same level of performance and show similar enhancements of the N200 and N400 components than skilled readers in the matching and semantic tasks. Results at both behavioral and electrophysiological levels showed that the phonological deficits evidenced in the phonological tasks did not impede students with dyslexia to learn the meaning of novel words, possibly because they mobilized more frontal resources than skilled readers.

Method The participants were 26 children with SLI, 14 monolingual English speakers and 12 dual language learners. The dual language learners were English dominant and spoke a variety of other languages in the home. The two SLI groups were compared using standardized tests and measures from two narrative samples. Results Compared to the monolingual children, the dual language learners achieved lower scores on standardized tests of morphosyntax but not on measures of language form derived from the narrative samples. Both groups achieved below average scores on productivity, narrative structure, literate language, and language form measures from the narrative samples. Conclusion The data suggest that narrative samples can be a sensitive way to assess the language skills of dual language learners with specific language impairment. Furthermore, the findings are consistent with the position that English standardized tests may be a biased assessment measure when used with dual language learners, particularly for the assessment of expressive morphosyntactic skills. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to (1) describe the narrative abilities of typically developing dual language learners; (2) describe similarities between the narrative abilities of children with SLI who are monolingual and dual language learners; (3) identify ways to analyses narratives at a variety of levels.",

Fifty monolingual Spanish-speaking children between 4; 0 and 6; 11 years were assigned to one of two groups: 25 children with SLI and 25 TLD age-matched peers. A scripted picture book was read to each child and the child was subsequently asked to retell the story using pictures. Story retells were analyzed for MLU, %UGS, TNW, and NDW. Results showed significant differences between groups on all four measures. Children with SLI showed significantly lower MLU, TNW and NDW, and significantly higher%UGS when compared with age-matched peers with TLD. Results suggest that measures of language productivity obtained during story retells may be used to accurately detect differences in language performance and differentiate monolingual Spanish-speaking children with SLI from their typical peers.

The results revealed that the lexical retrieval deficit manifested itself in all three languages.

Using elicitation techniques, texting and spoken language messages were collected from 55 children with TD and 15 children with SLI between 10 and 13 years old. The results show that text messages in the two groups were of equal length, but the children with TD used more textisms (alternative ways of spelling words) than the children with SLI. Both groups omitted words in their texting messages with similar frequencies, but while the SLI group omitted words equally frequently in texting messages and spoken language messages, omissions in the TD group were more specific to texting. This suggests that TD children omit words in texting because it is a register-specific convention, whereas children with SLI omit words regardless of the register. Socio-emotional reasons to use texting were found to be relatively important for children with SLI. This may be related to their higher level of shyness.",Texting; Specific language impairment; Grammatical development; WhatsApp; Elicited speech

Method : Participants were 24 English L2 children with DLD and 63 English L2 children with TD, matched on age (mean = 5; 8) and length of exposure to the L2 (mean = 24 months). Narrative samples were elicited using a story generation task and a parent questionnaire provided age and input variables. Results : Bilinguals with DLD had significantly lower scores for story grammar than their TD peers, but showed similar scores for narrative microstructure components. Length of L2 exposure in school and richness of the L2 environment predicted better narrative abilities for the group with TD but not with DLD. Older age predicted better narrative abilities for the group with DLD but not with TD. Quantity of L2 input/output at home did not predict story grammar or microstructure abilities in either group.

Results showed significant improvements in the trained children in RAN performance and in word reading accuracy. Importantly, gains in RAN observed in the dyslexic group were correlated with increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left anterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus (AF), which is primarily known to be involved in articulation and in speech fluency.

Results of studies using DL have indicated that language is lateralized in children with LD and that the lateralized language asymmetries do not develop after age 6 nor are they affected by gender. Observed differences in lateralized language processes between control children and those with LD were found not due to delayed cerebral dominance, but rather to deficits in selective attention. In addition, attention factors have a greater influence on auditory processing of verbal than nonverbal stimuli for children with LD, and children with LD exhibit a general processing bias to the same hemisphere unlike control children. Furthermore, employing directed attention conditions in DL experiments has played an important role in explaining learning disabled children’s performance on DL tasks. We conclude that auditory perceptual asymmetries as assessed by DL with children who experience LD are the result of the interaction of hemispheric capability and attention factors.",Dichotic listening; Language disorders; Learning disabilities; Selective attention

However, relevant research on language disorders has been generally restricted on tense morphology rather than aspect resulting in inconsistent findings. Specifically, some studies imply that acquisition of aspect in Specific Language Impairment (SLI) does not differentiate from typical development, whereas others report a deviant performance. These inconsistencies could be related to the limited number of languages tested or even to the different methodologies used across the studies. The present study examines the comprehension and production of grammatical aspect in Greek-speaking children with SLI. Thirty-six children participated in a combined comprehension – production task; twelve children with SLI (mean age: 6;3), twelve age-matched typically developing children (mean age: 6;3) and twelve language-matched typically developing children (mean age: 4;4). The originality of the study mainly lies on its methodology, since the task distributed to the children consisted of video stimuli instead of pictures, which are usually used in similar experimental designs. According to the findings, Greek-speaking children with SLI exhibited the same asymmetrical pattern reported for early stages of typical development. That is, perfective aspect is fully acquired, while interpretation and use of imperfective aspect seems to be problematic. Therefore, development of aspect in Greek SLI appears rather delayed than severely impaired.",Greek; language disorders; SLI; semantics – morphology interface

To address this shortage, this study evaluated the effectiveness of Preparing Pequeños, an integrated small-group instruction program designed to promote increased learning for Spanish speaking DLL in language, literacy, and math. The DLL in the randomized Preparing Pequeños intervention classrooms were compared to control DLL with comparable Spanish language delays and in which the school district's core curriculum was being implemented. Intervention teachers and paraprofessionals, as part of Preparing Pequeños, implemented new classroom and time management systems in order to conduct 90 min of small-group instruction four days each week across the school year.

To date, most studies on SES and dual language development have relied on static measures of vocabulary and syntactic skills, without examining the language learning processes – children’s ability to acquire new language items. The current study used a newly developed language measure, the Quick Interactive Language Screener: English and Spanish (QUILS:ES), to assess 3- through 5-year-old Spanish-English DLLs’ language learning processes. We also examined the association between SES (as measured by primary caregivers’ education) and language learning processes, and further explored mechanisms underlying the association. DLLs from higher-SES families showed better language learning skills than those from lower-SES families. The size of the gap did not vary by child age. Home literacy environment (i.e., access to books, book-reading frequency) and children’s existing knowledge (i.e., vocabulary and syntactic knowledge) mediated the SES effect. Together, these findings highlight the need to better prepare DLLs from low-SES families for learning from a dual-language environment.

We analyzed the relation of these morphosyntactic processes to other psycholinguistic abilities, according to the MUC (Memory-Unification-Control) model. Method Ten bilingual native Spanish-speaking children with SLI (8;3–10;6) and 10 age-matched children with TLD (7;6–10;10) received a psycholinguistic evaluation in Spanish-English. The 20 children and 10 adults (19–34) performed an on-line cross-modal pronoun task. They listened to long distance animate DO pronoun sentences, and filler sentences without any pronoun. At the offset of the pronoun in each pronoun sentence, a picture of an animal for the antecedent (match condition), another animal for the second noun (mismatch), or an unrelated object (neutral) was displayed on the screen. In the filler sentences, a picture of an object that depicted the first noun, appeared at the offset of another later noun. Participants decided whether that pictured item was “alive”/“not alive” by pressing two keys on the computer keyboard. Immediately after, they answered an oral comprehension question about the DO pronoun sentence. Results Bilingual children with SLI showed significantly poorer comprehension of DO pronoun sentences than bilingual children with TLD. Pronoun sentence understanding in the overall children correlated significantly with oral sentence completion, expressive vocabulary abilities, auditory story comprehension, and the non-word repetition task, all in Spanish. Adults showed significantly the highest pronoun sentence comprehension, and the fastest animacy decisions across conditions; it was the only group showing a significant behavioral morphosyntactic priming effect. All groups exhibited high accuracy in the animacy decisions across conditions, although children with SLI showed lower accuracy and more variability. Conclusion Bilingual Spanish-English children with SLI showed significant limitations in understanding long distance animate DO pronoun sentences. The deficits were also related to weak morphosyntactic, lexical, and/or phonological representations stored in their memory. These processes may be harder to combine in the unification process, and also to control for answering the comprehension questions.

Four distinct groups were identified from the Kindergarten cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) (1) English-only+typical speech and language (n=2012); (2) multilingual+typical speech and language (n=476); (3) English-only+speech and language concern (n=643); and (4) multilingual+speech and language concern (n=109). Two analytic approaches were used to compare these groups. First, a matched case-control design was used to randomly match multilingual children with speech and language concern (group 4, n=109) to children in groups 1–3 on gender, age, and family socio-economic position in a cross-sectional comparison of vocabulary, school readiness, and behavioral adjustment. Next, analyses were applied to the whole sample to determine longitudinal effects of group membership on teachers' ratings of literacy, numeracy, and behavioral adjustment at ages 6–7 and 8–9 years. At 4–5 years, multilingual children with speech and language concern did equally well or better than English-only children (with or without speech and language concern) on school readiness tests but performed more poorly on measures of English vocabulary and behavior. At ages 6–7 and 8–9, the early gap between English-only and multilingual children had closed. Multilingualism was not found to contribute to differences in literacy and numeracy outcomes at school; instead, outcomes were more related to concerns about children’s speech and language in early childhood. There were no group differences for socio-emotional outcomes. Early evidence for the combined risks of multilingualism plus speech and language concern was not upheld into the school years.",Bilingual; Multilingual; Dual language learner (DLL); Educational outcomes; Social-emotional outcomes; Speech; Language; Communication; Literacy; Reading; Numeracy; Mathematics

Written words enter the brain through the visual system and associated sounds through the auditory system. The task before the beginning reader is quite basic. She must learn correspondences between orthographic tokens and phonemic utterances, and she must do this to the point that there is seamless automatic ‘connection’ between these sensorially distinct units of language. It is self-evident then that learning to read requires formation of cross-sensory associations to the point that deeply encoded multisensory representations are attained. While the majority of individuals manage this task to a high degree of expertise, some struggle to attain even rudimentary capabilities. Why do dyslexic individuals, who learn well in myriad other domains, fail at this particular task? Here, we examine the literature as it pertains to multisensory processing in dyslexia. We find substantial support for multisensory deficits in dyslexia, and make the case that to fully understand its neurological basis, it will be necessary to thoroughly probe the integrity of auditory–visual integration mechanisms.",Reading disorder; Crossmodal; Sensory processing; Development; Children; Audiovisual; Temporal window of integration

Method Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, ERIC Ebsco, and Google Scholar were searched with no limits placed on the year of publication. Search terms consisted of: (“stuttering” [MeSH] OR “stutter”) AND (“child” [MeSH] OR “children”) AND (“multilingualism” [MeSH] OR “bilingualism”). Inclusion criteria were children who stutter, bilinguals who stutter, empirical research articles, and published in peer review journals. Exclusion criteria were studies that reported on only adults, only monolinguals, or were not published in English. Results A total of 50 articles met the criteria. There was convergence with monolingual studies reporting sexually dimorphic and familial trends in the prevalence of stuttering and rates of recovery. Findings surrounding language proficiency, cross-linguistic stuttering severity, and development were ambivalent. Results point to the difficulty in identifying stuttering in bilingual children, and the need for culturally competent research and interpretations. Conclusion Current findings offer a fragmented view of bilingual development and echoes a recurring theme, i.e., the current understanding of bilingualism and stuttering is limited and more research is warranted.",Children; Stuttering; Multilingual; Review; Bilingual

NNLDs are alterations in language owing to psychosomatic preoccupations, conversion disorder, psychiatric disorders, or other psychological reasons. Objective To identify and classify the range of NNLDs and their characteristics. Methods This review summarizes the literature on disturbances in language, broadly defined as the use of symbols for communication, which may have a psychogenic or psychiatric etiology. Results The literature suggests a classification for NNLDs that includes psychogenic aphasia with dysgrammatism; psychogenic “lalias” including oxylalia and agitolalia, palilalia and echolalia, xenolalia, glossolalia, and coprolalia; psychologically-mediated word usage; psychotic language; and psychogenic forms of the foreign accent syndrome. Conclusions Clinicians and researchers have insufficiently emphasized the presence of NNLDs, their characteristics, and their identification. Yet, these disorders may be the first or predominant manifestation of a psychologically-mediated illness. There are 2 steps to recognition. The first is to know how to distinguish NNLDs from the manifestations of neurogenic language impairments after a neurological evaluation. The second step is awareness of specific associated and examination features that suggest the presence of a NNLD.",language; aphasia; foreign accent syndrome

Rodríguez-Ortiz and Ana Matić and Rena Lyons and Camille Messarra and Edith {Kouba Hreich} and Margarita Stankova,2019,Working with the parents and families of children with developmental language disorders: An international perspective,article,Journal of Communication Disorders,ScienceDirect,"Background The relationship between parental input and child language development has had a complex history. It has become clear that indirect parent training for the parents of children with delayed language development is an important feature of interventions offered by speech and language therapists in the anglophone countries. Yet we know less about how this type of approach is realised in other countries. Methods In this paper we report the results of a survey of practice undertaken as part of the work of COST Action IS1406, a European Union (EU) funded research network. The focus of this paper is specifically on parent-related questions and responses referring to children under the age of twelve. The survey was devised by members of the Action and circulated electronically during the summer of 2017. In all, 4024 practitioners responded from 60 countries, the majority of whom came from EU member countries. Findings Respondents to the survey indicated that indirect therapy is commonly carried out via the parent in the early years and via teachers later. A range of professional groups, in addition to speech and language therapists, is likely to adopt this approach; including teachers, pedagogues and psychologists. A variety of interventions is reported, some of which have a reasonable evidence-base underpinning them. It is interesting to see the widespread involvement of fathers and other family members in interventions. Finally, the fact that practitioner characteristics (age, experience, location of practice etc.) are not related to the use of indirect techniques points to the universal recognition of the value of these approaches. Conclusions Despite the very different traditions in the practice of intervention across countries, there is clearly a widespread recognition of the importance of indirect approaches to intervention and specifically those focusing on parents. The mixture of family members being involved in interventions is a very promising indication of the role sharing commonly associated with the contemporary family. Yet the number of specific intervention approaches identified is relatively small given the number of respondents. There is a need for a better understanding of what exactly practitioners are doing when they involve parents in intervention or carry out parent-child interaction interventions and how well these interventions work in routine practice. This also has implications for the application of evidence-based practice and the precise nature of the interventions concerned (advice to parents, video interaction training etc.).",Parent-child interaction; Indirect approach to intervention; Developmental language disorder; Speech-language therapy; Practitioner survey

However, understanding the structural organization of reading and its aberrations in dyslexia requires a hodological approach, studies of which have not provided consistent findings. Here, we adopted a whole brain hodological approach and investigated relationships between structural white matter connectivity and reading skills and phonological processing in a cross-sectional study of 44 adults using individual local connectome matrix from diffusion MRI data. Moreover, we performed quantitative anisotropy aided differential tractography to uncover structural white matter anomalies in dyslexia (23 dyslexics and 21 matched controls) and their correlation to reading-related skills. The connectometry analyses indicated that reading skills and phonological processing were both associated with corpus callosum (tapetum), forceps major and minor, as well as cerebellum bilaterally. Furthermore, the left dorsal and right thalamic pathways were associated with phonological processing. Differential tractography analyses revealed structural white matter anomalies in dyslexics in the left ventral route and bilaterally in the dorsal route compared to the controls. Connectivity deficits were also observed in the corpus callosum, forceps major, vertical occipital fasciculus and corticostriatal and thalamic pathways. Altered structural connectivity in the observed differential tractography results correlated with poor reading skills and phonological processing. Using a hodological approach, the current study provides novel evidence for the extent of the reading-related connectome and its aberrations in dyslexia. The results conform current functional neuroanatomical models of reading and developmental dyslexia but provide novel network-level and tract-level evidence on structural connectivity anomalies in dyslexia, including the vertical occipital fasciculus.",Dyslexia; Reading; Phonological processing; Structural connectometry; DTI

In a word extension task, we used several types of object entities (solid, animate, nonsolid, functional, and spatial relations) for which children needed to attend to diverse properties (shape, texture, role, or spatial relation) to decide category membership. We compared 15 school-aged children with DLD with typically developing (TD) children matched on either age or vocabulary. Our results indicate that children with DLD were impaired in extending novel words for nonsolid substances and relational objects, whereas age-matched TD children performed well for all object classes. Similar to children with DLD, TD children matched on language had difficulty in extending spatial relation categories. We also show that children with DLD needed more learning exemplars and relied more on shape-based information than TD children, especially for spatial configuration objects. Overall, our findings suggest that children are able to learn regularities between object properties and category organization and to focus on diverse features according to the object presented when extending novel nouns. They also provide clear evidence linking DLD to deficits in novel name generalization and word learning.",Language acquisition; Developmental language disorder; Generalization; Vocabulary; Shape; Comparison

Previous work has identified several theoretical possibilities for the underlying locus of impairment in surface dyslexia. In this study, we systematically investigated whether children with surface dyslexia showed different patterns of reading performance that could be traced back to different underlying levels of impairment. To do this, we tested 12 English readers, replicating previous work in Hebrew (Gvion & Friedmann, 2013; 2016; Friedmann & Lukov, 2008; Friedmann & Gvion, 2016). In our sample, we found that poor irregular word reading was associated with deficits at the level of the orthographic input lexicon and with impaired access to meaning and spoken word forms after processing written words in the orthographic input lexicon. There were also children whose surface dyslexia seemed to be caused by impairments of the phonological output lexicon. We suggest that further evidence is required to unequivocally support a fourth pattern where the link between orthography and meaning is intact while the link between orthography and spoken word forms is not functioning.

One way of investigating the mechanisms of DLD language problems is to compare language-related brain activation patterns of children with DLD to those of a population with similar language difficulties and a uniform etiology. Children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) constitute such a population. Here, we conducted an fMRI study, in which children (6-10yo) with DLD and 22q11DS listened to speech alternated with reversed speech. We compared language laterality and language-related brain activation levels with those of typically developing (TD) children who performed the same task. The data revealed no significant differences between groups in language lateralization, but task-related activation levels were lower in children with language impairment than in TD children in several nodes of the language network. We conclude that language impairment in children with DLD and in children with 22q11DS may involve (partially) overlapping cortical areas.",Developmental language disorder; 22q11.2 deletion syndrome; fMRI; Spoken language processing; Language laterality

However, it remains unclear at which time point in reading development serial order STM is most important. Here, we established a crucial link between the reading development of primary school children and their serial order STM performance for both verbal and nonverbal materials. In a large cohort study of 113 Italian-speaking elementary school children in Grades 1–4, we investigated this relationship by implementing a novel double-probe design. In Experiment 1, we found that serial order STM performance was related to children’s reading abilities, especially in Grades 2 and 3, corresponding to the training phase of grapheme–phoneme decoding skills. In Experiment 2, we assessed children with developmental dyslexia (DD) and found that their serial order STM performance was significantly lower than that of chronological age-matched controls (CA). It also differed from that of reading age-matched controls when accounting for individual reading performance. Furthermore, the CA group displayed an implicit serial order facilitation for item memory, whereas this implicit recruitment of serial order abilities was completely absent in children with DD. Our results suggest that the domain-general cognitive ability to maintain the serial order of information interacts with the development of reading competency, especially during a middle training phase of word reading, and this particular relationship is markedly impaired in children with DD.",Reading development; Dyslexia; Memory; Serial order; Short-term memory; Modality effect; E58

Three of the patients had acquired Catalan and Spanish at the same time, while the rest were exposed to their second language (Spanish) between three and five years of age. Catalan was the most frequently used language for all the participants. Their performances in Catalan and Spanish were similar, except for the verbal fluency subtest (Spanish > Catalan). Their translation of words was better from Spanish to Catalan, whereas the translation of sentences was better from Catalan to Spanish. The analysis of spontaneous speech only showed that the patients produced more words and sentences in Catalan. According to the declarative/procedural model of language, these results suggest that the processing of the two languages is more similar than different. Nevertheless, regression to the first language may be more evident as the disease progresses.

Methods and procedures Whereas previous studies taught children new labels for familiar objects, the present study taught new labels for new objects. In our word learning experiment children were presented with pictures of imaginary creatures and pseudo words. Half of the words were accompanied by an augmentative pseudo sign. The children were tested for their receptive word knowledge. Outcomes and results The DHH children benefitted significantly from augmentative signs, but the children with SLI and TD age-matched peers did not score significantly different on words from either the sign or no-sign condition. Conclusions and implications These results suggest that using Sign-Supported speech in classrooms of bimodal bilingual DHH children may support their spoken language development.

Compared to the control group, the SLI group presented impaired decoding and comprehension skills at age 8, as evidenced by poor scores in all the assessed tasks. Nevertheless, only text comprehension abilities appeared to be impaired at age 12. Individual analyses confirmed the presence of comprehension deficits in most of the SLI children. Furthermore, early semantic verbal fluency at age 6 appeared to significantly predict the reading comprehension capacity of SLI participants at age 12. Our results emphasize the importance of semantic capacity at early stages of oral language development over the consolidation of reading acquisition at later stages.

One hundred forty-five monolingual primary school pupils were included in the study. Two study groups were formed: pupils with typical language development (TD) (n = 145) and pupils with developmental language disorders (LD) (n = 72). Acoustic measurements were made in twelve classrooms with different reverberation time. Monosyllabic nonsense words perception tests, presented by an examiner, were carried out in classrooms with and without SFAS. The number of errors in the test carried out with SFAS in different acoustic conditions reduced in pupils of Grade 1 with TD (Z = –2.273, p = .023; Z = –1.965, p = .049) and with LD (Z = –2.410, p = .016; Z = –2.156, p = .031). The SFAS installed in large classrooms with long reverberation time significantly increased the number of errors in nonsense monosyllables perception (rS = 0.361, p < .01, rS = 0.229, p < .01). The mean number of errors in children with LD was higher than in children with TD in monosyllabic nonsense words tests carried out with and without SFAS (U = 3194, p < .001; U = 3518.5, p < .001). First-grade students benefit from sound field amplification in perception of monosyllabic nonsense words regardless of classrooms acoustics, and irrespective of the level of language development. The positive effect of SFAS on nonsense word perception was not observed in pupils of Grade 2, 3, and 4 of primary school. Classroom acoustics affects the expected positive impact of SFAS for children older than first graders.

However, comparing nonwords of equal syllable lengths across languages may not sufficiently account for phonological differences across languages. We compared Spanish-language nonword sets of different lengths to select a set that would be equivalent with respect to difficulty in English. We considered language-specific phonological structure and level of difficulty in evaluating nonword performance in 126 first- and second-grade, Spanish-English bilingual children. We predicted that adding 5-syllable words to the Spanish nonword set and monosyllabic words to the English set would result in comparable difficulty. Method Participants repeated nonwords of increasing lengths in English of 1, 2, 3, and 4 syllables and in Spanish of 2, 3, 4, and 5 syllables. Percent phonemes correct was calculated for total sounds. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare accuracy across word lengths. Results Results indicated significant differences in overall means between languages when nonwords of equal word lengths were compared, but no significant differences in overall means when lengths of 1 – 4 syllables in English and 2 – 5 syllables in Spanish were used. Differences between languages varied at individual levels of complexity. Conclusions The finding that level of word length affects performance may have implications for understanding the factors in clinical test development for bilingual children.

Evidence of selection bias—differences between groups in SES, age, approaches to learning, self-control, social interaction, country of birth, childcare, household composition and number in the home, books in the home, and parent involvement—highlighted limitations of a traditional approach for investigating DIF that only controlled for ability. When controlling for selection bias, only 11% of items displayed DIF, and subsequent examination of item content did not suggest item bias. Results provide evidence that the Spanish translation of the ECLS-K mathematics assessment is an equitable and unbiased assessment accommodation for young dual language learners.",Dual language learners; Differential item functioning; Mathematics; Regression discontinuity design

Thus, though there is a high prevalence of language deficits in this family which raises the likelihood of a genetic origin of these deficits, and though all affected study participants displayed selective linguistic deficits with normal non-verbal functioning, language testing showed considerable variance in overlap and homogeneity of linguistic deficits.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a peer-mediated intervention on preschool-aged emergent bilinguals’ and their peer buddies’ social interactions in the classroom. Three emergent bilinguals were paired with 3 English-only peer-buddies. Children were typically-developing and 3.9–5.2 years old. Each dyad was trained using an Invite-Play-Talk model, followed by 10, 20-minute-intervention play sessions. A staggered multiple baseline design across participants was used to measure the effect of this peer-mediated intervention on emergent bilingual and peer buddy interactions. Interactions were coded as verbal or nonverbal. All dyads of emergent bilingual and peer buddy children exhibited increases in their initiations and responses throughout the intervention phase over-time. Gains were maintained with a slight decrease in interactions at 2-weeks postintervention. Results suggest the benefit of a peer-mediated intervention using an Invite-Play-Talk model to support communication in emergent bilingual preschoolers and encourage the provision of inclusive supports for emergent bilingual children in early childhood classrooms.",Emergent bilingual; Peer-mediated intervention; Language development; Multilingual; Preschoolers

Regarding the target-like dative case marking in total, there were no differences found between bilingual TD, monolingual and bilingual children with SLI by the age of four. They demonstrated a similar delay when compared to monolingual TD children. By the age of seven, however, bilingual TD children ‘catch up’ with their monolingual peers. Children with SLI do not master the acquisition of dative case marking by this age. Cumulative effects of bilingualism and SLI were not found neither in younger nor in older bilingual children.

Previous research has shown that regular rhythmic stimulation benefits subsequent syntax processing in children with dyslexia and specific language impairment. The present EEG study examined the influence of a rhythmic musical prime on the P600 late evoked-potential, associated with grammatical error detection for dyslexic adults and matched controls. Participants listened to regular or irregular rhythmic prime sequences followed by grammatically correct and incorrect sentences. They were required to perform grammaticality judgments for each auditorily presented sentence while EEG was recorded. In addition, tasks on syntax violation detection as well as rhythm perception and production were administered. For both participant groups, ungrammatical sentences evoked a P600 in comparison to grammatical sentences and its mean amplitude was larger after regular than irregular primes. Peak analyses of the P600 difference wave confirmed larger peak amplitudes after regular primes for both groups. They also revealed overall a later peak for dyslexic participants, particularly at posterior sites, compared to controls. Results extend rhythmic priming effects on language processing to underlying electrophysiological correlates of morpho-syntactic violation detection in dyslexic adults and matched controls. These findings are interpreted in the theoretical framework of the Dynamic Attending Theory (Jones, 1976, 2019) and the Temporal Sampling Framework for developmental disorders (Goswami, 2011).",Rhythmic priming; Syntax processing; Temporal attention; Dyslexia; P600 evoked potential

Dyslexia has been reported in every culture studied, and mounting evidence draws attention to cross-linguistic similarity in its neurobiological and neurocognitive bases. Much progress has been made across research specialties spanning the behavioural, neuropsychological, neurobiological, and causal levels of analysis in the past 5 years. From a neuropsychological perspective, the phonological theory remains the most compelling, although phonological problems also interact with other cognitive risk factors. Work confirms that, neurobiologically, dyslexia is characterised by dysfunction of the normal left hemisphere language network and also implicates abnormal white matter development. Studies accounting for reading experience demonstrate that many recorded neural differences show causes rather than effects of dyslexia. Six predisposing candidate genes have been identified, and evidence shows gene by environment interaction.",

Knowledge about the linguistic markers of SLI can facilitate its differentiation from the normal profile of language development. These markers can also be used as tools that may improve diagnostic. Aims To determine which psycholinguistic markers best discriminate Spanish-speaking children with SLI from children with typical language development. Method and procedure The performance of 31 Spanish-speaking children with SLI was analysed using a battery of 13 psycholinguistic tasks organized into two areas: phonology and morphosyntax. The performance of the SLI group was compared to that of two subgroups of controls: aged matched (CA) and linguistically matched (CL). Outcomes and results The data show that the SLI group performed worse than the CA subgroup on all 13 verbal tasks. However, the performance of the SLI group did not significantly differ from that of the CL subgroup on most (11/13) of the tasks. Stepwise discriminant analysis established the canonical function of three tasks (morphologic integration, sentence understanding and diadochokinesis) which significantly discriminated SLI from CA, with sensitivity 84% and specificity 90%. Conclusions and implications These results contribute to determining the psycholinguistic and clinical characteristics of SLI in Spanish-speaking children and provide some methods for screening assessment.",Specific Language Impairment; Language delay; Language assessment; Spanish

They may be particularly promising diagnostic tools for bilingual children if performance on them is not highly affected by bilingual exposure. Two studies were conducted which examined (1) the effect of amount of bilingual exposure on performance on French and English nonword repetition and sentence imitation in 5-year-old French-English bilingual children and (2) the diagnostic accuracy of the French versions of these measures and of receptive vocabulary in 5-year-old monolingual French-speakers and bilingual speakers with and without PLI, carefully matched on language exposure. Method Study 1 included 84 5-year-olds acquiring French and English simultaneously, differing in their amount of exposure to the two languages but equated on age, nonverbal cognition and socio-economic status. Children were administered French and English tests of NWR and SI. In Study 2, monolingual and bilingual children with and without PLI (four groups, n=14 per group) were assessed for NWR, SI, and receptive vocabulary in French to determine diagnostic accuracy. Results Study 1: Both processing measures, but in particular NWR, were less affected by previous exposure than vocabulary measures. Bilingual children with varying levels of exposure were unaffected by the length of nonwords. Study 2: In contrast to receptive vocabulary, NWR and SI correctly distinguished children with PLI from children with typical development (TD) regardless of bilingualism. Sensitivity levels were acceptable, but specificity was lower. Conclusions Bilingual children perform differently than children with PLI on NWR and SI. In contrast to children with PLI, bilingual children with a large range of previous exposure levels achieve high NWR scores and are unaffected by the length of the nonwords. Learning outcomes: Readers will recognize the effect of language input on the rate of language development, focusing specifically on how bilingual exposure affects the language learning of each language of bilingual children.",Nonword repetition; Sentence imitation; Bilingualism; Primary language impairment; Clinical marker; Diagnostic accuracy

The children were administered two similar reading batteries in French and Spanish. The deficits of the dyslexic children in reading accuracy were mainly visible in their opaque orthography (French) whereas difficulties indexed by reading speed were observed in both their opaque and transparent orthographies. Dyslexic children did not exhibit any phonemic awareness problems in French or in Spanish, but showed poor VA Span skills compared to their control peers. VA span skills correlated with reading accuracy and speed measures in both Spanish and French, whereas phonemic awareness correlated with reading accuracy only. Overall, the present results show that the VA Span is tightly related to reading speed regardless of orthographic transparency, and that it accounts for differences in reading performance between good and poor readers across languages. The present findings further suggest that VA Span skills may play a particularly important role in building-up specific word knowledge which is critical for lexical reading strategies.",Reading; Dyslexia; Orthographic transparency; Bilingualism; Visual attention span; Phonemic awareness

Multiple independent research findings indicate that children with specific language impairment (SLI) show subtle difficulties beyond the language domain. Uncertainties remain on possible association between body-mediated, non-linguistic expression of verbs and early manifestation of SLI during verb acquisition. The present study was conducted to determine whether verb production through non-linguistic modalities is impaired in children with SLI. Children with SLI (mean age 41 months) and typically developing children (mean age 40 months) were asked to recognize target verbs while viewing video clips showing the action associated with the verb (verb-recognition task) and to enact the action corresponding to the verb (verb-enacting task). Children with SLI performed more poorly than control children in both tasks. The present study demonstrates that early language impairment emerges at the bodily level.

Behavioural investigation showed a severe reduction of reading speed for both single items (words and pseudo-words) and texts in the two languages. However, performance was more affected in French than in Spanish. MP was administered an intensive VA span intervention programme. Pre–post intervention comparison revealed a positive effect of intervention on her VA span abilities. The intervention further transferred to reading. It primarily resulted in faster identification of the regular and irregular words in French. The effect of intervention was rather modest in Spanish that only showed a tendency for faster word reading. Text reading improved in the two languages with a stronger effect in French but pseudo-word reading did not improve in either French or Spanish. The overall results suggest that VA span intervention may primarily enhance the fast global reading procedure, with stronger effects in French than in Spanish. MP underwent two fMRI sessions to explore her brain activations before and after VA span training. Prior to the intervention, fMRI assessment showed that the striate and extrastriate visual cortices alone were activated but none of the regions typically involved in VA span. Post-training fMRI revealed increased activation of the superior and inferior parietal cortices. Comparison of pre- and post-training activations revealed significant activation increase of the superior parietal lobes (BA 7) bilaterally. Thus, we show that a specific VA span intervention not only modulates reading performance but further results in increased brain activity within the superior parietal lobes known to housing VA span abilities. Furthermore, positive effects of VA span intervention on reading suggest that the ability to process multiple visual elements simultaneously is one cause of successful reading acquisition.",French–Spanish bilingualism; Dyslexia; VA span; Intervention; Superior parietal lobes

However, previous studies have shown that children with SLI show some cognitive and literacy problems. Our study analyses the relationship between preschool cognitive and linguistic abilities and the later development of reading abilities in Spanish–Catalan bilingual children with SLI. The sample consisted of 17 bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI and 17 age-matched controls. We tested eight distinct processes related to phonological, attention, and language processing at the age of 6 years and reading at 8 years of age. Results show that bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI show significantly lower scores, as compared to typically developing peers, in phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming (RAN), together with a lower outcome in tasks measuring sentence repetition and verbal fluency. Regarding attentional processes, bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI obtained lower scores in auditory attention, but not in visual attention. At the age of 8 years Spanish–Catalan children with SLI had lower scores than their age-matched controls in total reading score, letter identification (decoding), and in semantic task (comprehension). Regression analyses identified both phonological awareness and verbal fluency at the age of 6 years to be the best predictors of subsequent reading performance at the age of 8 years. Our data suggest that language acquisition problems and difficulties in reading acquisition in bilingual children with SLI might be related to the close interdependence between a limitation in cognitive processing and a deficit at the linguistic level.

Methods Twenty-eight bilingual people who stutter performed a spontaneous and a controlled speech production task, once in their dominant and once in their non-dominant language. The controlled production task (i.e. a network description task) was carried out once under a full-attention condition and once under a divided-attention condition where a non-linguistic, pitch discrimination task was performed simultaneously. Results In both the spontaneous and the controlled speech task, bilingual persons who stutter produced more (typical and stuttering-like) disfluencies in their L2 than in their L1. Furthermore, whereas the typical disfluencies increased when attention was directed away from speech production, stuttering-like disfluencies decreased. This effect was however restricted to L2. In addition, L2 proficiency was generally found to be a predicting factor, with higher proficiency leading to fewer disfluencies. Conclusions These results suggest that speaking in a non-dominant language increases both typical and stuttering-like disfluencies in bilingual persons who stutter, but also that these two types of dysfluencies differ regarding their attentional origins. Our findings offer further support for attentional accounts of stuttering and have both theoretical and clinical implications.",Stuttering; Bilingualism; Language control; Attention; Proficiency

This research examines the language profiles of bilingual children with DS and typically developing (TD) children in comparison to monolinguals, with a view towards identifying the factors associated with language abilities within these populations. Method Four groups of children were recruited: Welsh-English bilinguals with DS (n=10), English monolinguals with DS (n=10), TD Welsh-English bilinguals (n=10) and TD English monolinguals (n=10). Children were individually matched on nonverbal cognitive ability (NVCA) to each child in the bilingual DS group and the four groups were matched on socioeconomic status and gender. Bilinguals were matched on current and lifetime exposure to Welsh and age of first exposure to their L2. Within DS and TD groups, chronological age was statistically controlled for. Language abilities were assessed via standardised assessments and specially designed tasks. Bilinguals were assessed in both of their languages. Results Results show no effect of language status on measures of expressive and receptive language abilities or phonological awareness. Language impairments were evident for both DS groups, particularly for expressive morphosyntax. Welsh receptive vocabulary scores of the bilinguals with DS were comparable to the TD bilinguals. Working memory, phonological awareness and chronological age were the strongest predictors of receptive language outcomes in both DS groups, explaining 90% of the variability. Conclusions In conclusion, we report no adverse outcomes on language development for bilinguals with DS. To our knowledge, this is the first group study of bilingualism in children with DS within the UK. Findings align with and add to the growing body of literature that reports that bilingualism does not negatively impact the language development of children with developmental disabilities. Clinical and educational implications are discussed.",Bilingualism; multilingualism; Down syndrome; developmental disorders; bilingual advantage; bilingual profiles

The study was conducted to modify business curriculum for students with in selected learning institutions in United Arab Emirates. Descriptive method/qualitative approach using observation and interview schedule techniques were employed in data gathering and analysis of population (n=125) of which female students comprised of twenty percent (20%) and males were eighty percent (80%). It was observed that one major struggle that learning facilitators had, how to effectively carry out the learning process with meaningful results and keeping in sight the existence of students from different nationalities. The research findings revealed that students needed updated instructional materials and the universities should modify the business curriculum for students with multiple intelligences. Curriculum modification was not limited to instructional modification or content modification but included a continuum of a wide range of modified educational components in business .On the bases of findings and conclusions derived from the study, and in consideration of the limitations of the study, the following were recommended: curriculum development/modification in business courses offerings,training of personnel, training of faculty needed to have a compulsory component in “teaching and assessing learners with learning challenges”. Similar in-service training was also needed for the already practicing faculty .Further, there was a clear manifestation of lack of resources in learning institutions where special students were found, modified curriculum and differentiated instruction materials for students’ with multiple intelligences must be introduced.",learning disabilities; multiple intelligences; business curriculum; United Arab Emirates

Methods We recruited a purposive sample of 25 couples who were caring for a child with SLD at home from one regional child mental health center in Hong Kong. Data were collected from individual couples via audio-taped, semi-structured interviews between April and June 2011. Each interview lasted for about an hour. We analyzed the interview data using qualitative content analysis, as suggested by Graneheim and Lundman (2004). Results Four identified categories of parents' perceived educational needs were information needs for caregiving, a variety of health concerns with themselves and their child, inadequate psychosocial support, and perceived stigma attached to help-seeking. These results reveal challenges and information for mental health professionals in providing effective educational and psychosocial support and culture-specific health care for these families and their children with learning disabilities. Conclusion Our findings indicate a few important educational needs of parents in caring for a child with SLD that might be underestimated by mental health professionals and teachers, such as psychological support and information needs. To facilitate effective parenting, holistic and individualized needs assessment and education should be provided to address each parent's biopsychosocial and cultural needs in relation to caregiving.",Chinese; family health; learning disorders; parenting; qualitative research

Aims To define the predictive value of early language testing and stability of language development, and perinatal and demographic risk factors for the diagnosis of SLI at 5years, in a cohort of preterm infants. Study design We used a retrospective hospital based cohort study. Subjects Preterm infants <30weeks of gestation, were cared for in NICU at RPAH, between 2004 and 2007, and prospectively enrolled in developmental follow-up. Standardised developmental assessment was done at 3years utilising the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III was done at 5years. Outcome measures Predictive value and stability of early language testing were assessed with respect to SLI at 5years, using measures of diagnostic accuracy and kappa values. Multivariate logistic regression was performed during the distribution of perinatal and demographic risk factors for SLI. Results One-in-five met diagnostic criteria for SLI (19%, n=24). Limited diagnostic accuracy was found with early expressive language and the stability of language scores demonstrated only fair agreement (Cohen's κ .383). Multilingual status and extreme gestational age at 24–25weeks were associated with a six-fold increased risk of SLI (OR 6.09, 95% CI 1.89–19.56; OR 6.09, 95% CI 1.28–29.0). Conclusion We defined a high incidence of SLI among our cohort, but only a limited diagnostic accuracy of early language testing. Multilingual status and extreme prematurity were independent risk factors for SLI.

Mutch and Carol Bower,2018,"Language diversity, language disorder, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder among youth sentenced to detention in Western Australia",article,International Journal of Law and Psychiatry,ScienceDirect,"Background While studies confirm high prevalence of language disorder among justice-involved young people, little is known about the impact of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) on language among this population. It is also not clear how language skills vary according to language diversity in Australian youth justice settings, where a disproportionate number of justice-involved youth are Aboriginal and may not speak Standard Australian English (SAE) as their first language. Language skills are important to understand, as language disorder and language difference can lead to a mismatch between the communication skills of a young person and the communication skills of the justice workforce with whom they are communicating. In the highly verbal environments that are common to justice systems, language disorder and language difference may result in a young person misunderstanding legal information and expectations placed on them and not being adequately understood by the justice workforce. Methods This study examined the language skills of 98 young people sentenced to detention in Western Australia (WA), who participated in a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence of FASD. Language skills assessed using standardised and non-standardised tasks were analysed by the three major language groups identified: speakers of SAE, Aboriginal English and English as an additional language. Results We identified rich diversity of languages, and multilingualism was common. Most young people for whom English was not their first language demonstrated difficulties in SAE competence. Further, nearly one in two young people were identified with language disorder – over half of whom had language disorder associated with FASD. Conclusions This study has documented language diversity and the prevalence of language disorder associated with FASD among a representative sample of youth sentenced to detention in WA. Results underscore the need for the justice workforce to consider language difference when working with justice-involved youth, as well as language disorder and FASD. The findings also demonstrate the need for speech pathology to be embedded as core service in youth justice systems, working in collaboration with local cultural and language advisors and accredited interpreters. This can better enable appropriate identification of and response to communication and associated rehabilitation needs of young people navigating youth justice systems.",Language; Communication; Youth justice; Young offender; Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; FASD

Phonological and morphological awareness are both known to play an important role in reading acquisition. Problems in morpho-phonological information processing could arguably be associated with developmental dyslexia, especially for Finnish, which is a rich morphologically language. We used MEG to study the connection between morpho-phonology in the Finnish language and familial risk for developmental dyslexia. We measured event-related fields (ERFs) of 22 pre-school children without risk and 18 children with familial risk for developmental dyslexia during a morphological task. Pairs of sentences consisting of a verb and its derived noun with the derivational suffix/–jA/and pairs of sentences consisting of a pseudo-verb and its pseudo-noun ending with the same suffix were presented to the participants. The derived nouns were also divided into correctly and incorrectly derived forms. Incorrectly derived forms contained an incorrect morpho-phonological change in the last vowel before the derivational suffix/-jA/. Both typically developing children and children at-risk for developmental dyslexia were sensitive to the morphological information, both in the case of real words and pseudowords, as shown by the sensor level analysis and cluster-based permutation tests for the responses to the morphologically correct vs. incorrect contrast. The groups showed somewhat different response patterns to this contrast. However, no significant differences were found in the between-group differences. No significant differences emerged between typically developing children and children at-risk for developmental dyslexia neither for real words nor for pseudowords. Overall, these findings suggest that pre-school children with and without risk for developmental dyslexia are already sensitive to the processing of morpho-phonological information before entering school.",Derivational morphology; Phonology; Pre-school children; Familial risk for developmental dyslexia; Magnetoencephalography; Reading acquisition

The present study is the first to assess the online comprehension of Spanish articles in bilingual children with DLD. In an eye tracking experiment, we monitored participants’ eye movements as they listened to Spanish articles embedded in structurally simple sentences. Ninety-six subjects from four different groups were evaluated: 24 children with DLD (average age 7;08), 24 children with the same chronological age (average age 7;08), 24 younger children matched for mean length utterance (average age 6;08), and 24 adults (average age 22;05). We calculated the proportion between the preference for the correct visual referent and a competitor object. Our results suggest that children with DLD are capable of timely comprehension of Spanish articles in real time and within simple sentence structures. However, we observed a strong effect of chronological age in the sample of interest; younger children with DLD are able to identify the correct referent, but this preference is weaker compared to the older children with DLD. We also observed local differences between the DLD group, and the other two children control groups, particularly when the chronological age group is introduced as a factor. These findings suggest a developmental trajectory that is different in the DLD group relative to children with typical language development. Notwithstanding, in spite of the article production difficulties previously reported, children with DLD in the present sample appear to be able to comprehend Spanish articles in the current experimental conditions.",Developmental language disorder (DLD); Language comprehension; Articles; Eye movements

Mono- and bilingual children with DLD frequently have co-occurring reading, attention, and related difficulties, compared to children with typical language development (TLD). Data for mono- and bilingual children with DLD and TLD would aid differentiation of language differences versus disorders in bilingual children. Objective We conducted a scoping review of descriptive research on mono-and bilingual children < and >= 9 years old with DLD versus TLD, and related skills (auditory processing, attention, cognition, executive function, and reading). Data Sources We searched PubMed for the terms “bilingual” and “language disorders” or “impairment” and “child[ren]” from August 1, 1979 through October 1, 2018. Charting Methods Two abstracters charted all search results. Main exclusions were: secondary data/reviews, special populations, intervention studies, and case studies/series. Abstracted data included age, related skills measures’, and four language groups of participants: monolingual DLD, monolingual TLD, bilingual DLD, and bilingual TLD. Results Of 366 articles, 159 (43%) met inclusion criteria. Relatively few (14%, n = 22) included all 4 language groups, co-occurring difficulties other than nonverbal intelligence (n = 49, 31%) or reading (n = 51, 32%) or any 9–18 year-olds (31%, n = 48). Just 5 (3%) included only 9-18 year-olds. Among studies with any 9 to 18 year olds, just 4 (8%, 4/48) included 4 language groups. Conclusions Future research should include mono- and bilingual children with both DLD and TLD, beyond 8 years of age, along with data about their related skills.",child; language disorders; multilingualism/bilingualism; MeSH terms; review

Sandberg and Monika Zacharewicz and Teresa Gray,2021,Bilingual Abstract Semantic Associative Network Training (BAbSANT): A Polish-English case study,article,Journal of Communication Disorders,ScienceDirect,"Introduction: This article presents a novel approach to anomia therapy (i.e., BAbSANT: Bilingual Abstract Semantic Associative Network Training) for bilingual persons with aphasia (B-PWA) that capitalizes both on lexico-semantic theories in bilingualism and general theories of semantic organization and learning. Based on previous work, we hypothesized that training abstract words in either language would promote within-language generalization, while training in the nondominant language would promote both within- and cross-language generalization. Methods: This case study used a single-subject A1BA2CA3 design. The participant was living with aphasia secondary to stroke and spoke both Polish and English, with Polish being his native and dominant language. Phase B consisted of abstract word training in Polish and phase C consisted of abstract word training in English. Prior to initiating therapy, in addition to a comprehensive language battery, we administered a cognitive control task to explore the relationship between cognitive control and treatment outcome. Results: We found within-language generalization regardless of the trained language, replicating previous work in monolingual persons with aphasia, further supporting the utility of training abstract words. However, contrary to our second hypothesis, cross-language generalization only occurred when the stronger language was trained. Conclusions: The discussion of the results of this case study is framed within previous work and theories of bilingualism. The lack of cross-language generalization when the weaker language was trained is discussed, taking into account nonverbal cognitive control deficits. In addition to showing the efficacy of BAbSANT, these results highlight the importance of considering cognitive control as a factor influencing therapeutic outcomes in anomia treatment in bilingual PWA.",Aphasia; Treatment; Bilingualism; Generalization; Cognitive control

Twelve dyslexic and 13 nondyslexic adults performed a lexical decision task while stimuli were presented unimodally (either aurally or visually) or bimodally (audiovisually simultaneously). The behavioral data collected during the experiment evidenced more accurate processing for bimodally than for unimodally presented stimuli irrespective of group. Words were processed faster than pseudowords. Notably, no group differences have been found for either accuracy or for reaction times. With respect to brain responses, nondyslexic compared to dyslexic adults elicited stronger hemodynamic responses in the leftward supramarginal gyrus (SMG), as well as in the right hemispheric superior temporal sulcus (STS). Furthermore, dyslexic compared to nondyslexic adults showed reduced responses to only aurally presented signals and enhanced hemodynamic responses to audiovisual, as well as visual stimulation in the right anterior insula. Our behavioral results evidence that the two groups easily identified the two-syllabic proper nouns that we provided them with. Our fMRI results indicate that dyslexics show less neuronal involvement of heteromodal and extrasylvian regions, namely, the STS, SMG, and insula when decoding phonological information. We posit that dyslexic adults evidence deficient functioning of word processing, which could possibly be attributed to deficits in phoneme to grapheme mapping.

Assuming that speaking a language in varying environments involves distinct subskills that can be acquired in differential patterns, the achievement of phonological, lexical, morphosyntactic and textual abilities were assessed separately. For each of these abilities, it was determined to what extent the conditions of restricted input (first vs. second language) and language deficit (typically developing vs. SLI) cause stagnation or a delay in language acquisition.

The context for bilingual acquisition varies considerably and can impact outcomes. In this first article of the special issue, we review research on the timing and amount of bilingual exposure and outcomes of either direct language intervention or educational placements in three groups of children with DD: Specific Language Impairment (SLI), Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and Down syndrome (DS). Children with SLI have been studied more than the other two groups. Findings showed that, on the one hand, the communication skills of simultaneous bilinguals and matched monolinguals with DD were similar for all groups when the stronger language or both languages of the bilingual children were considered. On the other hand, similar to typically developing children, sequential bilinguals and matched monolinguals with SLI (other groups not studied) differed on some but not all second language (L2) measures; even after an extended period of exposure, differences in L2 outcomes were not completely resolved. There is emerging evidence that the typological similarity of the languages being learned influences L2 development in sequential bilinguals, at least in children with SLI. Increasing the frequency of exposure seems to be more related to development of the weaker language in bilinguals with DD than their stronger language. Language intervention studies show the efficacy of interventions but provide little evidence for transfer across languages. In addition, only one (unpublished) study has compared the language and academic outcomes of children with DD in different language education programs. Research on bilingual children with DD in different educational settings/programs is limited, probably as a result of restricted inclusion of these children in some educational settings. We argue for the implementation of full inclusion policies that provide increased access to dual language programs for children with DD and access to a complete range of support services.",Developmental disabilities; Simultaneous bilingual; Sequential bilingual; Development; Language intervention; Language-in-education

In addition, we sought to investigate whether the bottleneck of dyslexic readers' second-language learning lies at the level of word representations or smaller units and whether the amplitude of mismatch negativity is correlated with native-language literacy and related skills. We found that the activation of brain representations for familiar second-language words, but not for second-language speech sounds or native-language words, was weaker in children with dyslexia than in typical readers. Source localization revealed that dyslexia was associated with weak activation of the right temporal cortex, which has been previously linked with word-form learning. Importantly, the amplitude of the mismatch negativity for familiar second-language words correlated with native-language literacy and rapid naming scores, suggesting a close link between second-language processing and these skills.",Dyslexia; Reading skills; Speech; Language learning; Second language; Mismatch negativity

In addition, it is not clear whether bilinguals' speech perception in challenging listening conditions is specific to the type of degradation, or whether there is a shared mechanism for bilingual speech processing under complex listening conditions. Therefore, the current study examined the speech perception of 60 Arabic-Hebrew bilinguals and a control group of native Hebrew speakers during degraded (speech in noise, vocoded speech) and quiet listening conditions. Between participant comparisons (comparing native Hebrew speakers and bilinguals' perceptual performance in L1) and within participant comparisons (perceptual performance of bilinguals in L1 and L2) were conducted. The findings showed that bilinguals in L1 had more difficulty in noisy conditions than their control counterparts did, even when performed like controls under favorable listening conditions. However, bilingualism did not hinder language learning mechanisms. Bilinguals in L1 outperformed native Hebrew speakers in the perception of vocoded speech, demonstrating more extended learning processes. Bilinguals' perceptual performance in L1 versus L2 varied by task complexity. Correlation analyses revealed that bilinguals who coped better with noise degradation were more successful in perceiving the vocoding distortion. Together, these results provide insights into the mechanisms that contribute to speech perceptual performance in challenging listening conditions and suggest that bilinguals' language proficiency and age of language acquisition are not the only factors that affect performance. Rather, duration of exposure to languages, co-activation, and the ability to benefit from exposure to novel stimuli appear to affect the perceptual performance of bilinguals, even when operating in their dominant language. Our findings suggest that bilinguals use a shared mechanism for speech processing under challenging listening conditions.",Bilingualism; Speech in noise; Vocoded speech; Challenging listening conditions; First language (L1); Second language (L2)

A total of 99 five-year-old pupils from schools in the Tenerife Island (Canary Islands, Spain) participated. The subtests of expressive vocabulary and of receptive and expressive word classes of the CELF-4 were used. The intervention program consisted of 75 sessions lasting 20minutes each. The results indicated that pupils diagnosed with developmental language disorder initially performed worse in vocabulary and word classes than those with TD. Also, the pupils with developmental language disorder not only improved their performance by the end of the program, but were found to be the group with the greatest gains from the intervention. There are educational implications for organizing an early intervention of an inclusive nature.

The review, conducted using the same protocol across sites, showed that special education policies rarely addressed second language learning explicitly. However, at all sites, the policies favoured inclusion and educational planning based on individual needs, and thus implied that students with DD would have opportunities for second language learning. The language-in-education policies occasionally specified the support individuals with special needs would receive. At some sites, policies and educational options provided little support for minority languages, a factor that could contribute to subtractive bilingualism.

The study was conducted with three groups of 1st and 2nd graders matched in age, SES and nonverbal IQ: a) monolingual English-speaking children from a general education program, b) native Japanese-speaking children from a Japanese–English two-way immersion bilingual program and c) native English-speaking children from the same bilingual program. An odd-man-out task that took into account the phonological and orthographical contrasts between English and Japanese was developed to assess onset awareness. The results showed that the bilingual children outperformed their monolingual peers in processing onsets that are shared between the two languages, which provided empirical support for the first hypothesis derived from structural sensitivity theory and highlighted the importance of contextual variability in bilingual metalinguistic processing. The second hypothesis derived from structural sensitivity theory, which predicated that bilingual advantage would be more evident in processing novel stimuli, was not confirmed in the present study. The absence of the predicted group difference may be attributed to the disparity in the extent of novelty of the stimuli and the difference in the comparability of participants' degrees of bilingualism between the present study and previous research. Finally, expanding existing research, results from this study showed that cross-language transfer can occur at a phonetic featural level.

Using an online survey, data were collected in six socio-culturally and linguistically diverse locations across four countries: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. In total, 361 surveys were included in the analysis from respondents who were primarily teachers and speech-language pathologists working in schools, daycares/preschools, or community-based clinics. The overall picture that emerged from the data reflected a disconnection between practice and opinion. In general, respondents believed that children with both mild and severe disabilities are capable of learning a second language, although their opinions were more neutral for the latter group. However, children with both mild and severe disabilities who spoke only a minority language at home had less access to services for second language learners than did their typically developing peers, although respondents agreed that such services should be more available. Regardless of clinical group, children who lived in homes where a minority language was spoken were often exposed to, assessed in, and treated in the majority language only; again, respondents generally disagreed with these practices. Finally, second language classes were less available to children in the two disability groups compared to typically developing bilingual children, with general agreement that the opportunity to acquire a second language should be more available, especially to those with mild disabilities.

Consequently, these facts may be represented and/or accessed as language-specific memories, requiring a qualitatively different retrieval process in their other language. Indeed, behavioral studies reveal that bilinguals verify arithmetic facts faster and better in the language of learning. Here, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used as a window into the neurocognitive processes underlying this language bias in children. ERPs were recorded while bilingual children verified the correctness of multiplication solutions. Operands were presented as spoken number words in Spanish and English, separately. Although a language bias was revealed in behavior, both languages elicited the same ERP correctness effect, an N400, reflecting similar cognitive processes in both languages. This suggests that the source of the behavioral difference is not at the level of semantic access.

Five groups of children (N=600) were involved in the study: children diagnosed with specific learning disorders, poor comprehenders, early bilinguals, late bilinguals, and a control group.

Mean group differences and profiles within each group were analyzed. The comparison of different groups evidences how, within each dimension, there might be similar profiles across different groups (e.g., the same reading comprehension skills in early bilinguals, late bilinguals, and children with specific learning disorders) and highly discrepant skills within the same group (e.g., word and non-word reading in late bilinguals).

Skeide,2016,Predicting early signs of dyslexia at a preliterate age by combining behavioral assessment with structural MRI,article,NeuroImage,ScienceDirect,"Background Recent studies suggest that neurobiological anomalies are already detectable in pre-school children with a family history of developmental dyslexia (DD). However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies showing a direct link between those differences at a preliterate age and the subsequent literacy difficulties seen in school. It is also not clear whether the prediction of DD in pre-school children can be significantly improved when considering neurobiological predictors, compared to models based on behavioral literacy precursors only. Methods We recruited 53 pre-reading children either with (N=25) or without a family risk of DD (N=28). Quantitative T1 MNI data and literacy precursor abilities were assessed at kindergarten age. A subsample of 35 children was tested for literacy skills either one or two years later, that is, either in first or second grade. Results The group comparison of quantitative T1 measures revealed significantly higher T1 intensities in the left anterior arcuate fascicle (AF), suggesting reduced myelin concentration in preliterate children at risk of DD. A logistic regression showed that DD can be predicted significantly better (p=.024) when neuroanatomical differences between groups are used as predictors (80%) compared to a model based on behavioral predictors only (63%). The Wald statistic confirmed that the T1 intensity of the left AF is a statistically significant predictor of DD (p<.05). Conclusions Our longitudinal results provide evidence for the hypothesis that neuroanatomical anomalies in children with a family risk of DD are related to subsequent problems in acquiring literacy.

Vidyasagar,2019,Visual attention and neural oscillations in reading and dyslexia: Are they possible targets for remediation?,article,Neuropsychologia,ScienceDirect,"After decades of finding a range of cognitive functions both in visual and phonological domains that correlate with reading performance, there are in recent years attempts to solve the causation versus correlation dilemma in finding a core deficit in developmental dyslexia (DD). Thus, longitudinal studies that aim to predict reading difficulties from studies done in pre-reading years and reading-level matched studies that try to factor out the effect due to lack of reading in DD cohorts, have helped identify two possible candidates to be added to the classical phonological suspect. One is a deficit in visuo-spatial attention that underpins our ability to selectively attend to individual objects in a cluttered world, which is fundamental in being able to identify letters and words in a text such as the one you are reading now. The other is an impairment in synchronised neuronal oscillations that may be crucial in mediating many cortical functions and also communication between brain regions. The latter may be a general deficit affecting many areas of the brain and thus underlie the wide-ranging co-morbidities in DD. However, that neuronal synchrony is a critical mediator in visual attention, brings the two suggestions into one hypothesis of a core deficit that triggers in some young children a great reluctance to read, putting them at a handicap in comparison to other children. This deprives them of the advantage that normal readers have in development of those visual and phonological processes that are needed for reading. This insight into aetiology may help in developing new remediation strategies, specifically aimed at improving visual attention and neuronal synchrony.",Dyslexia; Visual attention; Neural synchrony; Oscillations; Remediation; Magnocellular pathway

Methods The study group was composed by 14 bilingual deaf children and the control group by the same number of monolingual children implanted at our Institution. The control group was obtained by matching to each bilingual child a monolingual one with a similar clinical history regarding age at hearing loss diagnosis, age at first hearing-aids fitting and age at CI procedure. Children received a speech perception and linguistic development evaluation through specific structured tests. The linguistic competence of the patients both in mainstream and native language was determined by the Student Oral Language Observation Matrix (SOLOM). Results We did not find any statistically significant differences between bilingual and monolingual children in speech perception outcomes. Nevertheless, we obtained different results concerning language skills: bilingual implanted children scored lower at structured language tests, even if the difference was not statistically relevant. Bilingual children scored significantly lower than monolingual ones at the SOLOM scale for linguistic competence. Conclusion The results reported in the present study show better language skills after cochlear implant in Italian monolingual cases than in bilingual ones.

Yet, it remains unclear whether simultaneous second language acquisition affects this sensitivity. Here, we investigated the influence of early acquisition of two languages on the event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with lexical-semantic processing of spoken words in 18-month-old monolingual and bilingual children. Children were exposed to an auditory semantic priming task in French, while their ERPs were recorded. Word pairs were either semantically related (e.g., train-bike) or unrelated (e.g., chicken-bike), and they were presented at two stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA). The results revealed that only monolingual children exhibited a semantic priming effect at the short SOA while at the long SOA condition, both monolingual and bilingual children exhibited more pronounced ERPs in response to unrelated compared with related target words. This finding suggests that both language groups are sensitive to taxonomic relations between words but activation of sematic network might be less automatized or slower in bilingual children.",Semantic priming; Language-related ERPs; Bilinguals; Automatic activation; Controlled mechanisms; Language development

We also compare our method against previous results measuring information content in Alzheimer’s disease, and report an improvement over other topic-modeling approaches.

Also, some complex graphemes can be found in some languages but not in others. The purpose of this study is to determine if the congruency and complexity of English graphemes influence letter detection in L2 learners. We further investigated whether age group (7-, 9- and 11-year-old children, and university undergraduates) determines the size of these effects. Participants completed two different letter detection tasks using the mouse-tracking paradigm. Results from Experiment 1 indicate that only younger children are slightly affected by incongruent graphemes. Results from Experiment 2 show that all readers perform worse with complex graphemes. L2 learners interiorize English phonology at early stages, being barely affected by their native Spanish language. Importantly, L2 learners decode complex graphemes similarly to native English readers.

The purpose of this study was to compare social skills and autistic features in monolingual English and bilingual English-Spanish children with autism spectrum disorder. Methods We conducted a review of the multidisciplinary evaluations done in all children aged one to six years diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in an inner city, university-affiliated clinic from 2003 to 2013. Collected information included demographics, developmental testing, and autistic characteristics. Results We identified 462 children; 165 were bilingual English-Spanish and 297 were monolingual English. Parents of bilingual children reported stereotyped or repetitive use of language more often (66% vs 48% P = 0.002) than monolinguals. Significant differences were not found in social interaction, use of nonverbal behaviors, peer relationships, sharing or social or emotional reciprocity, mannerisms, or autism severity. Conclusions Bilingualism does not seem to confer an extra vulnerability on children with autism spectrum disorder; however, differences in qualitative use of language were observed.",Autism; Bilingualism; Young children; Language; Social characteristics

These studies have revealed that children with SLI are sensitive to syntactic, semantic, and real-world information, but do not show sensitivity to grammatical morphemes with low phonetic saliency, and they show longer reaction times than age-matched controls. TD children from the age of 4 show trace reactivation, but some children with SLI fail to show this effect, which resembles the pattern of adults and TD children with low working memory. Finally, findings from the German Language Development (GLAD) Project have revealed that a group of children at risk for SLI had a history of an auditory delay and impaired processing of prosodic information in the first months of their life, which is not detectable later in life. Although this is a single project that needs to be replicated with a larger group of children, it provides preliminary support for accounts of SLI which make an explicit link between an early deficit in the processing of phonology and later language deficits, and the Computational Complexity Hypothesis that argues that the language deficit in children with SLI lies in difficulties integrating different types of information at the interfaces.",Specific Language Impairment; On-line sentence processing; Infant speech perception; Wh-movement; Working memory; Phonological processing

Twenty-eight Spanish-English bilinguals and five monolinguals recruited to test and validate the model were evaluated in their picture naming skills in each language and filled out a language use questionnaire. We examined whether BiLex can (i) simulate their naming performance in each language while taking into account their L2 age of acquisition, use and exposure to each language, and (ii) predict naming performance in other participants not used in model training. Our findings showed that BiLex could accurately simulate naming performance in bilinguals, suggesting that differences in L2 age of acquisition, language use and exposure can account for individual differences in bilingual lexical access.",Bilingualism; Age of acquisition; Language exposure; Lexical access; Naming; Computational modeling; Neural network; Evolutionary algorithm

In particular, we tested the hypothesis that prefixes repel stress (Rastle & Coltheart, 2000) by investigating the likelihood with which patients with surface dyslexia assign second-syllable stress to prefixed words. Five such patients were presented with three types of disyllabic words for reading aloud: ‘regular’ prefixed words with weak-strong stress pattern (e.g., remind); ‘irregular’ prefixed words with strong-weak stress pattern (e.g., reflex); and non-prefixed words with strong-weak stress pattern (e.g., scandal). Results showed that all five patients frequently regularized the strong-weak prefixed words by pronouncing them with second syllable stress. These regularization errors provide strong evidence for the functional role of prefixes in stress assignment during reading. Additional computational simulations using the rule-based algorithm for pronouncing disyllables developed by Rastle and Coltheart (2000) and the CDP++ model of reading aloud (Perry et al., 2010) allowed us to evaluate how these two opponent approaches to reading aloud fare in respect of the patient data.",Reading aloud; Prefixes; Surface dyslexia; Computational modelling

Therefore, the present study compared articulation skills in bilingual Turkish-Dutch/Moroccan Arabic-Dutch children with migration background and monolingual Dutch children without migration background. Moreover, possible factors influencing articulation skills were determined. Methods 15 bilingual Turkish-Dutch, 15 bilingual Moroccan Arabic-Dutch and an age and gender matched group consisting of 15 monolingual Dutch children, all aged between 6 and 7 years and living in Flanders, were included in the present study. Articulation was evaluated using a picture naming test. Speech samples were transcribed phonetically and articulatory analysis, including a phonetic inventory and phonetic and phonological analyses, was performed. The phonetic analysis made a distinction between distortions, substitutions, additions, and omissions. For the phonological analysis, a distinction between syllable structure processes, substitution processes and assimilation processes was made. Moreover, parents were administered a self-report questionnaire to determine possible factors influencing articulation skills. Results A statistically significant difference in additions was found when comparing the three groups. Interestingly, both the Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan Arabic-Dutch groups used additions that were not present in the Dutch group (i.e. respectively addition of the [ə] and [ər]). Concerning phonological analysis, it was found that deletions of final consonants were more present in the bilingual groups compared to the monolingual group. Moreover, statistically significant effects of origin, home language, and language preference of the child were found on presence of both phonetic errors and phonological disorders. Conclusion Findings of the present study showed that some phonetic errors and phonological processes were more present in the group of bilingual children with migration background compared to the group of monolingual children without migration background. Interestingly, phonetic errors and phonological processes were more present when (1) the child had a Turkish origin, or (2) when the dominant language at the home environment was Turkish, or (3) when the preferred language of the child was Turkish. Given the increased attention to migration, findings of the present study are highly important for speech-language pathologists, teachers, and more generally, all professionals working with bilingual populations with a Moroccan Arabic or Turkish migration background.",Articulation skills; Influencing factors; Bilingualism; Immigration

The participants were individuals with expertise either in special needs and/or language education to support bilingualism (e.g., second language (L2) instruction), who served as key informants about service delivery and/or policy in these areas. Six themes emerged as salient during the analysis: we include all kids, special needs drives it, time/scheduling conflicts, IEP/IPP/statement drives it, it’s up to the parents, and service availability. The results suggested that access to language programs and services is limited for children with DD, even though participants at all sites reported adherence to a philosophy of inclusion. A priority on special education services over language services was identified, as well as barriers to providing children with DD access to programs and services to support bilingual development. Some of these barriers included time and scheduling conflicts and limited service availability. Additionally, the role of parents in decision making was affirmed, although, in contrast to special education services, decision-making about participation or exemption from language programs was typically left up to the parents. Overall, the results suggest a need for greater attention to providing supports for both first (L1) and L2 language development for bilingual children with DD and greater access to available language programs.",Bilingualism; Developmental disabilities; Inclusion; English language learners; English as a second language; Bilingual education

Theories of bilingualism suggests that exposure to two languages may yield a functional and neuroanatomical adaptation to support the learning of two languages (Klein et al., 2014). To test the hypothesis that this neural adaptation may vary as a function of structural and orthographic characteristics of bilinguals’ two languages, we compared Spanish-English and French-English bilingual children, and English monolingual children, using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy neuroimaging (fNIRS, ages 6–10, N =26). Spanish offers consistent sound-to-print correspondences (“phonologically transparent” or “shallow”); such correspondences are more opaque in French and even more opaque in English (which has both transparent and “phonologically opaque” or “deep” correspondences). Consistent with our hypothesis, both French- and Spanish-English bilinguals showed hyperactivation in left posterior temporal regions associated with direct sound-to-print phonological analyses and hypoactivation in left frontal regions associated with assembled phonology analyses. Spanish, but not French, bilinguals showed a similar effect when reading Irregular words.

A novel object was presented with a familiar object, and children were taught new labels for objects under two conditions. In the Align condition, the speaker’s gaze and the ME cue provided the same information (the speaker looked at the novel object while labeling it with a novel name). In the Conflict condition, the speaker’s gaze and the ME cue provided competing information (the speaker looked at the familiar object while labeling it with a novel name). Using a visual world eye-tracking paradigm, children’s retention was assessed by testing novel objects with novel labels and by testing the familiar objects with novel labels. We found that all children successfully retained the novel labels for novel objects when both eye gaze and ME provided the same information. However, when the cues conflicted, bilingual children did not perform above chance for either novel objects or familiar objects. In contrast, monolingual children demonstrated retention of novel labels for familiar objects but not for novel objects. Together, the findings suggest that redundant cues benefit word retention in all children regardless of linguistic background. Furthermore, when speaker gaze and ME conflict, bilingual children appear to disregard both cues during retention, whereas monolingual children may be more willing to retain novel labels for familiar words, suggesting that they prioritize a speaker’s eye gaze over ME.",Speaker eye gaze; Mutual exclusivity; Word learning; Bilingualism; Eye tracking; Retention

Subcortical language processing as the missing link between evolution and language disorder in psychosis – A neurolinguistic approach,article,Journal of Neurolinguistics,ScienceDirect,"Objective To achieve a unified and plausible concept of the aetiology of psychosis. Background From an evolutionary point of view, the capacity for language evolved relatively abruptly 150,000–200,000 years ago as a result of a saltational genetic change that allowed the two hemispheres to develop with a degree of independence. According to Crow (1997) the predisposition to schizophrenia might be a component of Homo sapiens-specific variation associated with the capacity for language. Crow (2000) suggested that schizophrenia is “the price that Homo sapiens pays for language”. Language impairment is one of the, core phenomenological characteristics of patients with schizophrenia (DeLisi, 2001). These symptoms might be understood as a breakdown of bi-hemispheric coordination of language. After reviewing the literature and regarding our own data concerning subcortical ambiguity processing, we suggest that subcortical language processing might play a crucial role as a missing link between the evolution of language (genetics), hemispheric dysbalance and language disorder in schizophrenia. Concentrating on the long time underestimated subcortical role of high order language function might open new perspectives in understanding the aetiology of psychosis. Conclusion From our point of view there might be at least two pathways useful in forming a neurolinguistic approach to understand language symptoms in schizophrenia: first, hemispheric imbalance might play a crucial role in the development of schizophrenia. The second pathway leads to a potentially disturbed interdependency between fronto-temporo-parietal and subcortical neural networks and their importance in the processing of high order linguistic functions (such as decoding ambiguities).",Schizophrenia; Language lateralisation; Subcortex; Ambiguity; Evolution; Basal ganglia

It is currently unknown if successful inhibition of a non-target language involves general cognitive control (domain-general cognitive control) or whether it is control specific to linguistic mechanisms (domain-specific language control) during language production. The primary aim of this systematic quantitative literature review was to identify and synthesize available evidence, in relation to bilinguals with aphasia, for these two mechanisms. We conducted a literature search across five databases using a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria designed for the review. We extracted data from twenty studies reporting original research in bilinguals with aphasia. The results provided evidence for both domain-general cognitive control and domain-specific language control mechanisms, although most studies showed the involvement of domain-general cognitive control. Available neuroimaging data indicated that the neural regions involved in domain-general language control in bilinguals with aphasia were the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, basal ganglia, and the frontal lobe.

Participants included 22 native English-speaking children living in France. French was evaluated using a standardized receptive vocabulary test, as well as tests of phonology and morphosyntax. English was evaluated using the Core Language Score subtests from the CELF-4-UK. The children varied in age (6;9–12;7) and length of exposure (0;11–3;9) to French and were tested twice at 12-month intervals. At T1, 7 children scored below norms in both languages, while only 3 did so at T2. Two out of these 3 were arguably not typically developing children. Length of exposure to French emerged as an important factor only at T1, when a number of children were in early stages of acquisition (≤18months of exposure). English scores varied by age and weekly use of English. In successive bilingual children, language performance on L2 standardized tests can be expected to be (well) below norms during the first 18 months of exposure. English scores revealed that weak L1 performance is part of typical development in this bilingual context, but that L1 retention is also a possibility.

In the experiment, children with normal and impaired language development heard spoken real words and pseudowords presented only once or two times in a row. In typically developing children, the activation in the bilateral superior temporal cortices was attenuated to the second presentation of the same word. In SLI children, this repetition effect was nearly nonexistent in the left hemisphere. Furthermore, the activation was equally strong to words and pseudowords in SLI children whereas in the typically developing children the left hemisphere activation persisted longer for pseudowords than words. Our results indicate that the short-term maintenance of linguistic activation that underlies spoken word recognition is defective in SLI particularly in the left language-dominant hemisphere.

We predicted that lower L2-exposure should produce less efficient L2 word recognition processing at the behavioural level, alongside neurophysiological changes at the early pre-lexical and lexical levels, but not at a post-lexical level. Results confirmed this hypothesis in accuracy and in the N1 component of the EEG signal. Precisely, bilinguals with lower L2-exposure appeared less accurate in determining semantic relatedness when target words were presented in L2, but this condition posed no such problem for bilinguals with higher L2-exposure. Moreover, L2-exposure modulates early processes of word recognition not only in L2 but also in L1 brain activity, thus challenging a fully non-selective access account (cf. BIA + model, Dijkstra and van Heuven, 2002). We interpret our findings with reference to the frequency-lag hypothesis (Gollan et al., 2011).",L2 exposure; Bilingual word recognition; Language mediation; EEG

Meanwhile, individuals with dyslexia have a core deficit in phonological processing. Based on these findings, we thus hypothesized that children with dyslexia may exhibit exact calculation impairment while doing mental arithmetic. The reaction time and accuracy while doing exact and approximate addition with symbolic Arabic digits and non-symbolic visual arrays of dots were compared between typically developing children and children with dyslexia. Reaction time analyses did not reveal any differences across two groups of children, the accuracies, interestingly, revealed a distinction of approximation and exact addition across two groups of children. Specifically, two groups of children had no differences in approximation. Children with dyslexia, however, had significantly lower accuracy in exact addition in both symbolic and non-symbolic tasks than that of typically developing children. Moreover, linguistic performances were selectively associated with exact calculation across individuals. These results suggested that children with dyslexia have a mental arithmetic deficit specifically in the realm of exact calculation, while their approximation ability is relatively intact.",Dyslexia; Exact calculation; Approximation; Phonological processing; Number sense

Share,2014,Orthographic learning and self-teaching in a bilingual and biliterate context,article,Journal of Experimental Child Psychology,ScienceDirect,"The aim of this study was to examine self-teaching in the context of English as a foreign language literacy acquisition. Three groups comprising 88 sixth-grade children participated. The first group consisted of Russian–Hebrew-speaking bilinguals who had acquired basic reading skills in Russian as their first language (L1) and literacy and who were literate in Hebrew as a second language. The second group consisted of Russian–Hebrew-speaking bilinguals who had not learned to read in their native Russian but had acquired Hebrew as their first literate language. The third group consisted of Hebrew-speaking monolingual children who were literate in Hebrew. This design facilitated examining the effect of biliteracy and bilingualism on basic English reading skills. We hypothesized that due to the proximity between the Russian and English orthographies as opposed to the Hebrew–English “distance,” the Russian–Hebrew-speaking biliterate group who acquired basic reading and spelling skills in L1 Russian would have superior self-teaching in English as opposed to the two other groups. The standard two-session self-teaching paradigm was employed with naming (speed and accuracy) and orthographic choice as posttest measures of orthographic learning. Results showed that after 4years of English instruction, all three groups showed evidence of self-teaching on naming speed and orthographic recognition. The Russian–Hebrew-speaking biliterate group, moreover, showed a partial advantage over the comparison groups for initial decoding of target pseudowords and clear-cut superiority for measures of later orthographic learning, thereby showing self-teaching while supporting the script dependence hypothesis.",Biliterate; Bilingualism; English foreign language; Orthographic learning; Self-teaching; Script dependence

Aims The present study investigated if children with LI perform weaker than typically developing (TD) controls on narrative macrostructure in different tasks, whether this changes over time and if between-group differences stem from linguistic or cognitive factors. Methods and procedures A group of monolingual Dutch children with LI (n=84) and a TD control group (n=45) were tested with a story comprehension and a story generation task. All children were five or six at wave 1 and six or seven at wave 2. Information was collected on vocabulary, grammar, verbal memory and sustained attention. Outcomes and results At wave 1, the LI group performed weaker than the TD group in both tasks. At wave 2, the groups performed similarly on story comprehension. On story generation, the TD group still outperformed the LI group. Sustained attention mediated the relationship between group and story generation. Conclusions and implications Effects of LI on narrative macrostructure are moderated by age and task and may stem from sustained attention weaknesses. These findings have implications for using narrative tasks in educational and diagnostic settings and may direct future interventions.",Language impairment; Narratives; Story comprehension; Story generation

Bilingualism has also been shown to contribute to cognitive reserve by offsetting the behavioral presentation of brain injury or neural degeneration. However, this effect has not been closely examined in individuals with post-stroke or post-TBI aphasia. Because bilingualism has been suggested as a factor of cognitive reserve, it may provide protective mechanisms for adults with aphasia. In the current study, evidence for the bilingual advantage was examined in 13 Spanish-English bilingual healthy adults (BHA) compared to 13 English monolingual healthy adults (MHA). Additionally, evidence for cognitive reserve as defined by a bilingual advantage was examined in 18 Spanish-English bilingual adults with aphasia (BAA) compared to 18 English monolingual adults with aphasia (MAA) who were otherwise matched on their age, education, language impairment, and non-verbal executive functions. All participants completed a non-linguistic cognitive control task that included congruent and incongruent conditions. Results indicated no bilingual cognitive control advantage on reaction times in healthy adult groups; however, BAA were faster than MAA, suggesting that bilingualism may contribute to cognitive reserve in adults with aphasia.

The primarily contrastive phonetic property for English voiceless stops is voice onset time (VOT), with the fundamental frequency (f0) of the post-stop vowel being non-contrastive but still informative for the voicing contrast. On the other hand, in Seoul Korean, stop VOT is a non-primary cue, but it is necessary to maintain the full three-way laryngeal contrast in the language. Post-stop f0 is the primary cue for the Seoul Korean aspirated stops. Seoul Korean speakers have been reported to imitate aspirated stops with longer VOT by raising their post-stop f0 (Kwon, 2019). In this study, English monolingual speakers and Seoul Korean-English bilingual speakers heard and shadowed model speech containing English voiceless stops manipulated by either raising post-stop f0 or lengthening VOT. Their imitation was assessed with two acoustic measurements, stop VOT and post-onset f0, of the voiceless stops, before and after the imitators heard the model speech with the two manipulations. A separate discrimination test confirmed that both manipulations were reliably perceived by both the monolingual and the bilingual imitators. English monolingual speakers' imitation data suggest that their shadowing productions reflect the phonological significance of the two phonetic properties, and only the imitative changes induced by a contrastive cue last beyond the immediate shadowing targets. In addition, Seoul Korean-English bilingual speakers, when performing the spontaneous imitation tasks in English, do not draw on their native (Seoul Korean) phonology. Implications of these findings on the role of phonology in the spontaneous imitation of bilingual and monolingual speakers are discussed.",Convergence; Spontaneous imitation; Voiceless stop; Non-contrastive cue; Bilingual imitator; Seoul Korean; English

At this time, very few studies have directly examined the efficacy of clinical intervention methods for bilingual children. Clinical decisions for this population cannot, therefore, be based on the strongest forms of research evidence, but must be inferred from other sources. This article reviews the available intervention research on bilingual children, the current clinical recommendations for this population, and the strength of the empirical and theoretical support on which these recommendations are based. Finally, future directions are suggested for documenting current methods of intervention and developing optimal methods for different groups of bilingual children. Although the current research base is limited, the few studies available to date uniformly suggest that interventions that include a focus on both languages are superior to those that focus on only one language. The available research offers little guidance, however, as to the particular treatment methods that may be most appropriate. Further research is required to examine efficacy with larger numbers of children and children of various bilingual backgrounds. It is suggested that efforts to develop and test intervention methods for bilingual children must carefully consider the linguistic heterogeneity of bilingual children and the cultural variation in communication styles, child rearing practices, and child rearing beliefs. This will lead to the development of methods that may involve treatment methods that are more suitable for other languages and cultures. Learning outcomes: Readers will become familiar with current recommendations for the treatment of bilingual children with language impairment, including which language or languages to use, the requirement for cultural sensitivity, and specific procedures that may be beneficial for bilingual populations.

Bilinguals switch between contexts in which only one language is present or both languages are equiprobable. Previous research by Wu and Thierry (2013) suggested that the bilingual language context can modify the workings of inhibitory control mechanisms. Here we investigate whether this can be replicated and whether other attentional mechanisms (alerting and orienting) also adjust depending on whether we are in a bilingual or a monolingual situation. Bilinguals performed the Attentional Network Task (ANT) task, which allows us to measure three types of attentional processes: alerting, orienting and executive control. Crucially, while performing the ANT task, participants also saw words presented in only one language (e.g., Catalan; monolingual context) or in two languages (Catalan and Spanish; bilingual context); this allowed us to assess whether the three attentional processes would be modified by language context. Compared to the monolingual context, in the bilingual context the target-P3 amplitude was enhanced for the alerting and executive control networks but not for the orienting network. This suggests that bilinguals’ state of alertness was enhanced when surrounded by words from two languages. Exploratory analyses reveal that within the bilingual context, language switches have an alerting effect, as indexed by a greater target-N1, thus impacting upcoming visual processing of the flanker. Response hand activation is speeded up for congruent trials in a similar way that arbitrary alerting cues speed them up. This speed-up was reflected in a greater LRP in the bilingual context, but it was not reflected in behavioral measures (RTs or ACC). Thus, a bilingual context can enhance attentional capacity towards non-linguistic information. It also reveals how flexible the cognitive system is.",Bilingual language context; Executive control; Attention

The present study investigated whether the role of pure copying differs in Chinese and English literacy acquisition by following a group of early Chinese-English bilinguals from kindergarten to grade two across three time points. Age, nonverbal IQ, three cognitive-linguistic skills administered in Chinese (i.e., phonological awareness, morphological awareness, and RAN) and pure copying of unfamiliar scripts (Korean and Hebrew) were tested in 188 children (mean age = 5.54 years) when they were in their final year of kindergarten. Both Chinese and English word reading and spelling performance were measured when they were in first and second grades, respectively. Results showed that pure copying skill was a critical predictor of Chinese reading and spelling, whereas it was not a significant longitudinal correlate of English reading and spelling. In addition, Chinese phonological awareness was a unique correlate of subsequent English, but not Chinese, word reading and spelling. This finding highlights the unique features of literacy learning in two different writing systems and suggests the importance of using somewhat different strategies according to the unique features of different writing systems during literacy learning and teaching.",Copying; Reading; Spelling; Chinese

Currently, only a few case reports are available on SLI in Dravidian languages. The morphological complexity inherent to Dravidian languages such as Kannada provides a potential avenue to verify one of the two prevailing accounts of SLI: the morphological richness theory and CGC (Computational Grammatical Complexity) hypothesis. While the previous theory predicts the relatively spared performance of children with SLI (CwSLI) on syntactic morphology in morphologically complex languages, the latter predicts a diametrically opposite performance. Data from a group of 15 Kannada-speaking CwSLI supported the morphological richness theory, and further revealed five distinct profiles of SLI. The results of this study reflected that CwSLI learning the agglutinative language (Kannada) as compared with language-matched children without SLI, displayed some shared deficits (e.g., in phonological processing on a non-word repetition task) with CwSLI learning English. However, CwSLI learning the morphosyntactically rich language Kannada differed remarkably from English-learning CwSLI by not showing deficits in syntactic morphology relative to language-matched peers (e.g., PNG, verb, tense, case, and pronoun).",SLI; Morphosyntax; Kannada; Agglutinative

This paper outlines the development of the Multilingual Children with Speech Sound Disorders: Position Paper created to guide speech-language pathologists’ (SLPs’) facilitation of multilingual children's speech. An international expert panel was assembled comprising 57 researchers (SLPs, linguists, phoneticians, and speech scientists) with knowledge about multilingual children's speech, or children with speech sound disorders. Combined, they had worked in 33 countries and used 26 languages in professional practice. Fourteen panel members met for a one-day workshop to identify key points for inclusion in the position paper. Subsequently, 42 additional panel members participated online to contribute to drafts of the position paper. A thematic analysis was undertaken of the major areas of discussion using two data sources: (a) face-to-face workshop transcript (133 pages) and (b) online discussion artifacts (104 pages). Finally, a moderator with international expertise in working with children with speech sound disorders facilitated the incorporation of the panel's recommendations. The following themes were identified: definitions, scope, framework, evidence, challenges, practices, and consideration of a multilingual audience. The resulting position paper contains guidelines for providing services to multilingual children with speech sound disorders (http://www.csu.edu.au/research/multilingual-speech/position-paper).

Method 50 adolescents enrolled in grades 8, 9 and 10 in Reykjavik (Iceland) public schools (27 L1 speakers and 23 L2 speakers) participated. Standardized language tests and language samples were collected in Icelandic and English. Self-ratings and parent ratings of language proficiency were obtained in Icelandic, English and, for L2 speakers, in the home language as well. Results As in previous studies, L2 speakers scored far below L1 speakers on formal tests of Icelandic, and also in conversation. The groups were similar in their English skills, with both groups scoring far below L1 English norms. Self-rated performance agreed well with measured performance. For the L2 speakers, self-rated performance in the home language was similar to performance in Icelandic and English. L1 speakers demonstrated much higher performance in Icelandic than English; L2 speakers’ performance was more evenly distributed over their three languages. Discussion The considerable English exposure available in Iceland leads to similar English skills for both L1 and L2 groups, but affects their overall language development in different ways. L1 adolescents maintain a clear dominance in Icelandic, whereas the proficiency of the L2 group is more equally distributed across their three languages, leading to unpredictable patterns of language dominance and at the group level, low performance compared to native speaker expectations in all three languages. These language outcomes in adolescence are of great concern as they do not equip the L2 speakers with the functional communication skills they require for further schooling and jobs. The study calls for a reconsideration of typical multilingual outcomes as necessarily implying unproblematic language skills and suggest that language policy changes are required in Iceland to ensure that children graduate compulsory education with solid language skills that allow them to pursue their goals.",Bilingualism; Trilingualism; Evaluation; Developmental Language Disorder; Language impairment; Self-report; Icelandic; English

The goal is to exploit corpus-based approaches inspired by the fields of natural language processing and machine learning. Methods and materials We extract a large variety of features from language samples and use them to train language models and well known machine learning algorithms as the underlying predictors. The methods are evaluated on two different datasets and three language tasks. One dataset contains samples of two spontaneous narrative tasks performed by 118 children with an average age of 13 years and a second dataset contains play sessions from over 600 younger children with an average age of 6 years. Results We compare results against a cut off baseline method and show that our results are far superior, reaching F-measures of over 85% in two of the three language tasks, and 48% in the third one. Conclusions The different experiments we present here show that corpus based approaches can yield good prediction results in the problem of language impairment detection. These findings warrant further exploration of natural language processing techniques in the field of communication disorders. Moreover, the proposed framework can be easily adapted to analyze samples in languages other than English since most of the features are language independent or can be customized with little effort.",Natural language processing; Machine learning; Analysis of orthographic transcriptions; Language impairment; Monolingual English-speaking children

Cantonese and Mandarin are two Chinese languages that belong to the logographic writing system and share the same set of Chinese characters. Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals employ logographic-logographic bilingualism, and thus provide a unique population for bilingual studies. In Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals, it remains unclear whether the second language (L2) phonological processing conforms to the assimilation or accommodation hypothesis and whether the brain mechanisms underlying Cantonese and Mandarin phonological processing are similar. Differential brain mechanisms of Mandarin as first language (L1) and L2 also needs to be clarified. Task-modality functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to explore these questions in Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals and native Mandarin speakers. Univariate analysis, activation similarity analysis, brain-behavioral analysis and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis were conducted. Novel evidence for accommodation was observed in the L2 processing of Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals, indicating that small language distance leads to the accommodation of L2 processing, which is absolutely distinct to alphabetic bilingualism. We speculated that the role of language distance in the balance between assimilation and accommodation may be regulated by L1. Notably, we found Cantonese processing relied more on orthography-to-phonology mapping, phonological processing, language control and inhibition while Mandarin relied more on memory extraction.

Hernandez,2018,"Becoming a balanced, proficient bilingual: Predictions from age of acquisition & genetic background",article,Journal of Neurolinguistics,ScienceDirect,"Genetic variants related to dopamine functioning (e.g., the ANKK1/TaqIa polymorphism within the DRD2 gene and the Val158Met polymorphism within the COMT gene) have previously been shown to predict cognitive flexibility and learning (e.g., Colzato et al., 2010; Stelzel et al., 2010). Additionally, researchers have found that these genetic variants may also predict second language learning (Mamiya et al., 2016), although this relationship may change across the lifespan (Sugiura et al., 2011). The current study examined the role of the ANKK1/TaqIa and Val158Met polymorphisms along with age of second language acquisition (AoA) in order to predict levels of bilingual proficiency in Spanish-English bilinguals. Results indicated a three-way interaction such that the relationship between the genetic variants and bilingual proficiency depended on AoA. At earlier AoAs, having the genetic variant associated with higher levels of subcortical dopamine (A1+) predicted the highest levels of bilingual proficiency. At later AoAs, individuals with the genetic variant associated with cortical dopamine levels that are balanced between stability and flexibility (Val/Met) predicted the highest levels of bilingual proficiency. These results fit with theories about the development of language as a subcortical process early in life and as a cortical process later in life (Hernandez & Li, 2007), as well as the importance of both stability and flexibility in bilingual language development (Green & Abutalebi, 2013). Finally, this study raises questions about the direction of causality between bilingualism and cognitive control, which is central to the debate over the ""bilingual advantage.""",Bilingualism; Proficiency; ;

LK is a late trilingual person whose first language is German. She had been learning English and French for 10 years when she moved to France at the age of 20 and now mostly uses French. German (L1) and French (L3) were assessed using a selection of sub-tests taken from the MT 86, the French version of the BDAE, the ECOSSE, the MEC, the German BAT, and, a non-standardized German adaptation of parts of the MEC. Preoperatively, LK had no language deficit. She was operated on under awake craniotomy, and both languages were mapped. Direct intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping showed that i) L1 and L3 were represented by both distinct and overlapping areas within the left (dominant) inferior frontal cortex, but shared the same subcortical tracts, and ii) the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was engaged when switching from one language to another. Since surgery, the patient has been followed longitudinally, with six-monthly assessments of her language skills using the same test battery. Her L1 and L3 language skills have been intact for 24 months postoperatively.

Evidence from bilingual aphasia,article,Journal of Neurolinguistics,ScienceDirect,"In the present study, we explored the underlying mechanisms of lexical retrieval in two languages when modulated by phonological context. To do so, we investigated the performance of bilingual patients with aphasia and healthy bilingual individuals on a blocked cyclic naming task as a measure of lexical activation and phonological encoding within their two languages. Highly proficient Catalan-Spanish bilinguals with aphasia (n = 13) and controls (n = 15) were recruited for this study, all with language profiles consistent with early and balanced usage of their two languages. Participants completed a phonological blocked cyclic naming task where reaction times, word duration, and accuracy in naming were measured in each of their languages. Three main results were obtained: (1) overall, patients were slower and less accurate than controls; (2) in patients with aphasia, phonologically related items were named with less accuracy than unrelated ones, suggesting an interference effect of phonological overlap within lexical retrieval; (3) performance in terms of naming latencies showed no effect of phonological context and this was similar across both languages for patients and controls; and (4) word durations were unaffected by phonological context and item repetition, suggesting that phonological encoding may not have a cascading effect onto speech-motor planning. Additionally, individual level analyses confirmed that most of the patients were less accurate in naming pictures within the homogenous compared to the heterogeneous condition (9/13 patients in their dominant language and 11/13 in their non-dominant language). These findings are discussed within the context of language production theories that have attempted to explain facilitation and interference in blocking naming and their implications for bilingualism.",Bilingual aphasia; Phonology; Lexical access; Cyclic naming

Evidence from instrumentality and name relation,article,Journal of Neurolinguistics,ScienceDirect,"Children with specific language impairment (SLI) have particular problems using verbs. However, not much is known about how children with SLI retrieve different types of verbs. In the present study, bilectal Greek-speaking children with and without SLI were assessed on naming of different verbs held constant for argument structure but manipulated for lexical-semantic and phonological-lexical features. School-aged children with SLI as well as typically developing age- and vocabulary-matched peers named 39 colored photographs representing actions in a confrontation naming task. Stimuli included actions involving an instrument (e.g., sweeping), i.e. instrumental verbs, and actions that have a name-relation with the instrument (e.g., sawing), i.e. name-related instrumental verbs as well as actions not involving an instrument (e.g., climbing), i.e. non-instrumental verbs. Instrumental verbs were significantly more difficult to retrieve than non-instrumental verbs for children with SLI and typically language-developing controls. In contrast, instrumental verbs with a name relation to the noun were significantly easier to name than instrumental verbs without a name relation for all groups. Children with SLI performed on par with vocabulary-matched peers. The results based on error types suggest that the greater difficulties children with SLI have with action naming is lexical-semantic in nature.

This raises complex questions such as which language is better preserved in these elderly individuals, particularly for those facing dementias. The main aim of the present investigation was to study in two groups of immigrant populations whether the first language (L1) or the second language (L2) are better preserved. For this purpose, we assessed by means of cognitive and neurolinguistics testing 20 late-bilingual individuals with neurodegenerative dementia of the Alzheimer and mixed type, and compared their results to a matched control group consisting of 19 subjects. Our results suggest that L1 is not better preserved in individuals with dementia. We report a parallel decline of second language across groups, regardless of the presence of dementia, as well as a significant correlation between language immersion and L2 relative performances (r = 0.379, p = 0.03). Moreover our data suggest that individual with dementia may have a relative sparing of syntactic L2 comprehension. These results suggest that these elderly individuals who have lived in a host country for many years, such as the subjects here investigated, may preserve similarly their L2 as much as their L1, irrespectively of the presence or absence of neurodegenerative disease, and even preserve some features of L2 processes in dementia. These results emphasize the role of immersion in language preservation.",

A reliable diagnosis of LI in bilingual children is therefore ideally based on the evaluation of both languages, as LI affects each language that is learned. However, due to the multitude of language combinations that are encountered in clinical practice, this is often not feasible. Bilingual norm-referencing may offer a solution, but the heterogeneity within the bilingual population makes it difficult to determine appropriate standards for every child. The present study examined an alternative approach to assessing both languages or using bilingual norm-referencing, aiming to assemble instruments that reduce bias against bilingual children. We used a four-group design, including monolingual and bilingual children with and without LI (N=132), to first investigate the effects of LI and bilingualism on risks associated with a child’s early language development and the prevalence of language problems in the family, as reported by parents. Second, we evaluated the diagnostic validity of these two indices, and, in addition, combined these with two unbiased language measures which we previously examined in isolation: a quasi-universal nonword repetition task and a narrative task. Results showed that the index of Early Language Development was a strong predictor of LI. In combination with the two direct language measures, it excellently identified the presence or absence of LI in and across monolingual and bilingual learning contexts. Learning outcomes: As a result of this study, the reader will learn about an alternative approach to testing a bilingual child in both languages.

Purpose The present study analyzed narrative abilities of Russian-Hebrew bilingual preschool children with and without SLI, with a particular focus on story grammar (SG) elements and causal relations, in order to identify macrostructure features which distinguish bilingual children with SLI from those with typical development. Method Narratives were collected from 35 typically developing bilinguals (BiTD) and 14 bilinguals with SLI (BiSLI) in both Russian/L1 and Hebrew/L2 using a retelling procedure (LITMUS-Multilingual Assessment Instrument for Narratives) (Gagarina, Klop, Kunnari, Tantele, Välimaa, Balčiūnienė, Bohnacker, & Walters, 2012). Each story contained three episodes, and each episode introduced a different protagonist with explicitly stated Goals (G), Attempts (A) and Outcomes (O). Causal relations assessed included Enabling, Physical, Motivational, and Psychological relations, following Trabasso & Nickels (1992). Each Goal-Attempt-Outcome (GAO) episode was examined for the use of SG elements and causal relations. Results. Group differences emerged for both aspects of macrostructure. For causal relations, narratives of BiSLI children contained fewer Enabling and Physical relations, and differed qualitatively from those of BiTD children. For SG elements, BiSLI children referred to fewer SG elements than BiTD children in the first episode, but performed like BiTD children in the second and the third episodes. Conclusions Story grammar elements in specific episodes along with Enabling and Physical causal relations distinguish the narratives of children with BiSLI from those with BiTD, which stresses the importance of examining wider array of macrostructure features in narratives.",Bilingualism; SLI; Narratives; Story grammar; Causal relations

The parenting stress index-short form (PSI-SF) questionnaire is a widely used instrument to measure parental stress. Cross-cultural translation of PSI-SF takes place to cater the different population around the world. Recently, a cross-cultural translation was implemented in the Malay language. The Malay version of the PSI-SF was developed and tested for psychometric properties among caregivers of individual with LD. Aim The main aim of this study was to examine the reliability and internal consistency of the Malay version of PSI-SF. Material and methods PSI-SF in English version was translated into Malay language. Back translation, comparison and modification were executed to obtain PSI-SF in Malay version. A total of 30 caregivers who handle individuals with LD were surveyed to evaluate the reliability of PSI-SF in the Malay version. Results and discussion The reliability of PSI-SF in the Malay version was good with Cronbach's α=0.944. The internal consistency on subscale of PSI-SF such as parental distress, parent–child dysfunction and difficult child also scored a high internal consistency with value 0.90, 0.82, and 0.87 respectively.

Forty children, 8–11years old, subdivided into 3 different groups (15 simultaneous bilinguals, 15 sequential bilinguals and 10 monolinguals), were scanned. The hypothesis was that the starting age and the manner of second language acquisition would affect the characteristics of language circuitry. In each subject the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) was obtained for four major white matter pathways: 1 — the left arcuate fasciculus/superior longitudinal fasciculus (lAF/lSLF) that connects Broca's area in the opercular and triangular regions of the left inferior frontal gyrus to the posterior language zone, 2 — the left inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus (lIFOF), connecting anterior regions in the frontal lobe with posterior regions in the temporal occipital lobes, 3 — the bundle arising from the anterior part of the corpus callosum projecting to the orbital lobe (AC-OL) and 4 – the fibers emerging from the anterior midbody (AMB) of the corpus callosum that associate with the premotor and supplementary motor cortices (AMB-PMC). The three groups did not show significant differences in mean FA over the lAF/lSLF or AMB-PMC tracts. In simultaneous bilingual subjects the lIFOF tracts had higher mean FA value compared to monolinguals and also sequential bilinguals, whereas the comparison for the AC-OL fibers yielded a significantly lower mean FA value in simultaneous bilingual subjects compared to monolinguals. In both cases the FA value for sequential bilinguals was intermediate to that of the other two groups.

In the present study, we investigated whether priming during sentence reading, rather than single word priming, could be related to children's reading comprehension scores. A self-paced reading experiment involving both associated and non-associated, context-dependent (functional) and context-independent (categorical) semantic relations was administered to 137 Dutch monolingual and bilingual children. Delayed facilitative priming effects were observed for non-associated context-dependently and context-independently related word pairs, but these were not linked to individual differences in reading comprehension.

Or, does early-life bilingual language experience change the brain? If so, how does age of first bilingual exposure impact neural activation for language? We compared how typically-developing bilingual and monolingual children (ages 7–10) and adults recruit brain areas during sentence processing using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain imaging. Bilingual participants included early-exposed (bilingual exposure from birth) and later-exposed individuals (bilingual exposure between ages 4–6). Both bilingual children and adults showed greater neural activation in left-hemisphere classic language areas, and additionally, right-hemisphere homologues (Right Superior Temporal Gyrus, Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus). However, important differences were observed between early-exposed and later-exposed bilinguals in their earliest-exposed language. Early bilingual exposure imparts fundamental changes to classic language areas instead of alterations to brain regions governing higher cognitive executive functions. However, age of first bilingual exposure does matter. Later-exposed bilinguals showed greater recruitment of the prefrontal cortex relative to early-exposed bilinguals and monolinguals. The findings provide fascinating insight into the neural resources that facilitate bilingual language use and are discussed in terms of how early-life language experiences can modify the neural systems underlying human language processing.",Bilingualism; Language development; Syntax; Sentence processing; fNIRS neuroimaging; Neural Signature Hypothesis

In order to check whether these acoustic differences between the productions of bilingual children and those of their monolingual French- or American English-speaking peers were perceptible by native monolingual adults, we investigated the perception of these words by French and American English native speakers. Using an Elo rating task, participants were asked to indicate in each trial which word out of two competitors was produced by a bilingual child. Words were produced by French- or American English-speaking monolingual children and by two groups of bilinguals, one dominant in French and the other in American-English. The results clearly show that both French and American English monolingual adults were successful in distinguishing the bilingual children from their monolingual peers, but only if they were not dominant in the language of the raters.

Cross-sectionally, inhibition was associated with LDT performance in both years. However, longitudinal analyses revealed that LDT performance in Year 1 predicted inhibition in Year 2, while the reverse relationship was not significant.

This paper discusses some of the challenges related to clinical issues pertaining to this population including (a) identifying stuttering in an unfamiliar language, (b) the influence of language proficiency, and (c) treatment of multilingual young children who stutter. The paper is written from the perspective of the author's experience treating multilingual children who stutter within the context of the linguistic and cultural diversity of Canada, notably in the French speaking Province of Quebec where many children grow up speaking two or more languages in everyday life. Clinical examples will be taken from the evidence-based literature as well as the author's clinical experience. Educational objectives: After reading this paper, the learner will be able to (1) summarize the literature regarding assessment and treatment of stuttering in young children speaking more than one language, (2) summarize some of the challenges related to this issue and (3) describe some of the findings associated with treatment of bilingual children who stutter and (4) be prepared to apply some of these suggestions in the treatment of bilingual children who stutter.",Stuttering; Treatment; Bilingualism; Children

As language acquisition is closely related to the hearing development, there is a critical need to investigate language development in hearing-impaired children being raised bilingually who were fitted with cochlear implants and/or hearing aids. Therefore, this research project aimed to study the linguistic development of hearing-impaired children being raised with German as a second language who were provided with hearing aids or cochlear implants. Further, the language development of these children is compared with that of hearing-impaired children being raised in a monolingual environment and with normal-hearing children being raised bilingually. Methods In this prospective study, we analyzed data from 95 typically developing children with hearing loss (43 bilingual and 52 monolingual) aged 3;0 to 10;11 (years; months) on four language measures in German: receptive vocabulary, productive vocabulary, receptive grammar, productive grammar (sentence repetition). Additionally, 30 bilingual children with normal hearing were included in this study. Results 44 children were provided with hearing aids in both ears; 34 used cochlear implants bilaterally and 17 were fitted bimodally. Statistical analysis showed that bilingual hearing-impaired children scored significantly poorer than monolingual hearing-impaired children. Conclusion Hearing-impaired children being raised bilingually should have speech and language examinations on a regular basis. An examination of both languages would be desirable in order to be able to fully assess speech and language acquisition.",bilingualism; Cochlear implant; Deafness; Hearing aid; Hearing development; Language development

Study design Expressive vocabularies were assessed at 6-month intervals from age 30 to 60 months, in English for monolinguals and English and Spanish for bilinguals. Use of English and Spanish in the home was assessed via parental report. Results Multilevel modeling, including parent education as a covariate, revealed that children from bilingual homes lagged 6 months to 1 year behind monolingual children in English vocabulary growth. The size of the lag was related to the relative amount of English use in the home, but the relation was not linear. Increments in English use conferred the greatest benefit most among homes with already high levels of English use. These homes also were likely to have 1 parent who was a native English speaker. Bilingual children showed stronger growth in English than in Spanish. Conclusions Bilingual children can lag 6 months to 1 year behind monolingual children in normal English language development. Such lags may not necessarily signify clinically relevant delay if parents report that children also have skills in the home language. Shorter lags are associated with 2 correlated factors: more English exposure and more exposure from native English speakers. Early exposure to Spanish in the home does not guarantee acquisition of Spanish.",bilingual development; Spanish speakers

Qualitative data from 12 ninth grade subject-matter classes were examined to note how uses of writing in subject-matter classrooms reflected or contradicted district standards and accountability efforts, and how these practices socialized multilingual learners into particular norms for academic writing in English. Findings suggest that classroom practices related to the current standards and accountability climate were socializing adolescent multilingual writers into narrow restrictive norms for academic writing, with the most restrictive norms occurring in the classes with the greatest enrollment of multilingual writers. This study highlights the influence of macro-level contextual factors on particular classroom-level writing practices and norms, and suggests the need for theories of second language writing that account for these influences, particularly in studies of multilingual adolescents in mainstream classrooms.",Multilingual; Adolescent writing; Standards; Accountability; Secondary; Mainstream

To enhance the credibility of our study, we triangulated the collected observations of the children's talk via teachers and parents’ testimonies. The analysis revealed that children applied diverse verbal and nonverbal mediating cues to solve their interlocutors’ communicative troubles. Their pragmatic awareness of the interlocutors’ communicative troubles was encouraged by a unique classroom context where the teachers stimulated children's language mediation and peers’ backup.

A related question is whether language control during comprehension recruits domain-general cognitive control. The current study examined processing of code-switching in Spanish-English bilingual children (ages 6;0–11;10) using an auditory moving window paradigm. Cognitive control was indexed by the Dimensional Change Card Sort. Children exhibited significant costs in processing speed when listening to code-switched sentences, but no costs in a measure of offline comprehension. The extent to which cognitive control skills moderated processing costs depended on the robustness of the language system: children with higher language skills exhibited a greater moderating effect of cognitive control. Taken together, the findings provide limited support for a role of cognitive control in children’s code-switching processing and suggest that the processing costs incurred may be transitory.",Bilingualism; Children; Intra-sentential code-switching; Sentence processing; Cognitive control

The present study compared first language (L1) and second language (L2) spoken word processing within a group of adult Mandarin-English bilinguals (N = 34; ages 18–25). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants completed the same cross-modal matching task separately in their L1 Mandarin and L2 English. This task consisted of deciding whether spoken words matched pictures of items. Pictures and spoken words either matched (e.g., Mandarin: TANG2-tang2; English: BELL-bell), or differed in word-initial phonemes (e.g., Mandarin: TANG2-lang2; English: BELL-shell), word-final phonemes (e.g., Mandarin: TANG2-tao2; English: BELL-bed), or whole words (e.g., Mandarin: TANG2-xia1: English: BELL-ham). Each mismatch type was associated with a pattern of modulation of the Phonological Mapping Negativity, the N400, and the Late N400 that was distinct from those of the other mismatch types yet similar between the two languages. This was interpreted as evidence of incremental processing with similar temporal dynamics in both languages. These findings support models of spoken word recognition in bilingual individuals that adopt an interactive-activation framework for both L1 and L2 processing.",Bilingualism; Spoken word recognition; Phonological competition; Second language processing; Event related potentials

Growth modeling indicated that a Grade 6 measure that tapped both attention shifting and inhibitory control moderately predicted reading comprehension growth, controlling for other executive functions and processing speed. This relation was not significant when controlling for word reading and language comprehension, suggesting overlap in the contributions of these skills.

The current study explores the effect of bilingualism on the narrative and EF skills of forty 7-to-12-year-old bilingual and monolingual children with ASD, as well as forty age-matched bilingual and monolingual children of typical development (TD). Narrative production data were elicited using the Edmonton Narrative Norms Instrument (ENNI; Schneider et al., 2005), which was developed to measure narrative production at a microstructural and macrostructural level. The same children were administered two EF tasks, namely, a global-local visual attention task and a 2-back working memory task. In story-telling, bilingual children with ASD achieved higher scores than monolingual children with ASD on story structure complexity and use of adverbial clauses, and they tended to use significantly fewer ambiguous referential forms than their monolingual peers with ASD. In the global-local task, bilingual children with ASD were faster and more accurate in global trials than monolingual children with ASD, who tended to be more susceptible to interference from locally presented information than the other experimental groups. Higher accuracy and faster response times were also observed for bilingual children with ASD in the 2-back task. Further correlation analyses between the story-telling and EF tasks revealed that bilingual children with ASD drew on a broader range of EF in narrative production than their monolingual peers. The overall findings reveal that bilingual children with ASD outperformed their monolingual peers with ASD in both the microstructure and macrostructure of their narrative production, as well as in their visual attention and working memory skills.",Autism; Bilingualism; Executive functions; Narratives

For instance, there is now evidence that the head of the left caudate is involved in controlling languages in bilingual individuals. On the other hand, the left putamen is hypothesized to be involved in articulatory processes but little is known on its engagement in bilingual language processing. Here, our hypothesis was that the left putamen of multilinguals is engaged when producing words in the less proficient language. We investigated this issue with event-related functional Magnetic Resonance (er-fMRI) in a group of multilinguals (n=14) and in monolinguals (n=14) during a picture-naming task. Further, we hypothesized increased grey matter density in the left putamen as an effect of experience since multilinguals constantly face a major articulatory load (i.e., speaking multiple languages) during life. To test these hypotheses we measured structural differences between multilinguals and monolinguals using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Our results indicate that multilinguals have increased activation in the left putamen for a non-native language, but only if they are not highly proficient in that language. In addition, we found increased grey matter density in the left putamen of multilinguals compared to monolinguals. These findings highlight that the multilingual brain handles a complex articulatory repertoire (i.e., dealing with multiple languages) by inducing structural plasticity in the left putamen.",Bilingual; Left putamen; Articulation; VBM; fMRI; Language; Multilingualism

There is as yet a limited evidence base (locally and internationally) for the provision of AAC services to multilingual populations. The perspectives of service providers can assist in gaining an understanding of current practices and the factors that influence these. Aims The study aimed to obtain the perspectives of AAC service providers about practices in providing AAC systems and AAC intervention to clients from multilingual backgrounds. Methods & procedures Fifteen AAC service providers were purposefully chosen to participate in one of three focus groups – two face-to-face and one online focus group. Data from the face-to-face focus groups was transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes and subthemes in the data. Outcomes & results Four overarching themes were identified, namely (a) current practices, (b) factors influencing current practices, (c) service provides’ orientation towards different language options in AAC intervention, and (d) needs and desired developments regarding AAC technology. This paper reports on the first three themes. Service providers reported their practices to range from a focus on L1 exclusively, L2 exclusively, to a multilingual (sequential or simultaneous) approach. The South African language context, family language preferences and choices, service provider skill and knowledge, as well as AAC technology were identified as factors influencing their practices. Although many viewed access to multiple languages through AAC as positive, they also expressed concerns and reservations about providing multilingual AAC services. Conclusions & implications Although service providers in general saw the need to give clients from multilingual backgrounds access to multiple languages using AAC, this did not always translate into multilingual AAC practices. Both extrinsic factors (e.g. the lack of appropriate AAC devices, software and apps giving access to non-English languages) and intrinsic factors (service providers’ language competency and their beliefs about the cognitive demands of multilingual AAC systems) influenced their practices and choices. Appropriate AAC service delivery to multilingual populations in South Africa would require not only appropriate AAC technology developments, but also research evidence to establish the efficacy of multilingual AAC interventions for clients with a variety of characteristics.",Augmentative and alternative communication; Multilingualism; AAC service providers; AAC technology; Evidence base

It is often difficult or impossible to observe a child's first language directly due to the absence of resources available in every language spoken. The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a parent questionnaire on the first language development of English language learners that is not specific to a particular language/cultural group: the Alberta Language and Development Questionnaire (ALDeQ), and (2) to test how well scores on the ALDeQ differentiated between English language learners with typical development and those with language impairment. Method Participants were 139 typically developing children and 29 children with language impairment, aged 69 months with 18 months of exposure to English through preschool or school, on average. The ALDeQ consists of four sections: early milestones, current first language abilities, behaviour patterns and activity preferences, and family history. ALDeQ total scores are proportions calculated across all sections. Results t-test analyses revealed robust between-group differences for ALDeQ total scores, and for each section score, with medium to very large effect sizes. Linear discriminant function analysis showed the ALDeQ total scores to be a significant and moderate discriminator between the typically developing and language impaired group, but with better specificity than sensitivity. The early milestones section scores emerged as the strongest discriminator among the four section scores. Parent responses showed that both the typically developing and language-impaired groups included children experiencing first language loss, but nevertheless, the current first language abilities section was the second strongest between-group discriminator. Conclusion The ALDeQ would be useful to speech–language pathologists for obtaining information on English language learners’ first language development, in particular where the first language cannot be examined directly. The information provided by the ALDeQ could be used in conjunction with other measures in order to identify children with language impairment among English language learners. The complete ALDeQ and score interpretation information are given in Appendix A. Learning outcomes: Readers will (1) have a general understanding of how parent report could be useful for assessment in a multilingual context; (2) be aware of how first language loss in minority language children could impact assessment, and (3) have specific knowledge of a particular parent questionnaire and how it can be used to assist in identifying English language learners with language delay/impairment.",

Ten children with SLI (8;5–10;9) and 14 children with TLD (8;2–11;8) participated. They received a comprehensive language and reading test battery. We also analyzed a subgroup of six children with SLI+RD (Reading Disability). Brain images from 3-Tesla MRIs were analyzed with intelligence, age, gender, and total intracranial volume as covariates. Children with SLI or SLI+RD exhibited a significant lower overall gray matter volume than children with TLD. Particularly, children with SLI showed a significantly lower volume of gray matter compared to children with TLD in the right postcentral parietal gyrus (BA4), and left and right medial occipital gyri (BA19). The group with SLI also exhibited a significantly greater volume of gray matter in the right superior occipital gyrus (BA19), which may reflect a brain reorganization to compensate for their lower volumes at medial occipital gyri. Children with SLI+RD, compared to children with TLD, showed a significantly lower volume of: (a) gray matter in the right postcentral parietal gyrus; and (b) white matter in the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (RILF), which interconnects the temporal and occipital lobes. Children with TLD exhibited a significantly lower CSF volume than children with SLI and children with SLI+RD respectively, who had somewhat smaller volumes of gray matter allowing for more CSF volume. The significant lower gray matter volume at the right postcentral parietal gyrus and greater cerebrospinal fluid volume may prove to be unique markers for SLI. We discuss the association of poor knowledge/visual representations and language input to brain development. Our comorbid study showed that a significant lower volume of white matter in the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus may be unique to children with SLI and Reading Disability. It was significantly associated to reading comprehension of sentences and receptive language composite z-score, especially receptive vocabulary and oral comprehension of stories.",Specific Language Impairment; Voxel-based morphometry; Magnetic resonance imaging; Gray matter; White matter; Reading Disability

A relatively small proportion of the research evidence on language intervention efficacy has focused specifically on bilingual children. This article reviews early research as well as recent findings on language intervention with bilingual children. Main questions targeted by this research include the choice of language of intervention, whether intervention effects transfer from one langage to the other, and whether language skills can be improved indirectly by enhancing underlying language processing and memory skills. Given the relative lack of intervention research on bilingual children, it is appropriate to consider the extent to which findings from the larger available evidence base on monolingual children can be applied. This may vary depending on the clinical question being asked and on the types of monolingual and bilingual environments involved. Given that monolingual and bilingual children are similar in a number of key characteristics that impact their ability to benefit from language treatment, it is proposed that clinicians use their experience and expertise to carefully consider the applicability to bilingual populations of research conducted with monolingual children. New directions in bilingual intervention that research is starting to address are reviewed, which will in time, lead to more sophisticated intervention choices tailored to the individual needs of children, both monolingual and bilingual.

Muchas de las cuestiones focalizadas por esta investigación incluyen la elección del lenguaje de intervención, mientras que los efectos de la intervención se transfieren de una lengua a otra, así como si pueden mejorarse las técnicas del lenguaje indirectamente al acrecentar el procesamiento del lenguaje subyacente y las habilidades de memoria. Dada la falta de investigación sobre intervención en los niños bilingües, es apropiado considerar el alcance de la aplicación de los hallazgos de la más amplia base de evidencia disponible en los niños monolingües. Ello puede variar dependiendo de la cuestión clínica a plantear y de los tipos de entornos monolingües y bilingües implicados. Dado que los niños monolingües y bilingües son similares en cuanto a una serie de características clave que impactan en su capacidad para beneficiarse del tratamiento del lenguaje, se propone que los clínicos utilicen su experiencia y competencia para considerar minuciosamente la aplicabilidad a las poblaciones bilingües de la investigación realizada con los niños monolingües. Se revisan las nuevas direcciones sobre intervención bilingüe que, en un momento dado, darán lugar a opciones de intervención más sofisticadas adaptadas a las necesidades individuales de los niños, tanto monolingües como bilingües.",Language impairment; Bilingual; Intervention; Efficacy; Evidence based practice; Deficiencias del lenguaje; Bilingüe; Intervención; Eficacia; Práctica basada en la evidencia

One possible source of discrepancy in the evidence may be that bilingualism tends to be treated as a monolithic category distinct from monolingualism. We address this possibility by examining the effects of different bilingual language experiences on brain activity related to EC performance. Participants were scanned (fMRI) while they performed a Flanker task. Behavioral data showed robust Flanker effects, not modulated by language experiences across participants. However, differences in duration of bilingual experience and extent of active language use predicted activation in distinct brain regions indicating differences in neural recruitment across conditions. This approach highlights the need to consider specific bilingual language experiences in assessing neurocognitive effects. It further underscores the utility and complementarity of neuroimaging evidence in this general line of research, contributing to a deeper understanding of the variability reported in the literature.",Bilingualism; Executive control; fMRI; Individual differences

In particular, they exhibit less implicit bias against racial outgroups. However, the cognitive determinants of racial bias in bilingual children remain unclear. In the current study, relationships between racial bias and three cognitive factors (inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and perspective-taking ability), along with language proficiency and parental education, were investigated in a sample of bilingual preschoolers (N = 55). Children were bilingual learners of English and Mandarin. Results demonstrated that implicit bias was predicted by cognitive flexibility, independent of variation in inhibitory control, second language vocabulary, perspective taking, and parental education. In contrast, explicit bias was predicted by parental education alone and not by cognitive or linguistic factors. Findings suggest that increased cognitive flexibility, often thought to be an outgrowth of bilingual experience, may also be associated with a reduction in implicit bias. Findings are discussed in terms of specific mechanisms that may link cognitive factors, bilingualism, and racial bias.",Bilingualism; Executive function; Language development; Racial and ethnic attitudes and relations; Implicit racial bias; Cognitive flexibility

It is not yet known what measures within and across languages are most informative when evaluating the language skills of bilingual children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how measures of language productivity and organization in two languages converge with children's measured language abilities on the Bilingual English Spanish Assessment (BESA), a standardized measure of language ability. 170 kindergarten age children who produced narrative language samples in Spanish and in English based on a wordless picture book were included in the analysis. Samples were analyzed for number of utterances, number of different words, mean length of utterance, and percentage of grammatical utterances. The best predictors of language ability as measured by the BESA scores were English MLU, English grammaticality, and Spanish grammaticality. Results are discussed in relationship to the nature of the measures in each of the languages and in regard to their potential utility for identifying low language ability in bilingual. Learning outcomes: The reader will be able to identify (1) why narratives are useful for evaluating bilingual language ability, (2) which measures of productivity and sentence organization in narratives best capture language ability and development in bilingual children, (3) how a bilingual or composite language ability across two languages can be determined, and (4) what relationship exists between measures of productivity and sentence organization in each language with a bilingual language ability score.",

Hierarchical regression analyses with 76 typical English-French bilingual students revealed that kindergarten Rapid Automatized Naming predicted English word and French word reading fluency in Grade 6 and sometimes in Grade 3 after within-language pseudoword reading fluency was controlled, supporting theory B.

However there are also quite a number of children who are acquiring two or more languages at the same time during their early childhood because of being raised in a bilingual family or society. Since bilingualism brings advantages to the child's future development, understanding how a bilingual child acquires the lexicon becomes a question of interest. As De Houwer (1990) suggests, children who receive primary input in each language from different interlocutors (such as a mother, father or siblings) may acquire different lexical repertoires in each language because different people talk about different things. Thus this study aimed to examine, assess and describe the sources of the differences in the receptive and productive vocabulary size of a bilingual boy in English and Turkish. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III (PPVT) by Dunn & Dunn (1997) was used as a tool in measuring a bilingual boy's (3;10) productive and receptive vocabulary. The results suggested that the child performed better in English than Turkish. He produced 96% correct vocabulary in English whereas the number declined to 67% in Turkish. However the child's receptive vocabulary was almost equal in both languages. The study revealed that the frequency of exposure and differences in context cause differences in vocabulary size of a bilingual child.",Bilingualism; Child Language; Lexicon; English; Turkish

This cognate effect has been shown to be gradual: recognition was facilitated when words had higher degrees of cross-linguistic similarity. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether cognate facilitation can also be observed in bilingual children’s sentence reading. To answer this question, a group of Frisian–Dutch bilingual children (N = 37) aged 9–12 years completed a reading task in both their languages. All children had Dutch as their dominant reading language, but most of them spoke mainly Frisian at home. Identical cognates (e.g., Dutch–Frisian boek–boek ‘book’), non-identical cognates (e.g., beam–boom ‘tree’), and non-cognates (e.g., beppe–oma ‘grandmother’) were presented in sentence context, and eye movements were recorded. The results showed a non-gradual cognate facilitation effect in Frisian: identical cognates were read faster than non-identical cognates and non-cognates. In Dutch, no cognate facilitation effect could be observed. This suggests that bilingual children use their dominant reading language while reading in their non-dominant one, but not vice versa.",Bilingualism; Cognate facilitation; Eye-tracking; Reading; Minority language; Children

From these overviews emerge a complex set of contextual factors that impact bilingual development in children with DD. We then use the Bioecological Systems model of Bronfenbrenner and Morris (2007) and conceptual maps (C-maps) to examine the particular circumstances of three hypothetical children with DD who are in very different bilingual contexts.

In a pre-attentive listening fMRI task, English monolingual and Spanish–English bilingual children – divided into groups of younger (6–8yrs) and older children (9–10yrs) – were asked to watch a silent movie while several English syllable combinations played through a pair of headphones. Two additional groups of monolingual and bilingual adults were included in the analyses. Our results show that the neural mechanisms supporting speech perception throughout development differ in monolinguals and bilinguals. While monolinguals recruit perceptual areas (i.e., superior temporal gyrus) in early and late childhood to process native speech, bilinguals recruit perceptual areas (i.e., superior temporal gyrus) in early childhood and higher-order executive areas in late childhood (i.e., bilateral middle frontal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobule, among others) to process non-native speech. The findings support the Perceptual Assimilation Model and the Speech Learning Model and suggest that the neural system processes phonological information differently depending on the stage of L2 speech learning.",Speech; Bilingualism; Development; Neuroscience; Learning

An analysis of spontaneous bilingual codeswitching in the Bangor Miami Corpus (Deuchar, Davies, Herring, Parafita Couto, & Carter, 2014) reveals that in anticipation of switching languages, Spanish–English bilinguals produce slowed speech rate and cross-language phonological influence on consonant voice onset time. A study of speech comprehension using the visual world paradigm demonstrates that bilingual listeners can indeed exploit these low-level phonetic cues to anticipate that a codeswitch is coming and to suppress activation of the non-target language.

Due to the large migrations over the past three decades, large numbers of individuals with schizophrenia are learning a second language and being seen in clinics in that second language. We conducted within-subject comparisons to clarify the contribution of clinical, linguistic and bilingual features in the first and second languages of bilinguals with schizophrenia. Methods. Ten bilingual Russian(L1) and Hebrew(L2) proficient patients, who developed clinical schizophrenia after achieving proficiency in both languages, were selected from 60 candidates referred for the study; they were resident in Israel 7–32 years with 3–10 years from immigration to diagnosis. Clinical, linguistic and fluency markers were coded in transcripts of clinical interviews. Results. There was a trend toward more verbal productivity in the first language (L1) than the second language (L2). Clinical speech markers associated with thought disorder and cognitive impairment (blocking and topic shift) were similar in both languages. Among linguistic markers of schizophrenia, Incomplete syntax and Speech role reference were significantly more frequent in L2 than L1; Lexical repetition and Unclear reference demonstrated a trend in the same direction. For fluency phenomena, Discourse markers were more prevalent in L1 than L2, and Codeswitching was similar across languages, showing that the patients were attuned to the socio-pragmatics of language use. Conclusions. More frequent linguistic markers of schizophrenia in L2 show more impairment in the syntactic/semantic components of language, reflecting greater thought and cognitive dysfunction. Patients are well able to acquire a second language. Nevertheless, schizophrenia finds expression in that language. Finally, more frequent fluency markers in L1 suggests motivation to maintain fluency, evidenced in particular by codeswitched L2 lexical items, a compensatory resource.",Bilingualism; Second language; Schizophrenia; Discourse

The ‘head’ of a compound is the component that determines the grammatical category, the syntactic (e.g., the gender) and the semantic properties of the compound as a whole. For example, in the word ‘blackberry’ berry is the compound's head. The question was addressed of whether or not the privileged status of the head constituent influences processing and determines behavioural patterns in the breakdown of spatial attention in neglect. Italian right-headed (e.g. capobanda, band leader) and left-headed compounds (e.g. astronave, spaceship) were administered to 18 participants affected by neglect dyslexia. Left-headed compounds were read better than right-headed compounds. This result was not due to factors such as frequency, familiarity, age of acquisition or imageability, since these effects were controlled. It is suggested that attention is captured by the head component after implicit reading of the whole word. The head would require a relatively lighter processing load than the modifier and benefit from top-down facilitation.",Noun–noun Italian compounds; Left-headed; Right-headed

Activation also occurs across languages in bilingual adult readers, suggesting that the activation of phonological representations is not language specific. Less is known about developing readers. First, it is unclear whether there is automatic phonological activation during visual word recognition among children in general. Second, no empirical data exist on whether the activation of phonological representations is language specific or not in bilingual children. The current study investigated these issues in bilingual third and fifth graders using cross-language phonological masked priming in a lexical decision task. Targets were French words, and primes were English pseudowords of three types: (a) phonological primes, which share phonological information with the target beginning (e.g., dee-DIMANCHE [Sunday], pronounced /di:/-/dimãʃ/); (b) orthographic control primes, which control for letters shared by the phonological prime and target (e.g., d) and their position (e.g., doo-DIMANCHE, pronounced /du:/-/dimãʃ/); and (c) unrelated primes, which share no phonological or orthographic information with the target beginning (e.g., pow-DIMANCHE, pronounced /paʊ/-/dimãʃ/). Significant phonological priming was observed, suggesting that (a) phonological representations are rapidly and automatically activated by print during visual word recognition from Grade 3 onward and that (b) the activation of phonological representations is not language specific in bilingual children.",Visual word recognition; Children; Phonology; Bilingualism; Masked priming; Reading acquisition

However, it is still largely unknown how the functional brain network organizes to enable fast and effortless reading processing in the native language (L1) but not in a non-proficient second language (L2), and whether the mechanisms underlying local activity are associated with connectivity dynamics in large-scale brain networks. In the present study, we combined activation-based and multivariate graph-theory analysis with functional magnetic resonance imaging data to address these questions. Chinese–English unbalanced bilinguals read narratives for comprehension in Chinese (L1) and in English (L2). Compared with L2, reading in L1 evoked greater brain activation and recruited a more globally efficient but less clustered network organization. Regions with both increased network efficiency and enhanced brain activation in L1 reading were mostly located in the fronto-temporal reading-related network (RN), whereas regions with decreased global network efficiency, increased clustering, and more deactivation in L2 reading were identified in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, functional network efficiency was closely associated with local brain activation, and such associations were also modulated by reading efficiency in the two languages. Our results demonstrate that an economical and integrative brain network topology is associated with efficient reading, and further reveal a dynamic association between network efficiency and local activation for both RN and DMN.

We assessed cross-language interactions using cognates in three lexical decision (LD) tasks, and non-linguistic cognitive control with a flanker task. We also examined functional connectivity between brain regions crucial for language control and language processing. We observed the preservation of cognate effects in a generalized lexical decision task requiring little language control, which indicates intact functionality (and cross-lingual interactivity) of lexical representations. On the other hand, we found diminished linguistic as well as non-linguistic control abilities, suggesting a domain general control impairment.

Method Four groups of children and youth matched on non-verbal mental age participated. There were 14 bilingual participants with DS (DS-B, mean age 12;5), 12 monolingual participants with DS (DS-M, mean age 10;10), 9 bilingual typically developing children (TD-B; mean age 4;1) and 11 monolingual typically developing children (TD-M; mean age 4;1). The participants completed a computerized syntactic bootstrapping task involving unfamiliar nouns and verbs. The syntactic cues employed were a for the nouns and ing for the verbs. Results Performance was better on nouns than verbs. There was also a main effect for group. Follow-up t-tests revealed that there were no significant differences between the TD-M and TD-B or between the DS-M and DS-B groups. However, the DS-M group performed more poorly than the TD-M group with a large effect size. Analyses at the individual level revealed a similar pattern of results. Conclusion There was evidence that Down syndrome impacted performance; there was no evidence that bilingualism negatively affected the syntactic bootstrapping skills of individuals with DS. These results from a dynamic language task are consistent with those of previous studies that used static or product measures. Thus, the results are consistent with the position that parents should be supported in their decision to provide bilingual input to their children with DS.

According to the Attentional Scaling Hypothesis, attempting to access lexical entries involves focusing attention on the initial letters of words to establish a cohort of potential matches with entries in the mental lexicon. We test this account by examining two predictions: (1) greater leftward bias for words should be evident in English readers in which the word beginning is on the left but not in Hebrew readers. (2) Dyslexics who have lexical impairments should show greater bias. Results reveal that word length modulated bisection bias differently for Hebrew and English readers, although the bias stays always leftward. Furthermore, dyslexics exhibited an exaggerated leftward bias than controls. We propose this effect arises from an interaction between reading and spatial attention rather than from the scaling of attention relative to the beginning of the word in the service of lexical access.",Bisection; Hemi-spatial attention; Lexical processing; Reading direction; Word representation

Tests include such measures as the Mini Mental Status Exam, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and others. These tests cover a range of functions including working memory, verbal fluency, prospective memory, and task switching. Interpretation of test results is based on comparison of the participant's score to standard scores that have been normed on a population database. However, a growing body of research has shown that the skills underlying these tests may be significantly different in monolingual and bilingual older adults, especially for those experiencing cognitive impairment, yet the standardized test scores do not account for such differences. Therefore, results of neuropsychological tests may be different for bilingual populations than for monolinguals, and those differences may be misinterpreted. The issue is important because the consequences of these interpretative errors may be over- or under-diagnosis of cognitive impairment. The present study examined the neuropsychological test scores of monolingual and bilingual older adults who were experiencing healthy aging or cognitive impairment to establish patterns in these scores that can more accurately guide the interpretation for bilingual older adults by considering group differences in the underlying abilities.",

Methods Eight healthy Mandarin-English bilingual adults and eight healthy English monolingual adults were scanned while single-word paradigms were audio-visually presented. Results Our results showed significantly stronger beta-band power suppression in the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL) covering the supramarginal gyrus (BA 40) and angular gyrus (BA 39) for bilinguals when processing Mandarin versus English. Moreover, there were no significant differences between bilinguals and monolinguals in the left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC, BA 44/45) when both were processing their first language. Conclusions These results support the view that Mandarin-English bilinguals have a shared neural system for word processing in both the first and second language, which is highly similar to monolinguals’, but with stronger right hemisphere involvement. Significance To our knowledge, this is the first MEG study to investigate the spatio-temporal and frequency characteristics between bilinguals and monolinguals, which provides us a new angle to better understand the language system in bilinguals’ and monolingual’s brain.",Magnetoencephalography; Word processing; Bilinguals; Monolinguals; Frequency; Oscillation

There was no effect of bilingual status on its own. The effect of language skills did not reach significance but was considerably higher in preschool settings in comparison with family and public situations. Results also indicated an association between parents’ orientation to the mainstream culture and children’s speaking behavior in preschool.

However, the relationship between bilingualism and cognition is complex, with costs as well as benefits to language functions. To further explore the cognitive consequences of bilingualism, the study used Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes, to examine whether bilingualism modifies the age at onset of behavioral and language variants of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) differently. Case records of 193 patients presenting with FTD (121 of them bilingual) were examined and the age at onset of the first symptoms were compared between monolinguals and bilinguals. A significant effect of bilingualism delaying the age at onset of dementia was found in behavioral variant FTD (5.7 years) but not in progressive nonfluent aphasia (0.7 years), semantic dementia (0.5 years), corticobasal syndrome (0.4 years), progressive supranuclear palsy (4.3 years) and FTD-motor neuron disease (3 years). On dividing all patients predominantly behavioral and predominantly aphasic groups, age at onset in the bilingual behavioral group (62.6) was over 6 years higher than in the monolingual patients (56.5, p=0.006), while there was no difference in the aphasic FTD group (60.9 vs. 60.6 years, p=0.851). The bilingual effect on age of bvFTD onset was shown independently of other potential confounding factors such as education, gender, occupation, and urban vs rural dwelling of subjects. To conclude, bilingualism delays the age at onset in the behavioral but not in the aphasic variants of FTD. The results are in line with similar findings based on research in stroke and with the current views of the interaction between bilingualism and cognition, pointing to advantages in executive functions and disadvantages in lexical tasks.",Dementia; Frontotemporal dementia; Executive function; Aphasia; Bilingualism

The participants included 39 children (15 bilinguals, 15 Mandarin monolinguals, and 9 English monolinguals) at 5–6years of age. The bilingual children were divided into Bi-low (at the early stage of English learning with low proficiency in English) and Bi-high (highly proficient in English) groups. Each participant was recorded producing one set of Mandarin words containing /a, i, u, y, ɤ/ and/or one set of English words containing /i, ɪ, e, ɛ, æ, u, ʊ, o, ɑ, ʌ/. Formant frequencies at five temporal locations were measured. Both static (midpoint formant values) and dynamic (formant movement pattern, trajectory length) acoustic properties were examined. Bi-low children showed a strong effect of L1 on L2. The L1 features were maintained and transferred to the new phonetic system. Bi-high children produced L2 vowels in a near-native manner. Meanwhile, they tended to transfer some L2 features to their L1 and moved the L1 vowels closer to L2 vowels, which suggested an assimilatory process.

The ability to switch languages is a very fast, efficient and flexible process, being a fundamental aspect of bilingual efficient language communication. The aim of the present study was to characterize the specific role of non-language specific prefrontal regions in the neural network involved in LS in bilingual patients, during awake brain surgery and using electrical stimulation mapping (ESM). Methods In order to identify the neural regions involved in LS we used, a new specific ESM protocol in two patients undergoing awake brain surgery. Besides, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuropsychological testing and the assessment of daily conversational LS patterns post-surgery were used as complementary imaging and behavioral assessments. Results The outcome of the multimodal ESM-fMRI neuroimaging comparison in both patients pointed out to the crucial involvement of the inferior and middle frontal cortices in LS. Conclusions The present results add to previous findings highlighting the important role of non-language specific frontal structures in regulating LS.

Using functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) analysis, this study aimed at exploring the neural basis of diglossia during picture naming in two contexts. In the first, healthy young participants were instructed to name each image either in SA or LA on the basis of cue word appearing after the stimulus. In the second, they were instructed to name images either in SA or in Hebrew. Behavioral analysis showed that naming in SA was slightly easier than LA and considerably easier than Hebrew. fMRI analysis showed no difference between SA and LA.

The results showed that when compared with typically developing controls, children with ASD manifested reduced MMN (mismatch negativity) amplitude at the left temporal-parietal and parietal sites, indicating that they were less sensitive to lexical stress. However, a more negative MMN response was found for ASD group than for typically developing group at the right central-parietal, temporal-parietal, and temporal sites.

Here we tested whether learning to read in two languages differing in their orthographic transparency yields different strategies used for encoding letter-strings as compared to learning to read in one (opaque) language only. Sixteen English monolingual and 16 early Welsh–English bilingual readers undergoing event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recordings were asked to report whether or not a target letter displayed at fixation was present in either a nonword (consonant string) or an English word presented immediately before. Bilinguals and monolinguals showed similar behavioural performance on target detection presented in words and nonwords, suggesting similar orthographic encoding in the two groups. By contrast, the amplitude of ERPs locked to the target letters (P3b, 340–570ms post target onset, and a late frontal positive component 600–1000ms post target onset) were differently modulated by the position of the target letter in words and nonwords between bilinguals and monolinguals. P3b results show that bilinguals who learnt to read simultaneously in an opaque and a transparent orthographies encoded orthographic information presented to the right of fixation more poorly than monolinguals. On the opposite, only monolinguals exhibited a position effect on the late positive component for both words and nonwords, interpreted as a sign of better re-evaluation of their responses.

One explicit test of this link has been studies of how speakers of different languages configure arrays of objects in non-linguistic rotation tasks. Subjects perform these tasks differently depending on their dominant linguistic frame of reference: relative e.g. left/right terms, or absolute e.g. N/S/W/E terms. One prediction is that changes in the linguistic system should result in corresponding cognitive changes. Such a linguistic shift has occurred among Gurindji people (Australia). Traditionally Gurindji people used a system of cardinal directions, however many have now also been exposed to the English left/right system. This paper demonstrates that this language difference is reflected cognitively. The ‘Animals-in-a-row’ task was administered to 107 Gurindji people. The results show strong ‘viewpoint independent’ responses, nonetheless those with a Tertiary education gave significantly more ‘viewpoint dependent’ responses which we attribute to exposure to English, and perhaps associated literacy practices.",Language change; Spatial relations; Frames of reference; Gurindji Kriol; Gurindji; Cardinal directions

This practice-based research study explores predictions of the SVR within a clinical practice setting. Method The study is a retrospective analysis of 112 assessment records from school-aged children (aged 6.0–16.7) referred for speech-language evaluation. Available scores within four areas (listening comprehension, word recognition, reading comprehension, and oral expression) were extracted and then converted to composites. Composite scores were used to categorize children into SVR subtypes. We examined the distribution of children across subtypes and the relationships among the four constructs. Results Children were distributed across all SVR subtypes, but few had impairments only in word recognition. Children with impairments in listening comprehension or word recognition showed poorer reading comprehension than those that did not, but there was imperfect prediction of reading comprehension impairment at an individual level. There were more significant correlations among constructs for younger children. Oral expression and listening comprehension were closely related across analyses.

Methods A group of 43 Chinese Singaporean preschoolers aged 3 to 6 years with a diagnosis of nonsyndromic CLP was assessed using the Singapore English Action Picture Test (SEAPT). The SEAPT is an English Language screening tool standardised on typically developing English–Mandarin Chinese Singaporean preschoolers that assesses expressive vocabulary and grammatical usage. A grammar and/or information score below the 20th percentile on the SEAPT is indicative of an expressive language impairment. In addition, the medical records of this cohort were examined retrospectively for documentation of surgical timings, audiological history, articulation and resonance. Results Based on the results of the SEAPT, 33% of the preschoolers with CLP were identified as having a—possible expressive language impairment. Hence, the likelihood that a child with CLP with normal cognitive functioning will have an expressive language impairment is between 3.9 to 12.7 times more likely than in the general population. There was no statistical significance when comparisons were made between dominant language groups or CLP groups on SEAPT measures of information and grammar content. Significantly more males than females were identified with language difficulties, relative to the sex ratio in the sample. No significance was found for the other participant variables. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that Chinese Singaporean preschoolers with CLP have more difficulty in the expressive use of grammar and vocabulary than their peers of typical development, with significantly more males affected than females. As language performance was not related to hearing, articulation or resonance; these early results suggest that a comprehensive investigation of cognition, literacy and family aggregation of communication disorders is urgently warranted to study other possible aetiologies for language impairment in children with CLP in Singapore.",Cleft lip; Cleft palate; Expressive language; Language impairment; Preschoolers; Chinese; Singapore; Bilingual

Early identification and intervention are desirable. Parent-report inventories are useful screening tools, but the screening context places limits at their length. Validity of parent-report screening tools in languages other than English has been rarely reported in detail. Aims The aim was to establish the concurrent validity of an existing 40-item parent-report vocabulary screening tool in Czech, using a picture-based examiner-administered comprehension and production task as a concurrent measure of vocabulary. Methods & Procedures Parents of 200 children aged 1;3 to 3;6 were given the screening inventory, in which they were asked if their child says or comprehends each of 40 words. At the same time, children were administered a picture-based comprehension and production task. Concurrent validity of the inventory was examined using correlations, partial correlations, and regression analyses controlling for age. Outcomes & Results The partial Spearman correlation (controlling for age) between production scores from parent-report and production scores from the examiner-administered task was 0.53; for comprehension, the correlation between parent report and test scores was 0.36. These values are similar to those reported for short and full versions of MacArthur-Bates CDI for 2-year-olds. Conclusion & Implications A 40-item tool shows clear concurrent relations with an examiner-administered picture comprehension and production task. The study demonstrates that short parent-report tools may be useful in early identification of language impairments, and they may be a good option particularly in languages that have limited repertoire of assessment instruments.",Vocabulary screening; Validity of screening; Parent report

Although metaphors have been shown to affect time conceptualisation, there is little evidence to date that the presence or absence of tense within a given language can affect how one processes temporal sequences of events. Here, we set out to characterise how native speakers of Mandarin Chinese – a tenseless language- deal with reference time misalignment using event-related brain potentials. Fluent Chinese-English participants and native speakers of English made acceptability judgements on sentences in which the adjunct clause started with the connective ‘after’ and was either temporally aligned or not with the main clause in terms of reference time conveyed by the verb. Native speakers of English failed to overtly report such reference time misalignments between clauses, but significant N400 modulations showed that they nevertheless required additional semantic processing effort. Chinese speakers, however, showed no such N400 modulation suggesting that they did not covertly detect reference time misalignments between clauses in real time. Critically, all participants manifested normal sentence comprehension as shown by a standard N400 semantic violation elicited by incongruent endings. We conclude that Chinese speakers of English experience difficulties locating events on a timeline in relation to one another when temporal information is conveyed by tense.",Reference time; Tenselessness; Event-related potentials; Syntax-semantics interference; Linguistic relativity; Sentence processing

Two groups of adult learners with high and low English proficiency finished a forward-masked lexical decision task. The results showed a complicated scenario on transposed-letter effects, implying that the late unbalanced Chinese-English bilinguals with low English proficiency still needed to adopt a letter-to-letter reading strategy, and that the L2 users with high English proficiency also had not properly developed the fine-grained orthographic route even they had a long experience of English learning in the foreign language learning settings in China. Overall, it is suggested that late unbalanced Chinese-English bilinguals generally follow a path similar to that of native readers in acquiring English visual word recognition skills developed from the letter-to-letter reading strategy to the parallel orthographic processing strategies. However, since L2 users usually have no or limited spoken vocabulary of English before accessing printed words and inadequate supervision in developing L2 word reading skills, their development would be much slower than that of English native speakers.",Transposed-letter effect; L2 reading development; Visual word recognition; Orthographic processing; Multiple-route model of reading development

In addition, conjunction analyses revealed that the right inferior frontal gyrus and medial frontal gyrus were more activated in KK and KE than CC and CE, suggesting that these regions are more involved in Korean speakers than Chinese speakers for both L1 and L2. Finally, an ROI analysis at the left middle frontal gyrus revealed greater activation for CE than for KE and a positive correlation with accuracy in CE, but a negative correlation in KE.

Analyses revealed that monolinguals were more sensitive to English morphosyntactic information than bilinguals, but the groups did not differ in reaction times or response bias. Furthermore, higher nonverbal working memory capacity was associated with greater sensitivity to morphosyntactic violations in bilinguals but not in monolinguals.

Thus cognitive control is crucial for word production. Given that word retrieval difficulty is a hallmark feature of aphasia, the relationship between word retrieval and cognitive control in aphasia has not been sufficiently explored. This study examined whether persons with aphasia show 1) evidence of a cognitive control deficit, 2) bilingual status interacts with cognitive control deficit in persons with aphasia, and (3) a relationship between measures of word naming and cognitive control. Thirty-eight persons with aphasia were administered a task of cognitive control (Stroop color-word task) and two word production tasks (picture naming and category fluency). We found weakened cognitive control in aphasia relative to age-matched neurologically healthy adults. A bilingual advantage in cognitive control was found in neurologically healthy adults and in one group of bilingual speakers with aphasia, but not the other group. Word retrieval in persons with aphasia was not correlated with Stroop task performance. These findings show that cognitive control performance (as measured by the Stroop task) is compromised in persons with aphasia, irrespective of bilingual status.

A major criticism of the findings quoted as evidence for embodied simulation, however, is that they could be a result of conscious image generation strategies. Here we exploit the well-known fact that bilinguals routinely and automatically activate both their languages during comprehension to test whether this automatic process is, in turn, modulated by embodied simulatory processes. Dutch participants heard English sentences containing interlingual homophones and implying specific distance relations, and had to subsequently respond to pictures of objects matching or mismatching this implied distance. Participants were significantly slower to reject critical items when their perceptual features matched said distance relationship. These results suggest that bilinguals not only activate task-irrelevant meanings of interlingual homophones, but also automatically simulate these meanings in a detailed perceptual fashion.

However, the majority of these studies tested bilinguals who did not necessarily code-switch on a regular basis. In order to investigate the impact of switching habits on language processing, two groups of French-English bilinguals (habitual code-switchers and non-habitual code-switchers) read sentences containing unilingual and switched determiner phrases while their EEG was recorded. The findings indicate important processing differences between the groups. Notably, switched trials (particularly those with a French determiner) generated an increased negativity from 300 to 500 ms for non-habitual code-switchers, but not for habitual code-switchers. The veritable impact of switching habits were also supported by a correlation analysis. This finding suggests that code-switching is not inherently effortful to process, but rather, that comprehension costs are related to idiosyncratic factors, such as the extent of prior exposure to code-switched input. An LPC was also observed from 500 to 900 for habitual code-switchers; for non-habitual switchers, this effect may have been attenuated by the long-lasting N400 effect. We advance several possible interpretations for the late positivity. Altogether, the results from the current study support the claim that the code-switching cost observed in previous literature may be linked to the bilingual samples tested in those studies: habitual code-switchers may not find switches effortful to process, but not all bilinguals code-switch.

Because of various close semiological resemblances with apraxia of speech, FAS has been hypothesized to be an apraxia subtype. In 2009 two cases of developmental FAS (dFAS) were described in whom the disorder was detected in an early stage of their speech-language development in the absence of brain damage or mental illness. In the present study, two listening panels consisting of 30 native speakers of two regiolects, Dutch and Flemish, evaluate the spontaneous speech of two native Flemish-speaking boys with suspected dFAS, three native Flemish-speaking children diagnosed with developmental apraxia of speech (dAoS), two bilingual children (L1 = Flemish, L2 = French or English), and six native Flemish-speaking children with typical speech-language development. Whereas the Dutch panellists were not able to distinguish the different groups, the Flemish listeners accurately identified the children with dFAS and the bilingual children. None of the listeners were able to discern between dFAS and dAoS. The latter finding supports the assumption that the two speech disorders not only share similar semiological and perceptual characteristics but also a common pathophysiological substrate. Although it is not always identified by listeners of the same language community but is by speakers of the same regiolect, in addition to FAS resulting from brain damage or a psychological disorder, dFAS appears a distinct form of apraxia of speech resulting from developmental deficits.",Bilingual; Developmental; Apraxia of speech; Foreign accent syndrome; FAS; Regiolect

A substantial number of behavioral studies have characterized when infants show changes in behavior towards speech sounds in relation to amount of experience with these sounds. However, these studies cannot explain to what extent the developmental timeline is influenced by experience with the language versus constraints imposed by cortical maturation. Studies using electrophysiological measures to examine the development of auditory and speech processing have shown great differences in infant and adult electrophysiological correlates of processing. Many of these differences are a function of immature cortex in the infant. In this paper, we examined the maturation of infant and child event-related-potential (ERP) electrophysiological components in processing an English vowel contrast and explored to what extent these components are influenced by intrinsic (e.g., sex) versus extrinsic factors, such as language experience (monolingual versus bilingual). Our findings demonstrate differences in the pattern of ERP responses related to age and sex, as well as language experience. These differences make it clear that general maturational factors need to be taken into consideration in examining the effect of language experience on the neurodevelopment of speech perception.",

The results show a remarkable similarity between the agrammatic phenomena in both languages on the typical agrammatic features: utterance length and speech rate are reduced and the proportion of grammatical sentences and complex sentences is lower than normal. Analysis of verb inflection demonstrates that there are no qualitative differences between the Swahili and English samples: in both languages reference to the past is more impaired than reference to the present. However, the use of verb inflection in general is better preserved in Swahili than English. English verb inflections are frequently omitted, whereas Swahili verb inflections are substituted.

Early identification of preterm infants at risk for language delay is essential to guide early intervention at the time of optimal neuroplasticity. This study examined near-term structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and white matter microstructure assessed on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in relation to early language development in children born very preterm. Methods A total of 102 very-low-birth-weight neonates (birthweight≤1500g, gestational age ≤32-weeks) were recruited to participate from 2010 to 2011. Near-term structural MRI was evaluated for white matter and cerebellar abnormalities. DTI fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were assessed. Language development was assessed with Bayley Scales of Infant-Toddler Development-III at 18 to 22 months adjusted age. Multivariate models with leave-one-out cross-validation and exhaustive feature selection identified three brain regions most predictive of language function. Distinct logistic regression models predicted high-risk infants, defined by language scores >1 S.D. below average. Results Of 102 children, 92 returned for neurodevelopmental testing. Composite language score mean ± S.D. was 89.0 ± 16.0; 31 of 92 children scored <85, including 15 of 92 scoring <70, suggesting moderate-to-severe delay. Children with cerebellar asymmetry had lower receptive language subscores (P = 0.016). Infants at high risk for language impairments were predicted based on regional white matter microstructure on DTI with high accuracy (sensitivity, specificity) for composite (89%, 86%), expressive (100%, 90%), and receptive language (100%, 90%). Conclusions Multivariate models of near-term structural MRI and white matter microstructure on DTI may assist in identification of preterm infants at risk for language impairment, guiding early intervention.",Preterm infants; Early language development; Diffusion tensor imaging; Machine learning

Recomendaciones basadas en la evidencia,article,"Revista de Logopedia, Foniatría y Audiología",ScienceDirect,"Resumen Algunos niños y niñas que crecen en entornos con oportunidades de comunicación en varias lenguas pueden necesitar en algún momento de su desarrollo apoyo de profesionales de la logopedia/fonoaudiología. El Comité de Expertos en Multilingüismo y Multiculturalidad de la Asociación Española de Logopedia, Foniatría y Fonoaudiología, e Iberoamericana de Fonoaudiología ha consensuado una propuesta de recomendaciones basadas en la evidencia para las prácticas en logopedia con el fin de facilitar que los/as niños/as puedan ejercer el derecho a su identidad cultural y a emplear su propio idioma. Se parte de una concepción dinámica del bi/multilingüismo centrado en la persona y su entorno, considerando un enfoque transcultural, transdisciplinar y funcional, dirigido a fomentar las oportunidades de aprendizaje. Considerando los resultados de investigaciones actuales sobre el desarrollo lingüístico-comunicativo de los/las niños/as bi/multilingües con y sin trastornos del lenguaje, habla y comunicación, se plantean herramientas para el desarrollo de la evaluación y la intervención logopédica/fonoaudiológica desde una perspectiva lingüístico-funcional. Así, se incluyen propuestas para realizar la entrevista e instrumentos para la evaluación directa y/o indirecta. Todo ello mediante la valoración del entorno bilingüe y la evaluación translingüística y funcional, en estrecha colaboración con las familias, las escuelas y otros profesionales de apoyo, como intérpretes. Finalmente se plantea la necesidad de formación continua en competencias profesionales, como las de gestión emocional para el trabajo con personas en entornos de origen lingüístico y cultural diverso. Some children who grow up in environments in which there is the opportunity to learn more than one language may, at some point in their development, need the support of speech and language professionals. The present paper by the Expert Committee on Multilingualism and Multiculturalism of the Spanish and Ibero-American Association of Speech and Language Therapy (AELFA-IF) provides evidence-based recommendations for speech and language therapy practices that facilitate children's ability to exercise their right to their cultural identity and the use of their language(s) (United Nations, 1989). These recommendations are based on a dynamic conceptualization of bilingualism/multilingualism that is centred on the person and his or her environment, and use a cross-cultural, transdisciplinary and functional approach to providing learning opportunities for speech and language professionals. Based on the results of research on the linguistic-communicative development of bilingual/multilingual children with and without speech/language and communication disorders, tools for developing speech/language assessment methods and intervention from a functional-linguistic perspective are proposed. These include suggestions for conducting interviews and using direct and indirect evaluation instruments to assess the bilingual environment, as well as the use of cross-linguistic and functional evaluation methods, in close collaboration with families, schools and other support professionals, such as interpreters. Finally, the paper outlines the need for continuous training in professional competencies, such as interpersonal skills, needed for working with people from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.",Logopedia; Fonoaudiología; Terapia del lenguaje; Niño; Guía; Bilingüismo; Speech and Language Therapy; Speech and Language Pathology; Child; Guidelines; Bilingualism

However, these studies have mostly been limited to the study of vowels and consonants in monolingual learners. There is relatively little research on other types of phonetic segments, such as lexical tone, even though tone languages are very well represented across languages of the world. The goal of the present study is to investigate how Mandarin Chinese–English bilingual learners contend with non-phonemic pitch variation in English spoken word recognition. This is contrasted with their treatment of phonemic changes in lexical tone in Mandarin spoken word recognition. The experimental design was cross-sectional and three age-groups were sampled (7.5months, 9months and 11months). Results demonstrated limited generalization abilities at 7.5months, where infants only recognized words in English when matched in pitch and words in Mandarin that were matched in tone. At 9months, infants recognized words in Mandarin Chinese that matched in tone, but also falsely recognized words that contrasted in tone. At this age, infants also recognized English words whether they were matched or mismatched in pitch. By 11months, infants correctly recognized pitch-matched and – mismatched words in English but only recognized tonal matches in Mandarin Chinese.",Bilingualism; Infant tone perception; Infant word recognition

Effects of age and cross-language relationships,article,Journal of Communication Disorders,ScienceDirect,"There is a growing pressure to teach foreign languages as early as possible, and children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) are not immune from these pressures. However, current scholarship lacks crucial insights into how children with DLD respond to L2 learning with minimal (classroom) exposure. In this paper, we report the results of a longitudinal study tracing the development of L1 Russian and English as a Foreign Language (EFL) skills in a group of learners with DLD (age of EFL onset: 7;9–12;1). The performance of the DLD group was compared to that of typically-developing controls, matched for classroom EFL exposure. Proficiency in English and Russian was measured three times (after one, one-and-a-half and two years of EFL instruction). At Time 1, there were no significant differences between groups on the EFL measures, but the performance of the typically-developing children significantly improved with time, and that of the DLD group did not. In the DLD group, age of EFL onset was positively related to English receptive vocabulary size. The relation between L1 and L2 proficiency in the DLD group was weaker than in the comparison group. This pattern is probably due to the floor performance of the DLD group in the grammatical domain, but may also indicate that the disorder affects cross-language transfer in the vulnerable domains.",Developmental language disorder; English as a foreign language; Age effects; Cross-language transfer

Semantic paralexias were observed in 9/340 subjects (2.4%). Our data and a review of the literature show that most deep dyslexics suffer from superficial and deep vascular damage in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, and that they are relatively young, well-educated individuals, in the chronic stage of their disease. In these subjects, perisylvian damage might be mainly responsible for damage to sublexical grapheme–phoneme Conversion (GPC) procedures, and extrasylvian damage for lexical–semantic impairment. Semantic paralexias might originate in the right hemisphere, or in left perilesional regions. The functional impairment underlying deep dyslexia was analyzed with specific reference to the summation hypothesis, i.e., to the hypothesis that in reading, GPC procedures interact with lexical–semantic information, thus blocking semantically incorrect responses. On this account, semantic paralexias should only occur when, in the presence of lexical–semantic damage, GPC rules are disrupted to the point that the interaction can no longer take place. In agreement with the hypothesis, only cases with co-occurring lexical–semantic and GPC damage produced semantic paralexias; and, these were the subjects with the most severe GPC damage. The inability to apply approximately 45% GPC mappings is the critical level of sublexical damage that no longer allows GPC procedures to interact with lexical–semantic information.",Deep dyslexia; Semantic paralexias; Lexical–semantic system; Grapheme–phoneme correspondence procedures; Sublexical conversion mechanisms; Summation hypothesis; Direct route reading models; Middle cerebral artery stroke; Right-hemisphere reading

Conclusions We provide online resources to promote adequate development of assessment tools in Spanish and Catalan, accounting for dialectal considerations.

Structural differences between bilinguals and monolinguals revealed by subcortical shape analysis,article,NeuroImage,ScienceDirect,"Naturally acquiring a language shapes the human brain through a long-lasting learning and practice process. This is supported by previous studies showing that managing more than one language from early childhood has an impact on brain structure and function. However, to what extent bilingual individuals present neuroanatomical peculiarities at the subcortical level with respect to monolinguals is yet not well understood, despite the key role of subcortical gray matter for a number of language functions, including monitoring of speech production and language control — two processes especially solicited by bilinguals. Here we addressed this issue by performing a subcortical surface-based analysis in a sample of monolinguals and simultaneous bilinguals (N=88) that only differed in their language experience from birth. This analysis allowed us to study with great anatomical precision the potential differences in morphology of key subcortical structures, namely, the caudate, accumbens, putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus. Vertexwise analyses revealed significantly expanded subcortical structures for bilinguals compared to monolinguals, localized in bilateral putamen and thalamus, as well as in the left globus pallidus and right caudate nucleus. A topographical interpretation of our results suggests that a more complex phonological system in bilinguals may lead to a greater development of a subcortical brain network involved in monitoring articulatory processes.",Basal Ganglia; Thalamus; Structural MRI; Neuroanatomy; Bilingualism

A secondary purpose was to explore the effects of the caregiver-implemented intervention on children's vocabulary. A final and more exploratory goal was to gain insight into caregivers’ perceptions of the intervention. 21 caregiver-child dyads participated in the intent-to-treat randomized control trial. Their children were 30-43 months old with language delays. Dyads were randomly assigned to receive 24 caregiver training sessions delivered at home in Spanish or a wait list control group. Pre, post and 3-month follow assessments included observational measures of caregiver-child interactions and child standardized vocabulary assessments. Caregivers completed surveys rating their perception of the intervention. Caregivers in the intervention group had significantly higher percentages of matched turns, expansions, and targets at post-assessment and of expansions and targets at follow-up compared to the control group. Overall, children in the intervention condition had significantly higher receptive vocabulary scores and performed better than children in the control condition on observational measure of their lexical diversity, with moderate effect sizes for most outcomes. Caregivers perceived the intervention as effective and culturally appropriate.

A series of seven proficient bilingual patients was studied: two left-handed and five right-handed individuals with no pre-existing language deficit. Hemispheric cortex (on the side contralateral to the patient’s hand-dominance) was directly stimulated whilst the patient performed naming and reading tasks in both languages and a translation task (of a written text from their second ‘learned’ language to their first or ‘native’ language). Of the 147 different cortical sites studied, 26 ‘language functional sites’ were detected, where electrostimulation affected reading and/or naming in the patient’s native and/or second learned language. Of these, 8 sites (in 4 patients) were “task-specific” and “language-specific” i.e., affecting only naming or reading in only one of the patient’s languages. Of the 26 “language sites”, only 3 produced any interferences in translation. All of these were located in frontal regions. Electrostimulation at these sites caused the patient to stop translating abruptly, but no language switching or other translation-related phenomenon was observed. No site was found that was involved only in translation and not other language tasks. Overall, in contrast to other language tasks, cortical structures of the convexity were rarely involved in translation. We suggest that translation interference could be more readily detected by subcortical stimulations. This spatial dissociation within the brain of translation function versus other language functions could explain the cases of dissociated language impairments observed in some bilingual patients with brain lesions. On a practical level, because the cortical sites found by translation tasks are few and related with other cortical language sites, we think that translation tasks provide little additional helpful information for cortical brain mapping in bilingual neurosurgical patients.",Brain tumour; Cortical mapping; Bilingualism; Reading; Naming; Translation

The present study investigates the impact of orthographic depth on reading route by analyzing evoked potentials to words in a deep (French) and shallow (German) language presented to highly proficient bilinguals. ERP analyses to German and French words revealed significant topographic modulations 240–280ms post-stimulus onset, indicative of distinct brain networks engaged in reading over this time window. Source estimations revealed that these effects stemmed from modulations of left insular, inferior frontal and dorsolateral regions (German>French) previously associated to phonological processing. Our results show that reading in a shallow language was associated to a stronger engagement of phonological pathways than reading in a deep language. Thus, the lexical pathways favored in word reading are reinforced by phonological networks more strongly in the shallow than deep orthography.",Reading; Words; Orthographic depth; Dual-Route Model; ERP; EEG; Topography; Grapheme–phoneme conversion; Bilingual; Reading strategies

Depending on the nature of a directive cue, participants named a subsequent picture in their native language, in their second language, or remained silent. The cue elicited a contingent negative variation of event-related brain potentials, greater in amplitude when the cue announced a naming trial as compared to when it announced a silent trial. In addition, the negativity was greater in amplitude when the picture was to be named in English than in Chinese, suggesting that preparation for speech in the second language requires more inhibition than preparation for speech in the native language.

We addressed whether this causes the profiles of neurosurgery- and stroke-induced language impairments to be distinct. K-means clustering of language assessment data (neurosurgery cohort: N = 88, stroke cohort: N = 95) identified similar profiles in both cohorts. But critically, a cluster of individuals with specific phonological deficits was only evident in the stroke but not in the neurosurgery cohort. Thus, phonological deficits are less clearly distinguished from other language deficits after glioma surgery compared to stroke. Furthermore, the correlations between language production and comprehension scores at different linguistic levels were more extensive in the neurosurgery than in the stroke cohort. Our findings suggest that neurosurgery-induced language impairments do not correspond to those caused by stroke, but rather manifest as a ‘moderate global aphasia’ – a generalized decline of language processing abilities.",Aphasia; Glioma; Neurosurgery; Stroke; K-means clustering

The study employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Respondents completed an online questionnaire and were interviewed by the researcher. The study included the Complementarity Principle into the operationalisation and measurement of language use in bilinguals (Grosjean, 2016). The findings revealed a consistent variation in the extent of L2 use across different language functions. Links were established between the extent of L2 internalisation and acculturation level, social network profile, and predicted future domicile. The results showed that sociocultural integration is a reliable predictor of the extent of L2 use across language functions.

The comparison of switch relative to repeat trials reveals longer response times and higher error rates, a pattern that has been interpreted as switching costs. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown the involvement of different brain modules in switching conditions, including prefrontal and parietal regions together with other sub-cortical structures. In this study, the aim was to shed light on the brain basis of cognitive control using an approach that proved useful in previous studies investigating language control in bilinguals. We examined adult participants in one simple color naming context and two task selection mixed contexts. In the first mixed selection context, participants named the color or the shape of the stimulus based on a cue word. In the second, they named the color or the size of the stimulus. It was assumed that the comparison of brain responses to the same color naming in mixed selection contexts vs. in non-selection context will reveal the of engagement of cognitive control/task selection processes. Whole brain analysis of color naming in the different contexts showed a significant main effect of context. The comparison of brain responses in several frontal, parietal and sub-cortical regions, of which some are supposedly involved in cognitive control, demonstrated an increased activation during color naming in mixed relative the simple non-mixed context.

The mechanisms responsible for task switching and language switching were investigated using electrophysiological (EEG) measures. In nonverbal task switching, monolinguals and bilinguals demonstrated equivalent behavioral mixing (pure vs. repeat) and switching (repeat vs. switch) costs, but bilinguals were more accurate in the mixed blocks. Bilinguals used a more distributed neural network than monolinguals that captured the nonverbal mixing effect and showed earlier discrimination for the switching effect in the ERPs. In language switching, more distributed networks for bilinguals than monolinguals were found for the switching effect. The scalp distributions revealed more overlap between task switching and language switching for bilinguals than monolinguals. For switch costs, both groups showed P3/LPC modulations in both tasks, but bilinguals showed extended activation to central regions for both switching tasks. For mixing costs, both groups revealed modulations of the N2 but only bilinguals showed extended activation to the occipital region.

An epidemiological cross-sectional study based on parental reports,article,International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology,ScienceDirect,"Objective To investigate the role of the period of emergence of the first words and its interactions with other risk factors in predicting the development of speech sound disorder (SSD) among 4- to 5-year-old children. Methods After 373 children underwent otolaryngology and speech pathology examinations, their parents answered a questionnaire about potential risk factors for speech impairment. The presence of SSD was identified by a speech pathologist who administered Fanzago's Articulation Test to each child. Multivariate logistic analysis was used to explore the relationships between variables and outcomes. Results Mean age at first words was 17.8 ± 6.5 months of life; 25.7% of patients suffered from SSD, and 3.7% from stuttering. A family history of language impairment was found in 12.9% of the sample, whereas a family history of reading difficulty was reported in only 5.4% of cases. No differences in terms of mean age (p = 0.3) or gestational age (p = 0.16) were found between children affected by SSD and those who were not. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that male sex (p < 0.001), a family history of language impairment (p < 0.001) and stuttering (p = 0.001) were significantly associated to SSD.

Metalinguistic skills, particularly metaphonological skills, greatly influence language learning during early, school grades and reportedly children with learning disorders are poor at these skills. Aim and objectives To develop and validate a Bengali rhyming checklist and study the auditory perception of non-sense and familiar Bengali rhyming words in children with and without specific learning disability (SLD). Method 60 children, age range 8–11years, participated in two groups; group-A included children with SLD and group-B, typically developing children (TDC). All participants were native Bengali speakers, attending regular school, with hearing sensitivity less than 25dBHL, no history of ear discharge and middle socioeconomic background. A rhyming checklist was developed in Bengali, consisting of familiar (section-A) and non-sense (section-B) words. Test–retest reliability and validity measures were obtained. The items on the checklist were audio recorded and presented to the participants in a rhyming judgment task in one to one set up. Scores were obtained and statistically analyzed using SPSS software (version-11.0). Result Children with SLD scored significantly low on the rhyming judgment task as against TDC (p<.05) for both familiar and non-sense words. Children with SLD performed significantly better on familiar word rhyming judgment task against non-sense words (p<.05). TDC showed no significant difference on familiar and non-sense words rhyming judgment tasks (p>.05). Conclusion Semantic content influences rhyming perception in children with SLD but has no significant effect on TDC. The developed rhyming checklist may be used as a screening tool for children at risk of SLD at primary school grades.

The review revealed the important roles of social class, family history, environmental, and genetic factors in prediction of child language development. It was established that the interplay between environmental, social, and genetic factors influence child language development; specifically, environmental exposure to toxins like lead and mercury were noted to have a complex interplay with the biological aspects of communication disorders.

To address these questions, we studied fourteen English-speaking monolingual adults enrolled in a 12-week intensive French language-training program in Montreal. Using functional MRI, we investigated the neural changes associated with new language acquisition. The participants were scanned before the start of the immersion program and at the end of the 12 weeks. The fMRI scan aimed to investigate the brain regions recruited in a sentence reading task both in English, their first language (L1), and in French, their second language (L2). For the L1, fMRI patterns did not change from Time 1 to Time 2, while for the L2, the brain response changed between Time 1 and Time 2 in language-related areas. Of note, for the L2, there was higher activation at Time 2 compared to Time 1 in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) including the supramarginal gyrus. At Time 2 this higher activation in the IPL correlated with faster L2 reading speed. Moreover, higher activation in the left IPL at Time 1 predicted improvement in L2 reading speed from Time 1 to Time 2. Our results suggest that learning-induced plasticity occurred as early as 12 weeks into immersive second-language training, and that the IPL appears to play a special role in language learning.",Second language acquisition; fMRI; Inferior parietal lobule; Sentence reading

Forty articles reporting on 41 studies met inclusionary criteria. Interventions focused on four areas: explicit instruction on targeted skills; classroom curriculum interventions; interactive book reading and/or book making interventions; and naturalistic, routines-based interventions. Most interventions were delivered to children above age 3 who were from Latino and/or Spanish-speaking backgrounds. Also, linguistic adaptations (primarily in Spanish) were more common in interventions as compared to cultural adaptations. Vocabulary was the most common outcome targeted, with a wide variety of measures used across studies. Most interventions had positive effects in English and/or a language other than English particularly when the interventions were linguistically- and culturally-responsive. Several cultural or linguistic factors were also identified as variables affecting intervention fidelity, engagement, and effects.

Inhibitory control was gauged by lag-2 task repetition costs, namely decreased performance on the final trial of sequences of type ABA relative to CBA, due to persisting inhibition of the recently abandoned task. Bilinguals had larger lag-2 repetition costs, which reflect stronger inhibition of a no-longer relevant task to facilitate a switch into a new task. Monitoring ability was measured by the fadeout effect, which reflects adaptation to simpler task demands when a single task block immediately and unexpectedly follows mixed task blocks. Bilinguals did not differ from monolinguals in the magnitude or trajectory of the fade-out effect. Thus, results support the notion of increased bilingual inhibitory control, even when it is detrimental to performance, and do not demonstrate a specific bilingual advantage in monitoring.

Patients produced more intrusions (and self-corrected less often) than controls, particularly when reading non-dominant language paragraphs with switches into the dominant language. Patients also produced more within-language errors than controls, but differences between groups for these were not consistently larger with dominant versus non-dominant language targets. These results illustrate the potential utility of speech errors for diagnosis of AD, suggest a variety of linguistic and executive control impairments in AD, and reveal multiple cognitive mechanisms needed to mix languages fluently. The observed pattern of deficits, and unique sensitivity of intrusions to AD in bilinguals, suggests intact ability to select a default language with contextual support, to rapidly translate and switch languages in production of connected speech, but impaired ability to monitor language membership while regulating inhibitory control.",Bilingualism; Switching; Speech errors; Alzheimer’s disease; Diagnosis; Reading-aloud

Infants, primates, some birds, and other animals are born with the innate ability, called subitizing, to tell at a glance whether small sets of scattered dots or other items differ by one or more item. This nonverbal approximate number system extends mostly to single digit sets as visual discrimination drops logarithmically to “many” with increasing numerosity (size effect) and crowding (distance effect). Preschoolers need several years and specific teaching to learn verbal names and visual symbols for numbers and school agers to understand their cardinality and ordinality and the invariance of their sequence (arithmetic number line) that enables calculation. This arithmetic linear line differs drastically from the nonlinear approximate number system mental number line that parallels the individual number-tuned neurons in the intraparietal sulcus in monkeys and overlying scalp distribution of discrete functional magnetic resonance imaging activations by number tasks in man. Calculation is a complex skill that activates both visual and spatial and visual and verbal networks. It is less strongly left lateralized than language, with approximate number system activation somewhat more right sided and exact number and arithmetic activation more left sided. Maturation and increasing number skill decrease associated widespread non-numerical brain activations that persist in some individuals with dyscalculia, which has no single, universal neurological cause or underlying mechanism in all affected individuals.",dyscalculia; learning disability; intraparietal sulcus; subitizing; numerosity; number line; functional magnetic brain imaging; remediation

The children completed tests of nonverbal intelligence, language tests assessing receptive vocabulary and attention based on picture naming, and two tests of executive functioning. All children performed equivalently on the basic intelligence tests, but performance on the language and executive functioning tasks was influenced by both SES and bilingualism. Middle-class children outperformed working-class children on all measures, and bilingual children obtained lower scores than monolingual children on language tests but higher scores than monolingual children on the executive functioning tasks. There were no interactions with either group factors or task factors.

Here, we investigated local structural differences along two language-related white matter trajectories, the arcuate fasciculus and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), between early simultaneous bilinguals and late sequential bilinguals. We also examined whether early exposure to two languages might lead to a more bilateral structural organization of the arcuate fasciculus. Fractional anisotropy, mean and radial diffusivities (FA, MD, and RD respectively) were extracted to analyse tract-specific changes. Additionally, global voxel-wise effects were investigated with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). We found that relative to late exposure, early exposure to L2 leads to increased FA along a phonology-related segment of the arcuate fasciculus, but induces no modulations along the IFOF, associated to semantic processing. Late sequential bilingualism, however, was associated with decreased MD along the bilateral IFOF. Our results suggest that early vs. late bilingualism may lead to qualitatively different kind of changes in the structural language-related network. Furthermore, we show that early bilingualism contributes to the structural laterality of the arcuate fasciculus, leading to a more bilateral organization of these perisylvian language-related tracts.",Bilingualism; DTI; FA; TBSS; Tract-specific

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on three participants with aphasia and three normal controls who had demonstrated a shift toward dominance in their second language (English). The behavioral and imaging results indicate that all participants processed their non-dominant native language (Spanish) differently compared to their dominant second language (English). Specifically, increased activation was observed in the left frontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus during the weaker native language processing. Further, in participants with aphasia, increased bilateral activation was observed during the weaker native language processing, indicating that decreased language usage/proficiency results in a distributed network of activation. The results of this study demonstrate that the neural substrates of language recovery in bilingual stroke patients are similar to regions engaged by normal bilinguals but include additional regions reflecting a compensatory network to subserve successful language processing.",Bilingualism; Aphasia; fMRI; Language use; Language proficiency

An interesting question is to what extent phonological similarity of translation equivalents across the first language (L1) and L2 affects speech-sound processing and lexical access in an L2. The present study examined this question by comparing processing of Spanish-English translation equivalents that either were phonologically similar (cognates) or dissimilar (non-cognates) in fifteen monolingual English-speakers and 15 late Spanish-English bilinguals. Event related potentials (ERP) were used to examine whether late L2-learners had more difficulty discriminating mispronunciations of vowels in English words that have Spanish cognates compared to words that do not have cognates. Behavioral results indicated effects of language background and cognate status on discrimination, with bilinguals showing poorer discrimination of English vowel mispronunciations than the American-English monolingual control group. ERP results revealed that cognate words facilitated L2 phonological processing as evidenced by a larger frontal positive component (P400) ERP effect, similar in amplitude to the P400 from monolinguals. Results suggest that cognate words facilitate speech processing in adult L2 learners, and, thus, may also be useful as a tool for perceptual learning of L2 phonology.",Bilingualism; Cognates; Event-related potential (ERP); Second language acquisition; Speech perception; Vowel perception; Spanish-English

Surprisingly, differences between patients and controls were larger using dominant-language than nondominant-language naming scores, and bilinguals with AD were either more likely than controls (in English-dominant bilinguals), or equally likely (in Spanish-dominant bilinguals), to name some pictures in the nondominant language that they could not produce in their dominant language. These findings suggest that dominant language testing may provide the best assessment of language deficits in bilingual AD, and argue against the common notion that the nondominant language is particularly susceptible to dementia. The greater vulnerability of the dominant language may reflect the increased probability of AD affecting richer semantic representations associated with dominant compared to nondominant language names.",Alzheimer's disease; Bilingual; Picture naming; Spanish–English; Retrieval deficit; Semantic representation

This right visual field advantage was largely reduced in individuals with reading difficulties from developmental dyslexia. Similarly, visual detection became more symmetric in skilled readers, when attention was guided opposite to the reading pattern.

By adopting an ecological approach, I examine how the memories they have created in Iran and Germany impact their emotional attachments to the Persian, Assyrian, and German languages. I argue that their experiences with these languages cause them to ascribe distinct emotional values to each. On the one hand, their strong feelings of belonging to a place (Iran), which correspond to their good memories of speaking Persian in that place, lead them to highly value that language and incorporate it into most aspects of their social lives. On the other hand, the migrants’ memories of a language with negative or neutral connotations (in this case, German) correspond with a lower level of reported social interactions in that language. This study shows that the language which these participants use to express their emotional involvement in particular moments of their life invokes specific feelings, and represents their inner world better than their other linguistic resources.",Migration; Belonging; Iranian refugees; Ecological approach; First language; Second language; Multilingualism

Although previous studies have determined the prevalence of congenital amusia in the general population, few have studied its presence among university students. Findings regarding the association between this condition and academic performance are equivocal, although evidence suggests that musical training improves scholastic achievement. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study on a sample of 383 university students, all pursuing health-related degrees, comparing their class rank with their performance on the BRAMS Online Test for amusia. Results We found a prevalence of 0.52% for pitch-based amusia. When applying the Off-Scale test failure criterion for the definition of amusia in our sample, we found a prevalence of 4.4%. Logistic models showed an increase in risk of poor academic performance (lowest quartile) in subjects who failed the off-scale test (Odds Ratio: 7.14 95% CI 2.59–19.6) and who met any of the described definitions of amusia (Odds Ratio: 4.89 95% CI 2.24–10.7).

Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies imply some separation between the two faculties, but recent perceptual studies suggest better talker recognition in familiar languages than unfamiliar languages. A familiar-language benefit in talker recognition potentially implies strong ties between the two domains. However, little is known about the nature of this language familiarity effect. The current study investigated the relationship between speech and talker processing by assessing bilingual and monolingual listeners’ ability to learn voices as a function of language familiarity and age of acquisition. Two effects emerged. First, bilinguals learned to recognize talkers in their first language (Korean) more rapidly than they learned to recognize talkers in their second language (English), while English-speaking participants showed the opposite pattern (learning English talkers faster than Korean talkers). Second, bilinguals’ learning rate for talkers in their second language (English) correlated with age of English acquisition.

Research also suggests that OCs are a complex morphosyntactic property of French and, as such, they could be particularly taxing for working memory (WM) resources. In light of previous research, it seems more likely that difficulties with OCs could be a marker for atypical early language acquisition. Children receiving a cochlear implant (CI) represent a case of delayed language exposure linked to a lack of early auditory exposure. Few studies have investigated the production of clitics in children with CIs. Studies suggest that children with CIs make significantly more clitic omissions on tasks of clitic production than typically-developing (TD) children. To our knowledge, no study has looked at clitic comprehension in children with CIs learning French or at the relationship between WM and performance on tasks of OCs in this population.

Children with SLI showed difficulties with most aspects of verbal fluency (rates of output, errors, switching) relative to typical children. Language ability predicted nearly every aspect of phonemic fluency performance and some aspects of semantic fluency performance. The relationships between verbal fluency and executive functioning were modest: inhibition was related to error scores on the phonemic fluency task, but relationships with executive-loaded working memory and switching were absent. Educationally, these results emphasise the underlying importance of language abilities in generation tasks like verbal fluency, but point to the importance of inhibition skills for error monitoring.

Examining this issue is paramount given that high-stakes decisions are based on individual test results. Consequently, we investigated whether seven current and widely used intelligence tests yielded comparable results for individuals between the ages of 4–20 years. Results mostly indicated substantial correlations between tests, although several significant mean differences at the group level were identified. Results associated with individual-level comparability indicated that the interpretation of exact IQ scores cannot be empirically supported, as the 95% confidence intervals could not be reliably replicated with different intelligence tests. Similar patterns also appeared for the individual-level comparability of nonverbal and verbal intelligence factor scores. Furthermore, the nominal level of intelligence systematically predicted IQ differences between tests, with above- and below-average IQ scores associated with larger differences as compared to average IQ scores. Analyses based on continuous data confirmed that differences appeared to increase toward the above-average IQ score range. These findings are critical as these are the ranges in which diagnostic questions most often arise in practice.

The interplay of coarticulation with children’s speaking rate has also been ignored. How do coarticulation and speaking rate (duration) interact over the course of development, and does the interaction manifest differently across distinct morphological environments? To answer this, the current study measured the speech patterns of bilingual Quechua-Spanish children (5–10 years) and adults. Coarticulation and duration were measured in two word environments, within morphemes and across morpheme boundaries. Unsurprisingly, adults consistently coarticulated more in shorter duration sequences, in both morphological environments. The children’s coarticulation-duration patterns, however, varied by morphological environment.

Children born with CL/P are at increased risk of persistent speech difficulties related to velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI) and compensatory articulation problems. It has also been reported that they achieve poorer results academically than their peers. There is a further body of evidence to suggest delayed language skills. These potentially related outcomes are often reported separately. Aim To review published and unpublished research into the nature of difficulties related to spoken and written language across all non-syndromic cleft diagnoses. To review any evidence of associations between comorbidities. Method A scoping review was carried out in October 2016 and updated in June 2019 following published methodology (Arksey & O’Malley, 2005; Levac et al. 2010). Results A search of the literature over the two time points found 38 papers in total. Three main themes were found: oral language skills, reading and auditory processing difficulties. Conclusions There is evidence of early language delay in children born with CL/P. Evidence of persistent oral language problems is less conclusive. Many studies have reported scores within the average range for language, auditory processing and reading but poorer outcomes when compared to non-cleft control groups. However, studies have used a range of outcome measures, making comparisons difficult. Moreover there is no clear evidence how these difficulties might relate to speech outcomes or educational achievement and no comparison to other populations with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN).",Language disorder; Cleft lip and palate; Auditory processing difficulties; Reading difficulties

Pickering,2022,Prediction during simultaneous interpreting: Evidence from the visual-world paradigm,article,Cognition,ScienceDirect,"We report the results of an eye-tracking study which used the Visual World Paradigm (VWP) to investigate the time-course of prediction during a simultaneous interpreting task. Twenty-four L1 French professional conference interpreters and twenty-four L1 French professional translators untrained in simultaneous interpretation listened to sentences in English and interpreted them simultaneously into French while looking at a visual scene. Sentences contained a highly predictable word (e.g., The dentist asked the man to open his mouth a little wider). The visual scene comprised four objects, one of which depicted either the target object (mouth; bouche), an English phonological competitor (mouse; souris), a French phonological competitor (cork; bouchon), or an unrelated word (bone; os). We considered 1) whether interpreters and translators predict upcoming nouns during a simultaneous interpreting task, 2) whether interpreters and translators predict the form of these nouns in English and in French and 3) whether interpreters and translators manifest different predictive behaviour. Our results suggest that both interpreters and translators predict upcoming nouns, but neither group predicts the word-form of these nouns. In addition, we did not find significant differences between patterns of prediction in interpreters and translators. Thus, evidence from the visual-world paradigm shows that prediction takes place in simultaneous interpreting, regardless of training and experience. However, we were unable to establish whether word-form was predicted.",Simultaneous interpreting; Prediction; Eye-tracking; Visual-world paradigm

This model included the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices as well as a subcortical structure, which could be the striatum, whose nature and role have remained unclear. Although the emergence of language deficits in patients with striatal injury has challenged the cortical language models developed over the past 30 years, the integration of the striatum into language processing models remains rare. The main argument for not including the striatum in language processing is that the disorders observed in patients with striatal dysfunction may result from the striatal role in cognitive functions beyond language, and not from the impairment of language itself. Indeed, unraveling the role of the striatum and the frontal cortex, linked by the fronto-striatal pathway, is a challenge. Here, we first reviewed the studies that explored the link between striatal functions and the different levels of language (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexico-semantics). We then looked at the language models, which included the striatum, and found that none of them captured the diversity of experimental data in this area. Finally, we propose an integrative anatomo-functional model of language processing combining traditional language processing levels and some “executive” functions, known to improve the efficiency and fluidity of language: control, working memory, and attention. We argue that within this integrative model, the striatum is a central node of a verbal executive network that regulates, monitors, and controls the allocations of limited cognitive resources (verbal working memory and verbal attention), whatever the language level. This model combines data from neurology, psycholinguistics, and cognitive science.",Striatum; Language; Huntington's disease

Study design This was a prospective cohort study. Concussed children, aged 8-18 years, presenting to a regional pediatric trauma center emergency department (n = 160) were contacted 7 and 30 days after injury to gather data on PCP follow-up, symptoms, quality of life, and receipt of academic support instituted after and because of the concussion. Bivariate comparisons of demographics, concussion characteristics, quality of life, and symptoms were made between children who did and did not receive support using independent samples t tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, or χ2 tests. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using multivariable logistic regression with backwards elimination to test the association between attending an outpatient follow-up visit and the receipt of academic support for variables where P < .2 in bivariate comparisons. Results Overall, 51.3% (n = 82) received academic support; of these, 84.2% attended a follow-up visit compared with 71.8% of 78 children who attended a follow-up visit but did not receive support (P = .06). Children who received support were more likely to have commercial insurance; experience a sports-related injury mechanism; have parents whose primary language was English; suffer from learning disabilities and migraines; and be non-Hispanic (P < .05). There was no association between attending a follow-up visit and receipt of academic support (adjusted OR 1.83; 95% CI 0.75-4.45).

Methods Retrospective analysis of the clinical database of a tertiary-care pediatric weight management clinic (n = 453), extracting data from electronic health records including longitudinal change in weight status (body mass index [BMI] z-score) and frequency of attrition from treatment. Upon review of medical records, children enrolled in the treatment program were classified as having no CD (n = 342) or CD (n = 111). Results At baseline, there were no between-group differences in BMI or BMI z-score. After 4 months of treatment, 66% (299) of patients remained enrolled, and complete case data were available for 219 children in final analyses. There were no statistically significant differences in attrition between the 2 groups (no CD vs CD). Mean change in BMI z-score across all groups was −0.03 ± 0.13 (P < .001). Change in BMI z-score was significantly greater among patients with CD (−0.07 ± 0.15) compared to those without CD (−0.03 ± 0.12) (difference 0.04, 95% confidence interval 0.005–0.08, P = .029).

The heterogeneity of these diverse populations makes it impossible to identify and document a one size fits all strategy for working with culturally and linguistically diverse families. This paper explores approaches to practice by SLPs identified as specialising in multilingual and multicultural practice in culturally and linguistically diverse contexts from around the world. Data were obtained from ethnographic observation of 14 sites in 5 countries on 4 continents. The sites included hospital settings, university clinics, school-based settings, private practices and Indigenous community-based services. There were 652 individual artefacts collected from the sites which included interview transcripts, photographs, videos, narrative reflections, informal and formal field notes. The data were analysed using Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (Engeström, 1987). From the analysis six overarching Principles of Culturally Competent Practice (PCCP) were identified. These were: (1) identification of culturally appropriate and mutually motivating therapy goals, (2) knowledge of languages and culture, (3) use of culturally appropriate resources, (4) consideration of the cultural, social and political context, (5) consultation with families and communities, and (6) collaboration between professionals. These overarching principles align with the six position statements developed by the International Expert Panel on Multilingual Children's Speech (2012) which aim to enhance the cultural competence of speech pathologists and their practice. The international examples provided in the current study demonstrate the individualised ways that these overarching principles are enacted in a range of different organisational, social, cultural and political contexts. Tensions experienced in enacting the principles are also discussed. This paper emphasises the potential for individual SLPs to enhance their practice by adopting these overarching principles to support the individual children and families in diverse contexts around the world.",ractice; Multilingual; Cultural and linguistic diversity; Cultural competence

Current research suggests substantial connections between SES and brain development changes, particularly in memory, executive function, and emotion, in investigating the relations between socioeconomic status and brain development. The cognitive abilities of children and their achievements at school are strongly influenced by socioeconomic status. Many studies have shown lower cognitive performance in adverse situations, and SES's impact on the child's neurological systems is little known. The proposed method suggested that, while the level of socioeconomic status performance is equally consistent, children's socioeconomic status is an essential predictor for neurocognitive performance, especially of semantic and executive function. Implications for brain science, as well as for identifying and improving childhood poverty issues, are addressed. The results show that SESC and bilingualism affect various child abilities. Bilingualism is correlated with lower vocabulary and lower performances in short-term verbal memory tasks with greater language load. And have significant clinical implications that include a further study into children's varied verbal and cognitive abilities and the diverse effects of the language and life experience.

Early acquired strong languages are likely to have higher baseline activation levels than later learned less-dominant languages. However, it is still largely unknown how the activation levels of these different languages are controlled, and how interference from an irrelevant language is prevented. In this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study on language switching during auditory perception, early Finnish-Swedish bilinguals (N = 18) who mastered English with high proficiency after childhood were presented with spoken words in each of the three languages, while performing a simple semantic categorisation task. Switches from the later learned English to either of the native languages resulted in increased neural activation in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) 400–600ms after word onset (N400m response), whereas such increase was not detected for switches from native languages to English or between the native languages. In an earlier time window of 350–450ms, English non-switch trials showed higher activation levels in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), pointing to ongoing inhibition of the native languages during the use of English. Taken together, these asymmetric switch costs suggest that native languages are suppressed during the use of a non-native language, despite the receptive nature of the language task. This effect seems to be driven mostly by age of acquisition or language exposure, rather than proficiency. Our results indicate that mechanisms of control between two native languages differ from those of a later learned language, as upbringing in an early bilingual environment has likely promoted automatiation of language control specifically for the native languages.",Trilingualism; Language control; N400m; Language switching; Auditory speech perception

Introduction Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) have cognitive deficit aspects such as attention and memory in addition to language difficulties. Studies of these supra-linguistic aspects have opened a debate in the scientific and professional community on changing the name of “specific” disorder to “developmental language disorder”. There is consensus about phonological memory deficits in this population but there are conflicting results in relation to visual memory and attention. In the present study we evaluated some aspects of memory and attention capacities, as well as vocabulary knowledge in a group of children with and without DLD to find differences and interaction between these variables. Method 39 bilingual Catalan-Spanish children with DLD and 39 typical developing (TD) children (from 5 to 12 years old), matched by age and sex participated in the study. Both groups were evaluated with a test battery of visual memory (immediate/delayed), non-word repetition task, sustained selective attention. A family report was used to assess inattention and hyperactivity. Linear mixed model analyses were used to compare performance between groups and correlations with vocabulary were applied. Results The group of children with DLD showed a lower performance in all attention and memory tasks. The performance of the tasks correlated positively with the level of vocabulary. The family report showed that the number of children with DLD with inattention features was higher than the number of children in the TD group. Conclusions DLD diagnosis, intervention and research have to consider that the difficulties of this population go beyond language, and that they are related to multiple and varied deficits in neuropsychological development.",Trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje; Trastorno específico del lenguaje; Memoria; Déficit de atención; Vocabulario; Developmental language disorder; Specific language impairment; Memory; Attention deficit; Vocabulary

At the whole-brain level, L2 learners showed the expected overall differences in activation when compared to native speakers (in the fronto-temporal network). But L2 speakers did not show any distinctive activation outside the caudate nucleus as Metaphoricity increased, suggesting that the L2 speakers were less affected by increasing Metaphoricity than native speakers were. With small volume correction, only a single peak in the amygdala reached threshold for L2 speakers as Metaphoricity increased. The findings are consistent with the view that metaphorical language is more engaging for native speakers but not necessarily for L2 speakers.",Multilingualism; Metaphor; Amygdala; Emotion; fMRI; IFG

El presente trabajo pretende aportar orientaciones para el diseño de intervenciones adaptadas a este tipo de usuarios. Pacientes Las orientaciones de intervención propuestas se dirigen a niños o adolescentes que evolucionan en contextos multilingües (con dos o más lenguas en su entorno familiar, escolar o social, que se juzguen relevantes para el desarrollo del individuo). Resultados Partiendo de la evidencia sobre la eficacia de las intervenciones fundamentadas en el desarrollo fonológico y de las correspondencias grafema-fonema con población multilingüe con trastorno del aprendizaje de la lectura, se proponen orientaciones para adaptar estos componentes del tratamiento a dicha población. Se incorporan asimismo recomendaciones de trabajo sobre componentes complementarios, tomando en cuenta su pertinencia en distintos tipos de lengua. Conclusiones La evidencia sugiere que es pertinente intervenir en más de una lengua con pacientes con trastorno del aprendizaje de la lectura, siempre y cuando se tengan en cuenta determinados aspectos específicos en el diseño del programa de intervención. No obstante, es necesario seguir generando estudios longitudinales de intervención o de caso con niños de distintos contextos multilingües, en función de la transparencia de cada una de sus lenguas, su momento de adquisición y el papel que desempeñan en la vida del niño. Background and objective With half of the world's population exposed to more than one language, the lack of studies on the effectiveness of interventions specifically aimed at bilingual children with reading learning disorder can lead professionals to issue hasty recommendations on how to approach the issue. This paper aims to provide guidance for the design of interventions adapted to this type of users. Patients The proposed intervention guidelines are aimed at children or adolescents who evolve in multilingual contexts (with two or more languages in their family, school or social environment, deemed relevant for the development of the individual). Results Using the evidence of the effectiveness of interventions based on phonological development and grapheme-phoneme correspondences with multilingual population with reading learning disorder, guidelines are proposed to adapt these components of the treatment to said population. Recommendations for work on complementary components are also incorporated, taking into account their relevance in different types of language. Conclusions The evidence suggests that it is pertinent to intervene in more than one language with patients with reading learning disorder, as long as certain specific aspects are taken into account in the design of the intervention programme. However, it is necessary to continue generating longitudinal intervention or case studies with children from different multilingual contexts, depending on the transparency of each of their languages, their moment of acquisition and the role they play in the child's life.",Trastorno de aprendizaje de la lectura; Dislexia; Bilingüe; Multilingüe; Logopedia; Fonoaudiología; Learning disability; Reading; Dyslexia; Bilingual; Multilingual; Speech therapy

We prospectively examined the role of the affected hemisphere and the lesion site in the occurrence and recovery of language deficits in nonthalamic subcortical stroke. Forty patients with unilateral basal ganglia stroke underwent language assessment within 1 week, 3 months and 1 year after stroke. Disturbances in at least one language domain were observed in 35 patients during the first week post stroke including aphasia diagnosed in 11 patients. Importantly, the appearance of deficits after stroke onset and the improvement of language function were not determined by the site of subcortical lesion, but instead were critically influenced by the affected hemisphere. In fact, the language impairments following left and right basal ganglia stroke mirrored the language dysfunction observed after cortical lesions in the same hemisphere. A significant overall language improvement was observed at 3 months after stroke, although residual deficits in language executive function were the most commonly observed impairment at 1 year follow-up. Although a substantial improvement of language function can be expected after nonthalamic subcortical stroke, our findings suggest that language recovery may not be fully achieved at 1 year post stroke.",Language; Aphasia; Recovery; Subcortical stroke

In the present study, we ask whether knowledge of a second language (English) modulates this pattern of activation in the perception of tonal contrasts. Twenty-four native Chinese speakers were recruited from undergraduate and graduate students at Beijing Normal University, China. Participants listened to blocks of computationally manipulated /ba/ syllables which were varied to form within- and across-category deviants at equal acoustic intervals from a standard tone while their cortical blood oxygenation was measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Blocks were analyzed for peak blood oxygenation (HbO) levels, and several linear models were estimated for these data, including effects of deviant tone type (within- or across-category), behavioral differences in tone identification, age of earliest exposure to English (spoken), and proficiency in English. Functional changes in HbO indicated a significantly greater response to within-category contrasts in right STG, consistent with previous findings. However, the effect of deviant type in left MTG was significantly modulated by the age of participants' earliest English exposure: Average across-category activation exceeded within-category activation only for participants exposed to English after 13 years of age. While previous research has established the importance of left MTG in the categorical perception of lexical tones, our findings suggest that the functional specialization of this region is sensitive to second language experience, even in the processing of native language.",Lexical tones; Categorical perception; Bilingualism; Chinese; Age of acquisition

Patterns of relative strengths and weaknesses in language, verbal memory and literacy were analyzed. Variables that predicted reading and writing were determined. Method : Children adopted from Eastern Europe between 1;0 and 4;11 years of age were assessed at ages 6 to 7 years and age 8 years on a variety of tests that measured language, verbal memory and literacy. Results were compared across ages, and language, verbal memory and literacy domains. Results : Group means for all measures fell within the average range at both ages. The children's scores were not significantly different from test norms except for measures of rapid naming and number repetition. However, a larger than expected percentage of children scored -1SD below the mean on decontextualized measures of verbal working memory and reading fluency. At age 8 years 24% of children received speech language therapy services and 26% had repeated a grade level. Vocabulary, expressive syntax, verbal short-term memory and writing were areas of relative strength. Higher level vocabulary knowledge was strongly correlated with all literacy measures. Conclusion : As a group, Eastern European adoptees scored average on measures of language and literacy at 6 or 7 years and again at age 8 years. However, 26% of the children had repeated a grade and 24% were still receiving speech and language services. Vocabulary was an area of strength reflecting the children's enriched adopted home environments. In-depth knowledge of vocabulary was the best predictor of reading and writing.

Such interference management, and bilingual language control more generally, have recently been linked to domain general executive functions (EF). In the current study, we examined L2 proficiency and executive functions as possible predictors of susceptibility to L1 interference during L2 processing, in bilinguals whose languages do not share an orthographic system. Seventy Arabic-Hebrew bilingual university students performed two tasks indexing cross-language interference (from L1 to L2). Lexical interference was assessed using a cross-modal semantic similarity judgment task in Hebrew, with false-cognates as critical items. Syntactic interference was assessed using a self-paced reading paradigm and grammaticality judgments on Hebrew sentences whose syntactic structures differed from those of Arabic. EFs were examined using spatial and numerical Stroop tasks, to index inhibitory control, and a task switching paradigm, to index shifting abilities. We found significant L1 interference across the lexical and syntactic domains, even in proficient different-script bilinguals. However, these interference effects were not correlated, and neither type of interference was related to domain general EF abilities. Finally, offline susceptibility to syntactic interference, but not lexical interference, was reduced with greater L2 proficiency. These results suggest at least partially independent mechanisms for managing interference in the two language domains, and raise questions regarding the degree to which domain general control abilities are recruited for managing L1 interference.",Bilingualism; Interference; Cognitive control

One way that linguistic injustice might occur is if gatekeepers (e.g., peer reviewers and editors) judge the scholarly quality of academic writing more harshly if the writing does not meet expectations for international academic English, even if the content is good. We tested this with a randomized control study in which scholars judged the scientific quality of several scientific abstracts. Each abstract had two versions with identical scientific content, such that the language in one version conformed to standards for international academic English, and the language in the other version did not (but was still comprehensible). While the data are preliminary and the effects statistically inconclusive, both pre-registered and exploratory analyses of the data suggest that scholars may give abstracts lower ratings of scientific quality when the writing does not conform to standards of international academic English.

All participants (7 males, 4 females) were administered individual intelligence tests (Wechsler or Leiter scales or both), a measure of their academic skill levels (Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement), and a screening measure of visual-motor integration ability (Beery-Buktenica). Consistent with our earlier findings, median IQ scores for the entire group on the Wechsler (median=84) and Leiter (median=92) scales continue to fall at the lower end of the average range compared to same-aged peers. The median scores for the group on a measure of visual-motor integration (median=76), visual perception (median=74) and motor coordination (median=60) were below average. Two distinct subgroups emerged based on participants' average or below average performance on the majority of academic subtests. Those participants with below average academic skills (n=6) demonstrated average nonverbal cognitive abilities on the Leiter, but had weaknesses in speech and language skills and greater medical involvement. Their profiles were more consistent with a learning disability diagnosis than an intellectual disability. Two of these participants showed a significant decline (15 and 23 points, respectively) on repeated Wechsler scales, but one continued to earn average scores on the Leiter scales where the verbal and motor demands are minimal. Participants with average academic skills (n=5) demonstrated average cognitive abilities (verbal and nonverbal) on the Wechsler scales and less medical involvement. Their speech and language skills appeared to be more intact. However, both groups earned below average median scores on the Beery-Buktenica motor coordination task. This study highlights the importance of using appropriate tests to capture both verbal and nonverbal abilities, considering each individual's motor skills, speech and language abilities, hearing status and native language. This will allow for a more accurate assessment of whether there is a learning disability or an intellectual disability. Long-term outcomes may be related to the stability of an individual's expressive and/or receptive language abilities over time. Changes in the speech and language domain may account for the decline in IQ observed in some IOPD long-term survivors, reflecting a learning disability rather than a decline in overall cognition or an intellectual disability. These observations, in conjunction with neuroimaging, will further our understanding of the neurocognitive profile of long-term IOPD survivors.",Infantile-onset Pompe; Cognitive; Academic; Visual-motor integration

Both theoretical models and behavioral studies have suggested that simultaneous visual processing of all the letters of a word could be important for the acquisition of its orthographic form. Main goal Two experiments are conducted to test this whole-word visual processing hypothesis. Method The paradigm used in both experiments is a self-teaching paradigm in which adult participants had to read orthographically complex bisyllabic pseudowords in isolation. In one reading condition, all the letters of the item are available at once, in the other the first and second syllables are seen successively. After reading, participants had to spell under dictation and to recognize the written items. Results Globally, the results showed that participants better recall the orthographic form of a word after having read it in the whole-word reading condition. The result of the recognition task, in the second experiment, was in line with the result of the spelling under dictation task. Conclusion These results, although they should be interpreted with caution, are in line with the whole-word visual processing hypothesis. Applied consequences for orthographic learning and teaching, as for remediation of specific orthographic disabilities, are discussed.

Des modèles théoriques et des études comportementales suggèrent que le traitement visuel simultané de toutes les lettres d’un mot serait important pour la mémorisation de son orthographe. Objectif principal Deux expériences ont été conduites pour tester cette hypothèse de l’importance du traitement visuel mot-entier. Méthode Le paradigme utilisé est un paradigme d’auto-apprentissage dans lequel les participants adultes doivent lire des mots bisyllabiques complexes présentés isolément. Dans une condition de lecture, toutes les lettres de l’item sont vues en même temps, dans l’autre les deux syllabes de l’item sont présentées successivement. Après la lecture, les participants doivent écrire les items sous la dictée, puis les reconnaître à l’écrit. Résultats Globalement, les résultats montrent que les participants retrouvent mieux l’orthographe d’un item après l’avoir lu dans la condition de lecture mot-entier. Le résultat de la tâche de reconnaissance, dans la seconde expérience, est en accord avec le résultat de la tâche de dictée. Conclusion Ces résultats, bien que devant être interprétés avec précaution, sont en accord avec l’hypothèse du traitement visuel mot-entier. Les conséquences appliquées de cette hypothèse sont discutées, pour l’apprentissage et l’enseignement de l’orthographe comme pour la remédiation aux troubles spécifiques d’acquisition de l’orthographe.",Self-teaching; Spelling; Reading; Whole-word visual processing; Adults; Auto-apprentissage; Orthographe; Lecture; Traitement visuel simultané; Adultes

All of the deaf groups lacking mental state language tended to perform worse than the hearing group on explicit mental state understanding. Deaf groups with either vocabulary skill or interpersonal experience from early years were similar to the hearing group in implicit mental state reasoning. Individuals frequently using syntactic complements or having interpersonal experience with hearing people from early years tended to use ToM better. Moreover, language ability was the only predictor for explicit rather than implicit mental state understanding. Sufficient language is not necessary for all aspects of advanced ToM.

Research, however, has yet to examine the implementation of reclassification policies specific to ELs with disabilities. This ethnographic study at two middle schools investigated the local implementation of one state's policy that aimed to promote ELs with disabilities’ reclassification. The findings indicate that although the policy increased reclassification rates for ELs with disabilities, both the policy itself and its implementation introduced new inequities. As a consequence, educators held two competing views of the policy and its implementation, with some lauding its promotion of equity, while others arguing that it functioned as mechanism for discrimination. These findings have implications for implementing reclassification policies that are both responsive to ELs with disabilities and data-based.",Reclassification policies; English learners with disabilities

In 2014, Strand and colleagues reported high to excellent intra- and interjudge reliability of the Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale (ASRS) in neurodegenerative speech and language disorders. Excellent interjudge reliability of the ASRS total score has also recently been reported in another study of individuals with chronic AOS after stroke, where the ratings were carried out by two experienced researchers not involved in the development of the instrument. However, it is still not fully determined whether the ASRS is a reliable instrument in assessment of patients in an early phase after stroke, where severe AOS is not uncommon. It is also not determined whether ASRS ratings can be performed reliably by practicing speech-language pathologists (SLPs) without long common experience and joint training. This study therefore addresses these questions. Method The ASRS was administered to thirty-six individuals in the first six months after stroke. The assessment procedures were video recorded. Ten of the recordings were selected for the reliability study, representative of patients typically seen at the actual inpatient ward with varying degrees of AOS severity. Five SLPs from different hospital departments participated as raters. The raters viewed each video and independently rated the presence and severity of AOS using the ASRS. To study intrajudge reliability, a rescoring was performed after a minimum of three weeks. Reliability was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results Intrajudge agreement for the ASRS total score varied from moderate to excellent (mean ICC = 0.69, 95 % CI [0.60, 0.77]) with most of the mean item level agreements within the categories ‘moderate’ or ‘good. Interjudge reliability was poor for the ASRS total score (ICC = 0.42, 95 % CI [0.35, 0.50]). The item level results varied between moderate and poor, with lack of agreement on several items. Conclusions For clinicians without expert knowledge of AOS and limited training using the ASRS, intra- and interjudge reliability of the ASRS is not satisfactory. Also, since some items in the protocol require a certain level of speech production to target the diagnostic marker, findings indicate that the ASRS in its present design has limitations in assessment of severe AOS. As suggested by Strand and colleagues, video examples that illustrate the ASRS characteristics could be one helpful alternative to support clinician training. A minor revision of response definitions of the scale may improve the applicability of the ASRS in severe AOS.",Apraxia of speech assessment reliability stroke

The present study examined intra- and inter-rater reliability for percent syllables stuttered (%SS), stuttering severity (SEV), syllables per minute (SPM), and speech naturalness (NAT) when English-speaking judges viewed speech samples in English and in a language with which they had no or minimal familiarity (Spanish). Over two time periods, 21 judges viewed eight videos of four bilingual persons who stutter. Data were analyzed for relative and absolute intra- and inter-rater reliability as well as for an effect of language on time period differences. Intra- and inter-rater relative reliability were good or excellent for all measures in both languages, with the exception of inter-rater relative reliability for NAT in both languages and %SS in Spanish. Intra-rater absolute reliability was acceptable in both languages for NAT and SEV and unacceptable in both for SPM and %SS. Inter-rater absolute reliability in both languages was unacceptable for all measures, even with judges with the same training. There was a clinically significant effect of language on %SS scores, but, despite a statistically significant effect of language for SPM and SEV, the differences were not clinically significant. Results indicate that reliability across and within languages varies by measure and is impacted by intra- vs. inter-rater reliability, relative vs. absolute reliability, and language familiarity. Modifications in training may be able to address some of the limitations found, particularly with regard to SPM and NAT.",Stuttering; Bilingual; Reliability

A systematic review 2014–18,article,Computers & Education,ScienceDirect,"In recent years, hopes that Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) would make access to education fairer faded in the light of research showing MOOCs favoured the already educated and relatively advantaged. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of literature from 2014 to 2018. The aim was to investigate the extent that MOOCs and other free open education programs provide equitable forms of online education to address global widening participation agendas. The literature fell into two main groups: empirical reports on outcomes for students, and those providing policy or practitioner guidance. A globally diverse set of 46 studies and reports were examined, including 24 empirical evaluations of programs reaching over 440,000 disadvantaged learners in both distance and blended learning settings. Most literature claimed an interest in advancing student equity (enrolled or tertiary preparation learners) and/or social inclusion (community learners) with low-skills, low confidence, and/or low levels of previous education. In contrast to the existing literature, this study found that there was a flourishing of multi-lingual and Languages other than English (LOTE) programs and those addressing regional socio-economic disadvantage. Most cases involved MOOCs and free online resources combined with additional forms of support, including face-to-face study groups. Contrary to the existing debate in the open education literature, the review also found that the legal status of the learning materials (copyright or openly licenced) was of little consequence so long as it was free to the end user. What seemed to matter most was the intentional and collaborative design for disadvantaged cohorts, including the provision of digital or face-to-face personal support. Successful design collaborations often featured learner-centred, non-technical partnerships with community groups which increased the understanding of the needs of particular marginalised learners, while also providing more sustainable and distributed learner support. The review concludes that MOOCs which aim to widen participation in education are an alternative global practice that exists alongside more commercial MOOC offerings. Recommendations are provided for addressing gaps in offerings, and improving design and research.",open education; MOOC; widening participation; higher education; student equity

MedLine, CINAHL and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched to retrieve all relevant peer-reviewed articles published in English language journals. Despite the focus that has been placed on agrammatism by the consensus recommendations, the studies reviewed do not systematically report impairments of inflectional morphology in the non-fluent/agrammatic variant. Studies also show that some individuals with the logopenic variant present with substantial inflection impairments. Contrary to expectations, some studies reveal the presence of morphological difficulties in the semantic variant. These difficulties concern mostly the production of irregular, low-frequency verbs while regular verbs are spared. Similar difficulties are also reported in studies of people with Alzheimer's disease. Overall, the results show the need to more clearly define the criteria related to grammar and morphology and to better characterise impairment severity. Future research on primary progressive aphasia and other degenerative diseases with language impairments will help refine our expectations regarding language features that characterise each profile.",Systematic review; Primary progressive aphasia; Alzheimer's disease; Morphology; Inflection

One factor that could interfere with the listener’s perception of non-native speech is the speaker’s accent. The current study explored the relationship between how accurately listeners could understand non-native speech and their perceptions of personal attributes of the speaker. Additionally, this study investigated how listeners’ familiarity and experience with other languages may influence their perceptions of non-native accented speech. Methods Through an online survey, native monolingual and bilingual English listeners rated four non-native accents (i.e., Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and Indian) on perceived intelligibility and perceived personal qualities (i.e., professionalism, intelligence, resourcefulness, empathy, and patience) necessary for speech-language pathologists. Results The results indicated significant relationships between the perception of intelligibility and the perception of personal qualities (i.e., professionalism, intelligence, and resourcefulness) attributed to non-native speakers. However, these findings were not supported for the Chinese accent. Bilingual listeners judged the non-native speech as more intelligible in comparison to monolingual listeners. No significant differences were found in the ratings between bilingual listeners who share the same language background as the speaker and other bilingual listeners. Conclusions Based on the current findings, greater perception of intelligibility was the key to promoting a positive perception of personal qualities such as professionalism, intelligence, and resourcefulness, important for speech-language pathologists. The current study found evidence to support the claim that bilinguals have a greater ability in understanding non-native accented speech compared to monolingual listeners. The results, however, did not confirm an advantage for bilingual listeners sharing the same language backgrounds with the non-native speaker over other bilingual listeners.",Non-native accent; Perception of intelligibility; Perceived personal qualities; Speech perception; Familiarity; Monolingual; Bilingual; Russian accent; Spanish accent; Chinese accent; Indian accent; Native English speakers; Speech-language pathology

Design A qualitative study taking a constructivist approach to gain insight into participants’ experiences of health care provision. In depth interviews were used to explore the ways in which personal understandings and life experiences shaped the characteristics of the therapeutic encounter that participants identified as important. Data were analysed thematically. Setting A Northern city in England. Interviews took place in participant's homes or work places. Participants Eleven Pakistani parents and one grandparent from nine different families, all caring for children with learning disabilities. Findings The study identified features of the therapeutic encounter that were important to Pakistani parents and highlighted that there is nothing to suggest that these are different to those of the majority population. Conclusions The utility of the concept of cultural competence may be limited where it depends on concepts of ethnic groups as relatively fixed cultural groups with distinct and clearly defined sets of health beliefs and behaviours. Physiotherapists cannot prejudge health status and behaviours from an individual's ethnic status. Instead there is a need to actively seek the understandings that are relevant to practice. In addition health service providers must develop and operate systems that ensure access, use and quality of care are the same at the point of delivery regardless of patient ethnicity.",Cultural competence; Ethnicity; Pakistani; Physiotherapy; Qualitative

Low-proficiency L2 learners showed greater functional connectivity for correct and TOT responses between the left inferior frontal gyrus and right-sided homologues of the temporoparietal regions that support phonological processing (e.g., supramarginal gyrus), possibly reflecting difficulty with phonological retrieval. High-proficiency L2 learners showed greater connectivity for erroneous responses (TOT in particular) between the left inferior frontal gyrus and regions of left medial temporal lobe (e.g., hippocampus), associated with implicit learning processes.

Eighty typically developing Chinese children in the first and second grades in Taiwan were recruited, and various cognitive and literacy ability tasks were administered. The results revealed that knowledge of the PCS served as a significant moderator of the association between ATP and Chinese character reading, that is, the significant prediction from ATP to Chinese character reading was observed only in those with high knowledge of the PCS but not those with low knowledge of the PCS. Additionally, we further demonstrated diverse ability levels in phonological processing as it contributes to Chinese character reading among individuals with higher and lower knowledge of the PCS. Specifically, ATP as well as phonological awareness significantly predicted Chinese character reading for those with high knowledge of the PCS, while only verbal short-term memory served as a significant predictor of Chinese character reading for those with low knowledge of the PCS. Our results show that individuals with different levels of knowledge of the PCS may demonstrate different ability levels in phonological processing in their Chinese character reading, which suggests that the need for teaching approaches suited to students with diverse learning experiences should be acknowledged.",Auditory temporal processing; Knowledge of the phonological coding system; Phonological processing; Chinese reading

We investigated orthographic and semantic processing in resilient readers to examine mechanisms of compensation for poor phonological decoding. Performance on phonological (phoneme deletion, pseudoword reading), orthographic (orthographic choice, orthographic analogy), and semantic (semantic priming, homograph resolution) tasks was compared between resilient, poor and proficient readers. Asymmetry of the planum temporale was investigated in order to determine whether atypical readers showed unusual morphology in this language-relevant region. Resilient readers showed deficits on phonological tasks similar to those shown by poor readers. We obtained no evidence that resilient readers compensate via superior orthographic processing, as they showed neither exceptional orthographic skill nor increased reliance on orthography to guide pronunciation. Resilient readers benefited more than poor or proficient readers from semantic relationships between words and experienced greater difficulty when such relationships were not present. We suggest, therefore, that resilient readers compensate for poor phonological decoding via greater reliance on word meaning relationships. The reading groups did not differ in mean asymmetry of the planum temporale. However, resilient readers showed greater variability in planar asymmetry than proficient readers. Poor readers also showed a trend towards greater variability in planar asymmetry, with more poor readers than proficient readers showing extreme asymmetry. Such increased variability suggests that university students with less reading skill display less well regulated brain anatomy than proficient readers.",Adult; Compensation; Phonology; Reading comprehension; Orthography; Planum temporale

Malatesha Joshi,2019,Profile of hyperlexia: Reconciling conflicts through a systematic review and meta-analysis,article,Journal of Neurolinguistics,ScienceDirect,"It is believed that children with poor decoding skills and adequate listening comprehension skills exhibit a dyslexia-type syndrome. However, there is no consensus relating to the other problem that arises: children who have exceptional decoding but poor listening comprehension. Sometimes, these children have been labeled as “individuals exhibiting hyperlexia.” There is no clear understanding of the following aspects of hyperlexia: a) population criteria (e.g., typically vs. atypically developing children), b) specific criteria (e.g., precocity, definition of “good decoding”) on their associations with reading, and c) the applicability of reading theories to hyperlexia (e.g., phonemic awareness is critical in decoding; both decoding and listening comprehension contribute to reading comprehension). Therefore, we conducted a systematic and meta-analytic review to explore these questions. We found that despite good decoding and verbal short-term memory skills, individuals with hyperlexia exhibit poor listening, verbal working memory, and reading comprehension skills. Also, all but three studies identified hyperlexics from atypical developing populations; however, criteria to define “good decoding” varied and the onset of precocious decoding behavior was not consistently reported. Our meta-regression analysis suggests that decoding still predicted the performance of reading comprehension after controlling for listening comprehension, suggesting that the variations of defining “good decoding” led to different reading comprehension profiles (e.g., mild vs. severe reading comprehension deficit). Further, listening comprehension but not decoding is related to phonemic awareness, which may be due to the difficulty of understanding phonemic awareness tasks. However, it may also suggest that the current decoding theory is not applied to hyperlexia.

Among the features underpinning types of developmental dyscalculia suggested in the literature, an impairment in arithmetic fact retrieval is particularly prominent. In this paper, we present a case study of an adult woman (DB) with very good cognitive capacities suffering from a specific and developmental arithmetic fact retrieval deficit. We test the main hypotheses about developmental dyscalculia derived from literature. We first explore the influential hypothesis of an approximate number system deficit, through estimation tasks, comparison tasks and a priming comparison task. Secondly, we evaluate whether DB's mathematical deficiencies are caused by a rote verbal memory deficit, using tasks involving completion of expressions, and reciting automatic series such as the alphabet and the months of the year. Alternatively, taking into account the extreme similarity of the arithmetic facts, we propose that a heightened sensitivity to interference could have prevented DB from memorizing the arithmetic facts. The pattern of DB's results on different tasks supports this hypothesis. Our findings identify a new etiology of a specific impairment of arithmetic facts storage, namely a hypersensitivity-to-interference.",Mathematical disabilities; Multiplication; Approximate number system; Developmental dyscalculia; Numerical cognition

Slow rhythmic modulations in the linguistic stream (below 8Hz) mark syllable and word boundaries in the continuous linguistic stream, potentially helping children master the words and structures of their language. Converging evidence across language and reading research suggests that children's sensitivity to these slow rhythmic modulations is important for language and reading acquisition. In infancy, children produce rhythmically alternating syllables, or babbles, at a slow frequency of ~1.5Hz or 660ms (Petitto et al., 2001). In early grades, children's sensitivity to slow rhythmic modulations correlates with their reading ability (Goswami, 2011). We used functional Near Infrared (fNIRS) imaging to investigate the brain bases of “language rhythm” in beginning readers (ages 6–9). Right hemisphere showed an overall greater activation toward the slow rhythmic stimuli, and left hemisphere showed greater activation toward 1.5Hz, relative to faster and slower frequencies. The findings suggest that while right hemisphere might have an overall better ability to process rhythmic sensitivity, left hemisphere might have a select sensitivity to a preferred range of slow rhythmic modulations—a range that might be particularly salient to brain mechanisms responsible for cross-modal language processing and reading acquisition.",Language; Language acquisition; Reading acquisition; Dyslexia; Brain development; Near infrared imaging

Compared to speech, song has greater rhythmic regularity, a more stable fundamental frequency, discrete pitch movements, and a metrical structure, this may provide a temporal framework that helps listeners neurally track information better than the rhythmically irregular rhythms of speech. The current study used EEG to examine whether entrainment to the syllable rate of linguistic utterances, as indexed by cerebro-acoustic phase coherence, was greater when listeners heard sung than spoken sentences. We assessed listeners phase-locking in both easy (no time compression) and hard (50% time-compression) utterance conditions. Adults phase-locked equally well to speech and song in the easy listening condition. However, in the time-compressed condition, phase-locking was greater for sung than spoken utterances in the theta band (3.67–5 ​Hz). Thus, the musical temporal and spectral characteristics of song related to better phase-locking to the slow phrasal and syllable information (4–7 ​Hz) in the speech stream.

Increased rigor/accountability standards in kindergarten may push parents to delay their child’s entry into school, known as “academic redshirting.” Current estimates suggest that 3–7% of students delay kindergarten entry in the US and that this is more common among high-SES families. The current project examined prevalence, predictors, and selection patterns of academic redshirting among a large, ethnically and linguistically diverse preschool sample (n = 30,967; 57.5% Latino, 34.7% Black, 7.8% White/Other) that was prospectively followed into kindergarten. Overall, delayed kindergarten entry was rare in this low-income sample—only 305 (1%) students entered kindergarten a year later than their age eligibility. Bivariate tests indicated that boys, native English speakers, students in poverty, younger students, and students who attended center-based childcare were more likely to delay entry than their peers. Further, delayed-entry students had poorer preschool cognitive, language, fine motor, and social/behavioral skills, on average, than those who entered on time. After including all variables in a logistic regression, demographic associations changed, suggesting that White children were more likely than their minority peers to delay entry, and that there were no differences by poverty status. After accounting for school readiness variables, gender associations disappeared, suggesting that boys may be more likely to delay entry due to poorer school readiness skills. We also examined evidence for positive and negative selection into kindergarten entry and found that most students in our predominantly low-income sample were negatively selected (i.e., had poorer school readiness skills prior to delayed entry).",Delayed entry; Redshirting; Kindergarten; Transition to school; School readiness

DO80 revisited,article,Neuropsychologia,ScienceDirect,"How do we choose words, and what affects the selection of a specific term? Naming tests such as the DO80 are frequently used to assess language function during brain mapping in awake surgery. The present study aimed to explore whether specific semantic errors become more probable under the stimulation of specific brain areas. Moreover, it meant to determine whether specific semantic characteristics of the items may evoke specific types of error. A corpus-based qualitative semantic analysis of the DO80 items, and the emitted naming errors to those items during direct cortical electrostimulation (DCE) revealed that the number of hyperonyms (i.e. 'vehicle' for car') of an item predicted the emission of a synonym ('automobile' for 'car'). This association occurred mainly in frontal tumor patients, which was corroborated by behavior to lesion analyses. In contrast, the emission of co-hyponyms was associated with tumors located in temporal areas. These two behavior-lesion associations thus dissociated, and were also dependent on item semantic characteristics. Co-hyponym errors might generate from the disruption in a temporal semantic-to-lexical process, and the production of synonyms could be the result of an impairment in a frontal lexical-selection mechanism. A hypothesis on the lexical selection mechanisms exerted by the inferior frontal gyrus is proposed. Crucially, the present data suggest the need for more restrictive naming tasks, with items conditioned by tumor location.",Direct current electrostimulation; Awake brain surgery; Lexical retrieval; Naming; Inferior frontal gyrus (IFG); Middle temporal gyrus (MTG)

With this earlier detection, arises the need for tools fit for assessing the very early speech and language production development of today's younger (0–18 month old) children. We have created the LittlEARS® Early Speech Production Questionnaire, with the aim of meeting this need. Methods 600 questionnaires of the pilot version of the LittlEARS® Early Speech Production Questionnaire were distributed to parents via pediatricians' practices, day care centers, and personal contact. The completed questionnaires were statistically analyzed to determine their reliability, predictive accuracy, internal consistency, and to what extent gender or unilingualism influenced a child's score. Further, a norm curve was generated to plot the children's increased expected speech production ability with age. Results Analysis of the data from the 352/600 returned questionnaires revealed that scores on LittlEARS® Early Speech Production Questionnaire correlate positively with a child's age, with older children scoring higher than do younger children. Further, the questionnaire has a high measuring reliability, high predictability, high unidemensionality of scale, and is not significantly gender or uni-/multilingually biased. A norm curve for expected development with age was created. Conclusions The LittlEARS® Early Speech Production Questionnaire (LEESPQ) is a valid tool for assessing the most important milestones in very early development of speech and language production of German language children with normal hearing aged 0–18 months old.

Ferreira and David Vinson and Ton Dijkstra and Gabriella Vigliocco,2021,Word learning in two languages: Neural overlap and representational differences,article,Neuropsychologia,ScienceDirect,"We investigated the neural basis of newly learned words in Spanish as a mother tongue (L1) and English as a second language (L2). Participants acquired new names for real but unfamiliar concepts in both languages over the course of two days. On day 3, they completed a semantic categorization task during fMRI scanning. The results revealed largely overlapping brain regions for newly learned words in Spanish and English. However, Spanish showed a heightened BOLD response within prefrontal cortex (PFC), due to increased competition of existing lexical representations. In contrast, English displayed higher activity than Spanish within primary auditory cortex, which suggests increased phonological processing due to more irregular phonological-orthographic mappings. Overall, these results suggest that novel words are learned similarly in Spanish L1 and English L2, and that they are represented in largely overlapping brain regions. However, they differ in terms of cognitive control and phonological processes.",Word learning; Second language acquisition; Bilingualism; fMRI; Prefrontal cortex

However, very few studies have been done to compare functional connectivity in L1 and L2 reading. Brain activation and functional connectivity during English pseudoword rhyming judgment in a group of late Chinese–English bilinguals (the CE group) were compared to a Chinese word rhyming judgment task in another group of late Chinese–English bilinguals (the CC group). Brain activation analyses revealed that the two groups engaged a similar network and that the only significant group difference was greater involvement of the right middle occipital gyrus in the CC group than in the CE group, due to greater holistic visuospatial processing of Chinese characters. English pseudowords can be read using the same network as Chinese characters, whereas psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses revealed different connectivity within the reading network between the two groups. Greater functional connectivity was found between three visuo-orthographic seed regions and the right precentral gyrus in the CC group, suggesting that the sensorimotor patterns of Chinese syllables are activated during Chinese word rhyming judgment. In contrast, we found greater connectivity between the three seed regions and the left postcentral gyrus in the CE group. In addition, the connectivity between one of the three seed regions (i.e. the right middle occipital gyrus) and the left postcentral gyrus was positively correlated with English proficiency in the CE group. This suggests that somatosensory feedback plays a key role in processing the foreign phonemes of English pseudowords and those highly proficient bilinguals tend to rely on this information to a greater degree. We also found that within the CE group, the connectivity between the right middle occipital gyrus and the left inferior parietal lobule was positively correlated with accuracy, and that the connectivity between the right middle occipital gyrus and the left superior temporal gyrus was negatively correlated with reaction time. These results suggest that even if a Chinese network is used in reading English pseudowords, the classic grapheme–phoneme-correspondence regions that are important for native English reading are involved in highly performing bilinguals by connecting them with the visuo-orthographic region.",Pseudoword; Bilingual; Functional connectivity; fMRI

The current treatment paradigm for neonatal brachial plexus palsy focuses on upper extremity motor recovery with little formal assessment of other aspects of development, such as language. We performed a cross-sectional pilot study to investigate early language delay prevalence in toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy and potential neonatal brachial plexus palsy–related factors involved. Method Twenty toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy were consecutively recruited (12 males and eight females; mean age, 30 months). Preschool Language Scale Score (4th edition), demographics, and socioeconomic status were collected. Neonatal brachial plexus palsy–related factors such as palsy side, treatment type, Narakas grade, muscle Medical Research Council score, and Raimondi hand score were reported. Student t test, chi-square test, or Fisher exact test were applied. Statistical significance level was established at P < 0.05. Results Of study participants, 30% had language delay, whereas the prevalence of language delay in the population with normal development in this age range was approximately 5-15%. Interpretation We observed high language delay prevalence among toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy. Although our subject sample is small, our findings warrant further study of this phenomenon. Early identification and timely intervention based on type of language impairment may be critical for improving communication outcome in this population.",brachial plexus injury; brachial plexus palsy; language delay; neonate

The aim of the present study was to describe the developmental characteristics of 129 1–4-year-old children (102 boys, 27 girls) referred for clinical assessment (mean age 2.9 years) due to suspicion of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) after community screening at Child Health Care centers. All children were clinically assessed at the Child Neuropsychiatry Clinic (CNC) in Gothenburg by a research team (neurodevelopmental examination, structured interviews and general cognitive and language examinations). Of the 129 children, 100 met diagnostic criteria for ASD (69 with autistic disorder, and 31 with atypical autism/pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified). The remaining 29 children had a variety of developmental disorders, most often attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), language disorder, borderline intellectual functioning, and intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) with (n=25) or without (n=4) autistic traits (AT). IDD was found in 36% of the 100 children with ASD, and in 4% of the 25 children with AT. Of the children with ASD, 56% had language disorder with no or just a few words at the initial assessment at the CNC, many of whom in combination with IDD. Hyperactivity was found in 37% of those with ASD and in 40% of those with AT. Epilepsy was found in 6% of the total group and in 7% of those with a diagnosis of ASD. Of the latter group 11% had a history of regression, while none of the AT cases had a similar background. When results were compared with a non-screened preschool ASD group of 208 children, referred for ASD intervention at a mean age of 3.4 years, very similar developmental profiles were seen. In conclusion, early community ASD screening appears to systematically identify those children who are in need of intervention and follow-up.",Autism spectrum disorder; Preschool community study; Developmental disorder; Cognitive function; ESSENCE; Comorbidity

However, it is unclear whether false memories that are rooted in semantic versus surface resemblance obey the same laws. The Deese/Roediger/McDermott (DRM) illusion offers an attractive testbed for comparing semantic and surface false memories under closely matched conditions, owing to parallel semantic and phonological versions of the illusion. We review three lines of evidence in which semantic and phonological DRM illusions have been compared: (a) studies in which the two illusions were tracked in populations with different semantic or surface memory abilities; (b) studies that investigated the effects of manipulations that target semantic content or surface content or both; and (c) studies that examined hybrid forms of the illusion in which there was both semantic and surface resemblance between false memories and actual experiences. The three lines of evidence showed that semantic and phonological DRM illusions display dissociative patterns in most instances, indicating that they are two distinct types of false memories. The two major theories of the DRM illusion, fuzzy-trace theory and the activation/monitoring framework, have different views of the underlying mechanisms for the semantic and phonological illusions.

While several tangible reading systems have been developed for children, few systems have been designed that explicitly target the first stage of reading where many children struggle, which is the alphabetic principle (letter-sound correspondences). We present a tangible reading system called PhonoBlocks that supports children learning English letter-sound correspondences. PhonoBlocks uses 3D tangible letters that change colour to draw attention to the moment that adding other letters changes the sounds. We then present a mixed-methods case study with ten Mandarin-speaking children in China using our system. Results showed that the Chinese children achieved significant learning gains relative to their baseline performance after PhonoBlocks instruction. The results also point to design features of our system that enabled behaviours that are correlated with learning. We compare the results of this study to a different study with eight at-risk monolingual English-speaking children in Canada using PhonoBlocks in learning to read and spell. By comparing results, we generalize and make three recommendations for designing tangible reading systems for all children who must learn the alphabetic principle.

The Latinx population represents the fastest growing minority population in the United States and a growing percentage of children seeking ASD intervention services. Aims Identify factors that impact Latinx parent involvement in interventions for children with ASD as an example of cultural considerations for diverse families and communities. Methods and procedures In this conceptual overview, we synthesize literature on cultural considerations for intervention design/adaptation for Latinx families and parent involvement in interventions for children with ASD through the lens of the Ecological Validity Model. Outcomes and results Frameworks such as the Ecological Validity Model can be used when creating or adapting interventions for specific cultural groups. Parent-involved interventions for children with ASD in the Latinx community should consider language of intervention delivery, family make-up, community support, disability knowledge of the family, the therapeutic alliance, and methods of implementation. Conclusions and implications Incorporating cultural components into parent-involved interventions will best support intervention implementation and dissemination in diverse communities.

Short-term memory was found to be involved in and affect phonemic manipulations at all grade levels: the longer the manipulated stimulus, the poorer the performance. The finding is in line with the ""transparency-by-modularity"" interaction, and suggests that Arabic is a ""semi-modular"" language in contrast to highly modular Hebrew.

The present study proposes a long-term training program to improve syntax processing in children with cochlear implants, a population showing syntax processing deficits in perception and production. Methods The training program consisted of morphosyntactic training exercises (based on speech processing) that were primed by musical regular primes (8 sessions) or neutral baseline primes (environmental sounds) (8 sessions). A crossover design was used to train 10 deaf children with cochlear implants. Performance in grammatical processing, non-word repetition, attention and memory was assessed before and after training. Results Training increased performance for syntax comprehension after both prime types but for grammaticality judgements and non-word repetition only when musical primes were used during training. For the far-transfer tests, some effects were also observed for attention tasks, especially if fast and precise sequential analysis (sequencing) was required, but not for memory tasks. Conclusions The findings extend the previously observed beneficial short-term effects of regular musical primes in the laboratory to long-term training effects. Results suggest that the musical primes improved the processing of the syntactic training material, thus enhancing the training effects on grammatical processing as well as phonological processing and sequencing of speech signals. The findings can be interpreted within the dynamic attending theory (postulating the modulation of attention over time) and associated oscillatory brain activity. Furthermore, the findings encourage the use of rhythmic structures (even in non-verbal materials) in language training programs and outline perspectives for rehabilitation.",Rhythm; Music; Syntax; Cochlear implant; Temporal attention; Rehabilitation

Overall, Singaporean kindergartners, nearly all of whom were bilingual, scored higher on English writing but lower on English oral language skills than U.S. norms. Despite literacy instruction that emphasized whole-word memorization, phonological awareness statistically significantly predicted English writing scores, controlling for English vocabulary, ethnicity, sex, and an interaction between English vocabulary and sex. The current study's findings highlight the possibility of developing high literacy skills among bilingual learners with low oral language skills. In addition, the study demonstrates children's development of phonological awareness in the absence of phonological awareness or phonics instruction and supports the theory that both alphabetic (phonological) processes and logographic (whole-word) processes contribute to successful English literacy achievement.",Bilingualism; Phonological awareness; Vocabulary; Literacy; Second language acquisition; English language learners

The auditory efferent system has two main segments: the rostral and the caudal parts. The rostral part, which starts from the cortical centers to thalamic nuclei and continues into collicular pathways in rostral brainstem, which sends its neural fibers to the main collicular nuclei especially inferior colliculus. The caudal part includes the olivocochlear bundle, which originates from the superior olivary complex and terminates on the cochlear hair cells. Most studies about the auditory efferent system have focused only on the caudal part using otoacoustic emission suppression test. Speech-evoked auditory brainstem response (S-ABR) as an electrophysiologic test that uses speech stimuli to simulate real-life auditory conditions, reflects the performance of rostral brainstem centers, so structurally seems to be an appropriate candidate to examine the rostral part of the auditory efferent system. Our hypothesis is that S-ABR in noisy condition, a typical condition for stimulating the auditory efferent system, has the potential to be used as an objective noninvasive electrophysiologic test for studying the rostral auditory efferent system in diagnosis and treatment/rehabilitation follow-ups. In addition, S-ABR can potentially reflect higher-order auditory functions and the effects of their dysfunctions on the lower brainstem. This characteristic makes S-ABR even more suitable tool for evaluation of the efferent system. To evaluate our hypothesis, Eighteen normal hearing subjects in the age range of 18–25 were tested in a pilot study for S-ABR in quiet mode and three signal to noise ratios of +10,0 and −10 for both ears. Then we checked the correlation between the results of S-ABR in different conditions and scores of auditory behavioral tests that auditory efferent system is involved in them: Consonant-Vowel perception in noise, dichotic Consonant-Vowel-Consonant and sound lateralization in noise. The results of our pilot study showed a significant correlation between S-ABR changes in noise with the scores of the behavioral tests in noisy or dichotic situations. Findings of the current study suggest that S-ABR with specific contralateral noise can be an appropriate option for evaluating the performance of rostral part of the auditory efferent system and may be suitable for top-down auditory training follow-ups, although the generalization of these results needs further studies in different groups with different auditory processing abnormalities or skills.",Speech evoked auditory brainstem response; Auditory efferent system; Speech in noise; Dichotic; Lateralization

An fMRI study of Korean–Chinese–English trilinguals,article,NeuroImage,ScienceDirect,"The present study tested the hypothesis that language distance between first language (L1) and second language (L2) influences the assimilation and accommodation pattern in Korean–Chinese–English trilinguals. The distance between English and Korean is smaller than that between Chinese and Korean in terms of orthographic transparency, because both English and Korean are alphabetic, whereas Chinese is logographic. During fMRI, Korean trilingual participants performed a visual rhyming judgment task in three languages (Korean: KK, Chinese: KC, English: KE). Two L1 control groups were native Chinese and English speakers performing the task in their native languages (CC and EE, respectively). The general pattern of brain activation of KC was more similar to that of CC than KK, suggesting accommodation. Higher accuracy in KC was associated with decreased activation in regions of the KK network, suggesting reduced assimilation. In contrast, the brain activation of KE was more similar to that of KK than EE, suggesting assimilation. Higher accuracy in KE was associated with decreased activation in regions of the EE network, suggesting reduced accommodation. Finally, an ROI analysis on the left middle frontal gyrus revealed greater activation for KC than for KE, suggesting its selective involvement in the L2 with more arbitrary mapping between orthography and phonology (i.e., Chinese). Taken together, the brain network involved in L2 reading is similar to the L1 network when L2 and L1 are similar in orthographic transparency, while significant accommodation is expected when L2 is more opaque than L1.",Bilingualism/multilingualism; Assimilation; Accommodation; fMRI; Orthographic transparency

Many traditional citation recommendation models use keywords to describe item attributes and ignore the semantics of sequences, which cause the relevance of the search results unsatisfactory. This paper proposes a deep-learning-based dual encoder retrieval (DER) model, which combines a text representation technique and a sentence pair matching approach, to improve the performance of citation recommendation. First, an input query and paper titles from publication databases are encoded to semantic vectors separately by two deep-learning-based encoders. Second, the semantic vector of the input query is matched with vectors that representing papers in the published databases by the multilayer perceptron approach to compute similarity scores. Finally, a list of documents, which are sorted in descending order of similarity scores, is generated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is compared with five baselines using a citation dataset. The results show that the proposed model achieves the best performance in terms of accuracy, recall, F1-measure, and AUC. In addition, we compare the DER (Glove) model with Google Scholar using a small example of twenty articles.

Study design Five-year-old children (n = 55) with complex CHD were assessed using standardized and comprehensive neuropsychological measures. Stability of language and cognitive performance was assessed by comparing standardized scores between ages 1, 2, and 5 years old. Association between 5-year-old skills and scores obtained in early childhood was studied to identify potential early markers of preschool performance. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the classification accuracy of Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition scales in identifying later impairments. Results At age 5 years, our cohort obtained scores significantly below the norms on most developmental domains, with 35% to 65% of participants showing impaired short-term/working memory, attention, and preacademic skills. Developmental patterns measured between ages 1 and 5 years were different for cognitive and language domains, with a decline with age for cognitive functioning and stable results for expressive language. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition language scores at age 2 years provided a good predictive value in identifying children with impaired language at age 5 years. Conclusions In our cohort, we found a high prevalence of impairments affecting higher-order cognitive domains.

There are factors, such as low productivity and opacity, which make derived words difficult to understand. Those and the deep structure of opaque derived words need further investigation (Gayatri, 2013, Serrano-Dolader, 2006). The goal of this study is to develop a scale of opacity along a continuum based on the number of changes to the lemma when the suffix is applied. Each of these changes was measured over a corpus of 550 derived words with productive Spanish suffixes (DRAE, 2001). 130 native Spanish high-school students and a small group of advanced non-native college students of Spanish were tested on the scale. Results reveal the usefulness of the scale to assess processing and reading difficulties in Spanish. Validation results indicate that all participants react in a similar way when facing basic morphological decisions.",Spanish linguistics; derivational morphology; opacity; productivity; first language acquisition; second language acquisition.

In doing so, a compassionate and positive narrative about deafness and deaf children is offered, one that relies on recent research evidence regarding the critical nature of early exposure to a fully accessible visual language, which in the United States is American Sign Language (ASL). This evidence includes the role of sign language in language acquisition, cognitive development, and literacy. In order for parents to provide a nurturing and anxiety-free environment for early childhood development, signing at home is important even if their child also has the additional nurturing and care of a signing community. It is not just the early years of a child's life that matter for language acquisition; it's the early months, the early weeks, even the early days. Deaf children cannot wait for accessible language input. The whole family must learn simultaneously as the deaf child learns. Even moderate fluency on the part of the family benefits the child enormously. And learning the sign language together can be one of the strongest bonding experiences that the family and deaf child have.",Deaf children; Sign language; Sensitive period for first language acquisition; Linguistic deprivation; Cognitive development; Family well-being

Brownlie and Lin Bao,2014,Age 31 Mental Health Outcomes of Childhood Language and Speech Disorders,article,Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,ScienceDirect,"Objective Language disorders are associated with emotional and behavioral problems in childhood and adolescence. Although clinical studies with small samples suggest that psychosocial difficulties continue into adulthood, adult mental health outcomes of childhood language disorders are not well known. The objective of this prospective longitudinal study is to determine whether the age 31 mental health outcomes of individuals who had childhood language disorders differ from the outcomes of typically developing controls. Method A 26-year cohort study followed up children with language or speech disorders from age 5 to age 31. The children were selected from a 1-in-3 random sample of 5-year-olds using a 3-stage screening and assessment process. A control group matched by sex, age, and classroom or school was also selected. Diagnoses were assigned with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview with the additional criterion that Global Assessment of Functioning scores indicated at least mild impairment. Dimensional psychosocial self-report measures were also administered. Results Rates of diagnosis at age 31 years were equivalent between participants who had childhood language disorders and controls, with and without multiple imputation to estimate missing outcomes. Differences in rates of affective and substance use disorders could not be ruled out because of attrition in the cohort with language disorders, who were less likely to participate at age 31. Psychosocial scores for both cohorts were in the normal range. The cohort with language disorders had poorer self-rated physical health than controls.

This study tests an emerging theoretical view that the same faculty underpins post-pubertal second language (L2) pronunciation learning. A total of 100 late Polish-English bilinguals in the UK with diverse age and experience backgrounds were assessed for their ability to represent various characteristics of sounds via behavioural and neurophysiological measures. Subsequently, the participants’ biographical backgrounds and auditory processing profiles were compared to various dimensions of their L2 pronunciation proficiency. According to the results of mixed-effects modeling analyses, individual differences in participants’ L2 pronunciation proficiency were equally accounted for by age (age of arrival), experience (length of residence), and auditory processing (encoding, reproduction). Within the current dataset, the degree of auditory precision was negatively associated with participants’ chronological age (19–45 years). The findings suggest that earlier age of onset may allow them to take advantage of more precise auditory processing, which in turn helps them to make the most of every input opportunity throughout extensive immersion experience, leading to more advanced L2 phonological skills in the long run.",Auditory processing; Second language; Speech production; Age; Experience

We compared the masking effects of babble generated in the listeners’ L1 (French), their L2 (Italian), or an unknown language (Irish) to the masking effects of corresponding fluctuating noise. The fluctuating noise contained spectro-temporal information similar to babble but lacked linguistic information. This design allowed us to compare lexical decision times obtained with the 2 kinds of background noise in each language and thus to assess the linguistic interference caused by babble. Results revealed that babble spoken in the known languages (French and Italian) produced both linguistic and acoustic interference and that babble spoken in the unknown language (Irish) produced acoustic interference only. Furthermore, the L1-French L2-Italian listeners were more strongly affected by the L2 babble than by the L1 babble.",Speech perception; Multilingualism; Speech-in-noise; Speech-in-speech perception; Multi-linguistic babble; Lexical access

These observations inform influential models of bilingual processing, which propose autonomous lexicons with different processing routes. In a series of experiments, we explored an alternative hypothesis that the asymmetries are due to frequency of use. Using a within-language ‘translation’ task, involving high/low frequency (HF/LF) synonyms, we obtained parallel results to bilingual studies. Experiment 1 revealed that HF synonyms were accessed faster than LF ones. Experiment 2 showed that semantic blocking slowed retrieval only of LF synonyms, while form blocking produced powerful interference of both HF and LF words. Experiment 3 examined translation speed and sensitivity to blocking in two groups of Russian-English bilinguals who differed in frequency of use of their languages.

Most of the previous assistive technologies use prefix based predictive text input algorithms. Prefix based predictive text entry is suitable for languages such as English where the average word length is approximately 5 characters. Other languages such as Norwegian and German have longer mean word lengths as words are combined into longer compound words and prefix approaches are thus less effective. This paper proposes a new abbreviation expansion algorithm. Users mentally determine an abbreviation of the word, typically comprising significant consonants and the system proposes words that contain the matched characters. The approach is non disruptive in that it does not require the user to learn a new system or abbreviation mnemonics, and it can be used with any text input device. The system is dynamic and adapts to the users style of abbreviated input. The algorithm is easier to implement than previous approaches and no a priori system training is required. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the algorithm achieves real time performance with modest computer hardware.",text input; low physical effort; ALS; dyslexia; abbreviation expansion; longest common subsequence

Methods The outcomes of 58 children with profound hearing loss and normal non-verbal cognition, after 60 months of CI use have been analyzed. At testing the children were enrolled in three different educational settings; in mainstream education, where spoken language is used or in hard-of-hearing education where sign supported spoken language is used and in bilingual deaf education, with Sign Language of the Netherlands and Sign Supported Dutch. Children were assessed on auditory speech perception, receptive language, educational attainment and wellbeing. Results Auditory speech perception of children with CI in mainstream education enable them to acquire language and educational levels that are comparable to those of their normal hearing peers. Although the children in mainstream and hard-of-hearing settings show similar speech perception abilities, language development in children in hard-of-hearing settings lags significantly behind. Speech perception, language and educational attainments of children in deaf education remained extremely poor. Furthermore more children in mainstream and hard-of-hearing environments are resilient than in deaf educational settings. Regression analyses showed an important influence of educational setting. Conclusions Children with CI who are placed in early intervention environments that facilitate auditory development are able to achieve good auditory speech perception, language and educational levels on the long term.

Considering the lack of studies in the field of grammar treatment in CI children and bearing in the mind that CI children have the potential to develop language, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of treating grammar in CI children using a treatment grammar program. Methodology first, the literature related to grammar were reviewed so as to extract different grammatical components for developing grammar treatment program and to make sentences for each element as well as to compile a manual for its implementation. Second, the validity of the sentences was examined using the Delphi method. Third, grammar treatment was performed on five CI children. Persian Developmental Sentence Scoring(PDSS) and Mean Length of Utterance(MLU) were used to evaluate them before and after treatment. Results Five grammatical classes were extracted, and the grammatical elements were classified in each category according to age. For all of the grammatical items, 2076 sentences were constructed. After applying the Delphi method, a total of 1936 sentences with Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W) of 71%, remained. Using this program, grammar treatment was effective in all five children. The PDSS and MLU increased in all five children during the treatment phase, which was confirmed by Percentage of Non-overlapping Data (PND), Improvement Rate Difference (IRD). During the follow-up period, the children showed that they were able to maintain the trained components. Conclusion Cochlear implants have the potential to learn language skills, and the present study confirms their ability to learn grammar, using a comprehensive grammar treatment program.",Persian; Treatment program; Grammar; Language disorder; Cochlear implant; PDSS; MLU

The analysis revealed that organic-neurogenic FAS is more frequent in women than in men. In organic-neurogenic FAS over half of the patients acquired the foreign accent after a stroke. Their lesions are typically located in the left supratentorial regions of the brain, and generally involve the primary motor cortex and premotor cortex (BA 4 and 6), and/or the basal ganglia. Although neurocognitive data are not consistently reported, vascular FAS patients regularly suffer frontal executive dysfunctions. On the basis of a careful comparison of the cognitive and theoretical accounts of FAS, AoS and ataxic dysarthria, it is concluded that FAS should be regarded a dual component motor speech disorder in which both planning and motor execution of speech may be affected.",Foreign accent syndrome; stroke; dysarthria; cerebellum; apraxia of speech

However, the interpretation of ERPs can be complicated by individual differences that aren't reflected in traditional analyses or visualizations. This is problematic, as failure to recognize important and systematic individual differences has in some cases led to inappropriate interpretations of ERP effects, with neurocognitive models of language comprehension sometimes being built on these inappropriate interpretations. In this chapter we review work, largely from our lab, on individual differences in ERP studies of language comprehension and discuss the promise of work on individual differences, as well as the challenges. In some cases individual differences in ERPs manifest themselves quantitatively (i.e., systematic differences in effect amplitudes), but in other more complex cases, qualitatively (i.e., different types of effects in different individuals). We will describe work on individual differences in morphosyntactic and semantic processing in both native and nonnative language processing, as well as multi-modal communication and higher-order pragmatic inferencing. In this last vein we will describe some nascent work done in our lab using unsupervised machine learning algorithms to better understand underlying patterns of qualitative individual differences in the processing of scalar implicatures.

El estudio distingue seis contextos en los que se requiere el uso de subjuntivo: cuando el verbo de la oración principal expresa deseo, mandato indirecto, duda, cuando se trata de una oración evaluativa con cópula así como con cláusulas temporales y de finalidad. Materiales y métodos Se estudió a 15niños con TEL y a 15niños con desarrollo típico entre los 5;0 y los 6;11años del centro de México. La producción del subjuntivo se hizo mediante un instrumento creado para el estudio en el que los niños completaron oraciones con formas verbales del subjuntivo e indicativo de diferentes tipos de oraciones a partir de una serie de imágenes. Resultados Los resultados mostraron una diferencia significativa en el uso de subjuntivo entre los niños con trastorno y los niños con desarrollo típico.

Background and objective Syntactic markers in Spanish to identify children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) have been described in several studies. Complex verbal morphology, such as the subjunctive, has been a sensitive area for these children. This study shows frequencies of subjunctive use in children with and without SLI. The study distinguishes six contexts in which the use of the subjunctive is required: when the verb in the main sentence expresses desire, indirect command, doubt, when it is an evaluative sentence with a copula and with time and purpose clauses. Materials and methods We studied 15children with SLI and 15children with typical development aged between 5;0 and 6;11 from central Mexico. The subjunctive was produced through an instrument created for the study in which the children completed sentences with verbal forms of the subjunctive and indicative from different types of sentences from a series of images. Results The results showed a significant difference in subjunctive use between the children with impairment and the typically developed children.

We measured 5–6-year-old children's (N=70) phoneme processing, word completion and perceptual reasoning skills and compared their test results to their brain responses to phonemic changes, separately for each test. We found that children performing better in Phoneme processing test showed larger mismatch negativity (MMN) responses than children scoring lower in the same test. In contrast, no correspondence between test scores and brain responses was found for Auditory closure. Thus, the results suggest that automatic auditory change detection is linked to phoneme awareness in preschool children.",MMN; LDN; Children; Behavioural tests; Phoneme processing; Intelligence

To demonstrate that tense, a discourse-sensitive construction, is problematic for Spanish-speaking children with SLI, 42 monolingual Spanish-speaking children, 21 with SLI and 21 age-matched typically-developing children, were recorded for 20–35min sessions of narrative speech, in Mexico City. The children's ages ranged from 58 to 76 months. Utterances were coded for compliance with obligatory context, defined as whether or not they agreed with plausibly associated subjects in the grammatical context. Our results show that children with SLI produced significantly more errors in verb finiteness, taking into account obligatory context, than did their typically-developing counterparts. We conclude that the type and frequency of finiteness errors produced by the children with SLI indicate that these children do indeed pass through an Extended Optional Infinitive (EOI) Stage. Our measure of obligatory context enables the identification of a bare stem, non-finite verb form, previously unidentified in spontaneous speech studies of Spanish-speaking children with SLI. Consequences of these findings for 3 prominent theories of SLI are discussed.",SLI; Specific language impairment; Spanish; Tense; Interface deficit; Interface delay; Spontaneous speech; Optional infinitives

Letter position errors were the main error type across tasks (writing to dictation and written naming), across output modalities (writing and typing), and across stimuli, e.g., migratable words (words in which letter migration forms another word), irregular words, and nonwords. Letter position errors occurred mainly in the middle letters of a word. AE's writing showed a significant length effect, and no lexicality, migratability, or frequency effects. His letter position deficit was manifested selectively in writing; he made no letter position errors in reading, demonstrating the dissociability of letter position encoding in reading and writing.

Meltzer and Tomiki Sumiyoshi,2014,Language-dependent performance on the letter fluency task in patients with schizophrenia,article,Schizophrenia Research,ScienceDirect,"Two types of verbal fluency tasks (letter fluency task; LFT, category fluency task; CFT) have been widely used to assess cognitive function in people with psychiatric diseases including schizophrenia. The task demand of the LFT is considered to vary across languages, as the cognitive process largely relies on sound and writing systems. Specifically, a sound unit for a letter (s) and a manner of association between them are assumed to be related with the performance. In the current study, three analyses have been conducted to examine this issue, using Japanese, Turkish, and English-speaking patients with schizophrenia. It was hypothesized that severity of letter fluency impairment would be in the order of Japanese, Turkish, and English speaking patients according to the inflexibility of a word search. First, performance on the LFT and the CFT was compared among Japanese (N=40), Turkish (N=30), and the US (N=31) patients (Analysis 1). A significant difference was found between the US and other two groups only in the LFT. Second, verbal fluency performance was compared between Japanese and Turkish patients by contrasting the degree of disassociations from normal controls (Japanese: N=20, Turkish: N=30) (Analysis 2). In Japanese patients, performance on the LFT was more severely impaired compared to that on the CFT while the opposite trend was found in the Turkish counterpart, suggesting that letter fluency performance was more degraded in Japanese patients. Finally, Analysis 3 was conducted to examine the relative order of letter fluency impairment among Japanese, Turkish and English-speaking patients. Disassociation in English users with schizophrenia was estimated based on previous meta-analytic reviews. The effect size (ES) for the letter fluency deficit was the largest in the Japanese sample, while the other two groups share similar ESs. The results from the three analyses partially supported the hypothesis for the severity of the letter fluency impairment in patients with schizophrenia. The language-dependency of letter fluency impairment was thought to be explained by the theoretical model built on unique properties of sound and writing systems. The considerations presented here would provide useful information for optimizing the portability of cognitive tasks across languages.",Verbal fluency; Letter fluency; Category fluency; Writing system; Cross-language diversity; Schizophrenia

The groups performed equally well on the semantic task, but hearing readers performed better on the phonological task. Semantic processing engaged similar left frontotemporal language circuits in deaf and hearing readers. However, phonological processing elicited increased neural activity in deaf, relative to hearing readers, in the left precentral gyrus, suggesting greater reliance on articulatory phonological codes, and in bilateral parietal cortex, suggesting increased phonological processing effort. Deaf readers also showed stronger anterior–posterior functional segregation between semantic and phonological processes in left inferior prefrontal cortex.

Participants included sixty Spanish-speaking children between the ages of three and four enrolled in community-based preschool classrooms. Child narrative retells were collected both in the fall and spring. Following coding procedures of the original English protocol, narratives were transcribed and scored according to 27 features within five categories: sentence structure, phrase structure, modifiers, nouns, and verbs. Nine additional features appropriate to Spanish were included in the analysis. Analysis of construct, concurrent, and predictive validity supported the utility of both long and short versions of the Spanish adaptation. Several differences between the original English version and Spanish adaption emerged. In particular, the inclusion of features related to number-gender agreement and regular imperfect verb tense benefited the tool. Spanish-speaking participants produced more tier-two verbs than tier-two nouns. In conclusion, the tool holds promise as an efficient way to monitor Spanish-speaking preschoolers’ progress in language development in a narrative context.",Assessment; Progress monitoring; Narrative language; Preschool; Spanish

The purpose of this study was to determine whether an absence of auditory input modulates attentional problems in deaf children with no delayed exposure to language. Two versions of a continuous performance test were administered to 37 deaf children born to Deaf parents and 60 hearing children, all aged 6–13 years. A vigilance task was used to measure sustained attention over the course of several minutes, and a distractibility test provided a measure of the ability to ignore task irrelevant information – selective attention. Both tasks provided assessments of cognitive control through analysis of commission errors. The deaf and hearing children did not differ on measures of sustained attention. However, younger deaf children were more distracted by task-irrelevant information in their peripheral visual field, and deaf children produced a higher number of commission errors in the selective attention task. It is argued that this is not likely to be an effect of audition on cognitive processing, but may rather reflect difficulty in endogenous control of reallocated visual attention resources stemming from early profound deafness.",

Además, se analizó el grado de acuerdo entre la percepción de dificultades lingüísticas reportadas por las familias (madres/padres) y el nivel obtenido en la evaluación estructurada. Método Participaron 23 niños y niñas con trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje y otros 23 con desarrollo típico, de entre 5 y 9 años, bilingües del catalán y español, emparejados por edad y sexo. Se utilizó la prueba CELF-4 para realizar la evaluación y el diagnóstico y test estandarizados para medir el nivel intelectual y el vocabulario expresivo y receptivo. Se administró un cuestionario parental para medir las variables: antecedentes familiares, factores sociodemográficos, indicadores de desarrollo y percepción de las dificultades lingüísticas de sus hijos. Resultados Se observó un mayor porcentaje de antecedentes familiares en el grupo con trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje que en el grupo con desarrollo típico. Se encontró una relación entre el nivel económico y el hecho de presentar TDL, un efecto significativo de grupo para el nivel económico en relación con el vocabulario receptivo y una correlación significativa entre primeras palabras con el vocabulario expresivo y receptivo posterior.

Background and aim There is a growing body of research seeking to find early identifiers of language difficulties. The aim of this study was to analyze family history of language disorders or other neurodevelopmental disorders, sociodemographic factors and other indicators of development from parental reports in order to distinguish between children with and without developmental language disorder. In addition, the degree of agreement between the perception of language difficulties reported by parents and the children's assessment scores was compared. Method 23 Catalan-Spanish bilingual children with developmental language disorder and 23 typical development children, matched by age and sex from 5 to 9 years of age took part in the study. CELF-4 was used to perform the language assessment and diagnosis, as well as other standardized tests to measure non-verbal intellectual level and expressive and receptive vocabulary. A questionnaire was administered to parents to measure the following variables: family history of language and other difficulties, sociodemographic factors, developmental indicators and their own perception of their children's language difficulties. Results A higher percentage of family history of language and other difficulties was observed in the developmental language disorder group compared to the typical development group. The economic level and the presence of DLD were significantly related, and we also found an effect of group on the economic level and on receptive vocabulary. A significant correlation was also found between the first words and later receptive vocabulary. Parental perception of their children's language difficulties and the results of the standardized language evaluation were also correlated, although only in the most evident difficulties.

Unfortunately, writing systems are not equally learnable and many individuals struggle to become proficient readers. Languages and their writing systems often have co-varying characteristics, due to both psycholinguistic and socio-cultural forces. This makes it difficult to determine the source of cross-linguistic differences in reading and writing. Nonetheless, it is important to make progress on this issue: a more precise understanding of the factors that affect reading disparities should improve reading instruction theory and practice, and the diagnosis and treatment of reading disorders. In this review, we consider the value of artificial orthographies as a tool for unpacking the factors that create cognitive and neural differences in reading acquisition and skill. We do so by focusing on one dimension that differs among writing systems: grain size. Grain size, or the unit of spoken language that is mapped onto a visual graph, is thought to affect learning, but its impact is still not well understood. We review relevant literature about cross-linguistic writing system differences, the benefits of using artificial orthographies as a research tool, and our recent work with an artificial alphasyllabic writing system for English. We conclude that artificial orthographies can be used to elucidate cross-linguistic principles that affect reading and writing.",Writing systems; Artificial orthographies; Grain size; Mapping principle; Syllables

Assuming that the above characteristics of metaphors can trigger inferential processing, we explored the impact of their modulation on metaphor understanding in a second language (L2). We thus manipulated the nature of prime sentences in relation to the original target metaphors (e.g. Obama presided over a topic of discussion of epochal proportions) and created less emotional literal paraphrases (synonymous; historic proportions) which we compared against emotionally loaded counterparts (implicatures; amazing proportions), and examined the performance of seventy-four Greek-English bilinguals on a reading comprehension and a meaning-matching task. The results showed that both experimental conditions elicited fewer errors in comparison to the control condition but did not differ between them in accuracy or in reaction time (RT).

However, whether the same or different brain regions are involved in learning to read a foreign language is largely unexplored. To investigate (1) neural correlates of literacy acquisition of Chinese in adults whose learning of this logographic language was relatively late, and (2) to examine which cognitive factors might be predictors of literacy acquisition that would modulate the computation demands on reading-related brain regions, native and non-native Chinese readers were recruited to participate in pronunciation and color verification tasks using Chinese pseudo-phonograms in fMRI while their sensitivity to extracting systematic regularity in nonverbal materials, as well as their IQ and working memory, was measured in a visual statistical learning (VSL) task. The results indicated that native participants activated a left lateralized reading network that is consistent with previous research on orthography-to-phonology conversion (OPC) of Chinese, while a similar but extensive network that also includes regions in the right hemisphere was engaged in the non-natives. Within this network, left inferior frontal sites were found to be crucial to the mapping of Chinese pseudo characters to potential sounds especially in non-natives. More important, only the VSL scores of native and non-native participants, but not their general cognitive abilities, were negatively correlated with the brain activities in the left inferior parietal and left inferior frontal regions, respectively, suggesting that the fundamental capacity of SL supports literacy acquisition through modulating computation demands on the brain regions associated with OPC processing, which is critical to Chinese character recognition.",Statistical learning; Foreign literacy acquisition; Bilingualism; Orthography-to-phonology conversion; fMRI

The present study extends previous research by testing two types of implicature: scalar implicatures, based on lexical scales, and ad-hoc implicatures, based on contextual scales. Methods We tested 26 children with ASD aged 4–10 years (mean age 7.1) and 26 typically developing (TD) children – matched on chronological age and with a similar performance in non-verbal IQ and vocabulary – by means of a picture selection task for scalar and ad-hoc implicatures. We also investigated the effect of children’s scores in standardized tests measuring non-verbal intelligence, lexical, and morphosyntactic abilities and Theory-of-Mind skills on their performance in the implicature tasks. Results Although more than half of the children with ASD performed above chance on both kinds of implicatures, their performance as a group was significantly lower than the performance of their TD peers. General cognitive abilities were found to affect the performance of children with ASD on both kinds of implicatures, and Theory-of-Mind reasoning skills were found to be linked to their performance on scalar, but not ad-hoc implicatures. Conclusions We show that children with ASD have difficulty with both kinds of implicatures.

Price,2018,Predicting language outcomes after stroke: Is structural disconnection a useful predictor?,article,NeuroImage: Clinical,ScienceDirect,"For many years, researchers have sought to understand whether and when stroke survivors with acquired language impairment (aphasia) will recover. There is broad agreement that lesion location information should play some role in these predictions, but still no consensus on the best or right way to encode that information. Here, we address the emerging emphasis on the structural connectome in this work – specifically the claim that disrupted white matter connectivity conveys important, unique prognostic information for stroke survivors with aphasia. Our sample included 818 stroke patients extracted from the PLORAS database, which associates structural MRI from stroke patients with language assessment scores from the Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT) and basic demographic. Patients were excluded when their lesions were too diffuse or small (<1 cm3) to be detected by the Automatic Lesion Identification toolbox, which we used to encode patients' lesions as binary lesion images in standard space. Lesions were encoded using the 116 regions defined by the Automatic Anatomical Labelling atlas. We examined prognostic models driven by both “lesion load” in these regions (i.e. the proportion of each region destroyed by each patient's lesion), and by the disconnection of the white matter connections between them which was calculated via the Network Modification toolbox. Using these data, we build a series of prognostic models to predict first one (“naming”), and then all of the language scores defined by the CAT. We found no consistent evidence that connectivity disruption data in these models improved our ability to predict any language score. This may be because the connectivity disruption variables are strongly correlated with the lesion load variables: correlations which we measure both between pairs of variables in their original form, and between principal components of both datasets. Our conclusion is that, while both types of structural brain data do convey useful, prognostic information in this domain, they also appear to convey largely the same variance. We conclude that connectivity disruption variables do not help us to predict patients' language skills more accurately than lesion location (load) data alone.",Stroke; Language; Aphasia; Outcomes; MRI; Connectomics; White matter

Here, we focus on two aspects of the bias that have received relatively little attention in the literature: Development and experience. A successful theory of ME will need to provide an account for why the strength of the effect changes with the age of the child. We provide a quantitative description of the change in the strength of the bias across development, and investigate the role that linguistic experience plays in this developmental change. We first summarize the current body of empirical findings via a meta-analysis, and then present two experiments that examine the relationship between a child's amount of linguistic experience and the strength of the ME bias. We conclude that the strength of the bias varies dramatically across development and that linguistic experience is likely one causal factor contributing to this change.

Mack,2017,Different mechanisms in learning different second languages: Evidence from English speakers learning Chinese and Spanish,article,NeuroImage,ScienceDirect,"Word reading has been found to be associated with different neural networks in different languages, with greater involvement of the lexical pathway for opaque languages and greater invovlement of the sub-lexical pathway for transparent langauges. However, we do not know whether this language divergence can be demonstrated in second langauge learners, how learner's metalinguistic ability would modulate the langauge divergence, or whether learning method would interact with the language divergence. In this study, we attempted to answer these questions by comparing brain activations of Chinese and Spanish word reading in native English-speaking adults who learned Chinese and Spanish over a 2 week period under three learning conditions: phonological, handwriting, and passive viewing. We found that mapping orthography to phonology in Chinese had greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) than in Spanish, suggesting greater invovlement of the lexical pathway in opaque langauges. In contrast, Spanish words evoked greater activation in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) than English, suggesting greater invovlement of the sublexical pathway for transparant languages. Furthermore, brain-behavior correlation analyses found that higher phonological awareness and rapid naming were associated with greater activation in the bilateral IFG for Chinese and in the bilateral STG for Spanish, suggesting greater language divergence in participants with higher meta-linguistic awareness. Finally, a significant interaction between the language and learning condition was found in the left STG and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), with greater activation in handwriting learning than viewing learning in the left STG only for Spanish, and greater activation in handwriting learning than phonological learning in the left MFG only for Chinese. These findings suggest that handwriting facilitates assembled phonology in Spanish and addressed phonology in Chinese. In summary, our study suggests different mechanisms in learning different L2s, providing important insights into neural plasticity and important implications in second language education.",Second language learning; Spanish; Chinese; English; Phonology; fMRI

Data Sources Sixty search terms related to communication partner training (CPT) in Chinese characters were searched in 8 electronic databases (published 1991-2020). Study Selection Journal articles written in Chinese that primarily target the Chinese audience and university theses were selected for review. Studies involving CPT and training to enable communication partner to deliver language tasks were included, but reports without PWA or direct training of communication partners were excluded. A final corpus of 37 articles, representing publications of group studies, case studies, qualitative studies, and opinion articles, were selected for full review. Data Extraction For all articles, 2 reviewers independently reviewed abstracts, excluding those without PWA or those that did not involve training of communication partners. One reviewer extracted descriptive data of participants with aphasia, communication partners, intervention details of the intervention (purpose, amount, setting, description), outcome measures, results, and clinical guidelines. A second reviewer performed accuracy verifications. Data Synthesis Quality of reviewed articles were classified using the American Academy of Neurology levels of evidence. The current review suggested an evidence base of low to medium quality supporting 2 intervention groups: (1) training partners to deliver therapy tasks and (2) training to improve communication between PWA and their communication partners. There was a higher proportion of persons with acute and subacute aphasia involved in these investigations, suggesting evidence on treatment efficacy of CPT in the acute stage. Conclusions Additional high-quality research with a better methodological quality, for example, randomized controlled trials or experimental design, are required to strengthen the current evidence of CPT.

Results of Experiment 1 showed that, like unimpaired speakers, the aphasic speakers evinced intact structural priming effects, suggesting that they are able to generate such representations. Unimpaired speakers also showed reliable thematic priming effects in all conditions; agrammatic speakers did so as well in most experimental conditions, suggesting that access to thematic representations may be intact. Results of Experiment 2 showed structural priming effects of comparable magnitude for aphasic and unimpaired speakers. In addition, both groups showed lasting structural priming effects in both lag conditions, consistent with implicit learning accounts. In both experiments, aphasic speakers with more severe language impairments exhibited larger priming effects, consistent with the “inverse preference” prediction of implicit learning accounts. The findings indicate that agrammatic speakers are sensitive to structural priming across levels of representation and that such effects are lasting, suggesting that structural priming may be beneficial for the treatment of sentence production deficits in agrammatism.",Structural priming; Thematic priming; Thematic mapping; Sentence production; Agrammatic aphasia

Choosing an appropriate expression requires the speaker to continuously keep track of the salience of referents in the discourse. Because this is cognitively challenging, children are expected to have problems creating referential cohesion. Yet, research has also shown that young children are sensitive to discourse factors in choosing referring expressions. To shed more light on how and when children learn to use referential expressions to create a cohesive discourse, we analyzed oral narratives by monolingual Swedish-speaking children aged 4;0–6;10, elicited with the Multilingual Assessment Instrument for Narratives (MAIN). We hypothesized that children would base their choice of referring expressions to a large extent on discourse factors for which no detailed mental model of the discourse is required, such as animacy. Our results show that the children indeed relied heavily on animacy as a cue for pronominalization. At the same time, they were sensitive to fine-grained levels of local discourse salience. We propose that, like adults, children use a combination of global and local discourse factors for choosing referring expressions, but that the relative weights of these factors may vary with cognitive capacity.",Accessibility; Narratives; Preschool children; Referential cohesion; Swedish

Carter and Anne Kaljonen and Annette Nylund and Päivi Pihlaja,2021,Communication skills predict social-emotional competencies,article,Journal of Communication Disorders,ScienceDirect,"Introduction Studies have shown that many children with early language difficulties also have delays in social-emotional competencies as well as social-emotional and behavioral problems. It is unclear if these conditions are causally related, if they share a common underlying etiology, or if there are bidirectional effects. Studies investigating these associations have mostly involved children who are already using words to communicate, but it is important to know whether delays in preverbal communication and language development have any effects on these associations. The aim of the present study was to examine associations between preverbal communication and early verbal skills in infancy and subsequent social-emotional competencies and ensuing social-emotional and behavioral problems in early toddlerhood. The role of background factors known to influence early language development was also examined. Methods The sample consisted of 395 children (51.6% boys) from the Finnish Steps Study cohort. Language was assessed at age 13 months (+ 1 month) with the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory for Infants (CDI-I), and the social-emotional domain was assessed at age < 17 months with the Brief Infant–Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA). Results Infants with lower preverbal gestural communication and receptive language skills had a higher risk of delays in social-emotional competencies in toddlerhood than children with better communication skills, but not of elevated social-emotional and behavioral problems. Conclusions The results indicate that lower early communication skills can predict delays in the development of social-emotional competencies, which has been found to be a risk factor for later development of social-emotional and behavioral problems. It is important to monitor early communication skills to provide guidance to parents in supporting early pragmatic communication and language development in infancy, if needed.",BITSEA; CDI; Communication development; Preverbal; Social-emotional competence; Social emotional problems

Methods We randomly selected 40 infants with TSC from the TSC Autism Center of Excellence Research Network dataset. Using human observers, we analyzed 74 audio-video recordings within a flexible software-based coding environment. During the recordings, infants were engaged in developmental testing. We determined syllables per minute (volubility), the number of consonant-vowel combinations, such as ‘ba’ (canonical babbling), and the canonical babbling ratio (canonical syllables/total syllables) and compared the data with two groups of typically developing (TD) infants. One comparison group's data had come from a laboratory setting, while the other's had come from all-day Language Environment Analysis recordings at home. Results Compared with TD infants in laboratory and all-day Language Environment Analysis recordings, entry into the canonical babbling stage was delayed in the majority of infants with TSC, and the canonical babbling ratio was low (TD mean = 0.346, SE = 0.19; TSC mean = 0.117, SE = 0.023). Volubility level in infants with TSC was less than half that of TD infants (TD mean = 9.82, SE = 5.78; TSC mean = 3.99, SE = 2.16). Conclusions Entry into the canonical stage and other precursors of speech development were delayed in infants with TSC and may signal poor language and developmental outcomes. Future studies are planned to assess prediction of language and developmental outcomes using these measures in a larger sample and in more precisely comparable recording circumstances.",Tuberous sclerosis complex; Vocal development; Canonical babbling; Autism spectrum disorder; Volubility; Language

Study design A prospective, longitudinal pregnancy cohort of 1023 mother-infant pairs in metropolitan Calgary, Canada, were followed across 5 time points: before 25 weeks gestation, between 34-36 weeks gestation, and at 4, 12, and 24 months postpartum. Toddlers who scored ≤10th percentile on The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories: Words and Sentences between 24 and 30 months of age were identified as late talkers. Thirty-four candidate characteristics theoretically and/or empirically linked to language development and/or language impairment were collected using survey methodology. Results The prevalence of late talking was 12.6%. Risk factors for late talking in the multivariable model included: male sex (P = .017) and a family history of late talking and/or diagnosed speech or language delay (P = .002). Toddlers were significantly less likely to be late talkers if they engaged in informal play opportunities (P = .013), were read to or shown picture books daily (P < .001), or cared for primarily in child care centers (P = .001). Conclusions Both biological and environmental factors were associated with the development of late talking. Biological factors placed toddlers at risk for late talking, and facets of the environment played a protective role. Enveloping infants and toddlers in language-rich milieus that promote opportunities for playing, reading, and sharing books daily may decrease risk for delayed early vocabulary.",

Communication partner training in aphasia: a systematic review. Objectives To describe the effects of communication partner training on persons with aphasia and their communication partners. Specifically the systematic review addressed 3 clinical questions regarding the impact of partner training on language, communication activity and participation, psychosocial adjustment, and quality of life for adults with aphasia and their communication partners. Data Sources Twenty-three terms were used to search 12 electronic databases (eg, PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, PsychArticles, CSA Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts, Social Sciences Citation Index [Web of Science], SUMSearch, TRIP, EMBASE, REHABDATA, National Library for Health, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and the journal “Aphasiology.” References from all relevant articles were hand-searched. Study Selection Two reviewers independently applied inclusion criteria to select potential relevant articles from the titles and abstracts of references retrieved by the literature search. The full text of the remaining articles was reviewed by a 5-member panel, resulting in a corpus of 31 studies that met the final inclusion criteria. Data Extraction Two independent reviewers extracted the descriptive data related to the participants, the intervention, the outcome measures, and the results. Data Synthesis The 5-member review team by consensus classified the studies using the American Academy of Neurology system for classification of evidence (2004). Conclusions Evidence shows that communication partner training is effective in improving communication activities and/or participation of the communication partner and is probably effective in improving communication activities and/or participation of persons with chronic aphasia when they are interacting with trained communication partners. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations related to the impact of partner training on persons with acute aphasia or the impact of training on language impairment, psychosocial adjustment, or quality of life for either the person with aphasia or the communication partner.",Aphasia; Communication; Treatment outcome; Rehabilitation

Aslin,2022,Towards a model of language neurobiology in early development,article,Brain and Language,ScienceDirect,"Understanding language neurobiology in early childhood is essential for characterizing the developmental structural and functional changes that lead to the mature adult language network. In the last two decades, the field of language neurodevelopment has received increasing attention, particularly given the rapid advances in the implementation of neuroimaging techniques and analytic approaches that allow detailed investigations into the developing brain across a variety of cognitive domains. These methodological and analytical advances hold the promise of developing early markers of language outcomes that allow diagnosis and clinical interventions at the earliest stages of development. Here, we argue that findings in language neurobiology need to be integrated within an approach that captures the dynamic nature and inherent variability that characterizes the developing brain and the interplay between behavior and (structural and functional) neural patterns. Accordingly, we describe a framework for understanding language neurobiology in early development, which minimally requires an explicit characterization of the following core domains: i) computations underlying language learning mechanisms, ii) developmental patterns of change across neural and behavioral measures, iii) environmental variables that reinforce language learning (e.g., the social context), and iv) brain maturational constraints for optimal neural plasticity, which determine the infant's sensitivity to learning from the environment. We discuss each of these domains in the context of recent behavioral and neuroimaging findings and consider the need for quantitatively modeling two main sources of variation: individual differences or trait-like patterns of variation and within-subject differences or state-like patterns of variation. The goal is to enable models that allow prediction of language outcomes from neural measures that take into account these two types of variation. Finally, we examine how future methodological approaches would benefit from the inclusion of more ecologically valid paradigms that complement and allow generalization of traditional controlled laboratory methods.",Infant; Development; Language; Neurobiology; Learning; Biomarkers

We approached this question by investigating sentence processing in advanced second language (L2) users with different native language (L1) backgrounds. Using a visual world eye tracking paradigm, we investigated to what extent L1 and L2 participants showed anticipatory eye movements to objects while listening to Dutch placement event descriptions. L2 groups differed in the degree of similarity between Dutch and their L1 with respect to placement verb semantics: German, like Dutch, specifies object position in placement verbs (put.STAND vs. put.LIE), whereas English and French typically leave position underspecified (put). Results showed that German L2 listeners, like native Dutch listeners, anticipate objects that match the verbally encoded position immediately upon encountering the verb. French/English L2 participants, however, did not show any prediction effects, despite proper understanding of Dutch placement verbs. Our findings suggest that prior experience with a specific semantic contrast in one’s L1 facilitates prediction in L2, and hence adds to the evidence that linguistic experience modulates predictive sentence processing.",Predictive processing; Sentence comprehension; Language experience; L2 processing; Cross-linguistic diversity; Visual world eye tracking

Phonological Processing was positively correlated with fractional anisotropy and negatively correlated with mean diffusivity. The relationships observed in left ventral pathways are consistent with studies in older children, and demonstrate that structural markers for language performance are apparent as young as 3 years of age.

Test–retest reliability was examined in a random subsample of 30 children at a five-week interval. The clinical discrimination of the D-N CAS was also examined by comparing children with and without ADHD (18 children in each group) and by comparing children with and without Chinese reading disabilities (18 children in each group). The current Chinese sample demonstrated a four-factor solution for cognitive performance among children with normal development: Planning, Attention, Simultaneous processing and Successive processing (χ2(48)=91.90, p=.000; χ2/df=1.92, RMSEA=.050, GFI=.966, CFI=.954). Moreover, all subtests of the battery demonstrated acceptable test–retest reliability (r=.72–.90, p<.01) at a five-week interval among the subjects of the small subsample. Children with ADHD performed significantly worse than normal children on the Attention factor (p<.001) and the Planning factor (p<.05) of the D-N CAS, and children with Chinese reading disabilities performed significantly worse than normal children on the Simultaneous processing factor (p<.01), the Successive processing factor (p<.001) and the Planning factor (p<.05) of the D-N CAS. These findings suggested that the current four-factor structure of the D-N CAS was similar to the original factor structure of the test.

Despite the robustness of the phenomenon, the way in which the shape bias is defined and tested has varied across studies and laboratories. The current review argues that differences in performance that come from even seemingly minor changes to the participants or task can offer critical insight to underlying mechanisms, and that working to incorporate data from multiple labs is an important way to reveal how task variation and a child’s individual pathway creates behavior—a key issue for understanding developmental phenomena.",Reproducibility; Shape bias; Task effects; Word learning; Individual differences

Participants were 25 sighted and 37 low-vision individuals. During the experiment, participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans. FC maps of the VWFA for sighted and low-vision participants were calculated separately and were contrasted with each other. Our results revealed a stronger FC between the VWFA and the inferior occipital cortex (IOC) but a weaker FC between the VWFA and the posterior central gyrus (PostCG) in the sighted people compared to the people with low vision. The region-of-interest-based analyses showed that the FC between the VWFA and PostCG in low-vision individuals who learned Braille was stronger relative to those who did not learn Braille, and that the FC between the VWFA and IOC was correlated with the onset age of Braille learning. These results suggest that the VWFA in people with low vision has a functional reorganization between visual and tactile processing, which was modulated by the experience of Braille reading.",Low vision; Resting state; Functional connectivity; Visual word form area

On two occasions, with a six months interval, we tested the students' word and pseudoword decoding fluency in their native language (Dutch) and their word decoding fluency in two foreign languages, English (L2) and French (L3). Our findings indicated that students' English word decoding development primarily depended on Dutch word decoding fluency. The development of their French decoding skills was mainly dependent on their Dutch pseudoword decoding fluency, and in the higher educational track also on their L2 word decoding ability. It is concluded that there is evidence of linguistic interdependencies in the development of word decoding in the native language and the subsequent development of word decoding in the foreign language.

However, it is still unknown whether, impaired phonological processing remains the core deficit of impaired English reading in individuals with English as their second language and how it is represented in the neural cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study investigated the neural responses to letter rhyming judgment (phonological task) and letter same/different judgment (orthographic task) in Chinese school children with English and Chinese reading impairment compared to typically developing children. Whole brain analyses with multiple comparison correction revealed reduced activation within the left lingual/calcarine gyrus during orthographic processing in children with reading impairment compared to typical readers. An independent region of interest analysis showed reduced activation in occipitotemporal regions during orthographic processing, and reduced activation in parietotemporal regions during phonological processing, consistent with previous studies in English native speakers. These results suggest that similar neural deficits are involved for impaired phonological processing in English as both the first and the second language acquired. These findings pose implications for reading remediation, educational curriculum design, and educational policy for second language learners.",Children; impaired reading; Phonological processing; Orthographic processing; Second language learning; fMRI developmental dyslexia

Specifically, we compared error rates produced in data collected using samples from spontaneous language versus elicited production, using both broad (overall) and narrow measures (errors with noun phrases). Methods and participants Monolingual-Spanish-speaking five-year-olds (n=55) were divided into typical language development (TL) and at-risk (Risk) according to a preexisting test, Tamiz de Problemas del Lenguaje. All children completed an elicited production and a narrative task. Results Children in the TL group outperform children in the Risk group in all measures used in this study. Statistically significant differences were found between children at Risk and TL children in both spontaneous and elicited language measures, although the effect size of the elicited language measures was considerably higher. Elicited and spontaneous tasks are more likely to produce results that are in accord than in disaccord. However, when results are in disaccord, the results almost always show low performance in elicited language but high performance in spontaneous language. Elicitation methods do not seem to have an impact on the type of error produced for neither narrow nor broad measures.

Específicamente, comparamos las tasas de error producidas usando muestras de lenguaje espontáneo versus la producción elicitada, usando medidas generales (todos los errores) y específicas (errores con frases nominales). Métodos y participantes Los niños monolingües de cinco años de habla hispana (n=55) se dividieron en dos grupos: desarrollo del lenguaje típico o a riesgo de desórdenes del lenguaje, para lo cual se usó el Tamiz de Problemas del Lenguaje. Todos los niños completaron una producción del lenguaje elicitada y una tarea narrativa. Resultados Los niños del grupo típico superan a los niños del grupo a riesgo en todas las medidas utilizadas en este estudio. Se encontraron diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre los niños a riesgo y los niños típicos en las medidas de lenguaje espontáneo y elicitado, aunque el tamaño del efecto de las medidas de lenguaje elicitado fue considerablemente mayor. El lenguaje elicitado y espontáneo producen mas resultados que están de acuerdo que en desacuerdo; sin embargo, cuando los resultados están en desacuerdo, casi siempre muestran un bajo rendimiento en el lenguaje elicitado pero un alto rendimiento en el lenguaje espontáneo.

Subjects were 83 preschool children in six public preschool classrooms with low-income eligibility thresholds, including 30 DLLs. Children were screened for alphabet knowledge and randomly assigned to small groups and to one of four conditions: experimental letter names or letter sounds only, experimental letter names + sounds (LN + LS), or typical LN + LS. Research assistants provided nine weeks of instruction in each treatment, in 10-min sessions, four days/week. Irrespective of language status, children in the four groups made significant growth from pretest to posttest on measures of alphabet learning. The single-focus letter name or letter sound conditions led to significantly greater growth on taught alphabet content. The experimental LN + LS condition led to greater growth in taught letter names and sounds content compared to the typical LN + LS condition. Pretest vocabulary and alphabet knowledge did not moderate growth, and only limited evidence of differential response to instruction among DLLs was found. Paired associate and articulation referencing learning processes were related to alphabetic growth. Engagement during learning was high in all four treatments.

Secondly, these series were used with rnTMS preoperatively in five children with epilepsy. Naming errors induced by the stimulation comprised no response, delayed response, semantic error, phonological error, and self-correction. Language laterality was compared with the results of a dichotic listening test and with neuropsychological tests with respect to general laterality, and general language abilities were considered with respect to the results of stimulation. One participant had below normal general language abilities, two had below-normal rapid naming, and three had slow and indistinct articulation. Laterality was only clear in two of the participants. All children required breaks of various durations during the process, and individual adjustments of the interpicture interval and other stimulation parameters were also made.

A sibling comparison approach was used, providing a robust test for the association between SDP and reading related outcomes in school-aged children. Results suggested within-family (i.e., potentially causal) associations between SDP and reading and language/comprehension factor scores, as well as between SDP and specific reading-related skills, including reading accuracy and receptive language, with increased exposure to SDP associated with decreased performance. SDP was not associated with spelling, reading rate, or receptive vocabulary. Initial within-family associations between SDP and word-letter identification, phonetic/decoding skills, and reading comprehension were fully attenuated following partial control for genetic and environmental confounding of the associations.

Method Spontaneous language samples of thirty-one age- and gender-matched pairs of children (total N=62) between the ages of 24 months and 59 months were analyzed. Results Results indicated that children who do and do not stutter over-regularize irregular past-tense verbs (i.e., saying runned for ran) with comparable frequency. However, two nonsignificant trends which suggest possible intra-group differences were noted. First, irregular past tense verbs represented a greater portion of total verbs for CWS than for CWNS. Second, CWS appeared to double-mark (i.e., say ranned for ran) more often than CWNS. Results are discussed in light of theories about the acquisition of the irregular past-tense and about differences in language skills between CWS and CWNS.

Some behavioral and functional neuroimaging investigations of healthy participants suggest that calculation requires language resources. However, there are also reports of individuals with severe aphasic language impairment who retain calculation ability. One possibility in resolving these discordant findings is that the neural basis of calculation has undergone significant reorganization in aphasic calculators. Using fMRI, we examined brain activations associated with exact addition and subtraction in two patients with severe agrammatic aphasia and retained calculation ability. Behavior and brain activations during two-digit addition and subtraction were compared to those of a group of 11 healthy, age-matched controls. Behavioral results confirmed that both patients retained calculation ability. Imaging findings revealed individual differences in processing, but also a similar activation pattern across patients and controls in bilateral parietal cortices. Patients differed from controls in small areas of increased activation in peri-lesional regions, a shift from left fronto-temporal activation to the contralateral region, and increased activations in bilateral superior parietal regions. Our results suggest that bilateral parietal cortex represents the core of the calculation network and, while healthy controls may recruit language resources to support calculation, these mechanisms are not mandatory in adult cognition.",fMRI; Language; Calculation; Parietal cortex; Aphasia

Method Children (n=85) around 3-years of age were recruited from a child development clinic. Detailed speech and language assessments were completed during a one-hour semi-structured clinician-child interactive session. Language assessment was carried out using a criterion-referenced checklist and the language sections of the Bayley Scale for Infant Development- 3rd Edition (BSID-III). All parents rated their children's language skills using seven statements related to reception and expression domains of language on a 7-point rating scale. The language status of the child (typical language vs delay) determined by the parental report was matched with the language status as per the child's performance during the SLP assessment. Results and discussion Mean parental ratings of children assessed as having language delay by an SLP were significantly lower than children with typical language. Total parental rating score correlated highly with overall language scores on BSID-III; the highest correlation was observed for ratings of statements related to expressive language skills focusing on formation of sentences. Parental report of below normal performance on any one of the seven statements demonstrated acceptable sensitivity (0.95) and a high negative predictive value (0.98) with the child's performance as the gold standard. Conclusion Parental ratings of language skills correlated with child's performance at 3-years of age with a higher agreement for identifying children with delays. Parental reports can be useful to red-flag children for further assessment and continued monitoring of language development in busy developmental clinics and preschools, especially in the context of low-resource settings.",Preschoolers; Tamil; Language screening; Language development; BSID-III

From each class, eight learners of low oral reading fluency and another eight of high oral reading fluency were chosen for data analysis. Learners in Class 1 enhanced their oral reading fluency with an audio player, Class 2 with a system-paced ASAS, and Class 3 with a learner-paced ASAS. Pretest and posttest were conducted before and after the training. During the 8-week training period, each student was required to read half of an article by repeating after the model speaker for thirty minutes each week. Two-way ANOVA simple main effect was conducted to analyze the data. Four conclusions were made. First, the training either with an audio player or with an ASAS enhanced learners’ WCPM more than their MFS scores. Second, students of low oral reading fluency benefited more by practicing with the ASAS. Third, training either with an audio player or an ASAS didn’t seem to help learners of high oral reading fluency much.

The analysis reveals key PoS-grams shared in CE and CL introductions, e.g., those associated with the step “purposive announcement”, as well as the discipline-specific ones such as the PoS-gram for structure-outlining only found in CE introductions. Compared to various forms of multi-word sequences like n-grams, the PoS-gram has the unique strength of grouping phraseologies with similar or identical structure and discursive functions and yet either recurrent or varying lexical choices under the co-selected grammatical categories. The advantage enriches analyses and helps yield pedagogically useful findings, in that patterning and variability is revealed not only in the overall function, structure and composition of PoS-grams but in such aspects of their recurrent or diversified tokens.

We hypothesized that individual differences in auditory processing may account for some variability in second language learning. We tested this hypothesis by examining psychoacoustic thresholds, auditory-motor temporal integration, and auditory neural encoding in adult native Polish speakers living in the UK. We found that precise English vowel perception and accurate English grammatical judgment were linked to lower psychoacoustic thresholds, better auditory-motor integration, and more consistent frequency-following responses to sound. Psychoacoustic thresholds and neural sound encoding explained independent variance in vowel perception, suggesting that they are dissociable indexes of sound processing. These results suggest that individual differences in second language acquisition success stem at least in part from domain-general difficulties with auditory perception, and that auditory training could help facilitate language learning in some individuals with specific auditory impairments.",Auditory; Bilingualism; FFR; Language; Rhythm

This study highlights the effective factors on post-traumatic (PT) linguistic disorder and relations between linguistic and cognitive function after trauma in adults with acute TBI. A cross-sectional design was employed to study 60 post-TBI hospitalized adults aged 18–65 years. Post-traumatic (PT) linguistic disorder and cognitive deficit after TBI were respectively diagnosed using the Persian Aphasia Test (PAT) and Persian version of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at discharge. Primary post-resuscitation consciousness level was determined using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Paracilinical data was obtained by CT scan technique. Multiple logistic regression analysis illustrated that brain injury severity was the first powerful significant predictor of PT linguistic disorder after TBI and frontotemporal lesion was the second. It was also revealed that cognitive function score was significantly correlated with score of each language skill except repetition. Subsequences of TBI are more commonly language dysfunctions that demand cognitive flexibility. Moderate, severe and fronto-temporal lesion can increase the risk of processing deficit in linguistic macrostructure production and comprehension. The dissociation risk of cortical and subcortical pathways related to cognitive-linguistic processing due to intracranial lesions can augment possibility of lexical-semantic processing deficit in acute phase which probably contributes to later cognitive-communication disorder.",Traumatic brain injury; Post-traumatic language disorder; Post-traumatic cognitive deficit; Acute phase

Phonological awareness is also considered a primarily metalinguistic skill not affected by the individual's L2 language proficiency, or by L1-L2 linguistic distance. The current paper takes a different perspective on L2 phonological awareness. It argues that L2 phonological awareness is affected by L2 language-specific factors, and that these factors may be as equally implicated in phonological awareness in L2 as the metalinguistic insight that words may be broken down into phonological units – often considered the hallmark of the phonological awareness construct. In support of this claim, we discuss two types of evidence. The first concerns significant differences between phonological awareness in L1 and L2, as well as a significant correlation between L2 oral language proficiency and phonological awareness in L2. The second concerns linguistic distance and the effect on L2 phonological awareness of phonological differences between L1 and L2. Both pieces of evidence are used to promote the argument that it is important to view phonological awareness in L2 as a two-dimensional construct encompassing a metalinguistic component, which may be metalinguistic in nature and language-independent, and a linguistic component which is language-specific and reflects phonological representations in L2.",L2; Linguistic distance; Novel phonemes; Oral language; Phonological awareness

To address this question, we examined autobiographical memory in 10 LPA patients, contrasted with 18 typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease and 16 healthy Control participants. A validated assessment, the Autobiographical Interview, was employed to explore autobiographical memory performance across the lifespan under free and probed recall conditions. Relative to Controls, LPA patients showed global impairments across all time periods for free recall, scoring at the same level as disease-matched cases of Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, these retrieval deficits persisted in LPA, even when structured probing was provided, and could not be explained by overall level of language disruption or amount of information generated during autobiographical narration. Autobiographical memory impairments in LPA related to gray matter intensity decrease in predominantly posterior parietal brain regions implicated in memory retrieval. Together, our results suggest that episodic memory disturbances may be an under-appreciated clinical feature of LPA.",Alzheimer's disease; Primary progressive aphasia; Dementia; Episodic memory; Parietal

Cox and Linda Ewing-Cobbs,2015,White matter and reading deficits after pediatric traumatic brain injury: A diffusion tensor imaging study,article,NeuroImage: Clinical,ScienceDirect,"Pediatric traumatic brain injury often results in significant long-term deficits in mastery of reading ability. This study aimed to identify white matter pathways that, when damaged, predicted reading deficits in children. Based on the dual-route model of word reading, we predicted that integrity of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus would be related to performance in sight word identification while integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus would be related to performance in phonemic decoding. Reading fluency and comprehension were hypothesized to relate to the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and cingulum bundle. The connectivity of white matter pathways was used to predict reading deficits in children aged 6 to 16years with traumatic brain injury (n=29) and those with orthopedic injury (n=27) using tract-based spatial statistics. Results showed that children with traumatic brain injury and reduced microstructural integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus demonstrated reduced word-reading ability on sight word and phonemic decoding tasks. Additionally, children with traumatic brain injury and microstructural changes involving the cingulum bundle demonstrated reduced reading fluency. Results support the association of a dorsal pathway via the superior longitudinal fasciculus with both sight word reading and phonemic decoding. No association was identified between the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and sight word reading or phonemic decoding. Reading fluency was associated with the integrity of the cingulum bundle. These findings support dissociable pathways predicting word reading and fluency using Diffusion Tensor Imaging and provide additional information for developing models of acquired reading deficits by specifying areas of brain damage which may predict reading deficits following recovery from the acute phase of TBI.",Reading; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Traumatic brain injury; Pediatric

Thompson,2016,Tracking sentence comprehension: Test-retest reliability in people with aphasia and unimpaired adults,article,Journal of Neurolinguistics,ScienceDirect,"Purpose Visual-world eyetracking is increasingly used to investigate online language processing in normal and language impaired listeners. Tracking changes in eye movements over time also may be useful for indexing language recovery in those with language impairments. Therefore, it is critical to determine the test-retest reliability of results obtained using this method. Methods Unimpaired young adults and people with aphasia took part in two eyetracking sessions spaced about one week apart. In each session, participants completed a sentence-picture matching task in which they listened to active and passive sentences (e.g., The [N1+Aux woman was] [V visiting/visited] [NP/PP2 (by) the man]) and selected between two pictures with reversed thematic roles. We used intraclass correlations (ICCs) to examine the test-retest reliability of response measures (accuracy, reaction time (RT)) and online eye movements (i.e., the likelihood of fixating the target picture in each region of the sentence) in each participant group. Results In the unimpaired adults, accuracy was at ceiling (thus ICCs were not computed), with moderate ICCs for RT (i.e., 0.4–0.58) for passive sentences and low (<0.4) for actives. In individuals with aphasia, test-retest reliability was strong (0.59 < ICC < 0.75) for accuracy and excellent (>0.75) for RT for both sentence types. Similarly, for the unimpaired listeners, reliability of eye movements was moderate for passive sentences (NP/PP2 region) and low in all regions for active sentences. But, for the aphasic participant group, eye movement reliability was excellent for passive sentences (in the first second after sentence end) and strong for active sentences (V and NP/PP2 regions). Conclusion Results indicated moderate-to-low reliability for unimpaired listeners; however, reliable eye movement patterns were detected for processes specific to passive sentences (e.g., thematic reanalysis). In contrast, individuals with aphasia exhibited strong and stable performance across sentence types in response measures and online eye movements. These findings indicate that visual-world eyetracking provides a reliable measure of online sentence comprehension in aphasia, and thus may be useful for investigating sentence processing changes over time.",Eyetracking; Aphasia; Sentence comprehension; Test-retest reliability

In the present study, we compared the brain morphology of two groups of bilinguals who were equally proficient in their second language but differed in their perception of both native and non-native vowels. A whole brain, voxel-based morphometry analysis (VBM) revealed larger white matter volume in the right insulo/fronto-opercular region in individuals who exhibited poorer perceptual discrimination of native and non-native vowels. As the volume of the left Heschl’s gyri has previously been shown to correlate with the ability to perceive foreign phonemic contrasts (between consonants), we also measured the white and grey matter volumes of Heschl’s gyri in our subjects. We did not observe any significant relation between these volumes and vowel discrimination capabilities.

Furthermore, the normalization process was found to ease lexical retrieval, as indexed by smaller N400 (350–470 ms) after larger P2. A cross-language vowel perception task was carried out to further specify whether normalization was processed in the phonetic and/or phonological stage(s). It was found that both phonetic and phonological cues in the speech context contributed to vowel normalization.

Infants receiving the intervention demonstrated a significantly higher number of observed different and total utterances at the 6-month follow-up compared to infants in standard care. Furthermore, there was an indirect effect of the intervention on infant language production, such that the intervention led to decreases in infant externalizing behavior problems from pre- to post-intervention, which, in turn, led to increases in infant different utterances at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups and total utterances at the 6-month follow-up.

Two elementary students (ages 7;6 and 8;4) completed a set of four vocabulary tasks and received two 30-minute mediations in ASL. Each session consisted of several scripted activities focusing on the use of categorization. Both had experienced difficulties in providing categorically related responses in one of the vocabulary tasks used previously. Results showed that the two students exhibited notable differences with regards to their learning pace, information uptake, and effort required by the mediator. Furthermore, we observed signs of a shift in strategic behavior by the lower performing student during the second mediation. Results suggest that the use of dynamic assessment procedures in a vocabulary context was helpful in understanding children's strategies as related to learning potential. These results are discussed in terms of deaf children's cognitive modifiability with implications for planning instruction and how MLE can be used with a population that uses ASL. Learning outcomes: The reader will (1) recognize the challenges in appropriate language assessment of deaf signing children; (2) recall the three areas explored to investigate whether a dynamic assessment approach is sensitive to differences in deaf signing children's language learning profiles (3) discuss how dynamic assessment procedures can make deaf signing children's individual language learning differences visible.",Dynamic assessment; Fast mapping; Modifiability; Deaf; Sign language; ASL

Their English vocabulary knowledge was measured 1, 2, and 3 school years later. Multiple regression analyses showed that, among the assessed phonological processing abilities, phonological STM and speech perception, but not phonological awareness, appeared to underlie L2 vocabulary acquisition in this context of an early L2 immersion school program, at least during the first steps of acquisition.

In the first part, structural and functional asymmetry of language relevant structures will be discus. The second part of the review will discuss recent neuroimaging studies, which coherently demonstrate that speech comprehension processes rely on a hierarchical network involving the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. Further, the results support the dual-stream model for speech comprehension, with a dorsal stream for auditory-motor integration, and a ventral stream for extracting meaning but also the processing of sentences and narratives. Specific patterns of functional asymmetry between the left and right hemisphere can also be demonstrated.

Parental LEP is associated with worse health outcomes among healthy children. The relationship of parental LEP to health outcomes for children with special health care needs (CSHCN) has not been systematically reviewed. Objective To conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature examining relationships between parental LEP and health outcomes for CSHCN. Data Sources PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Social Science Abstracts, bibliographies of included studies. Key search term categories: language, child, special health care needs, and health outcomes. Eligibility Criteria US studies published between 1964 and 2012 were included if: 1) subjects were CSHCN; 2) studies included some measure of parental LEP; 3) at least 1 outcome measure of child health status, access, utilization, costs, or quality; and 4) primary or secondary data analysis. Methods Three trained reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Two separate reviewers appraised studies for methodological rigor and quality. Results From 2765 titles and abstracts, 31 studies met eligibility criteria. Five studies assessed child health status, 12 assessed access, 8 assessed utilization, 2 assessed costs, and 14 assessed quality. Nearly all (29 of 31) studies used only parent- or child-reported outcome measures, rather than objective measures. LEP parents were substantially more likely than English-proficient parents to report that their CSHCN were uninsured and had no usual source of care or medical home. LEP parents were also less likely to report family-centered care and satisfaction with care. Disparities persisted for children with LEP parents after adjustment for ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Conclusions and Implications Parental LEP is independently associated with worse health care access and quality for CSHCN. Health care providers should recognize LEP as an independent risk factor for poor health outcomes among CSHCN. Emerging models of chronic disease care should integrate and evaluate interventions that target access and quality disparities for LEP families.",access; children with special health care needs; disabled children; health services accessibility; health services research; health care disparities; language; limited English proficiency; minority health; quality of health care

Forty-eight children were recruited for this study, evenly grouped in two conditions: SLI and Typical. Groups were balanced by gender with no differences in months of age. All children were assessed twice: when in 2nd grade and when in 4th grade. Several multiple regression analyses were conducted. Findings revealed differences in terms of which particular predictors significantly impacted reading comprehension in each group. Vocabulary and syntax complexity are the most consistent predictors of reading performance. Decoding predicted reading comprehension performance only in the observed early stage (2nd grade), becoming non-significant over time. Grammaticality was found to have no impact on reading comprehension in both groups. Reported results suggest that vocabulary and complex syntax solidly predict reading comprehension, while decoding and grammaticality play a minor or even negligible role. Thus, interventions designed to improve reading comprehension among children with SLI might benefit from targeting these two particular dimensions of language.",Specific Language Impairment (SLI); grammar; decoding; vocabulary; reading comprehension

We examined the extent to which various traits dimensionally linked to one or more of these disorders are associated with lexical recognition performance in the general population. Methods Seventy-eight healthy English-speaking participants completed self-report measures of schizotypy, psychopathy, impulsivity, depression, anxiety and stress. All participants were assessed on a one-choice variant of a lexical decision task (LDT). Results Meanness and Boldness traits of psychopathy (Triarchic Psychopathy Measure), and positive schizotypy (Unusual Experiences, Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences) were associated with poor word-nonword accuracy, and predicted a significant amount of unique variance (Meanness, 12%; Boldness, 4.8%; Positive Schizotypy, 4.4%; total 21%) in performance. Higher motor impulsivity predicted 30% of the variance in low-frequency words recognition accuracy, but only in non-native English speakers. Affective traits were not associated with LDT performance. Conclusion Psychopathic traits show stronger negative associations with lexical recognition performance than schizotypal traits, and impulsivity may differently influence lexical decision performance in native and non-native speakers. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings, especially the influence of language familiarity in the impulsivity-performance relationship, and to clarify the influence of corresponding symptom dimensions in lexical recognition abilities, taking language familiarity, migration status, and comorbidity into account, in people with schizophrenia, psychopathy, and/or antisocial personality disorders.",Schizotypy; Psychopathy; Impulsivity; Lexical decision task; Lexical recognition; Reading skills

Goals have differed from Psychology through ally disciplines to Linguistics, with analyses targeting co-development through disorders to general processes in acquisition. Psychology has typically turned to skills and abilities paralleling figurative language development (e.g., multi- and meta-representation). Linguistics has generally grappled with whether holistic or piecemeal approaches are best—the latter involving different explanations for different figures (e.g., standard pragmatic model and early conceptual metaphor theory, versus relevance theory). Mixtures of both disciplines have also been involved, as have approaches interested mainly in phenomena accompanying figurative language development/acquisition (e.g., reading, disorders, education), but including figurative abilities as measures in their research. The outcome of these efforts is a vast, complex set of partially interlocking literatures with much variability involving figures treated, processes involved, deficits or disorders measured and motivations for exploration. The set of cognitive/linguistic processes seen to underlie figurative abilities have also not changed drastically across this research era, nor have many of the empirical tools of assessment. Two alternative approaches are offered to potentially revitalize the headway in our endeavor to understand figurative language acquisition/development—one based on embodied simulations and another on pragmatic effects.",

Further, as in other investigations with the BigCAT (Vanryckeghem & Brutten, 2019), this self-report test revealed a statistically significant group mean difference between AWS and AWNS, suggesting the presence of a negative attitude towards communication in Kannada-speaking AWS. Further, individuals with severe stuttering had a significantly higher level of speech-associated negative attitude compared to those with mild stuttering. Age does not seem to influence the AWS’ speech-associated belief system.

The study aimed to report and discuss the normative data of the Italian version of ICS (ICS–I) in Italian-speaking preschool children, and to investigate whether the age influences the ICS-I scores (construct validity). Socio-economic status (SES) of the family were investigated and compared to parents' ratings on child's speech intelligibility. Methods A cross-sectional observational study was conducted. Italian-speaking children aged 3–6 years (n = 355; mean age = 56.06 months; SD = 9.8 months), without major developmental impairment, were recruited in kindergartens throughout a convenience sampling. Parents completed a self-report form on their family SES (educational level and employment status of fathers and mothers). Children were independently rated by their mothers (ICS-Im) and fathers (ICS-If). Results Results show that ICS normative data for the Italian preschool population (ICS-Im = 4.52; SD = 0.46; ICS-If = 4.47; SD = 0.49) are consistent with previous evidence found in other languages, suggesting that ICS could be a potential cross-linguistic tool to assess functional intelligibility. A statistically significant (p < 0.001) improvement in ICS-I score was found with increase of age (construct validity). No evidence of association (p > 0.05) with ICS-I was found for SES family. Conclusion The study provides normative data of the functional intelligibility assessed by a subjective parental scale. As for other previous international studies, ICS-I normative data suggest that a preschool child without major impairment shows a high degree of speech intelligibility, even if minimal differences of intelligibility are reported for different communicative partners. The current findings support clinicians and researchers in implementing ICS-I in typical and also in atypical population with different SES background and promoting its application as a potential outcome measure in children with Speech Sound Disorders.",Intelligibility in Context Scale; Norming data; Functional intelligibility; Speech sound disorder; Speech assessment; Parent report

Mitkov,2015,A semantic grammar for beginning communicators,article,Knowledge-Based Systems,ScienceDirect,"Beginning communicators are children faced with to the task of language learning. Young, typically developing children are early speakers before the age of 2years, the initial period of communication and language development. When this development is not happening because of disabilities or delays, it is possible to use computer-aided tools in order to help people to palliate or overcome such limitations, at least partially. For example, an Augmentative and Alternative Communication system must manage a vocabulary made up of several hundred concepts, usually without knowledge of the language at a semantic and pragmatic level. Such knowledge would make possible, for example, the implementation of new strategies for word prediction based on meaning, a very precise natural language generation or semantic parsing of the messages so that it would not allow the composition of meaningless messages. We present Simple Upper Ontology, SUpO, a semantic grammar which is made up of detailed knowledge of facts of the everyday life of simple words. In order to build SUpO we developed a procedure designed to give syntactic detail to part of FrameNet, a well-known ontology which encodes knowledge about usages of language at the semantic level. The result of this procedure is a multilingual semantic grammar which has been implemented by using Grammatical Framework. Finally, we propose some examples of tools where the use of SUpO would be suitable.",Ontology; Semantic grammar; Simple Upper Ontology; Grammatical Framework; FrameNet; Beginning communicators; Controlled language

Using an ERP measure with an implicit one-back repetition detection task, we investigated the neural basis of visual specialization for print in Chinese and English among eleven 7-to-8-year-old Hong Kong children, who were learning to read Chinese and English in parallel, though showing lower skills in English. N1 print tuning was found for both Chinese and English words, but was bilateral for Chinese and right-lateralized for English. In addition, the specialization effect of print started as early as in the time window of the P1, with a reduced P1 for Chinese and English words as compared to the visually matched control stimuli. These findings suggest that Chinese readers in 2nd grade show clear visual specialization for both Chinese and English print and that right-lateralized N1 specialization may be driven by less reading experience in English rather than by writing-specific effects induced by Chinese.",Print specialization; N1; Children; Second language learners

To this end, Dutch–English bilinguals read aloud L1 target words primed by L2 words, while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The onset of the primes was manipulated to disentangle the contributions of orthography and phonology (i.e. O+P+: kite – KUNST, ‘art’; O+P−: knee – KUNST; O−P+: crime – KUNST; O−P−: mine – KUNST). Phonological but not orthographic overlap facilitated RTs. However, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) revealed both orthographic and phonological priming starting 125ms after target presentation.

This study examined the impact that different definitions of recovery had on calculation of recovery rates and factors associated with recovery within the same sample of children. Method Speech samples and parents and child reports of their experiences of stuttering were collected from 38 children who stuttered aged 2–5 years of age (Occassion-1) and again at 9–13 years of age (Occassion-2). Four different criteria for recovery that were developed representing variations in criteria reported in previous research were applied to data from these children. Results . The majority of the participants (82%) showed very little disfluent speech (<1% syllables stuttered) at Occasion 2. Recovery rate varied greatly depending on the criteria used, ranging from 13.2%–94.7%. Definitions ordered from least to greatest recovery that were (a) parent and clinician report no stuttering and no stuttering observed (13.2 %); (b) ≤1% syllables stuttered; severity rated at ≤1; parent, clinician, and child report recovery (55.3 %); (c) ≤1% syllables stuttered; severity rated at ≤1; parent and clinician report recovery (71.1 %); (d) <3.0 % syllables stuttered (94.7 %). Five participants were considered recovered and two were considered persistent stutters across all criteria. Different factors were associated with recovery from stuttering depending on the criterion used. Conclusion The concept of recovery from stuttering is complex and estimations of recovery rate are likely to be greatly affected by differences in definitions and measurement across studies.

Methods This is an ad hoc analysis of a prospective cohort study on outcome prediction of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Patients with recovery of consciousness, who survived until hospital discharge, were subdivided in groups with and without delirium based on psychiatric consultation. Delirium phenotype and medical treatment were retrieved from patient files. All other data were prospectively collected. We used univariate analyses of baseline and early EEG characteristics for identification of possible delirium predictors. Association of delirium with neurological recovery at six months was analyzed with multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results Of 233 patients, 141 survived until hospital discharge, of whom 47 (33%) were diagnosed with delirium. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between patients with and without delirium. All delirious patients were treated with relatively high dosages of psychopharmaceuticals, mostly haloperidol and benzodiazepine agonists. Prevalent characteristics were disturbed cognition, perception and psychomotor functioning (98%). Half of the patients had language disorders or shouting. Delirium was associated with longer ICU and hospital admission, and more frequent discharge to rehabilitation centre or nursing home. There was a trend towards poorer neurological recovery. EEG measurements within 12 h after cardiac arrest could predict delirium with 91% specificity and 40% sensitivity.

Two general language measures were collected from the children: a standardized receptive vocabulary measure (Test de Vocabulario en Imágenes, TVIP), and a parental report of speech and language problems (PRSLP). In addition, four developmental language measures were calculated from a language sample collected using a story-retelling task: number of T-units (NU-TU), mean length of T-units (MLTU), subordination index (SUB-I), and grammatical errors per T-unit (GRE-TU). No statistically significant differences were found between the age groups on the standard scores for the TVIP or problem scores for the PRSLP, showing that the age groups were comparable. Increasing developmental patterns were found for NU-TU, MLTU and SUB-I. These data represent an important step in the characterization of typical language development for Spanish-speaking children.

Resumen En este estudio se han examinado algunas medidas del lenguaje espontáneo (SLM, por sus siglas en inglés) a partir de una narración en un grupo de niños hispanohablantes en edad preescolar. El objetivo de este trabajo es ofrecer una descripción del desarrollo de esas SLM y comprobar si muestran cambios significativos a lo largo del desarrollo lingüístico de los niños hispanohablantes. Los participantes en este estudio fueron 110 niños hispanohablantes monolingües divididos en tres grupos de edad: de 3, de 4 y de 5 años. Se tomaron dos medidas generales del lenguaje: el vocabulario receptivo con el TVIP (Test de vocabulario en imágenes) y la existencia de dificultades de habla y lenguaje por medio de un informe de los padres (PRSLP). Además, se utilizaron cuatro medidas de lenguaje espontáneo extraídas de la muestra de lenguaje: Número de unidades T (NU-TU), Longitud media de unidades T (MLTU), Índice de subordinación (SUB-I), y Número de errores gramaticales por unidades T (GRE-TU). No se encontraron diferencias significativas entre los grupos en los resultados del TVIP y del PRSLP, lo que ponía de manifiesto que los grupos eran iguales en habilidades lingüísticas generales. Las medidas NU-TU, MLTU y SUB-I mostraron un perfil evolutivo ascendente, con diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre los grupos.

The present study aims to examine how these ubiquitous neurophysiological attributes may inform us about the brain processes that underpin individual differences in speech perception and production, which in turn elucidate the specific functions of neural oscillations in the domain of speech processing. To this end, we recorded electrophysiological responses to a lexical tone contrast in a passive auditory oddball paradigm from two groups of healthy tone-language speakers who were equal in perceptual discriminability but differed in response latency and production distinctiveness of the tone contrast. Time-frequency analysis was applied to the EEG data, and decomposed into theta (4–7 Hz), beta (12–30 Hz), and gamma (30–50 Hz) frequency bands. Results show that listeners with longer discrimination RT and less distinctive production showed significantly higher induced (non-phase-locked) gamma during tone processing. Moreover, among speakers with less distinctive production, individual differences in induced gamma were significantly correlated with discrimination latency and production distinction. Based on the present findings, we propose that differences in gamma oscillations reflect differential sensory/perceptual computations during acoustic encoding, impacting the quality of perceptual representations, which further mediates individual differences in speech perception and production.",EEG; Neural oscillations; Speech perception; Speech production; Individual differences; Induced gamma oscillations

A further goal is to study how individual differences in children’s receptive language abilities are associated with such changes in cortical responses. Fourteen children, 10–16years old, participated in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment using a cross modal sentence-picture verification paradigm. We manipulated sentence difficulty and length in a 2×2 factorial design. Task-related activation covered large regions of the left and right superior temporal cortex, inferior parietal lobe, precuneous, cingulate, middle frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus. Sentence difficulty, independent of length, led to increased activation in the left temporal-parietal junction and right superior temporal gyrus. Changes in activation in frontal regions positively correlated with age-standardized receptive vocabulary scores and negatively correlated with reaction time on a receptive grammar test outside the scanner. Thus, individual differences in language skills were associated with changes in the network in response to changing task demands. These preliminary findings in a small sample of typically developing children suggest that the investigation of individual differences may prove useful in elucidating the underlying neural mechanisms of language disorders in children.",Language; Sentence comprehension; Children; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Individual differences; Inter-subject variability

Metzelthin and Hilde Verbeek and Jan P.H. Hamers and Sandra M.G. Zwakhalen,2021,A communication model for nursing staff working in dementia care: Results of a scoping review,article,International Journal of Nursing Studies,ScienceDirect,"Background Communication between nursing staff and people with dementia can be challenging. According to the literature, communication is seen as a process of social- and/or informational exchange between a sender and a receiver in a context. Factors related to these elements determine the quality of communication. Insight into the factors involved in the communication process between nursing staff and people with dementia is limited and a comprehensive model of communication in dementia care is lacking. Objectives To identify and visualize factors associated with communication between nursing staff and people with dementia. Design A scoping review of scientific literature. Data Sources Scientific articles were retrieved from the bibliographic databases of PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Review Methods The reviewing process was directed by the Joanna Briggs guidelines for scoping reviews. Full-text articles describing the communication process between nursing staff and people with dementia were eligible for inclusion. A data extraction form was used to identify factors associated with communication. Following a directed content analysis approach, factors were categorized in one of three categories: nursing staff; people with dementia; or context. Each category was thematically analysed to identify themes and subthemes. Results were visualized into a communication model. Results The review included 31 articles; in total, 115 factors were extracted. Thematic analysis of nursing staff factors (n = 78) showed that communication is associated with professional characteristics, individual experiences, verbal- and non-verbal communication skills, communication approach and values. Factors attributed to people with dementia (n = 22) concerned client characteristics, functional status, behaviour, verbal communication skills and values. Contextual factors (n = 15) related to organization of care, time and situation. Based on these results, the Contac-d model was constructed. Conclusions The Contac-d model gives a comprehensive overview of factors involved in the communication process between nursing staff and people with dementia, providing insight in potential starting points for communication improvement, e.g. respect for needs, identity and privacy of people with dementia, a flexible and adapted communication approach and matching language. Additionally, results suggest that an appealing location, longer duration of the interaction, and music in the surrounding may improve communication in certain situations. However, it was not feasible based on current literature to recommend what works to improve communication in which situations. Future studies should study factors and their interrelatedness in specific care situations. Authors further believe that more attention should be paid to strengths and capabilities of people with dementia and to non-modifiable factors that influence communication.",Communication; Dementia; Nursing care; Nursing staff; Quality of nursing care; long-term care

Multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling results suggested that the component skills of Chinese reading comprehension can be categorized into two major components: linguistic comprehension and decoding. The former is made up of oral narrative skills and syntactic skills, while the latter is made up of word recognition and reading fluency. The additive (i.e., linear) model with linguistic comprehension and decoding as predictors of reading comprehension provided an adequate account of the data in most analyses. The product of linguistic comprehension (syntactic skills) and decoding (word recognition/reading fluency) accounted for a significant amount of variance in passage comprehension at Grade 1 in addition to the linear contribution of linguistic comprehension and decoding.",Chinese; Oral language skills; Decoding; Reading comprehension; Simple view of reading

We report two experiments that examine how native language experience impacts the acquisition and processing of words with conflicting letter-to-sound mappings. Experiment 1 revealed that individual differences in nonverbal intelligence predicted word learning and that novel words with conflicting orthography-to-phonology mappings were harder to learn when their spelling was more typical of the native language than less typical (due to increased competition from the native language). Notably, Experiment 2 used eye tracking to reveal, for the first time, that hearing non-native spoken words activates native language orthography and both native and non-native letter-to-sound mappings. These findings evince high interactivity in the language system, illustrate the role of orthography in phonological learning and processing, and demonstrate that experience with written form changes the linguistic mind.",Letter-to-sound mapping; Phonology-to-orthography mapping; Phonology; Orthography; Word learning; Word processing; Parallel activation; Eye tracking; Visual world paradigm

The objective of the present study is to explore frequency, pattern and evolution of lesion-discordant aphasia following first ever acute stroke in Bengali-speaking subjects. Methods Bengali version of Western Aphasia Battery, a validated scale, was used for language assessment in our study subjects. Lesion localization was done by using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (3T) for ischemic stroke (if not contraindicated) and computed tomography (CT) for hemorrhagic stroke. Among 515 screened cases of first-ever acute stroke, 208 presented aphasia. Language assessment was done between 7 and 14 days in all study subjects and was repeated between 90 and 100 days in patients available for follow-up. Ischemic stroke cases with contraindication for MRI underwent CT imaging. Discordance between lesion and aphasic phenotype was determined only for right-handed subjects with cortical involvement (isolated or in combination with sub-cortical white matter) in the left hemisphere. Appropriate statistical tests were used to analyze the collected data. Results Lesion-aphasia discordance was found in 20 out of 134 patients with aphasia who were dextral and had cortical involvement in the left hemisphere (14.92%). The pattern of discordance observed were- posterior lesion with Broca's aphasia (4; 20%); posterior lesion with global aphasia (8; 40%); anterior lesion with global aphasia (4; 20%), and posterior lesion with mixed transcortical aphasia (4; 20%). On univariate analysis, the factors significantly associated with lesion-aphasia discordance were hemorrhagic stroke (p = 0.000); posterior perisylvian location (p = 0.002), and higher education (p = 0.048). After adjusting for all other variables, hemorrhagic stroke was found to have strong association with lesion-aphasia discordance (p = 0.001, OR = 11.764, 95% CI, 2.83–50.0). Discordant cases were more likely to recover or change to a milder type compared to concordant cases (p = 0.007, OR = 11.393, 95% CI, 1.960–66.231), after adjusting for all other variables including initial severity of aphasia (p = 0.006, OR = 8.388, 95% CI, 1.816–38.749). Conclusion Lesion-aphasia discordance following acute stroke is not uncommon among Bengali-speaking subjects. In the discordant group, preponderance towards non-fluent aphasia was observed. Discordance occurred more frequently after hemorrhagic stroke. Subjects with lesion-discordant aphasia presented better recovery during early post-stroke phase.",frequency; Lesion-aphasia discordance; Pattern; Recovery; Stroke

Although this observation indicates a role for attention in language processing, it is unclear whether this type of attention is part of basic speech perception mechanisms, higher-level language skills, or general cognitive abilities. The current study examined these possibilities by measuring ERPs from 5-year-old children listening to a narrative containing attention probes presented before, during, and after word onsets as well as at random control times. Children also completed behavioral tests assessing verbal and nonverbal skills. Probes presented after word onsets elicited a more negative ERP response beginning around 100ms after probe onset than control probes, indicating increased attention to word-initial segments. Crucially, the magnitude of this difference was correlated with performance on verbal tasks, but showed no relationship to nonverbal measures. More specifically, ERP attention effects were most strongly correlated with performance on a complex metalinguistic task involving grammaticality judgments. These results demonstrate that effective allocation of attention during speech perception supports higher-level, controlled language processing in children by allowing them to focus on relevant information at individual word and complex sentence levels.",Speech perception; Selective attention; Metalinguistic awareness; Development; Event-related potential

However, the nature of this relationship remains controversial because verbal STM, like reading acquisition, depends on the complexity of underlying phonological processing skills. This longitudinal study addressed the relation between STM and reading decoding acquisition by distinguishing between STM for item information and STM for order information based on recent studies showing that STM for item information, but not STM for order information, recruits underlying phonological representations. If there is a specific link between STM and reading decoding acquisition, STM for order information should be an independent predictor of reading decoding acquisition. Tasks maximizing STM for serial order or item information, measures of phonological abilities, and reading tests were administered to children followed from kindergarten through first grade. We observed that order STM capacity, but not item STM capacity, predicted independent variance in reading decoding abilities 1year later. These results highlight the specific role of STM for order in reading decoding acquisition and argue for a causal role of order STM capacity in reading acquisition.

The sample comprised 182 female students (Mage = 27.85, SD = 7.25) who completed the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), the Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). The results of the analyses of the regressions models using SEM revealed that parental care is associated with students’ lower imposter feelings via self-esteem, and paternal overprotection is associated with students’ higher imposter feelings via self-esteem. Hence, parental care and overprotection may be related to female students’ imposter feelings since they increase and decrease (respectively) their self-esteem which, in turn, affects their imposter feelings. The current study is among the first to demonstrate the mediation role played by self-esteem in the association in question separately for mothers and fathers, which contributes to facilitating the understanding of the etiology mechanism of the imposter phenomenon.",Imposter phenomenon; Parenting styles; Care; Overprotection; Self-esteem

The research team monitored the characteristics of the participants, the number of hours of services provided, and outcome measures related to employment. We then conducted descriptive analyses, t-tests, and Wilcoxon signed rank tests to compare anxiety about work and self-efficacy before services and after outcomes of the program. Results Despite high levels of comorbid mental health issues, our results indicated that 62.1 % of individuals obtained paid employment within 12 months. Furthermore, participants with post-secondary education found jobs related to their degree or requiring specialized skills. Participants felt less anxious and more self-efficacious towards employment. Maintaining employment was a greater challenge and continuing support may be required.

Materials and methods We developed the LT-LAEP and examined its psychometric properties. People with epilepsy (PWE) were asked to fill in the LT-LAEP, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale-7 (GAD-7), the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E), and a questionnaire addressing key demographic and clinical information. Antiseizure medicine (ASM) burden was expressed as a number of ASM and total drug load. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the influence of various variables on LAEP results. Results The data of 157 participants with the established diagnosis of epilepsy and stable ASM regimen were included in the final analysis. The mean LT-LAEP score was 48.72 ± 13.65. High internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.912) and test–retest reliability (ICC = 0.801) were demonstrated. The most common adverse effects (AEs) were tiredness (24.8%) and memory problems (23.6%). Lithuanian version of the Liverpool Adverse Events Profile score significantly correlated with NDDI-E (r = 0.635, p < 0.001) and GAD-7 (r = 0.640, p < 0.001) scores. The correlation between LT-LAEP score and total drug load was weak (r = 0.243, p = 0.002). The significant predictors of higher LT-LAEP score were female sex (β = −4.768, p = 0.003), higher seizure frequency (β = 4.757, p < 0.001), and higher NDDI-E (β = 1.457, p < 0.001) and GAD-7 scores (β = 0.610, p = 0.007) (F(4,152) = 43.975, R2 = 0.536, p < 0.001). Conclusions The LT-LAEP is a reliable and valid instrument for the evaluation of the AEs of ASM.

In the course of post-stroke aphasia different mechanisms can contribute to the recovery of language: recovery from ischemia, compensatory rerouting of language modalities and neuroplasticity occur at different time scales after the initial injury. These mechanisms may occur spontaneously or may be induced or influenced by various therapeutic interventions. This report contains a systematic review of the literature concerning the debated role of the right hemisphere in the recovery from stroke-related aphasia. The existing literature was approached using the PICOS principle and well-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although many gaps remain in the knowledge on the role of the right hemisphere, there is some evidence of a facilitation of spontaneous language recovery in the acute and subacute phase. In the subacute and chronic phase, the right hemisphere homologous language areas, along with memory and attention-related areas, facilitate treatment related improvement. In contrast, in therapy-free periods in the chronic stage, the right hemisphere no longer contributes to language recovery or may even be inhibitory.

Fox-Boyer,2022,"Diagnostic validity, accuracy and inter-rater reliability of a phonological assessment for Danish-speaking children",article,Journal of Communication Disorders,ScienceDirect,"Purpose The identification and differential diagnosis of children with speech sound disorders (SSD) is an important task of paediatric speech-language pathologists (SLPs). A correct identification requires valid and reliable assessment tools. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the diagnostic validity and accuracy as well as inter-rater reliability of the phonology test of LogoFova which was developed for Danish-speaking children. Method Investigation was carried out on two Danish-speaking populations: 61 suspected typically developing (TD) children and 61 children with suspected speech sound disorder aged 2–6 years. All children were assessed with the single-word picture-naming test of LogoFoVa. In order to determine diagnostic validity, it was investigated whether the test differentiated TD children from children with SSD as well as subgroups of SSD via a phonetic and phonological pattern analysis. Two different cut-off criteria were applied for the definition of patterns. Sensitivity and specificity as well as likelihood ratios were additionally calculated. To determine inter-rater reliability, transcriptions, pattern analyses and subgrouping were compared across raters. Results Overall, diagnostic validity of the picture-naming test of LogoFoVa was good as differentiation between TD children and children with suspected SSD as well as amongst subgroups of SSD (articulation impairment, phonological delay and atypical speech development) was possible. However, accuracy of differentiation between TD children and children with SSD was affected by the cut-off criterion applied. Inter-rater reliability was found to be almost perfect for transcription and moderate for identification of phonological processes as well as for subgrouping. Again, agreement rates depended on the cut-off criterion chosen for the definition of a phonological pattern. Conclusion LogoFoVa was found to be a reliable and valid clinical tool for the identification and subgrouping of children with SSD in Danish SLP practice if a new cut-off criterion was applied.",Phonology assessment; Test psychometrics; Speech sound disorder; Danish

Methods Trained undergraduates, onsite in the PED 30 hours/week during daytime and evening hours, weekdays and weekends, screened a convenience sample of families of patients in the PED for social needs, and provided information on available community resources. Families were offered a follow-up phone call several weeks after their PED visit to assess program satisfaction and success, and identify remaining social needs. Results Between January 2019 and March 2020, CHAT Desk screened and assisted 682 families. CHAT routinely provided resources about free outdoor recreational activities for families, but after that, the most commonly provided informational resources pertained to: healthcare (n=200), housing (n=143), and food (n=137). Of families who completed the follow-up phone call (n=294), almost half (n=134, 46%) reported being able to contact at least one of the resources; 100 reported that the resource was able to assist them, and 99 families planned to continue using the resource. When asked about satisfaction, 93% (n=274) reported being very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with CHAT; 94% (n=276) said they would recommend it to others.

However, research has often focused on school-age children in low-risk samples. This study utilized a series of latent profile analyses to identify different profiles of 521 toddlers in Early Head Start across behavioral and language domains. The study then examined individual, family, and socioeconomic predictors of profile. Data were drawn from the Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Study, a nationally-representative, prospective, longitudinal study of children assessed at ages 1, 2, and 3. The latent profile analyses suggested four distinct profiles of development at age 3: children who were well-adjusted, children with parent-reported behavior problems, children with staff-reported behavior problems, and children with multiple difficulties. Among the patterns of risk and protective factors, those in the profile with multiple difficulties were most likely to have missed early developmental milestones at age 1. Those in the parent-reported behavior problems profile experienced less supportive and more negative parenting, and had caregivers with higher levels of depressive symptoms than those who were well-adjusted. Those in the staff-reported behavior problems profile were more likely to be male as well as have higher levels of caregiver depressive symptoms. Overall, findings suggest unique patterns of risk factors for each profile, suggesting that interventions tailored to the precise needs of the family may be beneficial.",Person-centered; Profile; Behavior problems; Language delay; Low income; Parenting

Inter-talker variation in voice characteristics is traditionally seen as posing a challenge for infant language learners, who must disregard this variation when the task is to detect talkers’ shared linguistic conventions. However, talkers often differ markedly in their pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. This is true even in monolingual environments, given factors like gender, dialect, and proficiency. We therefore asked whether infants treat the voice characteristics distinguishing talkers as a cue for learning linguistic conventions that one talker may follow more closely than another. Supporting this previously untested hypothesis, 12-month-olds did not freely combine two talkers’ sentences distinguished by voice to more robustly learn the talkers’ shared grammar rules. Rather, they used this voice information to learn rules to which only one talker adhered, a finding replicated in same-aged infants with greater second language exposure. Both language groups generalized the rules to novel sentences produced by a novel talker. Voice characteristics can thus help infants learn and generalize talker-dependent linguistic structure, which pervades natural language. Results are interpreted in light of theories linking language learning with voice perception.",Language acquisition; Paralinguistic variation; Voice perception; Sociolinguistic variation; Exemplar models; General auditory account

Functional connectivity of the left frontal and temporal cortices and subcortical regions predicted reading speed. These results extend previous findings on the relationship between functional connectivity and reading competence in children, providing new evidence about such relationships in previously unexplored regions in the resting brain, including the left caudate, putamen and thalamus.

We assessed the perception and subcortical processing of speech in noise and related cognitive abilities in musician and nonmusician children that were matched for a variety of overarching factors. Outcomes reveal that musicians’ advantages for processing speech in noise are present during pivotal developmental years. Supported by correlations between auditory working memory and attention and auditory brainstem response properties, we propose that musicians’ perceptual and neural enhancements are driven in a top-down manner by strengthened cognitive abilities with training.

The impairment, not severe enough to elicit phonological errors, is associated with various alterations in the fine execution of speech sounds which cause the impression of foreignness. There is a growing interest in the study of linguistic and paralinguistic components, psychosocial aftermaths, and neural basis of FAS, but there are not yet neuroscience-driven treatments for this condition. A multimodal evaluation was conducted in a single patient with the aim of searching for clues which may assist to design neuroscience-driven therapies. The patient was a middle-aged bilingual woman who had chronic FAS. She had segmental deficits, abnormal production of linguistic and emotional prosody, impaired verbal communication, and reduced motivation and social engagement. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral small lesions mainly affecting the left deep frontal operculum and dorsal anterior insula. Diffusion tensor tractography suggested disrupted left deep frontal operculum-anterior insula connectivity. Metabolic activity measured with positron emission tomography was primarily decreased in key components of networks implicated in planning and execution of speech production, cognitive control and emotional communication (Brodmann’s areas 4/6/9/10/13/25/47, basal ganglia, and anterior cerebellar vermis). Compensatory increases of metabolic activity were found in cortical areas (left anterior cingulate gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus and right prefrontal cortex) associated with feedback and focal attention processes critical for monitoring and adjustment of verbal utterances. Moreover, bilateral structural and functional abnormalities probably interrupted the trajectory of the lateral and medial cholinergic pathways causing region-specific hypoactivity.

There are good reasons to expect such a relationship because learning to read involves learning the sounds of individual letters and possibly also sounds of strings of letters (e.g., spelling patterns). However, results from longitudinal studies have been mixed. A closer look at these studies suggests that PAL may be related to development of accuracy rather than speed in reading. This suggestion was investigated directly in the current longitudinal study. The study followed 137 students from Grade 0 (kindergarten) to Grade 5. In Grade 0, they completed measures of PAL, letter knowledge, phoneme awareness, and rapid automatized naming (RAN). In Grades 1 and 5, decoding accuracy was measured with the addition of decoding speed in Grade 5. PAL in Grade 0 was found to be a unique predictor of decoding accuracy in Grades 1 and 5 after controlling for Grade 0 letter knowledge, phoneme awareness, and RAN. PAL in Grade 0 even contributed to Grade 5 decoding accuracy after also controlling for Grade 1 decoding. Zero-order correlations between PAL and Grade 5 decoding speed were nonsignificant and close to zero. The results indicate that PAL measures a trait that may influence reading development over a substantial amount of time. Possible roles of PAL in decoding development over time are discussed, for example, how verbal learning may be a core component in the acquisition of associations between letter patterns (spelling patterns) and their pronunciation.",Paired associate learning; Reading development; Longitudinal prediction; Phoneme awareness; Letter knowledge; RAN

Processes involved in an N-back task include encoding, storing, rehearsing, inhibition, temporal ordering, and matching. Methods Fifteen AWS (11 males, 4 females; M = 23.27 years, SD = 5.68 years) and 15 AWNS (M = 23.47 years, SD = 6.21 years) were asked to monitor series of images and respond by pressing a “yes” button if the image they viewed was the same as the image one, two, or three trials back. Stimuli included images with phonologically similar (i.e., phonological condition) or phonologically dissimilar (i.e., neutral condition) names. Accuracy and manual reaction time (mRT) were analyzed. Results No difference was found between AWS and AWNS in accuracy. Furthermore, both groups were more accurate and significantly faster in 1- followed by 2- followed by 3-back trials. Finally, AWNS demonstrated faster mRT in the phonological compared to neutral condition, whereas AWS did not. Conclusion Results from this study suggest different processing mechanisms between AWS and AWNS for visually presented phonologically similar stimuli. Specifically, a phonological priming effect occurred in AWNS but not in AWS, potentially due to reduced spreading activation and organization in the mental lexicon of AWS. However, the lack of differences between AWS and AWNS across all N-back levels does not support deficits in AWS in aspects of working memory targeted through a visual N-back task; but, these results are preliminary and additional research is warranted.",Stuttering; Working memory; Central executive; N-back; Adults

It involves top-down influences from higher cortical levels on lower-level auditory processes. Individuals with congenital amusia have impaired pitch processing with reduced connectivity between frontal and temporal regions. This study examined whether deficits in amusia would lead to impaired perceptual adaptation in lexical tone perception. Thirteen Mandarin-speaking amusics and 13 controls identified the category of target tones on an 8-step continuum ranging from rising to high-level, either in isolation or in a high-/low-pitched context. For tones with no context, amusics exhibited reduced categorical perception than controls. While controls’ lexical tone categorization demonstrated a significant context effect due to perceptual adaptation, amusics showed similar categorization patterns across both contexts. These findings suggest that congenital amusia impacts the extraction of context-dependent tonal categories in speech perception, indicating that perceptual adaptation may depend on listeners’ perceptual acuity.",Congenital amusia; Perceptual adaptation; Tone categorization; Context; Pitch; Lexical tone

Yet, temporal misalignments in the presentation of visual and auditory stimuli may generate illusory phenomena such as the sound-induced flash illusion, in which a single flash paired with multiple auditory stimuli induces the perception of multiple illusory flashes. This phenomenon has been shown to be robust and resistant to feedback training. According to a Bayesian account, this is due to a statistically optimal combination of the signals operated by the nervous system. From this perspective, individual susceptibility to the illusion might be moulded through prolonged experience. For example, repeated exposure to the illusion and prolonged training sessions partially impact on the reported illusion. Therefore, extensive and immersive audio-visual experience, such as first-person shooter videogames, should sharpen individual capacity to correctly integrate multisensory information over time, leading to more veridical perception. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the temporal profile of the sound-induced illusion in a group of expert first-person shooter gamers and a non-players group. In line with the hypotheses, gamers experience significantly narrower windows of illusion (~87 ms) relative to non-players (~105 ms), leading to higher veridical reports in gamers (~68%) relative to non-players (~59%). Moreover, according to recent literature, we tested whether audio-visual intensive training in gamers could be related to the incidence of migraine, and found that its severity may be directly proportioned to the time spent on videogames. Overall, these results suggest that continued training within audio-visual environments such as first-person shooter videogames improves temporal discrimination and sensory integration. This finding may pave the way for future therapeutic strategies based on self-administered multisensory training. On the other hand, the impact of intensive training on visual-related stress disorders, such as migraine incidence, should be taken into account as a risk factor during therapeutic planning.",Multisensory; Temporal integration; Sound-induced flash illusion; Videogame; Migraine

This speech feature may also be helpful for early detection; however, studies involving patients at the pre-clinical, high-risk phase of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) have yielded varying results. Objective: To characterize the probability density distribution of speech pause durations in 26 patients with AD, 57 amnestic multi-domain amnestic MCI patients (29 with memory encoding deficits, a-mdMCI-E, and 28 with retrieval impairment only, a-mdMCI-R) and 29 healthy controls (HC) in order assess whether there are significant differences between them. To explore the potential differences in pause production between patients with a-mdMCI-E and a-mdMCI-R, as the former are considered to be at higher risk of progressing to dementia. Methods: The 112 picture-based oral narratives obtained were manually transcribed and annotated for the automatic extraction and analysis of pause durations. Different probability distributions were tested for the fitting of pause durations while truncating shorter ranges. Recent findings in the field of Statistics were considered in order to avoid the inherent methodological uncertainty that this type of analysis entails by addressing the question of temporal thresholding and its potential repercussions on inter-annotator reliability in manual transcriptions. Results: A lognormal distribution (LND) explained the distribution of pause duration for all groups. Its fitted parameters (μ, σ) followed a gradation from the group with shorter durations and a higher tendency to produce short pauses (HC) to the group with longer pause durations and a considerably higher tendency to produce long pauses with greater variance (AD). Importantly, a-mdMCI-E produced significantly longer pauses and with greater variability than their a-mdMCI-R counterparts (α=0.05). Conclusion: We report significant differences at the group level in pause distribution across all groups of study that could be used in future diagnostic tools and discuss the clinical implications of these findings, particularly regarding the characterization of a-mdMCI.",Alzheimer’s disease; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Speech; Natural language processing; Fluency; Statistical distributions

Participants read predictive stories in English that made a genitive construction consisting of a third-person singular possessive pronoun and a kinship noun (e.g., his mother) likely in an upcoming continuation. The possessive pronoun's form depended on the antecedent's natural gender, which had been previously established in the stories. The continuation included either the expected genitive construction or an unexpected one with a possessive pronoun of the opposite gender. We manipulated crosslinguistic (dis)similarity by comparing advanced English learners with either Swedish or Spanish as their L1. While Swedish has equivalent possessive pronouns that mark the antecedent's natural gender (i.e., hans/hennes “his/her”), Spanish does not. In fact, Spanish possessive pronouns mark the syntactic features (number, gender) of the possessed noun (e.g., nosotros queremos a nuestra madre “we-MASC love our-FEM mother-FEM). Twenty-four native speakers of English elicited an N400 effect for prenominal possessives that were unexpected based on the possessor noun's natural gender, consistent with the possibility that they activated the pronoun's form or its semantic features (natural gender). Thirty-two Swedish-speaking learners yielded a qualitatively and quantitatively native-like N400 for unexpected prenominal possessives. In contrast, twenty-five Spanish-speaking learners showed a P600 effect for unexpected possessives, consistent with the possibility that they experienced difficulty integrating a pronoun that mismatched the expected gender. Results suggest that differences with respect to the features encoded in the activated representation result in different predictive mechanisms among adult L2 learners.",Prediction; Crosslinguistic differences; Possessive pronouns; ERP; N400; P600

We compared the effects of diacritics that provide transparent but less familiar information and vowel letters that increase orthographic transparency without compromising familiarity. Brain activation was measured in 18 adults during oral reading of single words, while manipulating the presence of diacritic marks, the presence of a vowel letter, and word length (3 vs. 4 consonants). We found opposite effects of diacritics and vowel letters on temporo-parietal regions associated with mapping orthography to phonology. The increase in activation for diacritic marks and the decrease in activation for vowel letters in these regions suggest that the greater familiarity of vowel letters compared to diacritics overrides the effect of orthographic transparency. Vowel letters also reduced activation in regions associated with semantic processing in unpointed words, and were thus distinct from the effect of an additional consonant. Altogether the results suggest that both orthographic transparency and familiarity contribute to word recognition.",fMRI; Reading; Familiarity; Word length; Diacritics; Inferior parietal lobule

This study examined cognitive processing of children with reading disabilities based of Luria's three functional units of brain which are Planning, Attention, Simultaneous and Successive (PASS). Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) is capable of measuring the PASS cognitive processing, while Wide Range Achievement Test 4 (WART-4) was used to determine reading processes. CAS and WRAT were administered individually to 50 ESL poor readers in standard 3 at Sekolah Kebangsaan Bandar Tun Hussein Onn (SKBTHO). Profiles of the CAS and WRAT-4 were obtained, while the specific weakness of cognitive processing and reading processes were detected from the children with ESL reading difficulties. There were distinct PASS cognitive profiles among the poor readers of ESL children and gender was not the determinant. The PASS scale standard scores showed 41% (n=20) is at average level, 30% (n=16) is at low average level, 26% (n=13) is at below average level and only 2% (n=1) is at well below average level. There was no significant different between girls and boys in term of cognitive processing. However, girl subjects scored higher on Planning and Attention processing while boy subjects scored higher on Simultaneous and Successive processing. Overall, the poor ESL readers were significantly low for Simultaneous processing. Result of WRAT-4 indicated the subjects have low scores on comprehension (M = 66.64; SD = 5.12) and spelling (M = 68.00; SD = 12.07). Analysis correlation was used to indicate the relationship of cognitive processes and reading processes. There was significant relationship between PASS cognitive processing and reading composite (r = .382, p < .01) especially on word reading (r = .447, p < .01). The specific cognitive processes of planning and successive had significant relationship with word reading (r = .351, p < .05; r = .286, p < .05) respectively. While attention processing was significantly negative correlated with comprehension (r = -.296, p < .01). The simultaneous processing was significantly correlated with reading composite (r = .321, p < .05). No significant correlation between the spelling and the PASS cognitive processing was found. However, planning process was significantly correlated with the attention and successive processes (r = .516, p < .01; r = .338, p < .05) among the subjects. Reasons for this finding are suggested in the discussion and intervention was proposed that might help abilities of particular cognitive processing in enhancing reading processes.",PASS cognitive functions; CAS; Reading Difficulties; ESL; Reading processes

The N200 was more pronounced for pseudowords than for nonwords while no difference was found between known words and pseudowords. The amplitude difference between known words and pseudowords was, however, correlated with the productive vocabulary. Toddlers with a higher vocabulary score exhibited a bigger difference than toddlers with a lower vocabulary score. Similarly for the frontally distributed late negativity, only those toddlers with higher vocabulary knowledge exhibited a gradient pattern of activity in response to three word types while children with lower vocabulary skills exhibited a similar responsiveness to each word type.

Neural sensitivity to print was measured via a novel child friendly N170-elicitation paradigm. Our results highlight a transversal and longitudinal relation between rhythm sensitivity and letter name knowledge in pre-reading children. Moreover, they show that children’s rhythm sensitivity predicts a significant part of the variance of their N170 response one year later, highlighting the potential of rhythm tasks to predict future orthographic sensitivity in pre-reading stages. Interestingly, the relation between rhythmic skills and print sensitivity was not mediated by the children’s phonological short-term memory.

We used thematic analysis to analyze interview data from 15 Latinx parents who expressed concerns about their child’s (age 6–13) worry or sadness. Analyses revealed that Latinx parents often have difficulty identifying mental health problems, report stigma about mental health problems and help-seeking and want more information about how they can help their children. Although Latinx parents report significant mental health and treatment-seeking stigma, the majority were open to seeking mental health services for their children or were already receiving services. Findings suggest that stigma although prevalent, may not deter service utilization for some Latinx families.

We recently showed that sensitivity to morphological information in adult English readers is associated with the ventral reading pathways, bilaterally. It remains unclear, however, whether this association is specific to the English writing system. To shed light on this question, we investigated whether the associations between the ventral reading pathways and morphological sensitivity to word structure generalize across languages with different orthographies and morphological systems. To this end, we assessed neurocognitive correlations between white matter structural properties and morphological sensitivity in Hebrew, a Semitic language where morphemes are combined in a non-linear manner. We used diffusion MRI (dMRI) to segment ventral and dorsal tracts of interest in a sample of 43 adult Hebrew readers, who also completed a behavioral language assessment battery that included a morphological task. Significant correlations were found between morphological sensitivity and properties of bilateral ventral, but not dorsal, tracts. These correlations remained significant after controlling for measures of vocabulary and word reading, demonstrating their specificity to the morphological task. The current findings in Hebrew show striking similarity to prior findings in English. Our results support the view that morphological information contributes to lexical access along the ventral pathways, across orthographies and morphological systems.",Morphological processing; Derivational morphology; Reading; White matter tractography; Diffusion imaging; DTI; Hebrew

While reading Mandarin Chinese, the control group showed a left-hemispheric specialization within the 400–600ms interval in delta synchronization. However, delta synchronizations were widely distributed in all scalp regions and lasted longer than 600ms in the AS group. One possible interpretation of our data is the hypothesis that the AS group has more difficulty in brain organization of semantic and syntactic processes than the control group when reading their native language, because Chinese syntactic structure requires more work to be done by the perceiver. Nevertheless, other brain mechanisms (e.g., top-down regulation), can partially compensate for this difficulty, allowing AS subjects to attain the same level of response activity as the controls.",Asperger syndrome; Speech recognition; EEG; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs)

We review recent evidence from behavioral, functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and biologically plausible connectionist modeling approaches, focusing on how each approach provides insight into the temporal flow of information in the lexical system. We conclude that, consistent with interactive accounts, higher-order linguistic representations modulate early orthographic processing.

In this paper we test whether individual differences in inhibitory skill can lead to individual differences in phonological representations in perception and production. We further examine whether the type of inhibition that influences phonological representation is domain-specific or domain-general. Native French speakers read aloud sentences with words containing a voiced stop that either have a voicing neighbor (target) or not (control). The duration of pre-voicing was measured. Participants similarly performed a lexical decision task on versions of these target and matched control words whose pre-voicing duration was manipulated. Lastly, participants performed linguistic and non-linguistic inhibition tasks. Results indicate that the lower speakers' linguistic or non-linguistic inhibition is, the easier it is for them to recognize words with a voiceless neighbor when these words have a shorter, intermediate, pre-voicing rather than a longer one. Inhibitory skill did not predict recognition time for control words, indicating that the effect was due to the greater activation of the voiceless neighbor. Inhibition did not predict pre-voicing duration in production.

While neuropsychological evaluation may distinguish a neologistic component characterised by non-word production and a semantic component where pronounced words are real but speech is senseless, how this relates to the underlying white matter anatomy is debated. Objective To identify white matter pathways causally involved in jargonaphasia. Methods We retrospectively screened the intraoperative brain mapping data of 571 awake oncological resections using direct cortico-subcortical electrostimulation. Jargonaphasia was induced in 17 patients (19 sites) during a naming task. Stimulation sites were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute template space and used to generate individual disconnectome maps. Non-parametric voxelwise one and two sample t-tests were performed to identify the underlying white matter anatomy. Results Jargonaphasia was induced only during stimulation of the left hemisphere. No cortical stimulation generated jargonaphasia. Subcortical sites causally associated with jargonaphasia clustered in 3 regions: in the temporal lobe (middle to inferior temporal gyri; n = 12), in the parietal lobe (supramarginal gyrus; n = 3) and in the temporal stem (n = 4). Disconnectome analysis indicated the inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) was damaged in both neologistic and semantic jargonaphasia, while the involvement of the arcuate fasciculus was specific to neologistic jargonaphasia. Conclusion For the first time, we show that jargonaphasia is induced by white matter stimulation, hinting at disconnection. As IFOF disconnection unites both variants, these may represent a continuum of disorders distinguished by semantic impairment. Conversely, damage to the arcuate fasciculus in addition to the IFOF is specific to neologistic jargonaphasia, thus suggesting a dual-disconnection syndrome.",Arcuate fasciculus; Jargon; Jargon aphasia; Phonology; Semantics; Brain mapping

A first specific objective was to identify differences and similarities in early vocabulary development between children with cochlear implant (CI) compared with children with hearing aids (HAs)/Bone anchored hearing aids (Bahs) enrolled in a 3-year AVprogram, and to compare the group of children with HI to a control group of children with normal hearing (NH). A second specific objective was to study universal neonatal hearing screening (UNHS) using the 1-3-6 Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) guidelines. Introduction Effect of AV intervention for children with HI using different hearing technology is not thoroughly studied. It is relevant to question, whether children with mild to moderate HI encounter the same intensive need for AV intervention as children with congenital deafness. Methods A longitudinal and comparative study design was used involving two cohorts of children, i.e. 36 children with CI and 19 children with HA/Bahs. The children were the first in Denmark to receive a 3-year AV intervention by formally trained AV-practitioners. Children were tested annually with standardized speech and language tests, i.e. Peabody Picture Vocabulary test, Reynell test and a Danish test for active vocabulary, Viborgmaterialet. Categorical variables were compared using Fischer's exact test and continuous variables were compared using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, as data was not normally distributed. Results Median age of diagnosis was 6 months and median age at intervention was 13 and 12 months respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of scores according to age equivalency for the three tests. However, there was a significant difference between children with HI regardless of hearing technology and children with NH. Conclusion Children with HI progressed over a three-year period, but they did not reach the same level as children with NH. The high completion rate of 98,2% of families over a three-year period indicates the relevance of AV practice in a Nordic country. Children were diagnosed later than 3 months and intervention also started later than recommended.

A year of reading instruction was nevertheless sufficient to increase activation in regions involved in phonological representations (posterior superior temporal region) and sentence integration (temporal pole and pars orbitalis). A top-down activation of the left inferior temporal cortex surrounding the visual word form area, was also observed but only in 9year-olds (3years of reading practice) listening to their native language. These results emphasize how a successful cultural practice, reading, slots in the biological constraints of the innate spoken language network.",Child; fMRI; Brain development; Speech; Reading; Language comprehension

Early identification may significantly reduce this burden but relevant tools largely lack validation. We aimed to develop and evaluate the predictive validity of a simple screening tool for neurodevelopmental problems in a community sample of 30 month old children. A sample of children was selected from a community cohort screened at 30 months by health visitors using the Sure Start Language Measure (SSLM) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in 2011. Predictive validity was assessed by comparing screening results with detailed psychometric data from the same sample 1–2 years later. Screening performance using different thresholds was explored using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) with ROC area under the curve (AUC) and bootstrapping techniques. The SSLM predicted both language disorder identified by the New Reynell Developmental Language Scales (NRDLS) at follow-up (AUC 0.905) and global developmental delay assessed by the Griffiths Mental Development Scales (AUC 0.983). The SDQ administered at 30 months predicted psychiatric disorders identified by the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA) at follow-up (AUC 0.821). Using optimal cut-offs for the SDQ and SSLM at 30 months, both tools together had sensitivity 87%; specificity 64%; positive predictive value 31%; and negative predictive value 97% in the prediction of any kind of neurodevelopmental problem 1–2 years later. The combined measure reported here is not yet sufficient as a stand-alone population screening tool for neurodevelopmental disorders. The SSLM and SDQ did however show promise in identifying preschool children at risk of ongoing language, psychiatric disorders and global developmental delay 1–2 years later but with fairly high false positive rates. Given that current developmental risk prediction in resource-poor settings is little better than random assignment, the SDQ and SSLM may aid clinical judgement when used as interim triage tools for practitioners with no specialist knowledge, in the context of longitudinal follow-up arrangements.",Screening; Language delay; ESSENCE; Neurodevelopment; Neuropsychiatry; Paediatrics; Primary care

However, few Asia-based studies have explored cultural and linguistic adaptations of the MSEL or investigated its psychometric properties in populations with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Aims This study evaluated the reliability and validity of the MSEL-Taiwan version (MSEL-T) for Taiwanese children with ASD, global developmental delay (GDD), and typical development (TD). Methods and procedures The MSEL items were translated and modified according to the language and culture in Taiwan. In total, 191 children (ASD, 69; GDD, 36; and TD, 86) aged 19–68 months were assessed using the MSEL-T and Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2 (PDMS-2) at enrollment, followed by the assessments of Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-Chinese version (VABS-C) at the age of 36 months or later. Outcomes and results All subscales were verified to have good interrater reliability and internal consistency, and subscale scores indicated moderate to high correlations with PDMS-2 and VABS-C scores. Significant differences in MSEL-T scores were observed between same-aged pairs of children with TD and GDD and between pairs of children with TD and ASD. Conclusions and implications The findings provide evidence of validity and reliability of the MSEL-T. And it is suggested that the culturally and linguistically adapted MSEL-T is a good tool for the clinical assessment of children with and without ASD.",Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL); Validation; Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Cultural adaptation; Developmental assessment

In addition to FAS, which gave the impression she spoke with a German accent, German(-like) words and structures occurred. Speech symptoms were aggravated by increased stress, fatigue or emotional pressure, and this triggered jargon speech. It was hypothesized her FAS and jargon developed on a functional basis. Methods In-depth analyses of the patient’s medical background, neuropsychological and neurolinguistic tests and psychodiagnostic exams were done. The patient participated in an fMRI experiment. In a syllable repetition paradigm, motor speech activations were compared to those of healthy individuals, to see whether they were altered, which would be expected in case of a neurological etiology. Results Medical history disclosed prior traumatic experiences for which she sought help, but no neurological incidents. Repeated neuropsychological and neurolinguistic tests showed deficits in recent memory and executive functioning. The patient demonstrated great difficulties with picture naming. Clinically, language switching and mixing as well as recurring jargon speech was found. Formal psychodiagnostic tests did not identify a clear disorder, but psychodiagnostic interviews were consistent with a DSM-5 conversion disorder. The fMRI study demonstrated that speech network activations corresponded to those found in healthy participants. Conclusion The clinical neurolinguistic characteristics, outcome of the fMRI experiment, together with the clinical psychodiagnostic findings were strongly indicative for an underlying functional etiology for the FAS and jargon speech, presenting as symptoms of conversion disorder.",Foreign Accent Syndrome; FAS; Language mixing; Language switching; Jargon; fMRI; Speech; Accent; Functional disorder; Conversion disorder

We then examined whether these data-driven participant groupings were associated with improvement in inhibitory control. Latent class mixture modeling was conducted both with reaction time and a measure of response accuracy (d’) of log data. Results indicated two distinct classes based on reaction time, and four classes based on response accuracy over the course of training. Class membership based on reaction time was associated with differential improvements in performance on a subsequent standardized measure of inhibitory control. The findings point towards the need for formative metrics of progress, as well as the need for more adaptive and user-centered cognitive skills interventions.

In the field of motor speech disorders, such a cross-language approach could be of great interest to understand not only the deficits of speech production that are induced by the pathology, but also the difficulties that are induced by the linguistic constraints specific to the patients’ language. From a more clinical point of view, cross-linguistic studies should specifically focus on the relationship between speech disorders and speech intelligibility. The aim of this opinion article is to identify the currently scarce theoretical and clinical avenues for cross-linguistic studies of dysarthria in Parkinson’s disease, and to establish guidelines that would lead future research in this direction. In turn, the practical and behavioral management of dysarthria in Parkinson’s disease has so far only focused on the ‘universal’ dimensions of speech production and feedback (e.g., treatment of loudness and dysprosody). Such approaches could benefit immensely from proper recommendations that would be more ‘language-driven’ and individually adapted to the patients’ language environment. An additional factor to consider for a better understanding and treatment of dysarthria in PD is the role of adjustment and cultural identity.",Dysarthria; Parkinson’s disease; Cross-linguistic; Speech production; Speech intelligibility

The participants' social anxiety was positively correlated (at medium to strong size) with their impostor expressions. Perceived parental care was indirectly associated with the students' impostor expressions through social anxiety for mothers and fathers, meaning that the sample's students who perceived their parents as less caring exhibited greater impostor expressions because they were more socially anxious. Also, perceived paternal overprotection was associated with the students' impostor expressions through social anxiety. Namely, students who perceived their fathers as more overprotective had greater impostor expressions because they were more socially anxious.

However, advances in the field have failed to match the more general research on emotion and learning in psychology and education that has proven beneficial for understanding a broad range of emotions experienced in educational settings and has direct implications for classroom teaching. Specifically, the control-value theory (CVT) of achievement emotion, which addresses the origins and functions of diverse emotions in education, has gained strong momentum and emerged as a useful theoretical framework, although it is largely unknown and unused by L2 researchers. The present article aims to introduce the concept of achievement emotions into the L2 context and bridge the gaps between these two fields of emotion research. We first review research on emotions in second language acquisition (SLA) and identify crucial areas for improvement. Then, we discuss theory, measurement, and empirical studies related to the construct of achievement emotions.

Twenty-three native speakers of English read short contexts including three Noun Phrases (NPs) (e.g., Either an adviser or an agent can be helpful to a banker), followed by a wh-question that established the discourse role of each referent (In your opinion, which of the two should a banker hire?). The NP that the question was about (banker) was the Topic, and the two NPs that could fill the slot opened by the wh-question (adviser, agent) were the Focus NPs. The participants’ brain activity was recorded with EEG while they read the responses to the wh-questions, which differed along two dimensions: (1) the availability of the it-cleft construction (In my opinion, [it is] an agent…), a Focus-devoted device that makes Focus assignment predictable in the response; and (2) the discourse role of the target noun (Focus, Topic), which corresponds to the first referent in the response (In my opinion, [it is] an agent/a banker…). Crucially, we manipulated the phonological properties of the Focus and Topic nouns such that, if the Topic noun began with a consonant (e.g., a banker), both nouns that could fill the slot opened by the wh-question began with a vowel (e.g., an agent, an adviser) (counterbalanced in the overall design). This allowed us to measure effects of prediction at the prenominal article, before the integration of semantic and discourse information took place. The analyses on prenominal articles revealed an N400 effect for articles that were unexpected based on the phonological properties of the Focus nouns, but only in the conditions with the it-cleft. This effect emerged between 250 and 400 ms, with a frontal bias. The analyses on the noun revealed that violations of information structure (i.e., cases where the it-cleft was followed by the Topic noun) yielded a broadly distributed P600 effect, relative to appropriately clefted (i.e., focused) nouns. A similar (but numerically less robust) effect emerged for Topic relative to Focus NPs in the conditions without the it-cleft, suggesting that, in the absence of a constraining cue, comprehenders still assigned Focus to the first referent in the response. Overall, these results suggest that, when reading answers to wh-questions, comprehenders use information structure constraints (i.e., prior context + the it-cleft) to anticipate the form that the response should take (i.e., how information should be packaged).",Prediction; Information structure; Cleft; Focus; Topic; N400; P600

This includes interventions that address language and communication impairment (LCI), found to be present early in most types of dementia. Assessment of LCI can occur in many contexts (e.g., speech pathology, neuropsychology, occupational therapy) and is a vital initial step in providing adequate support to people living with dementia and their families. However, no previous research has compared the psychometric properties and utility of currently available and suitable tools for this purpose. Methods Eighteen tools with the potential to assess language and communication in dementia were identified through a two-stage process, and a synthesis of evidence is provided. Results Three tools satisfied all selection criteria: the Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia, the Sydney Language Battery, and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III. Main limitations of the 18 tools reviewed concern a lack of standardization, normative data, and criterion validity, as well as poor evidence of reliability of tools originally developed for non-neurodegenerative LCI (e.g., aphasia in the context of cerebrovascular accidents). Furthermore, no tool considers the perspectives of people with dementia regarding the impact of LCI on their daily lives. Conclusion Further research is needed to improve reliability and validity of currently available tools for the linguistic assessment of people living with dementia. Importantly, a tool to assess early identification of language and communication difficulties and associated needs among people with dementia is warranted to facilitate timely management and support.",dementia; assessment; language; communication; review

Weighted quantile sum regression analyses evaluated the contributions of specific PBDE congeners to observed associations. Greater RN efficiency was associated with better word reading in these novice readers. Children with higher ∑PBDE showed reduced GE of the RN; ∑PBDE was not associated with DMN efficiency, demonstrating specificity of our results. Consistent with prior findings, ∑PBDE was not associated word reading at 5-years-old.

Seventy–six Polish participants were presented with 24 nonwords paired with pictures; they completed 8 interleaving test blocks of form production and meaning recognition, both followed by feedback. The nonwords included “cognates” (nonwords resembling the Polish word for the object depicted in a given picture), “false cognates” (resembling a different Polish word than depicted), and “non–cognates” (nonwords different from Polish words). We measured the learning trajectories for all word types across the blocks. Cognates were fastest to learn in the recognition blocks as well as in the production blocks. Compared to non–cognates, false cognates were learned equally fast in the recognition blocks, but faster in the production blocks. This suggests the learning of false cognates benefits from the overlap in L1–L2 form and is not harmed by L1 interference, while the learning of cognates benefits from both form overlap and conceptual overlap. The study is unique as it examines how learners acquire both the form of new words, and the link between the L2 forms and their meanings.

Results The results suggest that, on most tasks, the effect of socio-educational status is mediated by language abilities. However, because the results were less clear for executive functions, we carried out a second experiment in which we administered more specific executive measures (i.e. inhibition, cognitive flexibility, updating and reasoning) to 80 children. Conclusion The results confirmed the influence of the parents’ educational status on the executive functioning and also that, contrary to other cognitive functions, this influence on executive tasks is not completely explained by language differences.

To account for these findings, Bastiaanse et al. (2011) formulated the PAst DIscourse LInking Hypothesis (PADILIH), in line with Avrutin's (2000) claim that discourse linking is impaired in Broca's aphasia. Past forms are impaired in opposition to non-past forms due to the fact that the former are discourse linked. However, this hypothesis entails further predictions: if the problem with tense is restricted to discourse linking, we expect present and future forms to be spared or, at least, damaged to the same extent. In this paper, we investigate time reference in Catalan and Spanish using a sentence completion task with pictures and a sentence-to-picture-matching task (adapted from the TART; Bastiaanse et al., 2008).

Abu-Dahab,2020,Sensory processing disorders in children with hearing impairment: Implications for multidisciplinary approach and early intervention,article,International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology,ScienceDirect,"Objective To explore the differences in sensory processing between children with hearing impairments and children with normal hearing and the variables that influence sensory processing disorder (SPD). Methods The sensory processing abilities of 90 children were compared in three age-matched groups of 30, with cochlear implants (CIs), hearing aids (HAs), and normal hearing (NH). The Arabic Sensory Profile (Arabic_SP) was used. Results Findings were presented in the Arabic_SP section and factor levels. Sections: The NH group performed better (p < .05) than the CI group in 57% of the sections and better than the HA group in 14%. The CI group exhibited more signs of SPD than the HA group with vestibular processing, multisensory processing, and emotional-social responses. Factors: The NH group differed from the CI group on all the factors that showed significance and from the HA group with inattention/distractibility and poor registration. There were great differences between the CI and the HA groups on all the factors except with poor registration and fine motor/perceptual. Hearing loss variables that most affected results in the Arabic_SP were the age at receiving a hearing device and type of hearing loss onset. Conclusion Along with speech and language problems, children with hearing impairment are especially vulnerable to SPD. Children with CIs and HAs are increasingly susceptible to auditory processing disorders. Higher risks of balance, multisensory processing, social-emotional, and fine motor problems are in children with CIs. Increased SPD risks came with a higher age at implantation. Findings indicate the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for early detection and intervention for children with hearing impairment, especially those with CIs.",Sensory processing disorders; Children; Hearing impairment; Cochlear implants; Hearing aids

The current study investigated the time course of talker normalization in typical listeners and individuals with congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of refined pitch processing. We examined the event-related potentials (ERPs) underling lexical tone processing in 24 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 24 typical listeners (controls) in two conditions: blocked-talker and mixed-talker conditions. The results demonstrated that for typical listeners, effects of talker variability can be observed as early as in the N1 time-window (100–150 ms), with the N1 amplitude reduced in the mixed-talker condition. Significant effects were also found in later components: the N2b/c peaked significantly earlier and the P3a and P3b amplitude was enhanced in the blocked-talker condition relative to the mixed-talker condition, especially for the tone pair that is more difficult to discriminate. These results suggest that the blocked-talker mode of stimulus presentation probably facilitates auditory processing and requires less attentional effort with easier speech categorization than the mixed-talker condition, providing neural evidence for the “active control theory”. On the other hand, amusics exhibited comparable N1 amplitude to controls in both conditions, but deviated from controls in later components. They demonstrated overall later N2b/c peak latency significantly reduced P3a amplitude in the blocked-talker condition and reduced P3b amplitude irrespective of talker conditions. These results suggest that the amusic brain was intact in the auditory processing of talker normalization processes, as reflected by the comparable N1 amplitude, but exhibited reduced automatic attentional switch to tone changes in the blocked-talker condition, as captured by the reduced P3a amplitude, which presumably underlies a previously reported perceptual “anchoring” deficit in amusics. Altogether, these findings revealed the time course of talker normalization processes in typical listeners and extended the finding that conscious pitch processing is impaired in the amusic brain.",Talker normalization; Time course; Talker variability; Congenital amusia; Cantonese tone; ERPs

The prevailing view – that sex differences arise from cochlear differences – remains unproven, and the extent to which these differences reflect distinct auditory processes is unknown. To determine the origin of subcortical sex differences, we mapped their emergence onto the peripheral-to-central maturation of the auditory system in 516 participants (250 female) across three age groups: 3–5, 14–15, and 22–26 years. To examine whether these sex differences arise from distinct processes, we compared developmental trajectories of each evoked-response component and tested their ability to predict a participant's sex and age. We find that some subcortical sex differences emerge well after the cochlea is mature and that each measure uniquely contributes to predicting participant demographics, indicating that sex differences arise from multiple central auditory processes.",Frequency-following response; Maturation; Auditory midbrain

However, the neural substrates underpinning this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here we manipulated language familiarity to test the hypothesis that phonological experience affects voice discrimination via mediating the engagement of multiple perceptual and cognitive resources. The results showed that during voice discrimination, the activation of several prefrontal regions was modulated by language familiarity. More importantly, the same effect was observed concerning the functional connectivity from the fronto-parietal network to the voice-identity network (VIN), and from the default mode network to the VIN. Our findings indicate that phonological experience could bias the recruitment of cognitive control and information retrieval/comparison processes during voice discrimination.

Cowan,2017,The structure of working memory in young children and its relation to intelligence,article,Journal of Memory and Language,ScienceDirect,"This study investigated the structure of working memory in young school-age children by testing the fit of three competing theoretical models using a wide variety of tasks. The best fitting models were then used to assess the relationship between working memory and nonverbal measures of fluid reasoning (Gf) and visual processing (Gv) intelligence. One hundred sixty-eight English-speaking 7–9year olds with typical development, from three states, participated. Results showed that Cowan’s three-factor embedded processes model fit the data slightly better than Baddeley and Hitch’s (1974) three-factor model (specified according to Baddeley, 1986) and decisively better than Baddeley’s (2000) four-factor model that included an episodic buffer. The focus of attention factor in Cowan’s model was a significant predictor of Gf and Gv. The results suggest that the focus of attention, rather than storage, drives the relationship between working memory, Gf, and Gv in young school-age children. Our results do not rule out the Baddeley and Hitch model, but they place constraints on both it and Cowan’s model. A common attentional component is needed for feature binding, running digit span, and visual short-term memory tasks; phonological storage is separate, as is a component of central executive processing involved in task manipulation. The results contribute to a zeitgeist in which working memory models are coming together on common ground (cf.

The current study examined whether 23 Japanese adult learners of English could create a new vowel category along the spectral dimension after phonetic training with the English vowels /i/-/ɪ/ as in beat and bit. As in previous training studies, the Japanese trainees improved their ability to categorize the vowels in tokens included in the training, and were able to generalize to novel tokens and talkers. A cue-weighting task confirmed that the Japanese trainees categorized the vowels based on temporal cues before training, presumably because vowel duration is used phonologically in Japanese. While 12 of the Japanese trainees still relied on vowel duration to distinguish the English vowels after training, 11 of them successfully created a new vowel category along the spectral dimension. However, their category boundary between /i/-/ɪ/ was set at a different location from that of native speakers. We interpret these results as providing evidence that it is possible for late inexperienced learners to create new phonetic categories with phonetic training, but that the new categories may be subject to phonetic category dissimilation, an effect previously documented with early bilinguals.",Second language acquisition; Perceptual learning; Phonetic training; Cue-weighting; Vowel perception; English vowels; Japanese

Specifically, the paper examines how socio-economic status and mobility intersect in the urban-rural fringe to influence the educational outcomes of young migrants. The paper uses survey data collected from over 500 students and 230 parents in Galway city and urban-rural fringe. The analysis highlights the overlapping and mutually constitutive relationship between Galway city and its urban-rural fringe in terms of student commuting patterns and suggests that potential achievement gaps may in part be related to residential patterns and segregated attendance between schools. It also highlights that the ability of foreign born students with foreign born parents to acquire educational capital is diminished in the urban-rural fringe, with important consequences for realizing future educational aspirations.",Urban-rural fringe; Commuting; Educational achievement; Young migrants

This usage was widely adopted in the fields of education and psychology. This article examines the distribution of both patterns in the electronic archives of the Houston Chronicle from 2002 to 2007, well after the suggestion for postmodification euphemism was launched, to investigate how widely the pattern has been adopted in everyday language use. The data from the Houston Chronicle are compared to the usage patterns in Google News (http://news.google.com/). Contrary to the usage in contemporary educational and psychological literature, the Houston Chronicle seems to favor the ‘non-PC’ usage: over 70% of the phrases resort to premodification. The distribution of ‘non-PC’ vs. ‘PC’ phrases, however, is not random: premodification refers to ‘undesirable’ societal elements (e.g., prisoners) or, for instance, to fictional characters in movie descriptions; by contrast, postmodification is reserved for children or non-criminal adults. The juxtaposition of these patterns in contemporary newspaper articles, and their deliberate separation in terms of the semantics of the referent (premodification for ‘undesirable’ or fictional referents; postmodification for ‘vulnerable’ referents) is likely to block the broader adoption of the ‘PC’ syntactic pattern and will ultimately fuel a desire for further euphemisms dependent on lexical innovations. The same patterns appear in Google News; however, lexically ‘non-PC’ usage, together with metalinguistic discussions of how to refer to the target group are much more prevalent in Google News than in the Houston Chronicle.",Political correctness; Euphemism; Language change; ‘People first’ language; Noun modification; Media language

We conducted a systematic literature review synthesizing results from studies examining sex differences in brain structure and function relevant to language development during childhood. We searched PubMed and Scopus databases, and this returned a total of 46 published studies meeting criteria for inclusion that directly examined sex differences in brain development relevant to language function in children. The results indicate that: (a) sex differences in brain structure or function do not necessarily lead to differences in language task performance; (b) evidence for sex differences in brain and language development are limited; (c) when present, sex differences often interact with a variety of factors such as age and task. Overall, the magnitude of sexual dimorphism of brain developmental trajectories associated with language is not as significant as previously thought. Sex differences were found, however, in studies employing tighter age ranges. This suggests that sex differences may be more prominent during certain developmental stages but are negligible in other stages, likely due to different rates of maturation between the sexes. More research is needed to improve our understanding of how sex differences may arise due to the influence of sex hormones and developmental stages, and how these differences may lead to differences in various language task performance. These studies are expected to provide normative information that may be used in studies examining neurodevelopmental disorders that frequently affect more males than females, and also often affect language development.",Sex differences; Children; Brain; Language; Development; Laterality

Practical considerations,article,Neurochirurgie,ScienceDirect,"Introduction The aim of brain glioma surgery is to maximize the quality of resection, while minimizing the risk of sequelae. Due to the frequent location of gliomas near or within eloquent areas, owing to their infiltrative feature, and because of major interindividual variability, the anatomofunctional organization and connectivity must be studied individually. Therefore, to optimize the benefit-to-risk ratio of surgery, intraoperative functional mapping is extensively used. Material and methods This article aims at describing the rationale, indications and practical aspects of intraoperative direct electrical bipolar electrostimulation for cortical and subcortical mapping under awake conditions using the asleep-awake asleep anaesthetic protocol in the setting of cerebral gliomas. We will address the operative approach, including patient positioning, functional mapping resection strategy, anaesthetic conditions, as well as tips and pitfalls. Results The intraoperative direct electrical bipolar electrostimulation enables: (i) to study the real-time individual cortical functional organization; (ii) to study the anatomofunctional subcortical connectivity along the resection; (iii) to tailor the resection according to individual corticosubcortical functional boundaries. This is an easy, accurate, reliable, well-tolerated and safe detection technique of both cortical and subcortical functionally essential structures during resection. It should be performed in the context of a standardized protocol involving members of both anaesthesiology and neurosurgery teams at neurosurgical centers specialized in surgical neuro-oncology. Conclusion Intraoperative direct electrical bipolar electrostimulation for cortical and subcortical mapping under awake conditions is currently considered the “gold standard” clinical tool for brain mapping during cerebral resection in neuro-oncology.",Awake surgery; Brain mapping; Cortical mapping; Direct electrical stimulation; Functional neuro-oncology; Subcortical mapping

The second year of life marks a period of dramatic advances in infants’ expressive and receptive word-processing abilities. Studies show that in adulthood, language processing is left-hemisphere dominant. However, adults learning a second language activate right-hemisphere brain functions. In infancy, acquisition of a first language involves recruitment of bilateral brain networks, and strong left-hemisphere dominance emerges by the third year. In the current study we focus on 14-month-old infants in the earliest stages of word learning using infant magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain imagining to characterize neural activity in response to familiar and unfamiliar words. Specifically, we examine the relationship between right-hemisphere brain responses and prospective measures of vocabulary growth. As expected, MEG source modeling revealed a broadly distributed network in frontal, temporal and parietal cortex that distinguished word classes between 150–900 ms after word onset. Importantly, brain activity in the right frontal cortex in response to familiar words was highly correlated with vocabulary growth at 18, 21, 24, and 27 months. Specifically, higher activation to familiar words in the 150–300 ms interval was associated with faster vocabulary growth, reflecting processing efficiency, whereas higher activation to familiar words in the 600–900 ms interval was associated with slower vocabulary growth, reflecting cognitive effort. These findings inform research and theory on the involvement of right frontal cortex in specific cognitive processes and individual differences related to attention that may play an important role in the development of left-lateralized word processing.",Language; Right hemisphere; Attention; Infants; Magnetoencephalography

However, coarticulation causes phonemes to differ based on their context. Because coarticulation is an ever-present component of the speech stream, it follows that listeners may exploit this source of information for cues to the identity of the words being spoken. This research investigates the development of listeners’ sensitivity to coarticulation cues below the level of the phoneme in spoken word recognition. Using a looking-while-listening paradigm, adults and 2- and 3-year-old children were tested on coarticulation cues that either matched or mismatched the target. Both adults and children predicted upcoming phonemes based on anticipatory coarticulation to make decisions about word identity. The overall results demonstrate that coarticulation cues are a fundamental component of children’s spoken word recognition system. However, children did not show the same resolution as adults of the mismatching coarticulation cues and competitor inhibition, indicating that children’s processing systems are still developing.",Coarticulation; Spoken word recognition; Language processing; Eye-tracking; Lexical competition; Vowel nasalization

Methods Relevant randomized controlled trials were retrieved from 11 electronic databases. A methodological quality assessment was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook, and meta-analyses were performed by using RevMan 5.2. A descriptive analysis was conducted when the included trials were not suitable for a meta-analysis. Results A total of 12 trials were included. A statistically significant group difference was shown from the meta-analysis in the results measured by the Western Aphasia Battery (random-effects model, MD = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.31 to 2.14, P < 0.01). However, there were no statistically significant differences shown in the results of the Boston Naming Test (fixed-effects model, MD = −1.79, 95% CI = −11.19 to 7.62, P > 0.05) and Aachen Aphasia Test (fixed-effects model, MD = −1.11, 95% CI = −4.49 to 2.27, P > 0.05). The descriptive analysis showed positive results in language performances of naming, repetition, and comprehension. Conclusion This systematic review indicated that CIAT was efficient for improving language performance with regard to naming, comprehension, repetition, written language, and oral language based on the current evidence. And this review provides some meaningful guides for clinical practice: expand the therapy duration to 2 or 3 h per day, focus on naming, and choose the best assessment tool.

Despite their major contributions, however, both fields have been undermined by a tradeoff between ecological validity (i.e., the degree to which tasks reflect the conditions of everyday communication) and experimental control (the manipulation of fine-grained variables, which is typically achieved by matching lists of decontextualized words and sentences). Specifically, most extant research sacrifices the former requisite in pursuit of the latter, or vice versa, but both are rarely met in combination. To overcome this problem, we have relied on Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and designed a protocol for constructing carefully matched but fully naturalistic narratives usable in experimental settings. First, we describe the limitations of mainstream language experiments and their poor ecological validity. Second, we introduce an SFL-based protocol that allows constructing naturalistic stories that differ in one critical target variable while guaranteeing statistical comparability in multiple other factors. Third, we illustrate how the protocol has been successfully implemented in two groundbreaking studies exploring the links between biological motor systems and lexico-semantic processing.

Several studies have reported negative associations between prenatal exposure to these compounds and aspects of cognition related to language in early childhood. Objectives The aim was to examine the association between maternal low level dietary exposure to dioxins and PCB during pregnancy and language development in 3year old children in a large group of mother-child pairs participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Methods This study includes 44,092 children of women who were recruited to the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) during the years 2002–2009. Maternal dietary exposure to dioxins and PCBs was estimated based on a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) answered mid-pregnancy and a database of dioxin and PCB concentrations in Norwegian foods. Exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-compounds) was expressed in total toxic equivalents (TEQ), and PCB-153 was used as marker for non-dioxin-like PCBs (ndlPCBs). Children's language skills at age 3 were assessed by parental report including a Dale and Bishop grammar rating and questions about communication skills from the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). Logistic regression models adjusted for confounders were used to examine the association between maternal dietary exposure to dl-compounds or PCB-153 and language development in children. Results The maternal dietary exposure to dl-compounds and PCB-153 was generally low, and 98% of women had intakes of dl-compounds ≤14pg TEQ/kg bw/week, which is the tolerable weekly intake set by EU's Scientific Committee for Food (SCF). High maternal exposure (>14pg TEQ/kg bw/week of dl-compounds (median 2.6pg/kg bw/day, range 2–16) or >97.5-percentile intake of PCB-153 (median 11ng/kg bw/day, range 5–28) was associated with higher odds of incomplete grammar (in boys and girls, adjusted ORs 1.1 to 1.3) and severe language delay in girls, adjusted ORs 2.8 [95% CI 1.1, 7.1] for PCB-153 and 2.9 [95% CI 1.4, 5.9] for dl-compounds. Furthermore, high exposure to dl-compounds was associated with moderate language delay 1.4 [95% CI 1.0, 2.0] and lower communication score (ASQ), adjusted OR 1.4 [95% CI 1.1, 1.9] in girls. Conclusions The main findings of this study were: 1) Girls born to mothers who exceeded the tolerable weekly intake for dl-compounds or had a PCB-153 intake above the 97.5 percentile in early pregnancy may have increased risk of language delay at age 3years. 2) Negative associations with maternal exposure to dl-compounds or PCB-153 were observed for both boys and girls having incomplete grammar, which is a subtle reduction in language skills.

Results suggested that older adults performed worse in vowel discrimination despite normal-for-age pure-tone hearing. In the older group, we found evidence that those with greater age-related cortical atrophy (i.e., lower cortical surface area and cortical volume) in the left and right PT also showed weaker vowel discrimination. In comparison, we found a lateralized correlation in the younger group suggesting that those with greater cortical thickness in only the left PT performed weaker in the vowel discrimination task. We did not find any associations between macroanatomical traits of the PT and MMN responses. We conclude that deficient vowel processing is not only caused by pure-tone hearing loss but is also influenced by atrophy-related changes in the ageing auditory-related cortices. Furthermore, our results suggest that auditory processing might become more bilateral across the lifespan.",Presbycusis; Vowel perception; Neural atrophy; Mismatch negativity; Spectral processing; Planum temporale

Here, we asked whether Swedish deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) children who are more aware of the phonology of Swedish Sign Language, a language with no orthography, are better at reading words in Swedish. Methods and procedures We developed the Cross-modal Phonological Awareness Test (C-PhAT) that can be used to assess PA in both Swedish Sign Language (C-PhAT-SSL) and Swedish (C-PhAT-Swed), and investigated how C-PhAT performance was related to word reading as well as linguistic and cognitive skills. We validated C-PhAT-Swed and administered C-PhAT-Swed and C-PhAT-SSL to DHH children who attended Swedish deaf schools with a bilingual curriculum and were at an early stage of reading. Outcomes and results C-PhAT-SSL correlated significantly with word reading for DHH children. They performed poorly on C-PhAT-Swed and their scores did not correlate significantly either with C-PhAT-SSL or word reading, although they did correlate significantly with cognitive measures. Conclusions and implications These results provide preliminary evidence that DHH children with good sign language PA are better at reading words and show that measures of spoken language PA in DHH children may be confounded by individual differences in cognitive skills.",Deafness; Sign language; Phonological awareness; Handshape; Word reading

Drawing on the tools of narrative analysis and critical discourse analysis, we identified five different kinds of counter-narratives. The counter-narratives are diverse in thematic focus and grammatical structure. They vary in how they couple critique with action, alternate vision, acceptance or an emerging counter-narrative. We define each type of counter-narrative, give a representative example and identify the discursive features associated with each type.

Data Sources Using the Cochrane Stroke Strategy, we searched 10 databases, 13 journals, 3 conferences, and the gray literature. Study Selection Our a priori protocol criteria included unselected samples of adult stroke patients from randomized controlled trials or consecutive cohorts. Two independent reviewers rated abstracts and articles for exclusion or inclusion, resolving discrepancies by consensus. Data Extraction We documented aphasia frequencies by stroke type and setting, and computed odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for outcomes. Data Synthesis We retrieved 2168 citations, reviewed 248 articles, and accepted 50. Median frequencies for mixed stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) were 30% and 34% for acute and rehabilitation settings, respectively. Frequencies by stroke type were lowest for acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (9%) and highest for acute ischemic stroke (62%) when arrival to the hospital was ≤3 hours from stroke onset. Articles monitoring aphasia for 1 year demonstrated aphasia frequencies 2% to 12% lower than baseline. Negative outcomes associated with aphasia included greater odds of in-hospital death (OR=2.7; 95% CI, 2.4–3.1) and longer mean length of stay in days (mean=1.6; 95% CI, 1.0–2.3) in acute settings. Patients with aphasia had greater disability from 28 days (OR=1.5; 95% CI, 1.3–1.7) to 2 years (OR=1.7; 95% CI, 1.6–2.0) than those without aphasia. By 2 years, they used more rehabilitation services (OR=1.5; 95% CI, 1.3–1.6) and returned home less frequently (OR=1.4; 95% CI, 1.2–1.7). Conclusions Reported frequencies of poststroke aphasia range widely, depending on stroke type and setting. Because aphasia is associated with mortality, disability, and use of health services, we recommend long-term interdisciplinary vigilance in the management of aphasia.",Aphasia; Outcome assessment (health care); Rehabilitation; Review; Stroke

However, children's propensity to gesture varies, and the mechanisms underlying these individual differences remain unknown. The present study tests whether gesture production in the presence of speech (bimodal gestures) or in the absence of speech (unimodal gestures) is predicted by working memory and articulation performance associated with verbal processing. Children aged 22–46 months were presented with a gesture elicitation task in which they needed to correct the actions of a puppet using everyday objects in an unconventional way. Working memory was measured by the Imitation Sorting Task (IST) and articulation performance was indexed by the Non-Word Repetition Task (NWR). It was revealed that any increase in working memory capacity was linked to a higher incidence rate of gesturing in toddlers and working memory was differentially associated with the production of unimodal and bimodal gestures. When gestures were produced without speech, they primarily relied on attentional processes as indicated by working memory capacity. Conversely, when gestures were produced with speech, it was the articulation performance supporting speech processing that predicted the number of bimodal gestures. Overall, unimodal and bimodal gestures seem to have different working memory demands.",Working memory; Articulation performance; Unimodal gesture; Bimodal gesture

Hansen,2013,Cerebral mechanisms for different second language writing systems,article,Neuropsychologia,ScienceDirect,"In this fMRI study, we examined the cerebral processing associated with second language (L2) reading in different writing systems in late L2 learners. To examine the impacts of cross-linguistic differences between the first language (L1) and L2 on learning to read in L2, we employed a bidirectional approach and compared brain activation during single word processing in two groups of late L2 readers: (1) L2 readers of English whose L1 was Japanese (Japanese-L1/English-L2) and (2) L2 readers of Japanese (of syllabic Kana only) whose L1 was English (English-L1/Japanese-L2). During English reading, the L2 readers of English (Japanese-L1/English-L2) exhibited stronger activation in the left superior parietal lobule/supramarginal gyrus, relative to the L1 readers of English (English-L1/Japanese-L2). This is a region considered to be involved in phonological processing. The increased activation in the Japanese-L1/English-L2 group likely reflects the increased cognitive load associated with L2 English reading, possibly because L1 readers of Kana, which has an extremely regular orthography, may need to adjust to the greater phonological demands of the irregular L2 English orthography. In contrast, during Kana reading, the L2 readers of Japanese Kana (English-L1/Japanese-L2) exhibited stronger activation in the lingual gyrus in both the left and right hemispheres compared to the L1 readers of Kana (Japaese-L1/English-L2). This additional activation is likely to reflect the lower level of visual familiarity to the L2 symbols in the English-L1/Japanese-L2 group; Kana symbols are uniquely used only in Japan, whereas Roman alphabetic symbols are seen nearly everywhere. These findings, bolstered by significant relationships between the activation of the identified regions and cognitive competence, suggest that the cerebral mechanisms for L2 reading in late learners depends both on which language is their L1 and which language is to be learnt as their L2. Educational implications of these results are discussed.",Second language reading; Different writing systems; Orthographic regularity; English; Japanese Kana

This study assessed and compared cognition in patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, n = 32, age = 61.09 ± 5.97 years), PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC, n = 32, age = 58.81 ± 6.15 years) and healthy controls (HC, n = 38, age = 57.39 ± 7.14 years). Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA) was used for categorization of subjects. Cognitive assessment of five domains: executive function, attention, visuospatial function, memory and language (using two tests in each domain) were performed. The effect of PD clinical scores on cognition and cognitive domain specificity in diagnosing PD-MCI were assessed by correlation and receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses, respectively. All the analyses followed removal of potential confounds (age, education and clinical scores). Attention, memory, executive and visuospatial functions were impaired in PD-MCI on comparison with HC and PD-NC groups. Performance in digit span forward and trail making tests for attention and memory (immediate recall) were comparable in both the PD groups. Both the PD groups revealed impairment in attention, memory and language with respect to HC, suggesting the fronto-striatal and posterior cortical syndrome in PD. Highly significant Visual-N-back correlation with UPDRS-III may implicate the shared motor-visuospatial neural pathways.

By the end of 2014 a total of 51, 705 children crossed the southwest border of the Rio Grande. The initial influx of child migrants into the Hudson Valley created a humanitarian crisis. The overwhelming majority of kids spoke either Spanish or only their indigenous language and many were traumatized by the journey. There were no services in place for these minor children or for their sponsors. Service providers, educators, and immigration lawyers were caught off guard and scrambled desperately to find solutions to the complex problems associated with the unprecedented arrival of unaccompanied immigrant children. This research examines how federal immigration policy impacted child migrants at the local Hudson Valley level and the collective response by service providers, educators, activists, and immigration lawyers to effectively deal with the crisis. Through twenty-five qualitative interviews, obtained via snowball sample, we present the voices of those on-the-ground individuals who responded to the lack of support for these kids, and attempted to organize an interconnected web of local services, in the context of federal immigration policy. In addition, we present alternative policy recommendations formulated by service providers and immigration advocates based on their experiences working with unaccompanied minors and their family members.

Regression analysis revealed that word recognition, vocabulary, cognitive flexibility and listening span task performance contributed directly to reading comprehension. Adding the listening span task to the model led to a change in the beta-values of storage, inhibition and cognitive flexibility, indicating that these variables shared variance with listening span task performance.

These three points were examined via results on an elicited production probe administered to 36 typically-developing 6- and 11-years-olds, and to 71 adolescents whose language has developed since childhood in the context of pathologies associated with varying degrees of severity for language development: SLI, mild-to-moderate hearing loss, and Rolandic Epilepsy. It was found that accusative clitic production remained weak long after childhood in adolescents whose language developed atypically, no matter what the cause of the atypical development was and no matter how severe its effects on language are, and that this low production concerned particularly or exclusively third person accusative clitics. Moreover, a strong age-effect was found between the TD 6- and 11-year-olds, for accusative clitic production. These results are interpreted as providing evidence that difficulty with third person accusative clitics stems from non-optimal functioning of extra-linguistic systems which are sensitive to the complexity of linguistic operations.",Acquisition; French; SLI; Mild-to-moderate hearing loss; Epilepsy; Accusative clitics

Awake intraoperative brain mapping is the gold standard technique used to optimise the onco-functional balance. Neuropsychological assessment and intervention have relevance in this type of procedures. Currently, there is a lack of protocolled structure for the neuropsychological intervention being able to satisfy patient needs. Method A retrospective descriptive study of 52 patients was performed, all of them with a diagnosis of glial tumour. The structure of the protocol developed in our centre is reported, also data of neuropsychological evaluation, comparing baseline performance with both immediate posterior performance, and long term performance. Results We describe our experience in each step of the intervention, highlighting the development of eight neurocognitive protocols for intraoperative brain mapping. The results of the neuropsychological examination objectify deficits in the immediate after surgery assessment which are reduced in the long-term assessment. Conclusions We emphasize the need of providing and structuring the cognitive and emotional aspects of patients suffering from any pathology that entails acquired brain damage in hospital environment.

Método Participaron 25 niños/as con TDL y 25 niños/as con desarrollo típico, de entre 5 y 8 años de edad, bilingües del catalán y español, emparejados por edad y sexo. La subprueba estructura de palabras evaluó la producción de palabras, concretamente flexiones nominales y verbales, palabras derivadas, comparaciones y el uso de pronombres. A nivel receptivo se evaluó la comprensión de estructuras sintácticas a través de la subprueba estructura de oraciones, en la cual tuvieron que elegir imágenes que ilustraban el significado de la oración. Finalmente, la producción de oraciones se evaluó con la subprueba de formulación de oraciones, indicando a los participantes la palabra con la debían crear una oración. Se analizaron los resultados obtenidos comparando los tipos de palabras que produjeron en la tarea de estructura de palabras y según el tipo de oración que incluían las pruebas de estructura de oraciones y formulación de oraciones dependiendo del ítem. De este modo se han podido describir las dificultades morfosintácticas de forma más específica. Resultados Los resultados muestran que los participantes con TDL tienen dificultades gramaticales especialmente en los verbos y oraciones morfosintácticamente más complejas. También se constató que la comprensión de oraciones está más preservada que la producción. Conclusiones La evaluación según los tipos de marcas morfológicas y los tipos de oraciones es importante para poder hacer una mejor adaptación de las reeducaciones a las necesidades de los niños/as con TDL. Background and objective The aim of the present study is to analyse the morphosyntactic difficulties (expressive and receptive skills) of children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). Three subtests of the CELF-4 were assessed. Firstly expressive language was assessed using the subtest estructura de palabras (word production) and formulación de oraciones (sentence production), secondly receptive language was assessed with the subtest estructura de oraciones (sentence comprehension). Method 25 children with DLD and 25 children with typical development took part of the study, they were 5-8 years old, bilingual Catalan-Spanish, sex and age-matched. The word production subtest assessed the word production, specifically the ability to establish nominal and verbal inflexions, word derivations, comparisons and pronouns. Receptive language was assessed through the sentence comprehension test, considering the syntactic structure comprehension by the selection of the image that showed the oral sentence heard. The sentence production was assessed by giving to the participants a word that they had to use to create a sentence. The results obtained were also analysed to item level considering the type of word and sentence complexity, in order to describe more specifically the morphosyntactic difficulties shown. Results the results showed that children with DLD had more grammatical difficulties than the typical development group, especially with verbs and in complex sentences. In addition, comprehension was found less impaired than production. Conclusions Assessing the morphological cues and different types of sentences is important for boys and girls with DLD in order to establish better interventions to cover their needs.",Trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje; Dificultades morfosintácticas; Producción de palabras; Comprensión de oraciones; Producción de oraciones; Developmental language disorder; Morphosyntactic difficulties; Word production; Sentence comprehension; Sentence production

Methods A cohort of 200 English- and Spanish-speaking patients completed the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) health literacy assessment tool, a sociodemographic survey, and 2 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System–based computerized adaptive testing questionnaires: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference and Upper-Extremity Function. The NVS scores were divided into limited (0–3) and adequate (4–6) health literacy. Multivariable regression modeling was used to identify independent predictors of limited health literacy. Results A total of 86 patients (43%) had limited health literacy (English-speaking: 33%; Spanish-speaking: 100%). Factors associated with limited health literacy were advanced age, lower income, and being publicly insured or uninsured. Increasing years of education was a protective factor. Primary language was not included in the logistic regression model because all Spanish-speaking patients had limited health literacy. When evaluating health literacy on a continuum, primary language was the factor that most influenced the NVS scores, accounting for 14% of the variability. Conclusions Limited health literacy was commonplace among patients seeing a hand surgeon, more so in elderly and disadvantaged individuals.

In this setting, Broca's area has been considered as the “speech area”; moreover, this observation led to localizationism. However, advances in brain mapping techniques, as functional neuroimaging and direct electrical stimulation in patients undergoing awake surgery for gliomas, has resulted in a paradigmatic shift regarding models of neural architecture. In fact, the brain is organized in distributed complex networks underpinning sensorimotor, visuospatial, language, cognitive and emotional functions. In this connectomal workframe, cerebral processing is not conceived as the sum of segregated subfunctions, but results from the integration and potentiation of parallel (even if partially overlapped) subcircuits. Such a networking model, taking into account cortical and subcortical anatomic constraints, explains interindividual variability in physiology and after brain damage, particularly in aphasiology – e.g. double dissociations during electrostimulations, as comprehension versus naming disorders, semantic versus phonemic paraphasias, or syntactic disturbances versus anomia. This dynamic organization mediated by the well-synchronized functioning of delocalized groups of interconnected neurons (rather than by discrete centers) also explains the huge potential of neuroplasticity following cerebral insult, on the condition that the axonal connectivity is preserved. According to this principle, massive surgical resection of brain regions dogmatically considered as “critical” in a localisationist view can be achieved with no functional deficit, as the removal of Broca's area – which is not the speech area – without disorders. This connectomal account of neural processing may have major implications in cognitive neurosciences and in therapeutic management of brain-damaged patients.",Brain connectome; Neuroplasticity; Serial mappings; Awake surgery; Direct electrical stimulation; Low-grade gliomas

Eighty-eight second graders were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a ‘gaming group’ which was instructed to play through the entire commercial game ‘Monkey Tales’, a group which was instructed to complete math exercises on paper and a control group that that did not receive any arithmetic exercises. We used a multidimensional approach to estimate the impact of game playing on objective measures of arithmetic performance such as speed and accuracy on a math test, as well as subjective measures such as math anxiety, enjoyment and perceived competence. Overall, the present study shows that the use of games for arithmetic can be beneficial both in terms of affective and cognitive learning outcomes.",Arithmetic training; Mental calculation; Educational game; Effectiveness; Cognitive learning outcome; Affective learning outcome

However, because most studies have been performed with English speaking children, available information regarding Persian-speaking children is scarce. Therefore, this study compared measures of lexical diversity (numbers of different words and total words), and syntactic complexity (mean length of utterance) in Persian-speaking children with and without CIs. Methods A cross-sectional study with 20 children with CIs and 20 typically developing children was conducted. To collect the data, the children's language samples were gathered via picture descriptions. The first 50 utterances were analyzed. Results All measures were significantly different between children with CIs and their typically developing age-matched peers, whereas no differences between children with CIs and their typically developing hearing age-matched peers were detected (p<0.05). Conclusions CIs have been recognized to be one of the most beneficial rehabilitation prostheses because they help children to acquire speech and language abilities similar to their typically developing hearing age-matched peers. After implantation, the performance of children with CIs is similar to the performance of normal children with the same hearing experience. The duration of the hearing experience after the implantation is an important factor for determining the development of speech and language abilities.",Lexical diversity; Syntax complexity; Number of different words; Number of total words; Mean length of utterance; Cochlear implant

This constellation of problems is characteristic of early-onset, persistent delinquent [EOPD] youth, and appropriately targeted interventions accounting for this comorbidity may improve outcomes. To investigate these relationships in EOPD youth, we characterized their cross-diagnostic psychopathology and verbal (word-list) learning/memory and evaluated: 1) verbal learning/memory profiles of Withdrawn/Depressed relative to Non-Withdrawn/Depressed youth; 2) cognitive and psychiatric predictors of verbal learning; and 3) emotion regulation as a mediator of psychiatric and cognitive relationships. Results indicated Withdrawn/Depressed youth recalled significantly fewer words during immediate, and some delayed, recall conditions. Less word-learning was predicted by: Withdrawn/Depressed classification, higher trauma-specific re-experiencing symptoms, greater emotion dysregulation, weaker executive skills, fewer trauma-avoidance and aggressive symptoms, and earlier alcohol-use onset. Emotion regulation strongly mediated the relationship between verbal learning and psychopathology, but not other cognitive skills, among these youth at high-risk for school dropout.

Method After reading lay definitions of cluttering and stuttering, three samples of adults from Norway and three from Puerto Rico rated their attitudes toward cluttering and/or stuttering on modified versions of the POSHA-Cl (for cluttering) and POSHA-S (for stuttering). They also identified children and adults whom they knew who either or both manifested cluttering or stuttering. Results Attitudes toward cluttering were essentially unaffected by rating either cluttering only or combined cluttering and stuttering on the same questionnaire in both countries. The same was also true of stuttering. Attitudes were very similar toward both disorders although slightly less positive for cluttering. Norwegian attitudes toward both disorders were generally more positive than Puerto Rican attitudes. The average respondent identified slightly more than one fluency disorder, a higher percentage for stuttering than cluttering and higher for adults than children. Cluttering–stuttering was rarely identified. Conclusion Given a lay definition, this study confirmed that adults from diverse cultures hold attitudes toward cluttering that are similar to—but somewhat less positive than—their attitudes toward stuttering. It also confirmed that adults can identify cluttering among people they know, although less commonly than stuttering. Design controls in this study assured that consideration of stuttering did not affect either the attitudes or identification results for cluttering. Educational objectives: The reader will be able to: (a) describe the effects—or lack thereof—of considerations of stuttering on attitudes toward cluttering; (b) describe differences in public identification of children and adults who either clutter or stutter; (c) describe differences between attitudes toward cluttering and stuttering in Norway and Puerto Rico.",Cluttering attitudes; Stuttering attitudes; Norway; Puerto Rico; POSHA

Over the first 3 years of life, children are highly sensitive to the quantity and quality of language input they receive. The focus of this study was on whether learning a different language in the early years affects the acquisition of English over the longer term. In this study, we investigated effects of foreign language (Hokkien) caregiving on the eventual acquisition of English as well as on memory traces of Hokkien. We sampled individuals who received foreign language caregiving in Hokkien during their early years either predominantly or in addition to English. Our control group had lifetime primary exposure to English. We compared the Hokkien- and English-only reared groups on phonological, semantic, and grammatical knowledge in English. We also compared the groups on memories for Hokkien tonal phonology and vocabulary. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in performance in English tasks between groups, yet the Hokkien-reared group demonstrated selective learning advantages in reacquiring Hokkien tonal contrasts.

Besides, it has also been observed that lifetime intellectual enriching skills reduce the effect of disease burden on cognitive status. The Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq), which is a method for the quantitative measurement and comprehensive evaluation of the CR, that individuals have accumulated throughout their lifetimes. The present study aimed to adapt CRIq to the Turkish population. Methods CRIq is a 20-item questionnaire consisting of 3 sub-scales (CRI-Education, CRI- Working Activity, CRI-Leisure Time). 271 females and 228 males, a total of 499 healthy volunteers participated in the study (mean age: 39.54±14.05, mean education years 13.14±4.84). Participants were evaluated with the “Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS)” and CRIq was applied. BICAMS was used to determine the validity of the CRIq. To determine the reliability, the questionnaire was applied again two weeks after the first application. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were measured for reliability analysis. Independent sample t-test was conducted to observe the difference between genders. Results The Cronbach alpha coefficient of the questionnaire was 0.78, and the reliability of the questionnaire was acceptable. The findings showed that inter-rater reliability was quite high (ICC:0.95, 95% CI=1.000, n=36). The correlation between the first and second application of the questionnaire was found to be acceptable for both the sub-scales and the whole questionnaire. The highest CRIq scores were shown for young adults in CRI-Education and CRI-LeisureTime, for the middle-aged in CRIq-WorkingActivity, no significant differences in total CRIq scores. The males scored significantly higher in CRIq total scores than females, but there was not a significant difference in CRI-LeisureTime between genders. Conclusion The Turkish version of CRIq was found to be a valid and reliable method for evaluating cognitive reserve in healthy individuals.",Cognitive reserve; Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire; Cognition; Education; Leisure time

Wilson,2016,The effect of aging on the brain network for exception word reading,article,Cortex,ScienceDirect,"Cognitive and computational models of reading aloud agree on the existence of two procedures for reading. Pseudowords (e.g., atendier) are correctly read through subword processes only while exception words (e.g., pint) are only correctly read via whole-words processes. Regular words can be correctly read by means of either way. Previous behavioral studies showed that older adults relied more on whole-word processing for reading. The aim of the present fMRI study was to verify whether this larger whole-word reliance for reading in older adults was reflected by changes in the pattern of brain activation. Both young and elderly participants read aloud pseudowords, exception and regular words in the scanner. Behavioral results reproduced those of previous studies showing that older adults made significantly less errors when reading exception words. Neuroimaging results showed significant activation of the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL), a key region implicated in whole-word reading for exception word reading in both young and elderly participants. Critically, ATL activation was also found for regular word reading in the elderly. No differences were observed in the pattern of activation between regular and pseudowords in the young. In conclusion, these results extend evidence on the critical role of the left ATL for exception word reading to elderly participants. Additionally, our study shows for the first time from a developmental point of view that the behavioral changes found in reading during normal aging also have a brain counterpart in the reading network changes that sustain exception and regular word reading in the elderly.",Reading network; Aging; fMRI; Exception words; Word processing

Furthermore, the relationship between language outcomes, medical morbidities and developmental trajectory in early infancy is unclear. Aims The goal of this study was to evaluate language outcomes among extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants at 30months adjusted age (AA). Study design The Bayley Scales of Infant Development II and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test or Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test/Receptive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test were administered at 30months AA to a prospective cohort of ELBW infants who participated in the NICHD Neonatal Network Glutamine Trial and Neurodevelopmental Follow-Up Study. A standardized history and physical examination and query regarding feeding behaviors were performed at 18months AA and 30months AA. Results Of the 467 infants evaluated, 55% had receptive language delay at 30months with 23% having severe delays. Fewer (26%) had expressive language delays, with 16% of those being severe delays. Non-English speaking infants had poorer performance on all language measures compared to English-speaking infants. Forty-seven percent of the cohort required assistance with feeds at 18months. These children were more likely to have language delay at the 30month assessment compared to infants who could feed themselves. Conclusions ELBW infants are at risk of language delay in early childhood. Additional research is needed to further explore the relationship between early predictors of language delay and the use of monolingual language assessments in non-English speaking patients with a history of prematurity.",Preterm infants; Neurodevelopmental outcome and language

A significant percentile has inadequate reading comprehension skills. We present a multilingual tool called Open Book (OB) that applies Human Language Technologies (HLT) in order to identify reading comprehension obstacles in text documents and propose more simple alternatives with the aim of assisting the reading comprehension of users. OB involves several text transformations at lexical, syntactic and semantic level. In this paper we focus on three challenging components of the OB tool: the image retrieval component, the idiom detection component and the summarization module. There are very few studies that involve simplification by showing images associated to difficult concepts. In addition, the treatment of figurative language such as idioms or metaphors is one of the most challenging areas in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Finally, although text summarization is a more widely studied field in NLP, its application to text simplification remains as an open research issue. Thus, we focus on the integration of these three modules in our OB tool. We present the motivation for building these components and we describe how they are integrated in the whole system. Moreover, the usability and the usefulness of OB have been evaluated and analysed showing that the tool helps to produce texts easier to understand for autistic people.",Natural Language Processing; Text simplification; ASD; Image retrieval; Text summarization; Topic Models; Idiom detection

Some people with aphasia (PWA) can learn word-referent pairings under referential uncertainty supported by online feedback. However, it remains unknown whether PWA can learn new words cross-situationally and if such learning ability is supported by statistical learning (SL) mechanisms. The present study examined whether PWA can learn novel word-referent mappings in a CSL task without feedback. We also studied whether CSL is related to SL in PWA and neurologically healthy individuals. We further examined whether aphasia severity, phonological processing and verbal short-term memory (STM) predict CSL in aphasia, and also whether individual differences in verbal STM modulate CSL in healthy older adults. Sixteen people with chronic aphasia underwent a CSL task that involved exposure to a series of individually ambiguous learning trials and a SL task that taps speech segmentation. Their learning ability was compared to 18 older controls and 39 young adults recruited for task validation. CSL in the aphasia group was below the older controls and young adults and took place at a slower rate. Importantly, we found a strong association between SL and CSL performance in all three groups. CSL was modulated by aphasia severity in the aphasia group, and by verbal STM capacity in the older controls. Our findings indicate that some PWA can preserve the ability to learn new word-referent associations cross-situationally. We suggest that both PWA and neurologically intact individuals may rely on SL mechanisms to achieve CSL and that verbal STM also influences CSL.

Participants for this study (1221 preschool children, 751 of whom were identified as Spanish-speaking LM children) completed the Phonological Awareness, Print Knowledge, and Definitional Vocabulary subtests of the Test of Preschool Early Literacy (TOPEL). Item response theory analysis was conducted to examine student performance on each subtest, and performance of monolingual English-speaking and Spanish-speaking LM children was compared using differential item functioning (DIF) analysis. Results indicated that there was minimal DIF for the Phonological Awareness and Print Knowledge subtests. Substantially more DIF was evident on the Definitional Vocabulary subtest, although presence of DIF was not consistently in favor of monolingual English-speaking or Spanish-speaking LM children. Moreover, effect size estimates of DIF indicated that, across most test items, the magnitude of DIF was small to moderate.

In a cohort of mutation carriers with mild behavioral and/or cognitive symptoms consistent with prodromal bvFTD, we aimed to investigate patterns of performance on an abbreviated list learning task, with a particular focus on recognition memory. We further aimed to characterize the cognitive prodromes associated with the three major genetic causes of frontotemporal dementia, as emerging evidence suggests there may be subtle differences in cognitive profiles among carriers of different genetic mutations. Participants included 57 carriers of a pathogenic mutation in microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, N = 23), or progranulin (GRN, N = 15), or a or a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72, N = 19), with mild cognitive and/or behavioral symptoms consistent with prodromal bvFTD. Familial non-carriers were included as controls (N = 143). All participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological examination, including an abbreviated list learning test assessing episodic memory recall and recognition. MAPT mutation carriers performed worse than non-carriers in terms of list recall, and had difficulty discriminating targets from distractors on the recognition memory task, primarily due to the endorsement of distractors as targets. MAPT mutation carriers also showed nonverbal episodic memory and semantic memory dysfunction (object naming). GRN mutation carriers were variable in performance and overall the most dysexecutive. Slowed psychomotor speed was evident in C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers. Identifying the earliest cognitive indicators of bvFTD is of critical clinical and research importance. List learning may be a sensitive cognitive marker for incipient dementia in MAPT and potentially a subset of GRN carriers. Our results highlight that distinct cognitive profiles may be evident in carriers of the three disease-causing genes during the prodromal disease stage.",Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia; Episodic memory; Neuropsychology; Prodromal disease; Genetic frontotemporal dementia

Aims To assess how domains of function, often negatively impacted by preterm birth, predict reading development in children born preterm and at term. Study design Longitudinal descriptive cohort study. Subjects Preterm (n = 48; gestational age 22–32 weeks, 30 males) and term (n = 41, 18 males) participants were assessed at age 6 years on a battery of verbal and non-verbal cognitive skills and reassessed at age 8 using the Gray Oral Reading Tests-5. Linear regressions assessed the contributions of phonological awareness, language, executive function, and non-verbal IQ at age 6 to reading outcome at age 8. Results Children born preterm had lower scores than children born at term on all measures (Cohen's d from 0.46 to 1.08, all p < .05). Phonological awareness and language abilities predicted reading in both groups (accounting for 19.9% and 25.0% of variance, respectively, p < .001). Birth group did not moderate the association. By contrast, the association between executive function and non-verbal intelligence and reading outcome was moderated by birth group (interaction accounted for 3.9–6.7% of variance, respectively, p < .05). Positive predictions to reading from executive function and non-verbal IQ were found only in children born preterm. Conclusions Non-verbal cognitive skills improved the prediction of reading outcome only in the preterm group, suggesting that reading decrements represent a component of global deficits.

Methods Mailed questionnaire with 5 items related to mental health, 12 items on services for CSHCN, and 28 items on financial issues previously reported. Results Responses were received from 320 of 472 organizations (67.8%); 153 respondents had at least 1 physician or nurse practitioner and were included in the analysis; 91 were hospital-based teams (HBTs); and 62 were community-based teams (CBTs). CBTs were significantly more likely to offer mental health treatment (65.0% vs 35.6%). When mental health services were needed in another language, only half (50.7%) indicated that services were available in Spanish, less than a third (29.3%) could find services in sign language, and only 20.3% expected to find services for patients who used other languages. Of all children evaluated, 31.2% had special health care needs. CBTs reported seeing significantly more CSHCN than HBTs (38.3% vs 26.5%). Over two-thirds (67.7%) did not have a special program or specialized staff to serve CSHCN. Overall, teams had some training and experience with CSHCN. Children who were deaf were evaluated by 84.5% of teams, while only 50.5% reported using professionally trained sign language interpreters. Most teams (82.2%) indicated that more time was needed to evaluate CSHCN, and 69.1% found arranging for mental health treatment for CSHCN more difficult than children without special needs. Conclusions Medically oriented child maltreatment teams are generally able to arrange for mental health services for the children served, and most feel capable of serving CSHCN. Significantly more mental health service providers are needed for children and families who communicate in languages other than English (e.g., Spanish, American Sign Language [ASL]). Practice implications Our results suggest that medically oriented child maltreatment teams and mental health services for maltreated children would improve gaps in services by: (1) recruiting and training bilingual professionals, (2) ensuring that children or family members who are deaf receive professional ASL services, and (3) ensuring that training is provided related to the needs of CSHCN.",Medically oriented child maltreatment teams; Mental health; Child maltreatment; Special health care needs; Disabilities

By means of eye-tracking, we measured children's processing times of two-clause sentences including a causal relation. Two text-related factors were investigated: coherence marking (i.e., presence vs. absence of the Dutch connective omdat ‘because’) and linear order of clauses (i.e., cause-effect vs. effect-cause). In addition, syntactic knowledge was included as a child-related factor of interest. The results showed that coherence marking and individual differences in syntactic knowledge influenced children's online sentence processing. In contrast to L1 readers, the absence of a connective led to longer sentence processing times for L2 readers with lower syntactic knowledge; they experienced more difficulty with processing sentences in which no connective was present. Apparently, L2 readers with limited syntactic knowledge benefit from coherence marking provided by a connective, which allows them to establish the causal coherence relation between clauses in a more efficient way. Reversing the linear order of clauses did not affect children's online sentence processing. This study provides an initial step towards the use of online measures to examine sentence processing in beginning L1 and L2 readers aimed at gaining more insight into L2 reading comprehension difficulties.",Sentence processing; Causal relations; Second language acquisition; Syntactic knowledge

This contribution focuses on the learning of arithmetic, which is quintessential to mathematical development. The nascent body of brain imaging studies reveals that arithmetic recruits a large set of interconnected areas, including prefrontal, posterior parietal, occipito-temporal and hippocampal areas. This network undergoes developmental changes in its function, connectivity and structure, which are not yet fully understood. This network only partially overlaps with what has been found in adults, and clear differences are observed in the recruitment of the hippocampus, which are related to the development of arithmetic fact retrieval. Despite these emerging trends, the literature remains scattered, particularly in the context of atypical development. Acknowledging the distributed nature of the arithmetic network, future studies should focus on connectivity and analytic approaches that investigate patterns of brain activity, coupled with a careful design of the arithmetic tasks and assessments of arithmetic strategies. Such studies will produce a more comprehensive understanding of how the arithmetical brain unfolds, how it changes over time, and how it is impaired in atypical development.",Arithmetic; Children; Development; Brain imaging; Dyscalculia; fMRI; DTI; Fact retrieval; Mathematics

Methods The study used a prospective, longitudinal matched-group design. Data were collected in a clinical setting at postoperative cochlear implant check-ups after 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months of implant use. The sample included 42 children: 21 cochlear implant users and 21 with normal hearing, matched pairwise according to gender and chronological age. Communication assessments included the LittlEARS questionnaire, the Mullen Scale of Early Learning, and the Minnesota Child Development Inventory. Results The cochlear implant users’ hearing function according to LittlEARS was comparable to that of normal-hearing children within 9 months post-implantation. The mean scores after 9 and 12 months were 31 and 33, respectively in the prelingually deaf versus 31 and 34 in the normal-hearing children. The children's receptive and expressive language scores showed that after 12–48 months with cochlear implants, 81% had receptive language skills within the normative range and 57% had expressive language skills within the normative range. The number of children who scored within the normal range increased with increasing CI experience. Conclusions The present study showed that prelingually deaf children's ability to develop complex expressive and receptive spoken language after early bilateral implantation appears promising. The majority of the children developed language skills at a faster pace than their hearing ages would suggest and over time achieved expressive and receptive language skills within the normative range.",Cochlear implant; Language development; Expressive language development; Receptive language development; Prelingually deaf children; Early bilateral implantation

Results show that children with cochlear implants demonstrate good results on quantity and coherence of the utterances, but problematic outcomes on quality, content and efficiency of retold stories. However, for a subgroup (n=20, median age=8 years 1 month) of deaf children without additional disabilities who receive cochlear implantation before the age of 2 years, use two implants, and are raised with one spoken language, age-adequate spoken narrative skills at school-age are feasible.

Recent studies suggest that in order to overcome the flawed speech signal, comprehenders engage in rational noisy-channel processing, which can pull their interpretation towards more probable “near-neighbor” analyses, based on the assumption that an error may have occurred in the transmission of the sentence. We investigate this type of processing using subject/object relative clause ambiguity in Hebrew. In four self-paced reading experiments and a sentence completion experiment, we find that during online processing, readers apply elaborate knowledge regarding the distribution of structures in the language, and that they are willing to compromise subject-verb agreement to refrain from (grammatical but) highly improbable structures. The results suggest that the prior probability of alternative analyses modulates the interpretation of agreement.",Sentence processing; Noisy-channel; Rational inference; Relative clause; Subject-verb agreement

Little is known, however, whether this differs as a function of grapheme to phoneme transparency in beginning readers. Here we compare speech and orthographic processing circuits in two contrasting languages, Polish and English, in 100 7-year-old children performing fMRI language localizer tasks. Results show limited language variation, with speech-print convergence evident mostly in left frontotemporal perisylvian regions. Correlational and intersect analyses revealed subtle differences in the strength of this coupling in several regions of interest. Specifically, speech-print convergence was higher for transparent Polish than opaque English in the right temporal area, associated with phonological processing. Conversely, speech-print convergence was higher for English than Polish in left fusiform, associated with visual word recognition. We conclude that speech-print convergence is a universal marker of reading even at the beginning of reading acquisition with minor variations that can be explained by the differences in grapheme to phoneme transparency. This finding at the earliest stages of reading acquisition conforms well with claims that reading exhibits a good deal of universality despite writing systems differences.",

Nonsense words contained phoneme sequence onsets (i.e., /pt/, /pət/, /st/ and /sət/) that occur in the Polish and English languages, with the exception that /pt/ at syllable onset is an illegal phonotactic form in English. P1–N1–P2 waveforms from fronto-central electrode sites were comparable in English and Polish listeners, even though, these same English participants were unable to distinguish the nonsense words having /pt/ and /pət/ onsets. The P1–N1–P2 complex indexed the temporal characteristics of the word stimuli in the same manner for both language groups. Taken together, these findings suggest that the fronto-central P1–N1–P2 complex reflects acoustic feature processing of speech and is not significantly influenced by exposure to the phoneme sequences of the native-language. In contrast, the T-complex from bilateral posterior temporal sites was found to index phonological as well as acoustic feature processing to the nonsense word stimuli. An enhanced negativity for the /pt/ cluster relative to its contrast sequence (i.e., /pət/) occurred only for the Polish listeners, suggesting that neural networks within non-primary auditory cortex may be involved in early cortical phonological processing.",Auditory-evoked potential (AEP); P1–N1–P2 complex; T-complex; Cross-linguistic; Phonetic; Speech perception

Although the social and health outcomes of social isolation are well documented, evidence regarding the prevention of isolation in later life remains scarce. This article addresses this by presenting the findings from a literature review focusing on the identification, assessment, prevention, and intervention strategies relevant to social isolation in older age. The paper first addresses the issues of identification and assessment, using an ecological framework to identify the risk factors for social isolation at four levels: individual, relationship, community, and societal. It then reviews different types of interventions to reduce or prevent social isolation in later life, including one-to-one, group, service provision, technology-based, neighbourhood, and structural interventions. The paper discusses both the opportunities and the constraints associated with these different approaches. The discussion highlights future directions for research, emphasising the need for a cultural change from ‘cure’ to ‘prevention’ of social isolation across the life-course, and the importance of acknowledging greater diversity within the ageing population.",Ageing; Loneliness; Prevention; Social isolation

The Reduced Buffer Capacity Hypothesis argues that people with AOS can hold only one syllable at a time in the speech motor planning buffer. The Program Retrieval Deficit Hypothesis, states that people with AOS have difficulty accessing the intended motor program in the context where several motor programs are activated simultaneously. The participants included eight speakers with AOS, most of whom also had aphasia, nine speakers with aphasia without AOS, and 25 age-matched control speakers. The experimental paradigm prompted single word production following three types of primes. In most trials, prime and target were the same (e.g., bill-bill). On some trials, the initial consonant differed in one phonetic feature (e.g., bill-dill; Similar) or in all phonetic features (fill-bill; Different). The dependent measures were accuracy and reaction time. The results revealed a switch cost – longer reaction times in trials where the prime and target differed compared to trials where they were the same words – in all groups; however, the switch cost was significantly larger in the AOS group compared to the other two groups. These findings are in line with the prediction of the Program Retrieval Deficit Hypothesis and suggest that speakers with AOS have difficulty with selecting one program over another when several programs compete for selection.",

Multiple regression analyses revealed that performance in the acquisition of the PAL task was significantly associated with phonological awareness and backward recall, whereas performance in the retrieval of the PAL task was significantly associated with rapid automatized naming, phonological awareness, and backward recall. Moreover, PAL proved to be mediating the relation between reading precursors and letter knowledge. Together, these findings indicate that the acquisition of letter knowledge may depend on a visual–verbal associative learning mechanism and that different factors contribute to the acquisition and retrieval of such visual–verbal associations.",Visual–verbal associative learning; Phonological awareness; Letter knowledge; Rapid automatized naming; Working memory; Reading

This allows us to provide the first direct estimate of how grammar-learning ability changes with age, finding that it is preserved almost to the crux of adulthood (17.4 years old) and then declines steadily. This finding held not only for “difficult” syntactic phenomena but also for “easy” syntactic phenomena that are normally mastered early in acquisition.

Traditionally, FFRs are recorded under close-field conditions (earphones), but free-field stimulations (loudspeaker) have yet to be attempted, which would increase the applications of FFRs by making this technique accessible to those who cannot wear inserted transducers. Here we test the feasibility and reliability of measuring speech ABRs across free and close-field. New method The FFR was evoked by a 40-ms consonant–vowel (cv) /da/ syllable which was presented in the standard close-field conditions with insert earphones, and in a novel free-field condition via a loudspeaker. Results A well-defined FFR was observed for each stimulating method (free or close-field). We show that it is possible and reliable to elicit FFRs from a speaker and that these do not systematically differ from those elicited by conventional earphones.

DESIGN A prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS This study took place in a tertiary referral center with a cohort of 84 Finnish patients (55% female) from 25 families with the pathogenic nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) variant c.61G>C. Observation procedures and main outcome measures were Sanger sequencing, clinical examination, corneal imaging, and a questionnaire regarding symptoms, quality of life, treatment, and comorbidities. RESULTS The oldest members in each family were born in Ostrobothnia in Western Finland or in Southwestern Finland with historical ties to Sweden. One carrier was asymptomatic. Most (77%, 46/60) experienced their first attack between age 6 and 20 years. Three-quarters had unilateral attacks 3 to 5 times annually, primarily triggered by cold wind or air, or stress. Eighty percent (48/60) reported ocular pain (median, 7 on scale 1-10), conjunctival injection, photophobia, foreign body sensation, and tearing during attacks. Visual blur occurred in 75% (45/60) and 91% (55/60) during and after the attack, respectively, for a median of 10 days (range, 1 day-2 months). Forty-seven percent (39/60) had corneal oval opacities with irregular tomography patterns and mild to moderate decrease (20/60 or better) in best-corrected visual acuity that improved with scleral contact lenses. Except for headache in 40%, systemic symptoms were absent during the attacks. CONCLUSIONS Symptoms and signs of KFH are restricted to the anterior segment of the eye and vary widely between individuals. We recommend scleral contact lenses as the first-line treatment for reduced vision. Allele frequencies suggest that KFH goes unrecognized in Sweden and populations with Scandinavian heritage.",

Sign language is developed and standardized in many developed nations like United States of America, United Kingdom etc. This has resulted in American Sign Language (ASL), British Sign Language (BSL) respectively. Language acquisition is a major requirement during the initial development stage of a sensory deficit subject. The language skills help an individual's ability to express self, aids cognitive skills and thought process. In India the pedagogy based on Indian Sign Language (ISL) is developing. Language learning using a multimedia based application is found helpful for sign language users. This paper discusses the development of a mobile application for sensory deficit people for language acquisition. An Android based learning system for hearing impaired individuals, which translate text to Indian sign language videos and images are developed.",Assistive technology; Indian Sign Language; Mobile Application; Multimedia based learning

The study was carried out at Zonguldak Bülent Ecevit University the School of Foreign Languages, with the participation of 61 intermediate, pre-intermediate and beginner level EFL learners. Data were collected through a perception questionnaire. A “Foreign Language Reading Attitudes and Motivation Questionnaire” was used to find out the students’ attitudes towards reading. The analyses of the data from the questionnaire revealed that the students’ attitudes towards reading in English were neutral, and there is a statistically significant difference between intermediate level learners and pre-intermediate and beginner level learners. Furthermore, the results revealed statistically no significant difference between males and females in relation to the participants’ attitudes toward reading. The comparison of the different levels of students indicated that high proficiency learners had a positive attitude towards reading.",Foreign language reading; reading attitudes

The impact on language abilities and verbal short-term memory of pre-school children from socioeconomic status (SES). Children from lower SES show less linguistic abilities and communication skills compared to higher SES children. The challenges of children's vocabulary brain development difference between lower and higher SES continues sometimes grows with age. Therefore this paper, machine learning assisted vocabulary development framework (MLVDF), has proposed a multimodal assessment of young children's brains' intellectual ability and capabilities. The proposed methodology is focused on the estimation and comparison with more developed strategies of nonverbal abilities using similar video interfaces. Machine learning technologies are used to determine a minimum number of variables capable of predicting particular children's cognitive skills. Thus, the findings highlight the complex effect of verbal and cognitive abilities on children's language and life experience. The results are obtained by the analysis of SES in Children's brain development as Cognitive skills ratio is 86.6%, Verbal abilities ratio is 87.12%, Children's brain capability ratio is 87.6%, Increasing the memory ratio is 83.5%, Learning attitude ratio is 93.8%, Reduce the effect of socioeconomic status ratio is 84.25%, Reading efficiency ratio is 87.6%.",Brain development; Cognitive skills; Machine learning; Socioeconomic Status (SES)

All children in four consecutive birth cohorts in Iceland diagnosed with ASD were divided into two groups based on their age at initial ASD diagnosis: 58 children were diagnosed before age 6 (group 1) and 41 children after age 6 (group 2). Children in group 1 were more likely to receive a diagnosis of childhood autism (p≤0.001), their average IQ/DQ was lower (p<0.001), verbal status was lower (p<0.001), and a history of autistic regression was more common (p<0.01) than in group 2. Half of the children in group 2 had received other developmental diagnoses prior to the ASD diagnosis, but this applied to only a few of the children in group 1 (p<0.001). There was no difference between the groups with regard to autistic symptoms as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (p=0.224), frequency of associated medical conditions (p=0.640), age of first parental concern (p=0.244), and age of first autistic symptoms on hindsight (p=0.540).

Regression analyses supported that EF and FMS were significantly associated with children's reading proficiency. Working memory and inhibition explained a substantial amount of variances in reading proficiency after controlling for the covariates. Structural equation modeling analysis suggested that the relation between FMS and reading proficiency was fully mediated by global EF (χ2/df=4.29/3; CFI=0.983; RMSEA=0.055). Results of the bootstrap method also supported the statistical significant effect of FMS on reading proficiency through global EF, 95% CI [0.029, 0.325].

Emotional Health and Psychosocial Well-being by Relative Birth Quarter in Canadian Adolescents,article,Journal of Adolescent Health,ScienceDirect,"Purpose Those born earlier within cohorts of similarly aged children tend to outperform peers in athletic and academic pursuits. Subsequent evidence suggests relatively younger children may also experience worse emotional and psychosocial health; however, evidence from middle adolescents is limited. This study assessed whether depression, anxiety, and psychosocial well-being differed by the relative birth quarter (RBQ) within a cohort of grades 9–12 in secondary schools across Canada. Methods Data from the 2018–19 student self-report surveys of the cannabis use, obesity, mental health, physical activity, alcohol use, smoking, and sedentary behavior study were analyzed. Students having made normative progress were categorized into RBQs by the provincial enrollment cutoff date (n = 49,921). Hierarchical modeling approaches assessed whether self-reported depression, anxiety, psychosocial well-being, and positive controls differed by RBQ after controlling for covariates. Results Despite relative age effects for positive control outcomes, no significant difference was detected for anxiety and depression scores or likelihood of meeting thresholds for having clinically relevant symptoms. However, a significant difference emerged between RBQs for psychosocial well-being scores; post hoc tests found that psychosocial well-being scores were lower in the fourth RBQ than those in all prior quarters. Discussion Results agree with limited findings that relative age differences in emotional health are not significant in older cohorts. Nonetheless, relatively older individuals reported very small (d = .04–.05) advantages in psychosocial well-being than their youngest peers, which aligns with previous data. Longitudinal approaches to assess relative age effects on mental health during and throughout the transition into middle adolescence are warranted.",Relative age; Depression; Anxiety; Psychosocial well-being; Flourishing; Secondary school; Middle adolescents

Half of these tumours occur in the posterior fossa, where surgical removal is complicated by the risk of cerebellar mutism syndrome, of which postoperative speech impairment (POSI) is a cardinal symptom, in up to 25% of patients. The surgical approach to midline tumours, mostly undertaken by transvermian or telovelar routes, has been proposed to influence the risk of POSI. We aimed to investigate the risk of developing POSI, the time course of its resolution, and its association with surgical approach and other clinical factors. Methods In this observational prospective multicentre cohort study, we included children (aged <18 years) undergoing primary surgery for a posterior fossa tumour at 26 centres in nine European countries. Within 72 h of surgery, the operating neurosurgeon reported details on the tumour location, surgical approach used, duration of surgery, use of traction, and other predetermined factors, using a standardised surgical report form. At 2 weeks, 2 months, and 1 year after surgery, a follow-up questionnaire was filled out by a paediatrician or neurosurgeon, including neurological examination and assessment of speech. Speech was classified as mutism, reduced speech, or habitual speech. POSI was defined as either mutism or severely reduced speech. Ordinal logistic regression was used to analyse the risk of POSI. Findings Between Aug 11, 2014, and Aug 24, 2020, we recruited 500 children. 426 (85%) patients underwent primary tumour surgery and had data available for further analysis. 192 (45%) patients were female, 234 (55%) patients were male, 81 (19%) patients were aged 0–2 years, 129 (30%) were aged 3–6 years, and 216 (51%) were aged 7–17 years. 0f 376 with known postoperative speech status, 112 (30%) developed POSI, 53 (14%) developed mutism (median 1 day [IQR 0–2]; range 0–10 days), and 59 (16%) developed reduced speech after surgery (0 days [0–1]; 0–4 days). Mutually adjusted analyses indicated that the independent risk factors for development of POSI were younger age (linear spline, p=0·0087), tumour location (four levels, p=0·0010), and tumour histology (five levels, p=0·0030); surgical approach (six levels) was not a significant risk factor (p=0·091). Tumour location outside the fourth ventricle and brainstem had a lower risk of POSI (with fourth ventricle as reference, odds ratio (OR) for cerebellar vermis 0·34 [95% CI 0·14–0·77] and OR for cerebellar hemispheres 0·23 [0·07–0·70]). Compared with pilocytic or pilomyxoid astrocytoma, a higher risk of POSI was seen for medulloblastoma (OR 2·85 [1·47–5·60]) and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour (10·30 [2·10–54·45]). We did not find an increased risk of POSI for transvermian surgical approach compared with telovelar (0·89 [0·46–1·73]). Probability of speech improvement from mutism reached 50% around 16 days after mutism onset. Interpretation Our data suggest that a midline tumour location, younger age, and high-grade tumour histology all increase the risk of speech impairment after posterior fossa tumour surgery. We found no evidence to recommend a preference for telovelar over transvermian surgical approach in the management of posterior fossa tumours in children in relation to the risk of developing POSI.

Li,2015,Working memory impairment and its associated sleep-related respiratory parameters in children with obstructive sleep apnea,article,Sleep Medicine,ScienceDirect,"Study Objective Working memory deficits in children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been reported in previous studies, but the results were inconclusive. This study tried to address this issue by delineating working memory functions into executive processes and storage/maintenance components based on Baddeley's working memory model. Methods Working memory and basic attention tasks were administered on 23 OSA children aged 8–12 years and 22 age-, education-, and general cognitive functioning-matched controls. Data on overnight polysomnographic sleep study and working memory functions were compared between the two groups. Associations between respiratory-related parameters and cognitive performance were explored in the OSA group. Results Compared with controls, children with OSA had poorer performance on both tasks of basic storage and central executive components in the verbal domain of working memory, above and beyond basic attention and processing speed impairments; such differences were not significant in the visuo-spatial domain. Moreover, correlational analyses and hierarchical regression analyses further suggested that obstructive apnea–hypopnea index (OAHI) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) nadir were associated with verbal working memory performance, highlighting the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of OSA-induced cognitive deficits. Conclusions Verbal working memory impairments associated with OSA may compromise children's learning potentials and neurocognitive development. Early identification of OSA and assessment of the associated neurocognitive deficits are of paramount importance. Reversibility of cognitive deficits after treatment would be a critical outcome indicator.",Working memory; OSA; Neurocognitive; Pediatric; Hypoxemia; Sleep

Temperament was assessed with the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ) and ToM by assessing children's understanding of divergent desires and beliefs, and of knowledge access. Our results are in line with a social-emotional reactivity perspective postulating more sophisticated ToM abilities for children with less reactive more observant temperament. Children with shy temperament at 18 months and at 3 years were better in reasoning about others’ mental states at age 3. Language, siblings and parental education had no effect on ToM. Findings indicate that temperament is related to ToM earlier in development than previously found, and that this relation is thus not unique to false-belief understanding.",Infant temperament; Early Theory of Mind abilities; Emotional reactivity; Language

Methods: Twenty children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 20 age matched typical development children (TD) were recruited. The detail data recorded from click-ABR were collected at two time periods (T1 and T2). Results There was no significant change in TD group at two time periods. In ASD group, wave V latency was significantly shortened at T2 compared to that recorded at T1. The interpeak latency of I–V was short at T2 versus at T1 in the autistic children. Compared to the TD group, ASD was associated with longer latencies for waves V and longer interpeak latencies of I-III, I–V at T1. In addition, ASD group also indicated longer latencies of wave III and wave V, longer interpeak latencies of I-III and I–V at T2 compared to the TD group. Conclusions ASD group had immature and dysfunction developmental mode in auditory stimuli perception at the level of brainstem.

However the relationship between CR and cognitive functioning in patients with brain tumours has been very rarely investigated in past research. The present study systematically assesses whether CR concept can also be applied to cognitive functions of neurosurgical patients affected by brain tumours. We investigated the role of different CR proxies (education level, premorbid IQ, current IQ, working and leisure activity) in protecting language against brain tumours and surgery effects, considering interactions with demographic (sex/age), anatomical (hemisphere/lobe location of lesion) and clinical/biological variables (tumour type: High/Low Grade Glioma or Meningioma; lesion volume; lesion aggressiveness). One-hundred patients undergoing neuropsychological assessment before and immediately after surgery participated. A “Language Score” summarizing performance on all language tests was derived with Principal Component Analysis. Data were then analyzed with Multiple Regression and Classification and Regression Tree analyses to investigate possible relationships between predictors (CR proxies and clinical variables) and Language Score. We found that premorbid IQ was the best predictor of pre-operatory language integrity, above and beyond all clinical variables considered, also moderating lesion volume effects. Moreover, patients with lower pre-operatory language integrity and low-to-moderately aggressive tumours showed a mitigating effect of current IQ over surgery consequences. Results thus suggest that different CR proxies play a role in moderating cognitive decline following brain tumours and surgery.",Brain tumours; Language; Glioma; Meningioma; Cognitive reserve

Early detection of potential speech difficulties has been linked to effective intervention. It is therefore important to identify those children at-risk of speech difficulties early so that intervention can take place which may improve educational attainment and future quality of life. This study used the Stuttering Severity Instrument- third edition (SSI-3) as a screening tool to separate fluent and dysfluent children. The main application of the SSI-3 is to categorize children into severity classes, however, in this paper; the SSI-3 was investigated as a screening tool. Clinic-like SSI-3 assessments were made with reception-class children (aged 4-6 years, n=730). Spontaneous monologues were recorded and analyzed. Children were then classified as either fluent or as at-risk of speech difficulties. The results of the identification of speech difficulties based on SSI-3 were compared with the teachers’ classifications of the children. Agreement with the teachers for the fluent children (i.e. the children classified as fluent by both parties) was high with a specificity of 96.7%. Agreement with teachers for the children who were classified as at-risk of speech difficulties was also high (sensitivity was 69.8%).

Specifically, we reviewed a total of 2921 abstracts published within the following journals between 2003 and 2013: Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools (LSHSS); American Journal of Speech–Language Pathology (AJSLP); Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research (JSLHR); Journal of Communication Disorders (JCD); and the International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders (IJLCD). Of the 346 eligible articles that addressed causal factors on child language development across the five journals, 11% were categorized as Genetic (37/346), 83% (287/346) were categorized as Environmental, and 6% (22/346) were categorized as Mixed. The bulk of studies addressing environmental influences focused on therapist intervention (154/296=52%), family/caregiver linguistic input (65/296=22%), or family/caregiver qualities (39/296=13%). A more in-depth review of all eligible studies published in 2013 (n=34) revealed that family/caregiver qualities served as the most commonly controlled environmental factor (e.g., SES) and only 3 studies explicitly noted the possibility of gene–environment interplay. This review highlighted the need to expand the research base for the field of CSD to include a broader range of environmental influences on child language development (e.g., diet, toxin exposure, stress) and to consider more directly the complex and dynamic interplay between genetic and environmental effects. Learning outcomes : Readers will be able to highlight causal factors on child language development that have been studied over the past decade in CSD and recognize additional influences worthy of consideration.

However, it is challenging to bridge the gap between those deeply-rooted fields. Historically, the gap has generated certain neuromyths and these can be quite damaging. In order to prevent this situation, teachers should be sufficiently informed. Thus, there are some efforts in some countries to prevent the spread of neuromyths, such as UK, Netherlands, Brazil, US, Greece, Portuguese etc. However there have been no studies in Turkey. The present study took a two-stage mixed-methods approach to explore primary and secondary school teachers’ concepts about the brain in Turkey and to identify potential sources of misconceptions. 278 primary and secondary school teachers were surveyed and 6 of them were interviewed for in depth responses. Analyses revealed that teachers held many misconceptions about concepts related to brain that have been observed elsewhere in Europe. On the other hand the comparison between Turkey, UK and Netherlands revealed some interesting differences.

Guided by Waddington’s (1957) heuristic image of the “epigenetic landscape” and drawing on empirical research, we propose eight premises about early language development and illustrate how each premise might inform interventions. Three premises address the developmental pathways to language; two highlight the essential role of the environment. The final three premises focus on the child and parent as the essential developmental unit and on the collaborative, transactional, developmental processes that facilitate language acquisition. These premises suggest that intervention should begin well before first words, address the social foundations of language, and support parents in their unique role as they directly and indirectly immerse children in the developmental landscape of language intervention.",Language; Development; Intervention; Parenting

The government however changed the medium of instruction of these subjects to English in January 2003. The “Teaching and Learning of Science and Mathematics in English” (PPSMI) policy was implemented in all primary and secondary schools. It aims to improve the English language proficiency among students as well as the learning and achievement level in science and mathematics. This paper presents findings of the study on students’ inclination towards English language as medium of instruction in teaching and learning of Science and Mathematics in Higher Learning Institutions in Malaysia. The respondents were 291 undergraduate students from the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST) and Faculty of Education (FPEND) of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM). A questionnaire pertaining to students’ inclination was used as research instrument. Using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and t-test, the study found that undergraduate students of FST and FPEND had an inclination towards English as medium of instruction in the teaching and learning of Science and Mathematics. Using the Post-Hoc test, it is found that Indian students and students from other races than Malay and Chinese have greater inclination towards English as medium of instruction in teaching and learning of Science and Mathematics in UKM for both faculties. However, FST students who studied in Mandarin and Tamil at pre-university level (STPM) had higher inclination compared to those who used Malay language or even English.",PPSMI; teaching and learning; medium of instruction; student's inclination

There have been lots of studies done on the topic to date investigating the effectiveness of different types of feedback on EFL learners’ language development. However, there has rarely been a study investigating the two types of implicit focus on form in the form of repetition and clarification request in the form of negotiated feedback on L2 learners’ accuracy. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of these two these two types on 36 elementary male learners studying English at Iran National Language Institution, Miyandoab Branch. These participants received one term of instruction (17 sessions). One group received scaffolding negotiated feedback while the other group received implicit focus on form on their erroneous utterances. A post-test and a delayed post-test were administered to collect data. T-test was used to analyse the data. The findings of the study proved no significant difference between two types of feedback and L2 learners’ accuracy.

Focusing on discursive, experiential, negotiated, contested, and positional construction of identity, it conceptualizes identity development as integral component of teacher learning, practice and growth. The findings suggest that the teacher candidates subjectively negotiated their teacher identities during teacher education coursework experiences as (a) they positioned themselves as an ESOL teacher through asynchronous online and face-to-face course discussions, assignments, and activities, (b) they engaged in professional interaction with teacher educators and other emerging teachers, and (c) the professors and other TCs capitalized on their simultaneous school experience as a valuable resource in the teacher-learning community.

This paper presents the results of research investigating the relationship between teachers who graduate from different training programs and student achievement on state reading and math tests. Using a novel methodology that allows teacher training effects to decay, we find that training institution indicators explain a statistically significant portion of the variation in student achievement in reading, but not in math. Moreover, there is evidence that graduates from some specific training programs are differentially effective at teaching reading than the average teacher trained out-of-state and that these differences are large enough to be educationally meaningful.",Teacher training; Value added; Teacher education

We compared its results to the approach described by Bedi et al. (2015), referred to here as the coherence model. Evaluations were also performed by a clinician using the Scale for the Assessment of Thought, Language and Communication (TLC). Using all six TLC questions the ELMo obtained an accuracy of 80% in distinguishing patients from healthy people. Previously used coherence models were less accurate at 70%. The classifying clinician was accurate 74% of the time. Our analysis shows that both ELMo and TLC are sensitive to the symptoms of disorganization in patients. In this study methods using text representations from language models were more accurate than those based solely on the assessment of FTD, and can be used as measures of disordered language that complement human clinical ratings.",Schizophrenia; Language; Natural language processing; Deep learning

Ben-David,2021,Evaluating rate and accuracy of real word vs. non-word diadochokinetic productions from childhood to early adulthood in Hebrew speakers,article,Journal of Communication Disorders,ScienceDirect,"Background Oral-Diadochokinesis (oral-DDK) tasks measure how quickly and accurately one can repeat a series of target sounds. Thus, they are a popular tool for evaluating oral-motor skills for individuals with various speech disorders. Typically, oral-DDK tasks involve rapid repetition of non-words. For several populations (e.g., young children, older adults), it has been suggested that repetitions of real words may be more suitable, commonly resulting in faster rates. Yet, the literature is either silent or inconsistent regarding this real-word repetition advantage for other age groups, from preschoolers to young adults. It is not clear whether performance accuracy is affected as well. Specifically, for Hebrew speakers, this data is missing. Aims The goal of this study was to compare rate and accuracy for non-word and real-word repetition, in four groups of Hebrew-speaking individuals; preschoolers (5 years old), younger elementary school children (7 years old), adolescents (15 years old) and young adults (25 years old). Secondary goals were to provide a developmental pattern for oral-DDK rates for Hebrew speakers, and to compare it to the English norms. Methods & Procedures All participants (n=150) had typical speech and language development. They were asked to repeat “pataka” (non-word) and “bodeket” (Hebrew real word) as quickly and accurately as possible for 10 sec. Production rates (syllables per second) and accuracy (on a 5-point scale) were measured. Outcomes & Results As expected, oral-DDK rates gradually increased with age, with similar rates for both real- and non-words. Accuracy scores were higher for real- than non-word repetition, across all age groups. For the group of school-age children, the Hebrew rates differed from the English ones. Conclusions & Implications A real-word repetition advantage was documented only for repetition accuracy, but not for rate. These findings can be explained as each stimulus involves different demands on an individual's neuro-motor and linguistic processing abilities. Further research using real- and non-word tasks should be conducted with clinical populations to assess whether both procedures could assist in differential diagnosis between various speech disorders. Finally, the large differences between children of different ages, as well as the apparent rate differences between Hebrew and English, highlight the need to create age- and language-sensitive norms.",Oral-Diadochokinesis; Oral-DDK Rate; Oral-DDK accuracy; Preschool children; Early adulthood; Non-words

This has led to the exploration of alternative sound perception methods involving training of vibrotactile discrimination of sounds within the language spectrum. In particular, stimulus duration plays an important role in linguistic categorical perception. We comparatively evaluated vibrotactile temporal discrimination of sound and how specific training can modify the underlying electrical brain activity. Fifteen profoundly deaf (PD) and 15 normal-hearing (NH) subjects performed a vibrotactile oddball task with simultaneous EEG recording, before and after a short training period (5 one-hour sessions; in 2.5–3 weeks). The stimuli consisted of 700 Hz pure-tones with different duration (target: long 500 ms; non-target: short 250 ms). The sound-wave stimuli were delivered by a small device worn on the right index finger. A similar behavioral training effect was observed in both groups showing significant improvement in sound-duration discrimination. However, quantitative EEG measurements reveal distinct neurophysiological patterns characterized by higher and more diffuse delta band magnitudes in the PD group, together with a generalized decrement in absolute power in both groups that might reflect a facilitating process associated to learning. Furthermore, training-related changes were found in the beta-band in NH. Findings suggest PD have different cognitive adaptive mechanisms which are not a mere amplification effect due to greater cortical excitability.",EEG; Deaf; Vibrotactile; Discrimination; Sound-duration

Two learning sessions were conducted 24 hours apart, with each participant exposed to both contexts. Subsequently, a test phase examined picture naming, translation and picture-word interference tasks. Compared to the unrelated context, the categorically related context resulted in poorer naming accuracy in the learning phase, slower response latencies at the immediate recall tasks and greater semantic interference in the picture-word interference task (picture naming in L1 with semantically related novel word distractors).

As a consequence, children become actors in world where they use passwords to authenticate themselves from a very young age. As such, there is a need for guidance to inform educators and parents about how to prepare children for responsible password practice. Very little attention has been paid to determining which password-related principles young children should know, and the age at which this information should be imparted. To address this deficiency, we commenced by deriving an ontology of “best practice” password principles from official sources. These password principles encode essential knowledge for password users of all ages and provide a benchmark that can be used to ground a set of age-appropriate ontologies. We compared this benchmark “good practice” ontology to the advice provided by a wide-ranging snapshot of password-related children’s books and parents’ online resources. We then consulted the research literature to identify the skills required to understand and apply each principle, and removed those that were unsuitable for young children. We then consulted parents of young children to help us to confirm the classification of the ontology’s principles in terms of age appropriateness. Parents also helped us to rephrase each principle to maximise accessibility and understandability for each age group. We conclude with our final set of three age-appropriate password best practice ontologies as a helpful resource for early education professionals and parents.",

We find that hyperlexia, or a hyperlexic-like profile, characterises a substantial portion of the autistic spectrum, in which the subcomponents of the typical reading architecture are altered and dissociated. Autistic children follow a chronologically inverted path when learning to read, and make extended use of the perceptual expertise system, specifically the visual word form recognition systems.

The present trial investigated a modified version of this program that incorporated parent verbal contingencies. Methods Participants were 22 stuttering children aged 6–11 years. Treatment involved training the children and their parents to use STS in conversation. Parents were also taught to use verbal contingencies in response to their child’s stuttered and stutter-free speech and to praise their child’s use of STS. Outcome assessments were conducted pre-treatment, at the completion of Stage 1 of the program and 6 months and 12 months after Stage 1 completion. Results Outcomes are reported for the 19 children who completed Stage 1 of the program. The group mean percent stuttering reduction was 77% from pre-treatment to 12 months post-treatment, and 82% with the two least responsive participants removed. There was considerable variation in response to the treatment. Eleven of the children showed reduced avoidance of speaking situations and 18 were more satisfied with their fluency post-treatment.

As Gutknecht (2001) claims, the translation theorists have made little systematic use of the techniques and insights of contemporary linguistics. However, two points must be emphasized: (1) although translation has existed for many centuries, it was not until the second half of this century that ‘Translation Studies’ developed into a discipline in its own right, and (2) although translation has taken on concepts and methods of other disciplines, “it is still conceived as a subdiscipline of applied linguistics” (Schaffner, 2004, p. 2). On the other hand, the past fifteen years or so have seen the focus of translation studies shift away from linguistics and increasingly to forms of cultural studies. There has also been a shift towards studies that have incorporated models from functional linguistics and Critical Discourse Analysis, locating the text within its sociocultural context. More recently, technological advances, which have transformed the working conditions of professional translators and researchers and have spawned new forms of translation, have also produced new areas of research, some linked to the effects of globalization and some to forms of intersemiotic translation. The present study, therefore, attempts to outline the scope of the discipline of translation studies (TS), to give some indication of the kind of work that has been done so far. More importantly, it is an attempt to demonstrate that (TS) is a vastly complex field with many far-reaching ramifications.",Linguistic theory translation theory; Translation Studies; Cultural studies sociocultural context; Technological advances; New areas of research; Intersemiotic translation

These findings are consistent with the theory that altered language lateralization may be a cause or consequence of stuttering. Here, we re-examined these findings in a larger sample of PWS. Methods We evaluated planum temporale asymmetry in structural MRI scans obtained from 67 PWS and 63 age-matched controls using: 1) manual measurements of the surface area; 2) voxel-based morphometry to automatically calculate grey matter density. We examined the influences of gender, age, and stuttering severity on planum temporale asymmetry. Results The size of the planum temporale and its asymmetry were not different in PWS compared with Controls using either the manual or the automated method. Both groups showed a significant leftwards asymmetry on average (about one-third of PWS and Controls showed rightward asymmetry). Importantly, and contrary to previous reports, the degree of asymmetry was not related to stuttering severity. In the manual measurements, women who stutter had a tendency towards rightwards asymmetry but men who stutter showed the same degree of leftwards asymmetry as male Controls. In the automated measurements, Controls showed a significant increase in leftwards asymmetry with age but this relationship was not observed in PWS. Conclusions We conclude that reduced planum temporale asymmetry is not a prominent feature of the brain in PWS and that the asymmetry is unrelated to stuttering severity.",

Existing instruments for the detection of dementia in persons with ID were collected and described systematically. This allows a direct and quick overview of available tools. Additionally, it contributes to the availability and usability of information about these instruments, thus enhancing further developments in this field. Methods A systematic literature search in five databases (CINAHL, PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) was conducted. In order to include gray literature an invisible college approach was used. Relevant studies were identified and selected using defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After the selection process all instruments were coded and classified. It was determined which concepts they assess, whether they were especially developed or adapted for persons with ID, and whether they were designed to assess dementia. The selection of relevant papers, as well as the coding of instruments was done independently by two researchers. Results In total, 97 records met the search criteria. Out of these, 114 different instruments were extracted. There were 79 instruments to be completed by the person with ID, and 35 informant-based instruments. Additionally, four test batteries were found. Some of these instruments were neither designed for the assessment of dementia, nor for persons with ID. Conclusions There are a variety of different tools used for the assessment of dementia in ID. Nevertheless, an agreed-upon approach or instrument is missing. Establishing this would improve the quality of assessment in clinical practice, and benefit research.

Methods The Galker test is a 35-item audio-visual, computerized word discrimination test in background noise. Included were 370 normally developed children attending day care center. The children were examined with the Galker test, tympanometry, audiometry, and the Reynell test of verbal comprehension. Parents and daycare teachers completed questionnaires on the children's ability to hear and understand speech. As most of the variables were not assessed using interval scales, non-parametric statistics (Goodman–Kruskal's gamma) were used for analyzing associations with the Galker test score. For comparisons, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Interrelations were adjusted for using a non-parametric graphic model. Results In unadjusted analyses, the Galker test was associated with gender, age group, language development (Reynell revised scale), audiometry, and tympanometry. The Galker score was also associated with the parents’ and day care teachers’ reports on the children's vocabulary, sentence construction, and pronunciation. Type B tympanograms were associated with a mean hearing 5–6dB below that of than type A, C1, or C2. In the graphic analysis, Galker scores were closely and significantly related to Reynell test scores (Gamma (G)=0.35), the children's age group (G=0.33), and the day care teachers’ assessment of the children's vocabulary (G=0.26). Conclusions The Galker test of speech reception in noise appears promising as an easy and quick tool for evaluating preschool children's understanding of spoken words in noise, and it correlated well with the day care teachers’ reports and less with the parents’ reports.",Speech recognition in noise test; Day care children; Language development; Otitis media; Hearing; Non-parametric statistics

Three analyses were performed: (1) the age of customary, acquisition and mastery production of Kurdish consonants; (2) phonological accuracy and the age of phonological pattern suppression; and (3) effect of age and sex on speech sound acquisition. Methods this research assessed 120 monolingual Kurdish-speaking children aged 3;0 to 5;0 years. The participants were selected randomly from the health center of Bukan city, Iran. Acquisition of 29 Kurdish consonants was assessed using the Kurdish Speech Test. Findings results found that Kurdish-speaking children had acquired all the vowels before 3;0 and all the consonants in the three positions of initial, medial and final up to 4;6 years old, with the exception of /ʤ/ in initial position, /ɣ/ in medial position and /ʒ/, /z/, /ɡ/, /ɣ/ in final position. Consonant production in initial position was more accurate than in medial and final positions. The accuracy of Kurdish vowels and consonants improves with increasing age as phonological patterns decrease. There was no significant sex difference within the age groups; however, overall, a statistically significant difference was noted for fricative production and for production of word final consonants in the older groups with females outperforming males. Conclusions the present study is the first investigation of speech sound acquisition in Kurdish-speaking children.

We used the computationally specified ‘Theory of Visual Attention’ together with whole- and partial-report paradigms to compare attentional sub-mechanisms of pre- (n=33) and full-term (n=32) born adults. Resting-state fMRI was used to evaluate both between-group differences and inter-individual variance in changed functional connectivity of intrinsic brain networks relevant for visual attention. In preterm born adults, we found specific impairments of visual short-term memory (vSTM) storage capacity while other sub-mechanisms such as processing speed or attentional weighting were unchanged. Furthermore, changed functional connectivity was found in unimodal visual and supramodal attention-related intrinsic networks. Among preterm born adults, the individual pattern of changed connectivity in occipital and parietal cortices was systematically associated with vSTM in such a way that the more distinct the connectivity differences, the better the preterm adults' storage capacity. These findings provide first evidence for selectively changed attentional sub-mechanisms in preterm born adults and their relation to altered intrinsic brain networks. In particular, data suggest that cortical changes in intrinsic functional connectivity may compensate adverse developmental consequences of prematurity on visual short-term storage capacity.",Preterm birth; Preterm born adults; Selective attention; Theory of Visual Attention; Intrinsic brain networks; Compensation

They analyzed the data using the principles of Grounded Theory and in-depth content analysis. They examined cultural idioms in participants' accounts. Findings suggested that Western diagnostic categories of mental illness were alien to participants. They had a culturally constructed way of defining and characterizing mental illness. Participants used idioms of ‘nerve’, ‘mood’, ‘behavior’, ‘personality’, ‘normal life’, ‘compassion’ and the idiom of ‘others’ to construct an alternative world for stigma management. They erected an invisible but permeable barrier to limit access to their normal world. The role of traditional Chinese culture of Confucianism was significant in shaping perceptions and conceptions of mental illness. This article offered another perspective on the alternative world of Chinese migrants' cultural understandings of mental illness, an area with limited understanding at present.

The aim of this study was to collect the first normative sample of Italian children. Methods We measured the total structural score (TSS), total functional score (TFS), oral function score (OFS), phonatory function score (PFS), maximum phonation time (MPT), speed of monosyllable repetition (SMR), and speed of polysyllable repetition (SPR) in 191 typically developing Italian children aged 2.6–6.11 years. Results Like the finding observed in the original protocol, there were no significant age-related changes in TSS, but the correlation was observed for TFS, OFS, PFS, MPT, SMR and SPR. The Inter-observer agreement was “good” or “excellent” for all scores except for SPR that was “moderate”. Conclusions The increase in oro-motor, oro-phonatory and diadochokinetic abilities confirmed the progressive maturation of these functions with age. The protocol can therefore be considered a useful instrument to classify speech sound disorders (SSDs) by excluding alterations in anatomical structures and evaluate the motor impairment. This normative sample of Italian children allows to use these measures for diagnostic purposes in young Italian speakers.",Oral Motor Assessment; Speech Sound Disorders; Childhood Apraxia of Speech; Test development; DDK rate; Differential Diagnosis

Methods Participants named pictures preceded by masked prime words. Primes and target picture labels were identical or mismatched. Priming effects on naming and picture-elicited ERP activity were analyzed. Vocabulary knowledge correlations with these measures were assessed. Results Priming improved naming RTs and accuracy in both groups. RTs were longer for AWS, and correlated positively with receptive vocabulary in TFA. Electrophysiologically, posterior-P1 amplitude negatively correlated with expressive vocabulary in TFA versus receptive vocabulary in AWS. Frontal/temporal-P1 amplitude correlated positively with expressive vocabulary in AWS. Identity priming enhanced frontal/posterior-N2 amplitude in both groups, and attenuated P280 amplitude in AWS. N400 priming was topographically-restricted in AWS. Conclusions Results suggest that conceptual knowledge was perceptually-grounded in expressive vocabulary in TFA versus receptive vocabulary in AWS. Poorer expressive vocabulary in AWS was potentially associated with greater suppression of irrelevant conceptual information. Priming enhanced N2-indexed cognitive control and visual attention in both groups. P280-indexed focal attention attenuated with priming in AWS only. Topographically-restricted N400 priming suggests that lemma/word form connections were weaker in AWS.

The reliability, including internal consistency and test-retest reliability, of the Chinese version of the EmQue-CA was acceptable. Concurrent validity was assessed by examining the correlations of the EmQue-CA with the Basic Empathy Scale and the prosocial behavior subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, with significant associations delivered. The results of convergent validity demonstrated strong correlations of the EmQue-CA subscales with callous unemotional traits and bullying.

Method Twenty adults with TBI participated in this study, including 10 with neurogenic stuttering (Group B) and 10 without -stuttering (Group A). Disfluency clusters in speech samples were classified into three types: Stuttering-like (SLD), other (OD), and mixed (MIX). Results Speakers with and without neurogenic stuttering produced the same mean number of disfluency clusters. In addition, the mean length of clusters did not differ between these speaker groups although the longest clusters did. The most frequently occurring cluster type for people with neurogenic stuttering was MIX and OD for people without stuttering. Although the speakers in Group A produced stuttering-like disfluencies, these never occurred together to form a SLD type cluster. For Group B, the starter units of the clusters were usually stuttering-like disfluencies, while for Group A, the starter units were mostly interruptions. Conclusions Compared to non-stuttering speakers, stuttering after TBI did not increase the number of clusters, but rather lengthened them. In speakers with neurogenic stuttering, the number and length of clusters were related to the manifestation of other communication deficits, not to the frequency of stuttering-like disfluencies. Still, SLD clusters occurred only in those people with neurogenic stuttering. These findings raise questions about the nature of both neurogenic stuttering and the dynamics of disfluency clustering.",Disfluencies; Disfluency clusters; Fluency; Neurogenic stuttering; Traumatic brain injury

Ryan and M.A. Allyse,2016,Informed decision-making about prenatal cfDNA screening: An assessment of written materials,article,"Ethics, Medicine and Public Health",ScienceDirect,"Summary Objectives The introduction of prenatal cfDNA screening for fetal aneuploidy and other genetic conditions has exacerbated concerns about informed decision-making in clinical prenatal testing. To assess the information provided to patients to facilitate decisions about cfDNA screening, we collected written patient education and consent documents created by laboratories and clinics. Methods Informed consent documents (IC) were coded by two independent coders. Each IC was assessed for readability, attention to elements of informed consent, and completeness of information about the test and the screened conditions. Results We found variance between IC produced by commercial laboratories versus those provided by local clinics or health care systems, and considerable variance among materials from all sources. “Commercial” IC were longer and written at a more difficult reading level than “non-commercial” IC, and were less likely to state explicitly that cfDNA only screens for certain conditions. About one-third of IC were combined with laboratory order forms. Though most IC recommended confirmatory testing for positive results, only about half clearly stated that results could be incorrect — including mentions of false positives or false negatives. About one-third of IC explicitly stated that cfDNA screening was optional. While nearly all IC from any source listed the conditions screened by the test, only about half of the IC included any phenotypic descriptions of these conditions. Few IC mentioned psychosocial considerations, and only one IC mentioned the availability of support groups for families of children with genetic conditions. Conclusions Based on our findings, we recommend that written and well-informed consent be sought before performing cfDNA screening, and we offer minimal and recommended standards for patient education and consent materials. Résumé Objectifs L’introduction du dépistage prénatal cfDNA aneuploïdie fœtale et d’autres maladies génétiques a exacerbé des préoccupations au sujet de prise de décisions éclairée dans les cliniques de dépistage prénatal. Afin d’évaluer les informations fournies aux patients pour faciliter les décisions sur le dépistage de la cfDNA, nous avons recueilli la documentation aux patients et les consentements écrits émanant des laboratoires et des cliniques. Méthodes Les documents de consentement éclairé (IC) ont été codés par deux programmeurs indépendants. Chaque IC a été évalué pour sa lisibilité, pour les éléments du consentement éclairé et l’exhaustivité des informations sur le test et les conditions de dépistage. Résultats Nous avons trouvé des différences entre les IC produits par les laboratoires commerciaux par rapport à ceux fournis par les cliniques locales ou des systèmes de soins de santé et une variance considérable entre les matériaux de toutes les sources. Les IC « Commerciaux » étaient plus longs et rédigés à un niveau de lecture plus difficile que les IC « non commerciaux » et étaient moins susceptible de statuer explicitement sur le statut de dépistage du cfDNA seulement sous certaines conditions. Environ un tiers des IC ont été combinés avec les bons de commande de laboratoire. Si la plupart des IC recommandaient des tests de confirmation pour des résultats sûrs, seulement environ la moitié a clairement indiqué que les résultats pourraient être incorrects — en incluant les mentions de faux positifs ou faux négatifs. Environ un tiers des IC a explicitement déclaré que le dépistage cfDNA était facultatif. Tandis que presque tous les IC de n’importe quelle source répertoriaient les conditions examinées par le test, seulement environ la moitié des IC incluait une description phénotypique de ces conditions. Peu d’IC ont mentionné les facteurs psychosociaux et seul un IC a mentionné l’existence de groupes de soutien pour les familles des enfants atteints de maladies génétiques. Conclusions D’après nos résultats, nous recommandons que le consentement écrit et bien informé soit fourni avant d’effectuer le dépistage des cfDNA, et nous offrons des normes minimales de recommandation pour l’éducation du patient et les éléments du consentement. Une de nos neuf recommandations est que quelle que soit la question de savoir si une signature est requise, les documents de consentement éclairé devraient inclure une instruction simple suggérant de ne pas associer des accords juridiques ou financiers.

Pugh and Ram Frost,2019,Neurobiological signatures of L2 proficiency: Evidence from a bi-directional cross-linguistic study,article,Journal of Neurolinguistics,ScienceDirect,"Recent evidence has shown that convergence of print and speech processing across a network of primarily left-hemisphere regions of the brain is a predictor of future reading skills in children, and a marker of fluent reading ability in adults. The present study extends these findings into the domain of second-language (L2) literacy, through brain imaging data of English and Hebrew L2 learners. Participants received an fMRI brain scan, while performing a semantic judgement task on spoken and written words and pseudowords in both their L1 and L2, alongside a battery of L1 and L2 behavioural measures. Imaging results show, overall, a similar network of activation for reading across the two languages, alongside significant convergence of print and speech processing across a network of left-hemisphere regions in both L1 and L2 and in both cohorts. Importantly, convergence is greater for L1 in occipito-temporal regions tied to automatic skilled reading processes including the visual word-form area, but greater for L2 in frontal regions of the reading network, tied to more effortful, active processing. The main groupwise brain effects tell a similar story, with greater L2 than L1 activation across frontal, temporal and parietal regions, but greater L1 than L2 activation in parieto-occipital regions tied to automatic mapping processes in skilled reading. These results provide evidence for the shifting of the reading networks towards more automatic processing as reading proficiency rises and the mappings and statistics of the new orthography are learned and incorporated into the reading system.",

Millman and Christopher J. Plack,2018,Impaired speech perception in noise with a normal audiogram: No evidence for cochlear synaptopathy and no relation to lifetime noise exposure,article,Hearing Research,ScienceDirect,"In rodents, noise exposure can destroy synapses between inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers (“cochlear synaptopathy”) without causing hair cell loss. Noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy usually leaves cochlear thresholds unaltered, but is associated with long-term reductions in auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes at medium-to-high sound levels. This pathophysiology has been suggested to degrade speech perception in noise (SPiN), perhaps explaining why SPiN ability varies so widely among audiometrically normal humans. The present study is the first to test for evidence of cochlear synaptopathy in humans with significant SPiN impairment. Individuals were recruited on the basis of self-reported SPiN difficulties and normal pure tone audiometric thresholds. Performance on a listening task identified a subset with “verified” SPiN impairment. This group was matched with controls on the basis of age, sex, and audiometric thresholds up to 14 kHz. ABRs and envelope-following responses (EFRs) were recorded at high stimulus levels, yielding both raw amplitude measures and within-subject difference measures. Past exposure to high sound levels was assessed by detailed structured interview. Impaired SPiN was not associated with greater lifetime noise exposure, nor with any electrophysiological measure. It is conceivable that retrospective self-report cannot reliably capture noise exposure, and that ABRs and EFRs offer limited sensitivity to synaptopathy in humans. Nevertheless, the results do not support the notion that noise-induced synaptopathy is a significant etiology of SPiN impairment with normal audiometric thresholds. It may be that synaptopathy alone does not have significant perceptual consequences, or is not widespread in humans with normal audiograms.",Speech in noise; Obscure auditory dysfunction; Cochlear synaptopathy; Hidden hearing loss; Auditory brainstem response; Envelope-following response

Early identification of language delay is essential to improve functional outcome in these children. Aim To examine the concurrent validity of Rescorla's Language Development Survey and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) at 18months corrected age in preterm infants. Study design Test accuracy study. Participants 189 preterm infants born <29weeks were assessed at 18months. Outcome measures The Language Development Survey, a parent-reported screening instrument, was administered in French concurrently with the Language Scales of the Bayley-III. Receiver-Operating-Characteristics curves were used to determine optimal cut-off score on the Language Development Survey to identify Bayley-III score <85. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and κ coefficient were calculated. Results Using Rescorla's original cut-off scores of ≤10 words for boys and ≤24 for girls, sensitivity was 76% and 88% for boys and girls, respectively, and specificity was 73% and 52% for boys and girls, respectively, in identifying language delay as per the Bayley-III. The optimal threshold was ≤10 words for both boys and girls. In girls, lowering the cut-off score decreased sensitivity (79%), but improved specificity (82%), thus lowering the number of false-positives.

However, this treatment, widely recognized as the gold-standard for the treatment of childhood trauma, has been applied only in recent years to address the unique needs of children and adolescents with histories of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. This paper strives to expand this limited literature base by examining the clinical value in individualizing TF-CBT to effectively treat an adolescent experiencing posttraumatic stress related to the experience of familial sex trafficking while also maintaining treatment fidelity. This case study emphasizes the value of the TF-CBT components in addressing a variety of factors that impact this population, including psychological coercion, psychological manipulation, the threat of legal action (in this case deportation), lack of community involvement, running away behaviors, and pregnancy by sexual assault. Multisource measures completed at the beginning and end of treatment document a significant decrease in symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and a depressive disorder after 20 treatment sessions that comprised individual sessions for the youth, individual sessions for the nonoffending caregiver, and conjoint caregiver-youth sessions.",TF-CBT; trauma; familial sex trafficking; labor trafficking; PTSD

As it poses inherent risks associated with intra-arterial catheter techniques and as it occasionally fails to indicate language dominance, an alternative reliable test is needed. We quantitatively assessed the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using the Shiritori task, a Japanese word chain, to identify the threshold for correctly predicting HLD. Methods The subjects were 28 patients with intractable epilepsy scheduled to undergo the Wada test and focus resection. We set the region of interest (ROI) on the bilateral Brodmann areas 44 and 45 (BA 44 and 45). To compare the functional activity at both ROIs we calculated the language laterality index (LI) using the formula: [VL−VR]/[VL+VR]×100, where VL and VR indicated the number of activated voxels in the left and right ROIs, respectively. Results As 2 patients were excluded due to the lack of activation in either ROI, the final study population consisted of 26 patients. By the Wada test, HLD was left in 20, right in 3, and equivocal in 3. At a cut-off of LI+50, the predictive sensitivity and specificity for left HLD were 85% (17/20) and 100%; right HLD was predicted in a single patient (sensitivity 33.3%, specificity 100%).

To scholars, language and culture are inseparably acquired together (Brown, 2000, Hedge, 2004; and Jiang, 2000). Therefore, in this study a textbook teaching Turkish for foreigners (TFL) was analyzed attempting to answer the research questions that whether the textbook includes cultural elements (native-C1; target-C2; and other world cultures-C3) related to Turkish culture and/or world cultures. Data were collected through a textbook evaluation checklist. Descriptive statistics and the item frequency procedure were applied in order to analyze C1, C2, and C3 cultural content of the textbook.

Here we investigated whether this was true for neural representations of simple events described using sentences. Participants viewed sentences describing four events in different ways. Multivariate classifiers were trained to discriminate the four events using a subset of sentences, allowing us to test generalisation to novel sentences. We found that neural patterns in a left-lateralised network of frontal, temporal and parietal regions discriminated events in a way that generalised successfully over changes in the syntactic and lexical properties of the sentences used to describe them. In contrast, decoding in visual areas was sentence-specific and failed to generalise to novel sentences. In the reverse analysis, we tested for decoding of syntactic and lexical structure, independent of the event being described. Regions displaying this coding were limited and largely fell outside the canonical semantic network. Our results indicate that a distributed neural network represents the meaning of event sentences in a way that is robust to changes in their structure and form. They suggest that the semantic system disregards the surface properties of stimuli in order to represent their underlying conceptual significance.",Conceptual knowledge; MVPA; Semantic cognition; Sentences

Our aim is to present the results of a study of the factor structure and the reliability and concurrent validity of the scores of the Selective Mutism Questionnaire (SMQ), translated and adapted into Spanish. The SMQ contains 17 items about children's difficulty in speaking adequately in the family, school and social environment (out-of-school and out-of-family), each of which is answered according to a Likert scale with four response alternatives on speech frequency. Method: The study involved 110 pairs of parents of children diagnosed with SM whose ages ranged from 3 to 10 years. Results: The results show that the data from the Spanish sample fit the factorial model obtained by Bergman et al., and that data on its reliability and validity are robust and confirm that it as a good instrument for assessing SM in Spanish-speaking children. Conclusions: Therefore, we can affirm that the SMQ is a good instrument to assess SM in Spanish-speaking children.

Taylor,2012,The relative efficiency of charter schools: A cost frontier approach,article,Economics of Education Review,ScienceDirect,"Charters represent an expansion of public school choice, offering free, publicly funded educational alternatives to traditional public schools. One relatively unexplored research question concerning charter schools asks whether charter schools are more efficient suppliers of educational services than are traditional public schools. The potential relative efficiency advantage of charters vis-a-vis traditional publics is one of the mechanisms that supports the hypotheses that charters could improve performance for their students while using the same or fewer resources, and that the systemic effect of charters could lead to improved outcomes for traditional public students without requiring an increase in education sector resources. In this paper, we provide evidence as to the cost efficiency of charter schools relative to traditional public schools, and explore the extent to which those differences are attributable to differences in hiring and compensation practices, or to differences in the length of time a campus has been operating. We generate estimates of efficiency using a stochastic cost frontier approach. We estimate a translog stochastic cost frontier model using panel data for charter campuses and traditional public campuses in Texas over the five-year period 2005–2009. Our main findings suggest that charter schools are able to produce educational outcomes at lower cost than traditional public schools—probably because they face fewer regulations—but are not systematically more efficient relative to their frontier than are traditional public schools.",Charter schools; Costs; School choice; Efficiency; Teacher salaries

One recent study conducted in preschool classrooms serving low-income children found negative associations between age-mixing and children's social and cognitive development. The current study extended this research by examining associations between classroom age composition (variability in ages of children in the classroom) and low-income preschool children's rates of change in school readiness. The sample consisted of 4417 preschool children enrolled in 207 classrooms in a large, diverse urban Head Start program. Multilevel modeling was employed to examine the main effect of classroom age composition, as well as the interaction between classroom age composition and children's age, as predictors of children's rates of change in emergent literacy, emergent numeracy, social and emotional skills, and approaches to learning. In contrast to previous research, classroom age composition was not associated with school readiness outcomes. This study contributes to the conflicting literature examining the associations between age mixing and children's school readiness and calls for a future research agenda to examine age mixing in context that is focused on sorting out these conflicting results.

In parallel, a growing body of research reports language difficulties in Parkinson’s disease, more specifically in the domains of sentence processing and lexical-semantic processing. In this review, the performance of patients with Parkinson’s disease in these domains of language will be reviewed with a focus on the links that they have with the rest of cognition and on how they could contribute to the earlier and more precise characterization and prediction of cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease.

The MoCA is often the only formal cognitive assessment available when comprehensive neuropsychological testing is not practical, such as rural clinical settings or large retrospective and multi-lingual research settings. However, the MoCA domain-specific subsections have never been formally assessed for sensitivity or specificity. Therefore, in Parkinson's disease, we examined whether the subsections of the MoCA could identify cognitive impairment within specific cognitive domains. Methods We administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery to 85 Parkinson's disease participants, who were then categorized as with or without cognitive impairment, with respect to global cognition and in five cognitive domains. We then assessed the domain-specific categorization of the MoCA subsections compared to the full neuropsychology battery. Results All MoCA subsections predicted impairment in their respective cognitive domain. However, the executive subsection showed the highest sensitivity and specificity (89.3% and 82.5%, respectively), followed by visuospatial (93.3% and 45.7%, respectively) and memory (84.6% and 56.5%, respectively).

Method The aim of the study was to assess the validity of the self-reporting questionnaire SRQ 20, (English and Urdu versions) in white Europeans and British Pakistanis and to determine the optimum cut-off scores for detecting depression. Validation of the English and Urdu versions of the SRQ was conducted with a sample of white Europeans and British Pakistani participants.

In this study, we measured behavioral and brain responses to newly-learned words in children. Two groups of Dutch children, aged between 8–10 and 14–16 years, were trained on 30 novel Japanese words depicting novel concepts. Children were tested on word-forms, word-meanings, and the novel words’ influence on existing word processing immediately after training, and again after a week. In line with the adult findings, hippocampal involvement decreased with time. Lexical integration, however, was not observed immediately or after a week, neither behaviorally nor neurally. It appears that time alone is not always sufficient for lexical integration to occur.

Consequently, there is a need for early educational intervention methods that are suitable for infants at the preverbal level. To meet this need we have developed and evaluated the Muenster Parental Programme (MPP), a responsive parenting programme for parents of children with HL aged 3–18 months. It aims at enhancing the parents’ communicative skills towards their child. Methods The MPP is introduced following confirmation of a HL. Flanked by two individual counselling sessions, the programme comprises six group sessions and two single training sessions with video feedback. The focus of the programme lies in enhancing parents’ responsive behaviour and in reducing inappropriate initiative behaviour. The present study involved 29 parents of 24 children aged 6.6 (mean, range: 3–12) months at the outset of the MPP. The children's degree of HL ranged from moderate to profound. Parents of children with unilateral HL and/or risk for an additional developmental delay were included. The prospective study compared parent communication skills of a trained (N=15) versus a control group (N=14) before and after the MPP. For this purpose, instances of responsive behaviour to the signals of the child and total time of initiative behaviour within a 4-min video-sample were measured before and after completion of the study in both groups. Results Trained parents could enhance their responsiveness to vocal and preverbal signals of the child (Wilcoxon test, p=.002) and also their responsiveness to non-verbal signals (Wilcoxon test, p<.001). Moreover, parents reduced their inappropriate initiative behaviour (related t-test, p<.001). Pre-post comparisons in the control group were non-significant. Conclusions The increased parental responsiveness to infants with HL is of great importance as these early behaviours underlie later acquisition of speech, language, hearing and social communication skills. The MPP constitutes the first evaluated group concept for parents of infants with HL in the German-speaking countries and equally meets the needs of parents and professionals.",Hearing loss; Early intervention; Responsive parenting; Interaction; Newborn hearing screening; Evidence-based practice

Although Hebrew has an alphabetic writing system, just like English, French, or Spanish, a series of studies consistently suggested that simple form-orthographic priming, or letter-transposition priming are not found in Hebrew. In four experiments, we tested the hypothesis that this is due to the fact that Semitic words have an underlying structure that constrains the possible alignment of phonemes and their respective letters. The experiments contrasted typical Semitic words which are root-derived, with Hebrew words of non-Semitic origin, which are morphologically simple and resemble base-words in European languages. Using RSVP, TL priming, and form-priming manipulations, we show that Hebrew readers process Hebrew words which are morphologically simple similar to the way they process English words. These words indeed reveal the typical form-priming and TL priming effects reported in European languages. In contrast, words with internal structure are processed differently, and require a different code for lexical access. We discuss the implications of these findings for current models of visual word recognition.",Morphological processing; Orthographic processing; Letter transpositions; Form-priming

The growing burden of survivorship is substantial in terms of the complexity of long-term health effects and the number of people affected. Persistent symptoms have been reported in patients with both mild and severe acute COVID-19, including those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Early reports on the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) indicate that fatigue, dyspnoea, cough, headache, loss of taste or smell, and cognitive or mental health impairments are among the most common symptoms. These complex, multifactorial impairments across the domains of physical, cognitive, and mental health require a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to management. Decades of research on the multifaceted needs of and models of care for patients with post-intensive care syndrome provide a framework for the development of PASC clinics to address the immediate needs of both hospitalised and non-hospitalised survivors of COVID-19. Such clinics could also provide a platform for rigorous research into the natural history of PASC and the potential benefits of therapeutic interventions.",

The amplitude of the N400 effect in event-related brain potentials is inversely correlated with the degree of fit of a word's meaning into a semantic representation of the preceding discourse. This study reports a double dissociation in the latency characteristics of the N400 effect depending on task demands. When participants silently read words in a sentence context, without issuing a relevant overt response, greater temporal alignment over recording sites occurs for N400 onsets than peaks. If however a behavior is produced – here pressing a button in a binary probe selection task – exactly the opposite pattern is observed, with stronger alignment of N400 peaks than onsets. The peak amplitude of the N400 effect correlates best with the latency characteristic showing less temporal dispersion. These findings suggest that meaning construction in the brain is subtly affected by task demands, and that there is complex functional integration between semantic combinatorics and control systems handling behavioral goals.",N400; Language processing; Semantics

Wierenga,2017,Temporal gradient during famous face naming is associated with lower cerebral blood flow and gray matter volume in aging,article,Neuropsychologia,ScienceDirect,"Objective Evidence suggests that famous face naming may be a cognitive ability especially sensitive to the early pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that those at risk for AD may demonstrate a Ribot temporal gradient (RTG), characterized by better performance for naming remote famous faces than for naming recent famous faces. Reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and gray matter volume (GMV) have been implicated in the neuropathological cascade of AD and show utility as biomarkers of AD risk. We examined whether a RTG during famous face naming was associated with lower CBF and/or GMV among a group of cognitively normal older adults. Methods Voxel-wise independent samples t-tests were employed to contrast resting CBF values between those who exhibited a RTG (RTG+) during a famous face naming task and those who did not (RTG-) among a sample of 52 cognitively normal older adults (25 RTG-, 27 RTG+; mean age = 73). Groups were also compared on GMV using a voxel-wise general linear model. Results Significant group differences in CBF and GMV were found, whereby the RTG+ group demonstrated reduced CBF and GMV within medial temporal lobe regions (hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus), relative to the RTG- group. Conclusions This represents the first study to show that cognitively intact older adults who demonstrate a RTG during famous face naming exhibit vascular dysregulation and structural changes similar to that seen in AD risk. Findings suggest that famous face naming ability may be particularly sensitive to the very early brain changes associated with AD.",Preclinical Alzheimer's disease; Ribot temporal gradient; Famous face naming; Cerebral blood flow; Arterial spin labeling; Magnetic resonance imaging; Cognitive aging

The challenge to find the cause for each and every accident has perpetuated a complicated and fundamental debate. In spite of the different paradigms, the many branch specific investigation methods, decades of accumulated and documented accident investigation experience, the diversity in taxonomy of causal factors, and an increasing depth of general systematic analysis tools, there are still causal factors missing out. A recent study identifies language issues as an underestimated danger. Dutch Labour Inspectorate records identify procedures and communication as an important causal factor area for major accidents. Accident investigation method taxonomies that are frequently used in The Netherlands, were investigated on the content related to language issues. Language issues are found to be either present less than proportional with observed accident rates or not present at all in frequently applied accident investigation classification systems. Hence a new taxonomy problem was found in Dutch accident data. Language issues need more attention in accident investigation methods.",Taxonomy; Accident investigation; Language issues; Diversity; Industrial safety; SEVESO

This study used the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) 2000 data for a nationally representative sample to identify subgroups of children meeting three different criteria for having a disability or developmental delay. Results indicated that about one-third of children in Head Start (33%) met one or more of the criteria for a disability or delay, about one-third of those children (33%) met criteria for two or for all three of the subgroups. However, only 8% of children in Head Start had an Individualized Education Program (IEP). Children with disabilities or delays, regardless of the subgroup criteria used, had higher levels of many other risk factors associated with poor developmental and school readiness outcomes. They also exhibited poorer performance on early literacy, social, and behavioral measures both at entry into Head Start and at the end of kindergarten compared with children not in each of those subgroups.

Yet, the complexities of collaborating across institutions and professions as well as the identity work that goes with it has been under theorized in inclusive education partnerships. Drawing from Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) and the literature on boundary practices, this paper advances theoretical tools to examine and further understand the work of inclusive education partnerships. We conceptualize partnerships as a fertile ground for learning and identity development as professionals work across institutional boundaries and face tensions and contradictions created by the overlap of different communities of practice and their respective policies and mediating tools.

To overcome these obstacles, researchers have developed and are currently evaluating different multi-tiered systems of support that are specific to the settings, service delivery models, and curricula in early childhood education. Given the rate at which departments of education and accreditation agencies are presently creating system-wide tiered support systems for early childhood education, we conducted a review of the available literature on multi-tiered systems of support in early childhood education to provide stakeholders with guidance on development and implementation. Our findings indicate that tiered support systems targeting social–emotional development were most successful.

Geriatricians agree on its definition, but the lists of geriatric syndromes vary based on the purpose. The aim of this article is to attempt to reach a consensus on the list of geriatric syndromes within the Asian-Pacific geriatric societies. Methods We surveyed Asian-Pacific expert geriatricians using a questionnaire that asked whether each country's geriatric society recognized the presented items as a geriatric syndrome. Results Expert geriatricians from 10 Asian-Pacific nations/regions completed the questionnaire. Dementia, incontinence, delirium, falls, hearing impairment, visual impairment, sarcopenia, malnutrition, and frailty were agreed on as geriatric syndromes by all 10 respondents. Immobility, gait disturbance, and pressure ulcers were included as geriatric syndromes by 90% of the respondents while osteoporosis, failure to thrive, sleep disorder, and functional dependency were included by 80%. Less than 50% of the respondents included self-neglect, anorexia, and emesis as geriatric syndromes. Conclusions Dementia, incontinence, delirium, falls, hearing impairment, visual impairment, sarcopenia, malnutrition, frailty, immobility, gait disturbance, and pressure ulcers were included as geriatric syndromes by at least 90% of the respondents.

Ellen Grant and April A. Benasich,2010,Associations between the size of the amygdala in infancy and language abilities during the preschool years in normally developing children,article,NeuroImage,ScienceDirect,"Recently, structural MRI studies in children have been used to examine relations between brain volume and behavioral measures. However, most of these studies have been done in children older than 2 years of age. Obtaining volumetric measures in infants is considerably more difficult, as structures are less well defined and largely unmyelinated, making segmentation challenging. Moreover, it is still unclear whether individual anatomic variation across development, in healthy, normally developing infants, is reflected in the configuration and function of the mature brain and, as importantly, whether variation in infant brain structure might be related to later cognitive and linguistic abilities. In this longitudinal study, using T1 structural MRI, we identified links between amygdala volume in normally developing, naturally sleeping, 6-month infants and their subsequent language abilities at 2, 3 and 4 years. The images were processed and manually segmented using Cardviews to extract volumetric measures. Intra-rater reliability for repeated segmentation was 87.73% of common voxel agreement. Standardized language assessments were administered at 6 and 12 months and at 2, 3 and 4 years. Significant and consistent correlations were found between amygdala size and language abilities. Children with larger right amygdalae at 6 months had lower scores on expressive and receptive language measures at 2, 3, and 4 years. Associations between amygdala size and language outcomes have been reported in children with autism. The findings presented here extend this association to normally developing children, supporting the idea that the amygdalae might play an important but as yet unspecified role in mediating language acquisition.",Amygdala; Infant; Language development; Naturally sleeping MRI; Emotion

The study methods were varied, and included reflective techniques (e.g., questionnaires, journals, and thought listing) and momentary techniques (e.g., experience sampling method, think alouds). The studies were mainly grounded in sociocultural theory or metacognition. Generally, studies found that self-talk functioned to help children to regulate task engagement and cope with social challenges.

The children underwent language testing and MRI scans at 1.5 T. Brain tissue was segmented and frontotemporal volumes were computed. Higher mean language scores were significantly associated with larger inferior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, and posterior superior temporal gyrus gray matter volumes in the epilepsy group and in the children with epilepsy with average language scores. Increased total brain and dorsolateral prefrontal gray and white matter volumes, however, were associated with higher language scores in the healthy controls. Within the epilepsy group, linguistic deficits were related to smaller anterior superior temporal gyrus gray matter volumes and there was a negative association between language scores and dorsolateral prefrontal gray matter volumes.

Participants were 231 adolescents and youth (M=14.9, SD=1.99, 58.4% female) from five provinces of Burundi, a country in Central Africa affected by war and political violence. Translation and back-translation of the CTQ was carried out to obtain an adaptation of CTQ in Kirundi, the native language of Burundi. With the exception of one item on ‘molestation’ in the factor of sexual abuse, the five-factor structure of CTQ was obtained comprising latent factors, namely emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and emotional and physical neglect. The rate of abuse and neglect ranged from 14.7-93.5% with more than 37% reporting 4 or more types of abuse and neglect experiences. Emotional abuse and neglect, and physical neglect were 2–3 times higher among Burundian adolescents when compared with studies from high-income countries using the CTQ. A cumulative effect of multiple types of abuse and neglect was found, such that, those with 4 or more types of maltreatment were higher on symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress. Findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive, standardized, and validated measures and norms for gauging childhood maltreatment in Burundi and related need for preventative interventions on childhood maltreatment.",Child abuse and neglect; CTQ; Burundi; Africa; Cumulative risk; Low income country

To answer this question, we used Huntington's disease as a model of striatal lesion. We investigated the morphological deficit of 30 early Huntington's disease patients with a novel linguistic task that can be modeled within an explicit theory of linguistic computation. Behavioral results reflected an impairment in HD patients on the linguistic task. Computational model-based analysis compared the behavioral data to simulated data from two distinct lesion models, a selection deficit model and a grammatical deficit model. This analysis revealed that the impairment derives from an increased randomness in the process of selecting between grammatical alternatives, rather than from a disruption of grammatical knowledge per se. Voxel-based morphometry permitted to correlate this impairment to dorsal striatal degeneration. We thus show that the striatum holds a role in the selection of linguistic alternatives, just as in the selection of motor and cognitive programs.",Language; Huntington's disease; Basal ganglia; Brain mapping

However, these correlations have not all been explored together in prospective longitudinal studies. The goal of the current research was to compare how early speech perception and cognitive skills predict later language outcomes using a within-participant design. To achieve this goal, we tested 97 5- to 7-month-olds on two speech perception tasks (stress pattern preference, native vowel discrimination) and two cognitive tasks (visual recognition memory, A-not-B) and later assessed their vocabulary outcomes at 18 and 24 months. Frequentist statistical analyses showed that only native vowel discrimination significantly predicted vocabulary. However, Bayesian analyses suggested that evidence was ambiguous between null and alternative hypotheses for all infant predictors. These results highlight the importance of recognizing and addressing challenges related to infant data collection, interpretation, and replication in the developmental field, a roadblock in our route to understanding the contribution of domain-specific and domain-general skills for language acquisition.

Each participant saw either Arabic or Indian numerals. The results of the size congruity effect in the physical task, for both Indian and Arabic numerals, suggest that studying two sets of numerals interferes with the acquisition of an automatic association of a numerical symbol and magnitude.

Results partially confirmed the hypothesis in the school domain, but not in the social domain. In the school domain, a positive bias at Time 1 was associated with better self-regulation three years later, fewer feelings of school alienation and higher school achievement. In the social domain, a negative bias was linked positively with the preference for avoiding social relations and with peers' rejection. Unexpectedly, a negative bias of self-evaluation of social competence was linked to better self-regulation. Furthermore, unlike previous research (Larouche, Galand, & Bouffard, 2008), the positive association between biased self-evaluations of school and social competences was not confirmed. The discussion highlights the importance of broadening the examination of the impact of biased self-evaluation of competence in various domains and the factors associated with their development.",Biased self-evaluation of school competence; Biased self-evaluation of social competence; School adjustment; Social adjustment

Methods Five children with cleft palate (+/-cleft lip) with VPI and non-oral and passive cleft speech characteristics underwent 40 intensive articulation therapies over 10 weeks in a single case experimental design. The percentage of non-oral CSCs (NCSCs), passive CSCs (PCSCs), stimulable consonants (SC), correct consonants in word imitation (CCI), and correct consonants in picture naming (CCN) were captured at baseline, during intervention and in follow up phases. Visual analysis and two effect size indexes of Percentage of Nonoverlapping Data and Percentage of Improvement Rate Difference were analyzed. Results Articulation therapy resulted in visible decrease in NCSCs for all 5 participants across the intervention phases. Intervention was effective in changing percentage of passive CSCs in two different ways; it reduced the PCSCs in three cases and resulted in an increase in PCSCs in the other two cases. This was interpreted as intervention having changed the non-oral CSCs to consonants produced within the oral cavity but with passive characteristics affecting manner of production including weakness, nasalized plosives and nasal realizations of plosives and fricatives. Percent SC increased throughout the intervention period in all five patients. All participants demonstrated an increase in percentage of CCI and CCN suggesting an increase in the consonant inventory. Follow-up data showed that all the subjects were able to maintain their ability to articulate learned phonemes correctly even after a 4-week break from intervention. Conclusion This single case experimental study supports the hypothesis that speech intervention in patients with VPI can result in an improvement in oral placements and passive CSCs.",Cleft palate; Non-oral CSCs; Passive CSCs; Speech; Single case experimental design; VPI; Articulation therapy

Stimulation of other portions of the exposed cortex did not cause language switching as did not stimulation of the left inferior frontal gyrus, where we evoked a speech arrest. Stimulation effects on language switching were selective, namely, interfered with counting behaviour but not with object naming.

Such strokes often have consequences for emotional experience, but these can be subtle. In such cases diagnosis is difficult because emotional awareness (limiting reporting of emotional changes) may be affected. The present study sought to clarify the mechanisms of altered emotion experience after right MCA stroke. It was predicted that after right MCA stroke the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain region concerned with emotional awareness, would show reduced neural activity. Brain activity during presentation of emotional stimuli was measured in 6 patients with stable stroke, and in 12 age- and sex-matched nonlesion comparisons using positron emission tomography and the [15O]H2O autoradiographic method. MCA stroke was associated with weaker pleasant experience and decreased activity ipsilaterally in the ACC. Other regions involved in emotional processing including thalamus, dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex showed reduced activity ipsilaterally. Dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex, association visual cortex and cerebellum showed reduced activity contralaterally. Experience from unpleasant stimuli was unaltered and was associated with decreased activity only in the left midbrain. Right MCA stroke may reduce experience of pleasant emotions by altering brain activity in limbic and paralimbic regions distant from the area of direct damage, in addition to changes due to direct tissue damage to insula and basal ganglia. The knowledge acquired in this study begins to explain the mechanisms underlying emotional changes following right MCA stroke.

Method Participants were 17 children who stutter (CWS) (Age range = 7–12) and 17 age and gender-matched children who do not stutter (CWNS). For the nonword repetition task, the participants repeated sets of 2-, 3-, and 4-syllable nonwords (n = 12 per set). The participants silently identified a target nonword from a subsequent set of three nonwords (n = 12 per 2-, 3- and 4-syllable length) for the nonword identification task. The performance of CWS on the nonword repetition task was compared with the CWNS for the mean number of accurate repetitions, number of trials taken, number of accurate repetitions on initial trial, and number of fluent repetitions across the three-syllable conditions for the tasks. For the nonword identification task, the number of nonwords identified accurately by the two groups were subjected to analysis. Results CWS were significantly less accurate on the initial production of nonwords and required significantly more number of attempts to repeat the nonword accurately. Further for the nonword identification task, CWS were significantly less accurate than CWNS in correctly identifying the target nonword. Conclusions The present findings suggest that, in addition to limitations in PWM capacity, an unstable speech motor control system in CWS may lead to dysfluent speech.",Nonword repetition; Nonword identification; Phonological working memory; Phonological abilities; Children who stutter

Analyses provided strong evidence for a specific link between serial order WM and both vocabulary measures, with a particularly important link with the rare noun subtask and the absence of link with verbs.

Often, there is a mismatch between parents and children in terms of language, particularly in the early post-adoption period. There is a gap in the literature regarding parent experiences of this phase of their lives. Changing patterns in international adoption have led to an increase in adoptions of toddlers and older children. Due to institutional care, these toddlers and older children often lack exposure to their native language which may lead to language delay. When they are brought home, they are immersed in English. As well beginning to acquire English, these children are also forming an attachment with their parents. While research has investigated speech and language skills in this population, there is a lack of literature exploring the experiences of parents regarding communicating with toddlers who are adopted internationally in the early months following adoption. This is a qualitative study where interviews and thematic analysis were used to explore the experiences of 12 parents of 12 toddlers who were adopted internationally. Three main themes: ‘Getting ready’, ‘Support’, and ‘Challenges’ emerged from the data. The results highlight the ways in which adoptive parents facilitated communication with their toddlers, supporting their acquisition of English. The results also reveal gaps in service provision for this population. Results also illustrate the proactive way in which parents dealt with challenges, even in the presence of limited support services. Gaps in service provision where intense focus pre-adoption was followed by a lack of support post-adoption were identified by parents. The dual needs of developing attachment and common language development strategies were also described by parents. The study demonstrates the need for pre- and post-adoptive speech and language services for this client group. It highlights the importance of the role of speech and language pathology in working with parents of toddlers and children who were adopted internationally. This role is in health promotion and prevention, as well as providing a service to this population as part of a multidisciplinary team, post-adoption.",Toddlers who were adopted internationally; Qualitative study; Speech & language therapy; Speech-language pathology; Parent experiences; Service provision

Eden,2016,Chinese Character and English Word processing in children's ventral occipitotemporal cortex: fMRI evidence for script invariance,article,NeuroImage,ScienceDirect,"Learning to read is thought to involve the recruitment of left hemisphere ventral occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) by a process of “neuronal recycling”, whereby object processing mechanisms are co-opted for reading. Under the same theoretical framework, it has been proposed that the visual word form area (VWFA) within OTC processes orthographic stimuli independent of culture and writing systems, suggesting that it is universally involved in written language. However, this “script invariance” has yet to be demonstrated in monolingual readers of two different writing systems studied under the same experimental conditions. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined activity in response to English Words and Chinese Characters in 1st graders in the United States and China, respectively. We examined each group separately and found the readers of English as well as the readers of Chinese to activate the left ventral OTC for their respective native writing systems (using both a whole-brain and a bilateral OTC-restricted analysis). Critically, a conjunction analysis of the two groups revealed significant overlap between them for native writing system processing, located in the VWFA and therefore supporting the hypothesis of script invariance. In the second part of the study, we further examined the left OTC region responsive to each group's native writing system and found that it responded equally to Object stimuli (line drawings) in the Chinese-reading children. In English-reading children, the OTC responded much more to Objects than to English Words. Together, these results support the script invariant role of the VWFA and also support the idea that the areas recruited for character or word processing are rooted in object processing mechanisms of the left OTC.",Reading; Visual word form area; fMRI; Orthography

A recurrent claim is that linguistic properties at interfaces are inherently more “complex” than linguistic properties internal to a specific domain (syntax, phonology, semantics) due to the integration of different levels of linguistic knowledge/analysis. Even within interfaces, not all interfaces are created equal; some have been claimed to be even more complex, vulnerable, or more problematic than others. Slabakova (2008) claims that properties at the syntax–semantics interface are largely unproblematic in adult L2 acquisition, but functional morphology (the morphology–syntax interface), by contrast, is the bottleneck of acquisition. Drawing on the distinction between internal and external interfaces, Tsimpli and Sorace (2006) and Sorace and Serratrice (2009) have also argued that the syntax–semantics interface (an internal interface) is eventually acquired at the near-native level, while, the syntax–discourse interface (an external interface) presents prolonged difficulty in both L2 acquisition and L1 attrition. In this article I question these recent claims about vulnerability of specific interfaces based on empirical evidence from recent studies on incomplete acquisition in L2 and heritage language acquisition.

Methods A random sample of 301 child/caregiver dyads was recruited from kindergartens in Hong Kong. Two locally-developed and validated OHL assessment tasks were administered to caregivers with Hong Kong Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry-30 (HKREALD-30) assessing word recognition and Hong Kong Oral Health Literacy Assessment Task for Paediatric Dentistry (HKOHLAT-P) assessing comprehension. Their children's oral health status was assessed [dental caries experience – decayed, missing, filled teeth index – (dmft) and oral hygiene status – Visible Plaque Index (VPI)]. Results Caregivers’ literacy was associated with children's oral health status. The HKOHLAT-P had a stronger association with children's oral health than HKREALD-30.

Classroom self-regulation explained a moderate proportion of the kindergarten math and literacy gaps, but only among children from economically disadvantaged families. After accounting for classroom self-regulation, executive function skills explained a more substantial proportion of kindergarten achievement gaps for children from economically disadvantaged families and Spanish-speaking ELLs. Moreover, although executive function skills continued to explain achievement gaps in third grade for both groups, effect sizes were small.

In this study, we compare brain mechanisms of Spanish word learning in Chinese and English speakers using two learning conditions: speech-based learning and handwriting-based learning. The behavioral data suggest an advantage for learning that uses handwriting over speech-based learning across all participants. Furthermore, brain imaging data reveal that English speakers show greater functional connectivity among phonological regions in the handwriting condition than the speech-based condition during a silent phonological recall task. This suggests that, for English speakers specifically, handwriting further enhanced the phonological network. Interestingly, Chinese speakers showed an opposite pattern, with greater functional connectivity among phonological regions in the speech-based condition than the handwriting condition. Moreover, it was found that Chinese speakers with higher reading skills in their native L1 tended to engage the right fusiform to a greater degree by connecting to phonological regions in the handwriting condition. Thus, the handwriting-based learning engaged visuo-orthographic regions to a greater degree in highly skilled Chinese speakers. In summary, the current findings suggest that handwriting facilitates lexical learning by enhancing orthographic involvement in Chinese speakers, while the handwriting condition enhanced phonological involvement in English speakers. This difference between Chinese and English speakers might be due to different L1 learning experience.",handwriting; speech-based; second language; fMRI; Spanish

The contrastive syllable stress elicited two consecutive MMNs in both language groups, but English speakers demonstrated larger responses to stress patterns than Mandarin speakers. Correlations between the amplitude of ERPs and continuous changes in the running intensity and pitch of speech assessed how well each language group’s brain activity tracked these salient acoustic features of lexical stress.

Thus, when an error is made in a decision about spelling, the brain processes indexed by the ERN reflect both phonological and orthographic input to the decision process. In both experiments, ERN effect sizes were correlated with assessments of lexical knowledge and reading, including offline spelling ability and spelling-mediated vocabulary knowledge. These results affirm the interdependent nature of orthographic, semantic, and phonological knowledge components while showing that spelling knowledge uniquely influences the ERN during spelling decisions. Finally, the study demonstrates the value of ERNs in exposing individual differences in lexical knowledge.",Spelling; Error-monitoring; Orthographic representation; Phonological processing; ERPs; Error-related negativity

This study investigated (a) whether beat gestures combined with prosodic information help children recall contrastively focused words as well as information related to those words in a child-directed discourse (Experiment 1) and (b) whether the presence of beat gestures helps children comprehend a narrative discourse (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, 51 4-year-olds were exposed to a total of three short stories with contrastive words presented in three conditions, namely with prominence in both speech and gesture, prominence in speech only, and nonprominent speech. Results of a recall task showed that (a) children remembered more words when exposed to prominence in both speech and gesture than in either of the other two conditions and that (b) children were more likely to remember information related to those words when the words were associated with beat gestures. In Experiment 2, 55 5- and 6-year-olds were presented with six narratives with target items either produced with prosodic prominence but no beat gestures or produced with both prosodic prominence and beat gestures. Results of a comprehension task demonstrated that stories told with beat gestures were comprehended better by children. Together, these results constitute evidence that beat gestures help preschoolers not only to recall discourse information but also to comprehend it.",Beat gestures; Prosodic prominence; Word recall; Narrative comprehension; Saliency effect; Child development

With the use of a computerized Chinese Handwriting Assessment Tool (CHAT), it was made possible to objectively assess and analyze in detail the handwriting characteristics of individual students. Fifty participants (age range: 15–19-years-old) were recruited from one mainstream secondary school and 20 participants (age range: 17–24-years-old) were recruited from two secondary schools for students with PD. They were asked to perform three consecutive handwriting tasks: copying 90 characters using the computerized CHAT, an English passage copying task, and a Chinese passage copying task. The data indicated that students with PD were significantly slower in copying both Chinese and English characters in passages when compared to the typical students. Significant differences in the measures of writing speed, air/ground time ratio, standard deviation of speed, standard deviation of size per character, and number of stroke errors measured by the CHAT were found between the two groups of students. Further analysis on the data of typical students indicated no significant difference in handwriting speed among students of different classes (i.e. arts or science) on copying Chinese and English passages, and on individual Chinese words (from CHAT). The academic results of students also showed no significant correlation with their handwriting speed measured by the three writing tasks. To conclude, the CHAT system was able to identify a number of characteristics of handwriting on students with and without PD. It was suggested that the CHAT should further be developed into an objective evaluation tool to explore the handwriting characteristics of the students with a wider range of disabilities in the future, and to make recommendations to arrange special examination arrangements (SEA) for students with physical disabilities or other special needs.",Handwriting; Physical disabilities; Secondary students; Computerized tool; Special examination arrangements

To answer this question, we carried out an experiment in which beginning, intermediate, and adult Basque readers (n=32 each, average age=7, 11, and 22years, respectively) needed to read correctly versus incorrectly inflected words embedded in sentences. Half of the targets contained high-frequency stems, and the other half contained low-frequency stems. To each stem, four inflections of different lengths were attached (-a, -ari, -aren, and -arentzat, i.e., inflectional sequences). To test whether the process of word recognition was modulated by the knowledge of word structure in the language, half of the participants’ native language was Basque and the other half’s native language was Spanish. Children showed robust effects of frequency and length of inflection that diminished with age. In addition, the effect of length of inflection was modulated by the frequency of the stem and by the native language. Taken together, these results suggest that word recognition develops from a decoding strategy to a direct lexical access strategy and that this process is modulated by children’s knowledge of the inflectional structure of words from the beginning of their reading experience.",Word recognition; Reading development; Orthographic representation; Inflectional morphology; Agglutination; Lexical access

Method Three groups of listeners attributed accents to conversational speech samples of 5 FAS speakers which were embedded amongst those of 5 speakers with a real foreign accent and 5 native speaker controls. The listening panels differed in their familiarity with foreign accented speech and speech pathology. Results The findings indicate that listeners’ perceptual responses to the three groups of speakers were essentially different at all levels of analysis. The native speaker controls were unequivocally recognized as native speakers of Dutch while the speakers with a real foreign accent were very reliably assessed as non-native speakers. The speakers with Foreign Accent Syndrome, however, were in some sense perceived as foreign and in some sense as native by listeners, but not as foreign as speakers with a real foreign accent nor as native as real native speakers. These results are accounted for in terms of a misinterpretation of markers of speech pathology as markers regional affiliation. Conclusions The findings of the experiment are consistent with the idea that the very nature of the foreign accent is different in both groups of speakers, although it cannot be fully excluded that the foreign impression in the two groups is one of degree. Learning outcomes: Readers are able to: (1) define Foreign Accent Syndrome as a motor speech disorder and identify the different subtypes of FAS, (2) describe the most important differences in listeners’ perceptual reactions to FAS and real foreign accents, and (3) discuss the findings of the present study in relation to other studies investigating accent attribution in FAS.",Foreign Accent Syndrome; Accent attribution; Speech perception

The fillers in these wh-dependencies involve lexically selected noun complements (Comp): quelle décision à propos de lui/à son sujet ‘which decision about him’ or unselected NP-modifiers (Mod): quelle décision le concernant ‘which decision regarding him’; they also involve the lexical encoding of antecedent gender (lui/elle ‘3p.sing.masc/fem’) or not (son ‘3p.sing.gen’) in a pronoun. We propose that NNSs adapt to processing a non-native language by directing more resources toward computing lexically encoded properties than toward inferences that go beyond lexical information. At the recursive clause edge, a population-wide asymmetry between conditions arose at 15–16Hz in induced power: Lexical selection and gender specification led to diminished power for Comp son vs. Mod le/la and for specified lui/elle vs. unspecified son in Comps. This was also found at 17–22Hz in induced power in NSs whereas asymmetries were reversed in NNSs, with computations of lexically encoded properties demanding greater power. At 41–44Hz in induced power, group differences emerged: More power was directed at gender-specified le/la and lui/elle in NNSs, but at unspecified son in NSs. These asymmetries suggest that non-native processing seems characterized by resources directed toward lexically encoded properties in computations.",Anaphora; Time-frequency; Parsing; Movement; EEG

We sought to determine if the MTL plays a role in single-word decoding in healthy, normal skilled readers. The experiment follows from the implications of the dual-process model of single-word decoding, which provides distinct predictions about the nature of MTL involvement. The paradigm utilized word (regular and irregularly spelled words) and pseudoword (phonetically regular) stimuli that differed in their demand for non-lexical as opposed lexical decoding. The data clearly showed that the MTL system was not involved in single word decoding in skilled, native English readers. Neither the hippocampus nor the MTL system as a whole showed significant activation during lexical or non-lexical based decoding. The results provide evidence that lexical and non-lexical decoding are implemented by distinct but overlapping neuroanatomical networks. Non-lexical decoding appeared most uniquely associated with cuneus and fusiform gyrus activation biased toward the left hemisphere. In contrast, lexical decoding appeared associated with right middle frontal and supramarginal, and bilateral cerebellar activation. Both these decoding operations appeared in the context of a shared widespread network of activations including bilateral occipital cortex and superior frontal regions. These activations suggest that the absence of MTL involvement in either lexical or non-lexical decoding appears likely a function of the skilled reading ability of our sample such that whole-word recognition and retrieval processes do not utilize the declarative memory system, in the case of lexical decoding, and require only minimal analysis and recombination of the phonetic elements of a word, in the case of non-lexical decoding.",Reading; Medial temporal lobe; Language; Non-lexical decoding; Lexical decoding

The agrammatic participants had better performance on argument than on adjunct questions, while no dissociation was observed between subject and object questions. The overall difficulty with wh-questions indicates that the agrammatic participants had a deficit in syntactic movement or in handling CP, a finding which is compatible with other cross-linguistic results. Although this finding could be accounted for by existing hypotheses, an alternative account is proposed, according to which wh-questions are difficult to process because they are associated with LF-interpretable features, which increase their processing load. Finally, the preponderance of argument over adjunct questions reinforces the (double) dissociation between these two question types reported in the literature, while the lack of a dissociation between the subject- and the object-questions suggests that both question types involve syntactic movement to CP.",Agrammatism; -questions; Greek; Adjunct; Argument; Movement

In particular, such disruptions have been repeatedly observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, it remains unclear whether these deficits are language-specific and whether they are equally dissociable from other reported disturbances –viz., processing of object semantics. To address these issues, we administered linguistic, semantic, and executive function (EFs) tasks to two groups of non-demented PD patients, with and without mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI and PD-nMCI, respectively). We compared these two groups with each other and with matched samples of healthy controls. Our results showed that PD patients exhibited linguistic and semantic deficits even in the absence of MCI. However, not all domains were equally related to EFs and MCI across samples. Whereas EFs predicted disturbances of syntax and object semantics in both PD-nMCI and PD-MCI, they had no impact on action-verb and action-semantic impairments in either group. Critically, patients showed disruptions of action-verb production and action semantics in the absence of MCI and without any executive influence, suggesting a sui generis deficit present since early stages of the disease.

However, there is limited prospective data about its functional validity. We compared changes in neuropsychological evaluation (NPE) performed before and 1-year after epilepsy surgery, between patients with/without resection of cortical sites showing HGM during a visual naming task. Methods Pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients underwent pre-surgical language localization with ESM and HGM using a visual naming task. Surgical decisions were based solely on ESM results. NPE difference scores were compared between patients with/without resection of HGM naming sites using principal component (PC) analysis. Follow-up NPE scores were modeled with resection group as main effect and respective pre-surgical score as a covariate, using analysis of covariance. Results Seventeen native English speakers (12 females), aged 6.5–20.2 years, were included. One year after epilepsy surgery, first PC score increased by (mean ± standard deviation) 14.4 ± 16.5 points in patients without resection, whereas it decreased by 7.6 ± 24.6 points in those with resection of HGM naming sites (p = 0.040). This PC score represented verbal comprehension, working memory, perceptual reasoning (Wechsler subscales); Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement; and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Subsequent analysis showed significant difference in working memory score between patients with/without resection of HGM naming sites (−15.2 points, 95% confidence limits −29.7 to −0.7, p = 0.041).

Behavioral reaction time (RT) and electrophysiological responsiveness to visually displayed words and non-language images were measured in persons who differed in how much experience they had in reading English. The electrophysiological response was the recognition potential (RP). Behavioral RT and the latency of the RP to English words were both expected to depend upon how much English reading experience a person had. The short latency of the RP was expected to free it from the influence of non-perceptual factors that affect RT, such as speed/accuracy tradeoff. This expectation yielded the prediction that the behavioral and electrophysiological results would differ in a specific way. Long-time readers of English were expected to show shorter RP latency to English words than less experienced (China-educated) readers of English but no RP latency difference for non-language images, with which neither group had greater experience. In contrast, due to speed accuracy tradeoff, the China-educated subjects were expected to show longer RT for both the words and the non-language images. The prediction was confirmed. The amount of language experience that a person had showed a stronger relationship to RP latency than it did to RT. This helped to validate the use of the RP as a tool for investigating perception and demonstrated definite advantages that it has for studying acquired perceptual processes in humans.",Recognition potential; Perception; Language; Reading; Gestalt; Word recognition

Impaired sentence repetition is a core feature of logopenic variant PPA, although the underlying cognitive mechanisms of this impairment and its significance as a diagnostic criterion remain poorly understood. Sentence repetition abilities of 12 people with dementia, using an adapted error classification schema, were analyzed, along with digit span abilities, a measure frequently used to assess working memory capacity, to explore error patterns and correlations. Participants with semantic variant PPA showed the greatest performance on sentence repetition and digit span in comparison to the logopenic variant PPA and Alzheimer’s disease participants. Sentence repetition errors were characterized by middle omissions for semantic variant PPA, ending omissions and phonological errors for logopenic variant PPA, and ending omissions and unrelated word substitutions for Alzheimer’s disease. Significant correlations were found between sentence repetition and digit span abilities.

Concurrently, a growing body of work suggests that vocabulary ability is crucially related to lexical processing skills in children. However, little is known about this relationship with predictive sentence processing in children or adults. We explore this question by comparing the degree to which an upcoming sentential theme is anticipated by combining information from a prior agent and action. 48 children, aged of 3 to 10, and 48 college-aged adults’ eye-movements were recorded as they heard a sentence (e.g., The pirate hides the treasure) in which the object referred to one of four images that included an agent-related, action-related and unrelated distractor image. Pictures were rotated so that, across all versions of the study, each picture appeared in all conditions, yielding a completely balanced within-subjects design. Adults and children quickly made use of combinatory information available at the action to generate anticipatory looks to the target object. Speed of anticipatory fixations did not vary with age. When controlling for age, individuals with higher vocabularies were faster to look to the target than those with lower vocabulary scores. Together, these results support and extend current views of incremental processing in which adults and children make use of linguistic information to continuously update their mental representation of ongoing language.",Sentence comprehension; Individual differences; Language development; Eye-tracking; Visual-world paradigm; Language processing

A different account is that children are less developed than adults at recognizing speech sounds and at recognizing talkers, and development involves protracted tuning of both recognition systems. The current research presented preschoolers and adults (N=180) with voices linked to two distinct cartoon characters. After exposure, participants heard each talker and selected which character was speaking. Consistent with the protracted tuning hypothesis, children were much less accurate than adults when talkers were matched on age, gender, and dialect (Experiments 1–3), even when prosody differed (Experiment 5). Children were highly accurate when voices differed in gender (Experiment 2) or age (mother vs. daughter; Experiment 6), suggesting that greater acoustic dissimilarity facilitated encoding. Implications for speech sound processing are discussed, as are the roles of language knowledge and the nature of talker perceptual space in talker encoding.",Talker variability; Perceptual learning; Auditory learning; Preschool; Language development; Voices

Aims In the present study, we examined the extent of delay in lexical and morphosyntactic spoken language levels of children with CIs as compared to those of a normative sample of age-matched children with normal hearing. Furthermore, the predictive value of auditory and verbal memory factors in the spoken language performance of implanted children was analyzed. Methods & procedures Thirty-nine profoundly deaf children with CIs were assessed using a test battery including measures of lexical, grammatical, auditory and verbal memory tests. Furthermore, child-related demographic characteristics were taken into account. Outcomes & results The majority of the children with CIs did not reach age-equivalent lexical and morphosyntactic language skills. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that lexical spoken language performance in children with CIs was best predicted by age at testing, phoneme perception, and auditory word closure. The morphosyntactic language outcomes of the CI group were best predicted by lexicon, auditory word closure, and auditory memory for words. Conclusions Qualitatively good speech perception skills appear to be crucial for lexical and grammatical development in children with CIs. Furthermore, strongly developed vocabulary skills and verbal memory abilities predict morphosyntactic language skills.",Cochlear implantation; Children; Lexicon; Morphosyntax; Auditory skills; Verbal memory skills

Gobes,2016,Mirrored patterns of lateralized neuronal activation reflect old and new memories in the avian auditory cortex,article,Neuroscience,ScienceDirect,"In monolingual humans, language-related brain activation shows a distinct lateralized pattern, in which the left hemisphere is often dominant. Studies are not as conclusive regarding the localization of the underlying neural substrate for language in sequential language learners. Lateralization of the neural substrate for first and second language depends on a number of factors including proficiency and early experience with each language. Similar to humans learning speech, songbirds learn their vocalizations from a conspecific tutor early in development. Here, we show mirrored patterns of lateralization in the avian analog of the mammalian auditory cortex (the caudomedial nidopallium [NCM]) in sequentially tutored zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata​) in response to their first tutor song, learned early in development, and their second tutor song, learned later in development. The greater the retention of song from their first tutor, the more right-dominant the birds were when exposed to that song; the more birds learned from their second tutor, the more left-dominant they were when exposed to that song. Thus, the avian auditory cortex may preserve lateralized neuronal traces of old and new tutor song memories, which are dependent on proficiency of song learning. There is striking resemblance in humans: early-formed language representations are maintained in the brain even if exposure to that language is discontinued. The switching of hemispheric dominance related to the acquisition of early auditory memories and subsequent encoding of more recent memories may be an evolutionary adaptation in vocal learners necessary for the behavioral flexibility to acquire novel vocalizations, such as a second language.",songbird; birdsong; speech; memory; sensorimotor;

There is limited, yet inconsistent data regarding DE and its associations with cognition, particularly in the early illness course. This study aimed to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships of DE with cognitive functions in first-episode schizophrenia utilizing a prospective design. Method Ninety-three Hong Kong Chinese aged 18 to 55years presenting with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder were studied. Severity of DE was measured as sum of individual item scores indicative of affect flattening and alogia. Symptom evaluation was conducted at intake, after clinical stabilization of first psychotic episode, at 12, 24 and 36months. Cognitive functions were evaluated at clinical stabilization, 12, 24 and 36months. Results DE was significantly correlated with various cognitive functions in successive follow-up assessments. Regression analyses adjusting confounding effects of sex, pre-morbid adjustment, duration of untreated psychosis and chlorpromazine equivalents showed that DE was associated with performance on verbal fluency at 12 (p<0.01) and 24months (p<0.05), visual reproduction at 24 (p<0.05) and 36months (p<0.01), logical memory at 36months (p<0.05) and Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting test at 24 (p<0.05) and 36months (p<0.05). Neither cross-lagged associations between DE and cognition nor significant correlations between changes in these two domains over three years were observed. Conclusions DE and cognitive functions were correlated concurrently but no longitudinal associations between these two domains could be demonstrated. Our findings indicated that DE and cognitive impairment represented relatively independent domains of the illness with potentially distinctive therapeutic implications.",Diminished expression; Negative symptoms; Cognitive impairment; First-episode schizophrenia; Longitudinal follow-up

Salkovskis (1996) proposed one such mechanism in terms of the shift towards an alternative, less negative view of their problems or cognitive flexibility. This hypothesis has been described as involving a shift in beliefs, from “theory A″ to “theory B”. The objective of this research was to evaluate this hypothesis. Methods Effectiveness of a novel txCBT and temporal changes in process and symptom measures were evaluated using a non-concurrent multiple baseline design and Tau-U calculations with thirteen participants (five with obsessive-compulsive disorder, two with panic disorder with agoraphobia and six with major depressive disorder). As a secondary analysis authors calculated Kendall's – Tau correlation between process and symptom measures, performed the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess treatment modules effect on negative thought and calculated Reliable change index (RCI). Results The txCBT was clearly effective for eight participants. The results varied dependent on the stimuli evaluated as negative or threatening. Level and trend of the ratings of belief in theory A followed the level and trend of symptom measures to a greater extent than the (inverse) level and trend of belief in theory B. Limitations Only thirteen participants were recruited and evaluated. Conclusions The results are consistent with the view that effective treatment may involve a txMOC characterized by the ability to shift from a relatively fixed negative view of their experience to a less negative psychologically focused alternative.",Mechanism of change; Transdiagnostic cognitive behavior therapy; Single case experimental design; Anxiety; Depression

Gold,2013,Combined ERP/fMRI evidence for early word recognition effects in the posterior inferior temporal gyrus,article,Cortex,ScienceDirect,"Two brain regions with established roles in reading are the posterior middle temporal gyrus and the posterior fusiform gyrus (FG). Lesion studies have also suggested that the region located between them, the posterior inferior temporal gyrus (pITG), plays a central role in word recognition. However, these lesion results could reflect disconnection effects since neuroimaging studies have not reported consistent lexicality effects in pITG. Here we tested whether these reported pITG lesion effects are due to disconnection effects or not using parallel Event-related Potentials (ERP)/functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. We predicted that the Recognition Potential (RP), a left-lateralized ERP negativity that peaks at about 200–250 msec, might be the electrophysiological correlate of pITG activity and that conditions that evoke the RP (perceptual degradation) might therefore also evoke pITG activity. In Experiment 1, twenty-three participants performed a lexical decision task (temporally flanked by supraliminal masks) while having high-density 129-channel ERP data collected. In Experiment 2, a separate group of fifteen participants underwent the same task while having fMRI data collected in a 3T scanner. Examination of the ERP data suggested that a canonical RP effect was produced. The strongest corresponding effect in the fMRI data was in the vicinity of the pITG. In addition, results indicated stimulus-dependent functional connectivity between pITG and a region of the posterior FG near the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) during word compared to nonword processing. These results provide convergent spatiotemporal evidence that the pITG contributes to early lexical access through interaction with the VWFA.",ERP; fMRI; Language; Lexical decision; Recognition Potential

Yet, corresponding data on the visualization of language-related subcortical pathways is lacking. Therefore, this study evaluates the feasibility of nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) for subcortical language pathways by a fractional anisotropy (FA) protocol. New method DTI FT was performed in 37 patients suffering from left-sided perisylvian brain lesions based on nTMS data exclusively, using the FA-based protocol originally established for the corticospinal tract (CST) by Frey et al. (2012): minimum fiber length was 110mm and the highest individual FA value leading to visualization of white matter tracts was determined as the FA threshold (FAT). Then, deterministic DTI FT using an FA value of 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of the individual FAT (with 25% as an additional setting to the original protocol) was performed. Results Our approach visualized 9 language-related subcortical white matter pathways. By using 100% FAT, the mean percentage of visualized tracts was 13.5%, whereas DTI FT performed with 75%, 50%, and 25% FAT detected 30.6%, 61.3%, and 93.7% of language-related fiber tracts, respectively. Comparison with existing methods nTMS language mapping alone is not able to visualize subcortical language-related pathways. Conclusions This study shows that nTMS language maps are feasible for DTI FT of language-related pathways within the scope of a FAT-based protocol. Although this approach is novel and might be helpful during scientific neuroimaging and tumor resection, intraoperative validation is needed to go beyond the level of feasibility.",Cortical mapping; Diffusion tensor imaging; Fiber tracking; Language; Transcranial magnetic stimulation

The application uses official school data and a self-collected questionnaire on recent innovations in schools. In the nonparametric model, it is assumed that schools aim to maximize educational attainments of students under a budget constraint. The results suggest that innovations are positively related to efficiency. We find that profiling, pedagogic, process and education chain innovations are significantly related to school efficiency, whereas innovations in the professionalization of teachers are insignificantly related to school efficiency. Furthermore, the number of locations per school and the number of schools per governing body are negatively and significantly related to school efficiency. School type and region significantly influence school efficiency, whereas share of disadvantaged students, degree of urbanization and student/teacher ratio do not have significant influence.",Education; Conditional efficiency; Innovations; Nonparametric estimation

The rates are high in ethnic minority groups. The causes are not known in British Pakistani women. The aim of this study was to estimate the rates, correlates and maintaining factors of perinatal depression in a Pakistani sample in UK. The design used was a cross-sectional two phase population based survey with a prospective cohort study. Methods All women in 3rd trimester attending antenatal clinic were screened with the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS). Women scoring 12 or more on EPDS and a random sample of low scorers were interviewed using the Schedules for Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) and the Life Events and Difficulties schedule (LEDS). Social support was assessed with the Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). They were reassessed 6months after the delivery using the same measures. Results The weighted prevalence of depression was 16.8%. Depressed mothers had more marked non health difficulties (housing, financial and marital). They had less social support and were socially isolated. Marked social isolation and marked non-health related difficulties were independent predictors of depression. Analyses of all the possible risk factors, comparing 26 persistent depressed with 27 depression resolved group showed significant differences in the MSPSS subscales between the two groups. Limitations The study lacked inter-rater reliability testing between the individuals carrying out diagnostic interviews. The study sample did not accurately represent the general population and information about the origins of depression in this group of mothers was limited. Conclusion Depression in British Pakistani mothers is associated with social isolation, poor social support and severe and persistent social difficulties.

The main dependent variables were the number of practice trials, response accuracy, response latency for accurate responses, and the number of extra taps (i.e., tapping more than two times). Results The CWS were less accurate and slower on the PTT than the CWNS, with no differences in the number of practice trials. Furthermore, the CWS, especially boys, produced more extra taps than the CWNS. Conclusions Findings revealed that preschool CWS have weaknesses in complex response inhibition and stopping impulsivity in the nonverbal domain compared to CWNS.

The goal of this review is to challenge this view, that is, to move to a hodotopical approach to lesion mapping, on the basis of new insights provided by intraoperative electrostimulation mapping investigations in patients who underwent awake surgery for cerebral tumors. These original data reported in the last decade break with the traditional dogma of a modular and fixed organization of the central nervous system, by switching to the concepts of cerebral connectivity and plasticity – i.e., a brain organization based on dynamic interrelationships between parallel distributed networks. According to this revisited model, “frontal symptoms” can be generated by tumor or electrostimulation not only of the frontal lobes, but also of cortical and subcortical (white matter pathways/deep gray nuclei) structures outside the frontal lobes: especially, stimulation of the superior longitudinal fascicle may elicit speech production disorders, syntactic disturbances, involuntary language switching or phonemic paraphasia (arcuate fascicle), stimulation of the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle can generate semantic paraphasia or deficit of cross-modal judgment, stimulation of the subcallosal fasciculus may elicit transcortical motor aphasia, while stimulation of the striatum induces preservations. On the other hand, it is also possible to perform extensive right or left frontal lobectomy in patients who continue to have a normal familial, social and professional life, without “frontal syndrome”. Therefore, this provocative approach may open the door to a renewal in the modeling of brain processing as well as in its clinical applications, especially in the fields of cerebral surgery and functional rehabilitation. These findings illustrate well the need to reinforce links between cognitive neuroscience and clinical neurology/neurosurgery.",Frontal syndrome; Electrostimulation brain mapping; Brain plasticity; Awake surgery; Hodotopy

This study provides empirical evidence of a serial multiple mediator model supporting the relationship between English L2 students’ morphological awareness, vocabulary knowledge, reading proficiency and academic achievement. Comparisons were made at two levels: general English and academic English. Data were acquired from 454 second- and third-year English L2 university students in Ghana, West Africa. Using two different mediation analyses, the study produced significant evidence for a two-mediator model at both levels. Morphological awareness is modelled as affecting academic achievement through four different pathways: indirectly through vocabulary, indirectly through reading comprehension, indirectly through vocabulary and reading comprehension sequentially, and directly. This shows that knowledge of morphology both directly and indirectly influences academic achievement at tertiary level in English L2 contexts.",Morphological awareness; Vocabulary; Reading comprehension; English L2; Serial mediation analysis; Literacy development

Since the 1980s, that assumption has been buttressed by numerous studies that detected declines in false memory between early childhood and young adulthood under controlled conditions. Fuzzy-trace theory predicted reversals of this standard developmental pattern in circumstances that are directly relevant to testimony because they involve using the gist of experience to remember events. That prediction has been investigated during the past decade, and a large number of experiments have been published in which false memories have indeed been found to increase between early childhood and young adulthood. Further, experimentation has tied age increases in false memory to improvements in children’s memory for semantic gist. According to current scientific evidence, the principle that children’s testimony is necessarily more infected with false memories than adults’ and that, other things being equal, juries should regard adults’ testimony as necessarily more faithful to actual events is untenable.",Children’s testimony; False memory; Fuzzy-trace theory; Developmental reversals

This is a pertinent problem for educational scholars, teacher educators, and teachers, because struggles concerning smartness foster social inequity. While much research accentuates the inequity that occurs when those students who do not fit the “smart” category are marginalized, the inequities that emerge when teachers prefer the smart student have not received much scholarly attention. Drawing on linguistic ethnographic fieldwork in a primary school in Copenhagen, Denmark, this paper explores how one student, over the course of two years and two months, comes to inhabit the “smart” role, and must then cope with being favoured by the teachers and ostracised by peers. Dual pressures such as these have implications for education and research.",Classroom discourse; Social inequity; Student identities; Smartness; Linguistic ethnography; Social identification

We expected recovery orientation and insight to be positively, and self-stigma to be negatively associated with a good therapeutic alliance. We expected these associations to be independent from age, clinical symptoms (i.e. positive and negative symptoms, depression), and more general aspects of relationship building like avoidant attachment style and the duration of treatment by the current therapist. The study included 156 participants with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in the maintenance phase of treatment. Therapeutic alliance, recovery orientation, self-stigma, insight, adult attachment style, and depression were assessed by self-report. Symptoms were rated by interviewers. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that more recovery orientation, less self-stigma, and more insight independently were associated with a better quality of the therapeutic alliance. Clinical symptoms, adult attachment style, age, and the duration of treatment by current therapist were unrelated to the quality of the therapeutic alliance. Low recovery orientation and increased self-stigma might undermine the therapeutic alliance in schizophrenia beyond the detrimental effect of poor insight. Therefore in clinical settings, besides enhancing insight, recovery orientation, and self-stigma should be addressed.",Therapeutic relationship; Goal orientation; Service engagement

The present study explored the types and sociodemographic correlates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among PWE in Oman among attendees of a neurological unit at a tertiary care center. Data on the types of CAM were gathered from telephone interviews. The relevant demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants were obtained from electronic medical records. Of the total of 101 participants, 73.3% were CAM users. The majority of these participants have not disclosed their CAM use to their allopathic health-care providers. The most common types of CAM reported were those falling under the ‘mind–body’ type (incantations and fumigation) and biologically based (herbal concoctions) or a combination of them. Compared to non-CAM users, a significant and greater proportion of CAM users attributed the etiology of their illness to nonbiomedical factors such as ‘evil eyes’ (P=0.04). The multivariate logistic regression model indicated that the use of CAM was highly associated with age of <30years (OR=3.09; 95% CI: 1.10, 5.46), unemployment (OR=2.04; 95% CI: 1.15, 6.39), having basic school education (OR=2.21; 95% CI: 0.83, 5.18), low family income (OR=1.52; 95% CI: 0.91, 2.11), and the presence of hypersalivation (OR=2.20; 95% CI: 1.01, 4.39). Further studies are needed to harmonize these two healing practices. On the whole, this study indicates that among attendees of tertiary care utilization, CAM is common among PWE in Oman.

This study investigated neurodevelopmental mechanisms linking language input to development by measuring neuroplasticity associated with an intervention designed to enhance language environments of families primarily from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Families of 52 4-to-6 year-old children were randomly assigned to a 9-week, interactive, family-based intervention or no-contact control group. Children completed pre- and post-assessments of verbal and nonverbal cognition (n = 52), structural magnetic resonance imaging (n = 45), and home auditory recordings of language exposure (n = 39). Families who completed the intervention exhibited greater increases in adult-child conversational turns, and changes in turn-taking mediated intervention effects on language and executive functioning measures. Collapsing across groups, turn-taking changes were also positively correlated with cortical thickening in left inferior frontal and supramarginal gyri, the latter of which mediated relationships between changes in turn-taking and children’s language development. This is the first study of longitudinal neuroplasticity in response to changes in children’s language environments, and findings suggest that conversational turns support language development through cortical growth in language and social processing regions. This has implications for early interventions to enhance children’s language environments to support neurocognitive development.",Neuroplasticity; Conversational turns; Socioeconomic status; Family-Based intervention; Language development; LENA

The speech and language evaluation revealed apparently dysfluent speech. Unlike the people with neurogenic stuttering, our subject revealed clinical features suggestive of developmental stuttering. Combining our observations with the evidences from the previous neuroimaging studies of developmental stuttering as well as clinical studies of both neurogenic and (post-stroke) reappeared stuttering, we support the hypothesis on the compensatory role of the right frontal lobe in developmental stuttering.

Despite early referral to kidney care, initiation onto dialysis is still suboptimal for many patients, which has clinical and cost implications. This study aimed to explore perspectives of various stakeholders on barriers to timely access creation. Study Design Qualitative study. Setting & Participants Semi-structured interviews with 96 participants (response rate, 67%), including patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (n = 30), new hemodialysis patients with (n = 18) and without (n = 20) permanent access (arteriovenous fistula), family members (n = 19), and kidney health care providers (n = 9). Analytical Approach Thematic analysis. Results Patients reported differential levels of behavioral activation toward access creation: avoidance/denial, wait and see, or active intention. 6 core themes were identified: (1) lack of symptoms, (2) dialysis fears and practical concerns (exaggerated fear, pain, cost, lifestyle disruptions, work-related concerns, burdening their families), (3) evaluating value against costs/risks of access creation (benefits, threat of operation, viability, prompt for early initiation), (4) preference for alternatives, (5) social influences (hearsay, family involvement, experiences of others), and (6) health care provider interactions (mistrust, interpersonal tension, lack of clarity in information). Themes were common to all groups, whereas nuanced perspectives of family members and health care providers were noted in some subthemes. Limitations Response bias. Conclusions Individual, interpersonal, and psychosocial factors compromise dialysis preparation and contribute to suboptimal dialysis initiation. Our findings support the need for interventions to improve patient and family engagement and address emotional concerns and misperceptions about preparing for dialysis.",Fistula; access creation; decision making; qualitative study; delay; chronic kidney disease; renal failure; renal replacement therapy

The increasing importance of the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding (AARR), with regards to rules, has come to be of particular interest within Relational Frame Theory (RFT). One feature of AARR that previous research has suggested may differentially impact persistent rule-following is level of derivation. However, no published research to date has systematically explored this suggestion. Across two experiments, the impact of levels of derivation was examined on persistent rule-following at two stages of relational development: mutual entailment (Exp. 1) and combinatorial entailment (Exp. 2). A Training IRAP was used to establish a mutually entailed relational network in Experiment 1 and a combinatorially entailed network in Experiment 2, and to train these networks to different levels of derivation. This was followed by a contingency switching Match-to-Sample (MTS) task to assess rule persistence. Results from both experiments were generally consistent with the suggestion that lower levels of derivation produce more persistent rule-following. Unexpectedly, however, the findings from Experiment 1 also indicated that persistence was moderated by the type of novel word employed. Variations in results across both experiments and their implications for future research are discussed.",Levels of derivation; Relational Frame Theory; Rules; Persistent rule-following

It was hypothesized that healthier family dynamics would be associated with better caregiver mental health. Design A cross-sectional study of self-reported data collected from TBI caregivers through the Mexican National Institute of Rehabilitation in Mexico City, Mexico, the premier public medical facility in Mexico that provides rehabilitation services to patients with various disabilities. Setting One public outpatient medical and rehabilitation facility. Participants Sixty-eight caregivers of individuals with moderate-to-severe TBI from Mexico City, Mexico, were related to an individual with TBI who was ≥3 months after injury, a primary caregiver for ≥3 months, familiar with the patient's history, and without neurologic or psychiatric conditions. The average (standard deviation) age of caregivers was 50.94 ± 12.85 years), and 82% were women. Methods The caregivers completed Spanish versions of instruments that assessed their own mental health and family dynamics. Main Outcome Measurements Outcomes assessed included family dynamics (Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale—Fourth Edition; Family Communication Scale; Family Satisfaction Scale; Family Assessment Device—General Functioning; and Relationship-Focused Coping Scale), and caregiver mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Zarit Burden Interview, and Satisfaction with Life Scale). Results Results of canonical correlation analyses suggested that caregiver mental health and family dynamics were positively related, with a large effect size. Caregivers with high family satisfaction and cohesion tended to have a low burden and high satisfaction with life. In addition, caregiver depression and burden were positively related to each other and were both inversely related to caregiver satisfaction with life. Conclusions TBI caregiver interventions in Latino populations would likely benefit from including programming or techniques to improve family dynamics, especially family cohesion, given the strong potentially reciprocal influence of these dynamics on caregiver mental health.",

Although a positive impact of DES on postoperative linguistic outcome is generally advocated, the literature is only scantily documented with information about the linguistic methods applied in awake surgery. This article critically reviews the neurolinguistic procedures currently used in awake studies. Methods Based on an extensive review of the literature, an overview is given of the language mapping techniques applied in brain tumour surgery. Studies investigating linguistic testing and outcome in awake surgery were analysed. Information about the timing of the assessment(s), the linguistic tasks, the linguistic stimuli and the indication for awake surgery was also discussed. Results Intraoperative DES remains the ‘gold standard’ for language mapping, but pre- and postoperative non-invasive mapping methods are important adjuncts. In the pre- and postoperative phase, standardised linguistic test batteries are generally used to assess language function. In the intraoperative phase, only naming and number counting are commonly applied. Most often no detailed information about the linguistic stimuli is provided and no standardised protocols measuring different linguistic levels have been described. Conclusions Awake surgery with DES is a useful tool for preserving linguistic functions in patients undergoing surgery in critical brain regions. However, no studies exist that apply a well-balanced and standardised linguistic protocol to reliably identify the critical language zones. The availability of a standardised linguistic protocol might substantially increase intraoperative comfort and might improve outcome and quality of life.",Awake craniotomy; Direct electrical stimulation; Language mapping; Language testing; Review

Apfelbaum and Jamie Klein-Packard and Bob McMurray,2021,The pictures who shall not be named: Empirical support for benefits of preview in the Visual World Paradigm,article,Journal of Memory and Language,ScienceDirect,"A common critique of the Visual World Paradigm (VWP) in psycholinguistic studies is that what is designed as a measure of language processes is meaningfully altered by the visual context of the task. This is crucial, particularly in studies of spoken word recognition, where the displayed images are usually seen as just a part of the measure and are not of fundamental interest. Many variants of the VWP allow participants to sample the visual scene before a trial begins. However, this could bias their interpretations of the later speech or even lead to abnormal processing strategies (e.g., comparing the input to only preactivated working memory representations). Prior work has focused only on whether preview duration changes fixation patterns. However, preview could affect a number of processes, such as visual search, that would not challenge the interpretation of the VWP. The present study uses a series of targeted manipulations of the preview period to ask if preview alters looking behavior during a trial, and why. Results show that evidence of incremental processing and phonological competition seen in the VWP are not dependent on preview, and are not enhanced by manipulations that directly encourage phonological prenaming. Moreover, some forms of preview can eliminate nuisance variance deriving from object recognition and visual search demands in order to produce a more sensitive measure of linguistic processing. These results deepen our understanding of how the visual scene interacts with language processing to drive fixations patterns in the VWP, and reinforce the value of the VWP as a tool for measuring real-time language processing.

Lynn (2010),article,Intelligence,ScienceDirect,"Working with data from the PISA study (OECD, 2007), Lynn (2010) has argued that individuals from South Italy average an IQ approximately 10 points lower than individuals from North Italy, and has gone on to put forward a series of conclusions on the relationship between average IQ, latitude, average stature, income, etc. The present paper criticizes these conclusions and the robustness of the data from which Lynn (2010) derived the IQ scores. In particular, on the basis of recent Italian studies and our databank, we observe that : 1) school measures should be used for deriving IQ indices only in cases where contextual variables are not crucial: there is evidence that partialling out the role of contextual variables may lead to reduction or even elimination of PISA differences; in particular, schooling effects are shown through different sets of data obtained for younger grades; 2) in the case of South Italy, the PISA data may have exaggerated the differences, since data obtained with tasks similar to the PISA tasks (MT-advanced) show smaller differences; 3) national official data, obtained by INVALSI (2009a) on large numbers of primary school children, support these conclusions, suggesting that schooling may have a critical role; 4) purer measures of IQ obtained during the standardisation of Raven's Progressive Coloured Matrices also show no significant differences in IQ between children from South and North Italy.",IQ; Italy; Regional differences; PISA

Consistent with the critical period hypothesis, group differences revealed that while native speakers elicited a biphasic N400-P600 in response to ungrammatical sentences, L2 learners as a group only elicited an N400.

In this work, we investigate text-mining technology to analyze and predict the depression tendency of web posts. Methods In this paper, we defined depression factors, which include negative events, negative emotions, symptoms, and negative thoughts from web posts. We proposed an enhanced event extraction (E3) method to automatically extract negative event terms. In addition, we also proposed an event-driven depression tendency warning (EDDTW) model to predict the depression tendency of web bloggers or post authors by analyzing their posted articles. Results We compare the performance among the proposed EDDTW model, negative emotion evaluation (NEE) model, and the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-based depression tendency evaluation method. The EDDTW model obtains the best recall rate and F-measure at 0.668 and 0.624, respectively, while the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-based method achieves the best precision rate of 0.666. The main reason is that our enhanced event extraction method can increase recall rate by enlarging the negative event lexicon at the expense of precision. Our EDDTW model can also be used to track the change or trend of depression tendency for each post author. The depression tendency trend can help doctors to diagnose and even track depression of web post authors more efficiently.

Video/EEG and brain imaging results confirmed localization. Logistic regression models revealed that perceived emotional distress moderated language performance. Performance of patients with left MTLE and that of patients with FLE were equally poor across language measures. Performance of patients with right MTLE was intact. Depression and anxiety differentially moderated performance. Anxiety was associated with better performance in patients with FLE on classically temporal lobe-mediated tasks (Boston Naming Test). Depression was associated with worse language performance on measures for which impaired performance was traditionally intrinsic to the underlying epileptogenic lesion (word fluency in FLE). Emotional distress influences language performance.

A review and meta-analysis of reading rate,article,Journal of Memory and Language,ScienceDirect,"Based on the analysis of 190 studies (18,573 participants), we estimate that the average silent reading rate for adults in English is 238 words per minute (wpm) for non-fiction and 260 wpm for fiction. The difference can be predicted by taking into account the length of the words, with longer words in non-fiction than in fiction. The estimates are lower than the numbers often cited in scientific and popular writings. The reasons for the overestimates are reviewed. The average oral reading rate (based on 77 studies and 5965 participants) is 183 wpm. Reading rates are lower for children, old adults, and readers with English as second language. The reading rates are in line with maximum listening speed and do not require the assumption of reading-specific language processing. Within each group/task there are reliable individual differences, which are not yet fully understood. For silent reading of English non-fiction most adults fall in the range of 175–300 wpm; for fiction the range is 200–320 wpm. Reading rates in other languages can be predicted reasonably well by taking into account the number of words these languages require to convey the same message as in English.",Reading rate; Reading speed; Silent reading; Oral reading; Language differences; Words per minute

Nevertheless, it cannot be completely ruled out that the BG may be involved in language in some domain-specific manner. The present study aimed to investigate one type of cognitive control—sequencing, a function that has long been connected with the BG—and to test whether the BG could be specifically implicated in language. Participants were required to rearrange materials sequentially based on linguistic (syntactic or conceptual) or non-linguistic (order switching) rules, or to repeat a previously ordered sequence as a control task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed a strongly active left-lateralized corticostriatal network, encompassing the anterior striatum, dorsolaterial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and presupplementary motor area, while the participants were sequencing materials using linguistic vs. non-linguistic rules. This functional network has an anatomical basis and is strikingly similar to the well-known associative loop implicated in sensorimotor sequence learning. We concluded that the anterior striatum has extended its original sequencing role and worked in concert with frontal cortical regions to subserve the function of linguistic sequencing in a domain-specific manner.",Sequencing; Subcortical language function; Basal ganglia; Striatum; Corticostriatal network; fMRI

This paper attempts to answer the controversy whether surgery affects increase and decrease of linguistic impairment or not. Materials and methods Two hundred forty-one TBI patients aged 18–65 with abnormal CT findings and at least 20 minute post-trauma amnesia (PTA), who were conscious at discharge, participated in this study. Based on operative intervention, the samples were divided into two groups: operative and nonoperative. Cognitive and aphasic deficits were inspected formally and pragmatic disorder was informally appraised at discharge. Results The groups had no significant differences in aphasia incidence and language pragmatic impairment, though they were significantly distinctive in aphasia subcategories and cognitive deficit after trauma. Fluent aphasia was more common in both groups alike. In aphasia subcategories, however, transcortical sensory aphasia (TSA) in operative and anomia in nonoperative group were the most prevalent. Several variables appeared strikingly related to higher aphasia in operative groups as follows: moderate to severe injury, 18–35 and over 50years of age, more than 1week PTA, intracranial surgery of multiple lesions in left or bilateral hemisphere fronto-temporal cortex plus post-trauma cognitive and pragmatic impairments, and diffuse axonal injuries. Discussion Almost certainly, meaningful drop of cognitive function post surgery roots back in significant loss of initial consciousness level. Related factors to postoperative aphasia suggest taking policies through surgery intervention. Discerning the indispensable contributions of neurosurgeons, neurolinguists, and neuroscientists, results inspire more clinical future studies.",Aphasia; Pragmatic disorder; Cognitive deficit; Traumatic brain injury

Previous research has mostly focused on chronic patients and few studies were conducted to investigate predictors of work outcome in first-episode populations. The impact of cognitive dysfunction on employment outcome in early psychosis was under‐studied. In this study, we prospectively followed up 93 patients aged 18–55 years presented with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder for 3 years with an aim to identify early clinical and cognitive predictors of vocational outcome. Pre-morbid adjustment, baseline symptomatology and cognitive functions, and employment outcome were assessed. Result indicated that approximately half of the patients (53.8%) were engaged in full-time work at intake and at 3 years. Pre-morbid adjustment, baseline occupational status and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) performance were found to predict vocational outcome. Analysis on a subgroup of patients who were unemployed at intake showed that subjects who remained unemployed over 3 years had poorer WCST performance and more severe positive symptoms at baseline than those having job attainment during follow-up. Our results thus confirmed predictive value of pre-morbid functioning and baseline occupational status on vocational outcome.

This study investigated the association between drawing and language in preschoolers, and examined the role of working memory and executive functions (inhibition, shifting, and updating) in the association between drawing and language. The participants were 125 preschoolers (aged 3;0–6;1). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses found that two factors, respectively loading language and drawing measures, were correlated, also controlling for age. Regression analyses indicated that working memory and inhibition tasks predicted language, and inhibition tasks predicted drawing, above and beyond age. Structural equation modeling supported a model, according to which indirect influence of working memory and direct influence of executive functions fully accounted for the correlation between drawing and language. This suggests that the intertwining of language and drawing development in preschoolers depends on the development of domain-general components of the cognitive system.",Drawing; Language; Working memory; Executive function; Inhibition; Preschoolers

Recent neurophysiological research on word form acquisition in adults indicates that novel words can be acquired within minutes of repetitive exposure to them, regardless of the individual's focused attention on the speech input. Although it is well-known that children surpass adults in language acquisition, the developmental aspects of such rapid and automatic neural acquisition mechanisms remain unexplored. To address this open question, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to scrutinise brain dynamics elicited by spoken words and word-like sounds in healthy monolingual (Danish) children throughout a 20-min repetitive passive exposure session. We found rapid neural dynamics manifested as an enhancement of early (~100ms) brain activity over the short exposure session, with distinct spatiotemporal patterns for different novel sounds. For novel Danish word forms, signs of such enhancement were seen in the left temporal regions only, suggesting reliance on pre-existing language circuits for acquisition of novel word forms with native phonology. In contrast, exposure both to novel word forms with non-native phonology and to novel non-speech sounds led to activity enhancement in both left and right hemispheres, suggesting that more wide-spread cortical networks contribute to the build-up of memory traces for non-native and non-speech sounds. Similar studies in adults have previously reported more sluggish (~15–25min, as opposed to 4min in the present study) or non-existent neural dynamics for non-native sound acquisition, which might be indicative of a higher degree of plasticity in the children's brain. Overall, the results indicate a rapid and highly plastic mechanism for a dynamic build-up of memory traces for novel acoustic information in the children's brain that operates automatically and recruits bilateral temporal cortical circuits.",MEG; Children; Language; Learning; Development; ERF

Mack and Elena Barbieri and Sandra Weintraub and M.-Marsel Mesulam and Cynthia K.

We aimed to quantify the strength of the relationship between grammatical measures across tasks, and identify factors that condition it. Three grammatical domains were investigated: overall sentence production, verb morphology, and verb-argument structure. Methods 77 participants with PPA (34 PPA-G, 16 PPA-L, 15 PPA-S and 12 other) completed a battery of grammatical tests and a narrative language sample was obtained. Accuracy scores were computed for the language tests and the narrative samples were analyzed for both accuracy of selected narrative variables as well as grammatical diversity across the three grammatical domains. Principal components analysis (PCA) and multiple regression were used to examine cross-task relationships for all measures. Results As expected on the basis of classification criteria, accuracy scores were lower for the PPA-G group as compared to the PPA-L and PPA-S participants for overall sentence production and verb morphology, but not argument structure. Grammatical accuracy in narratives strongly predicted overall language test performance in PPA-G, whereas grammatical diversity in narratives did so in PPA-L, and no significant correspondence between narrative and language test performance was found for PPA-S. For individuals with severe grammatical impairments only, error distribution for both morphology and argument structure was strongly associated in structured tasks and narratives. Conclusions Grammatical production in narrative language predicts accuracy elicited with structured language tests in PPA. However, unique narrative production patterns distinguish PPA by subtype: accuracy for PPA-G, and grammatical diversity for PPA-L. The impairment in PPA-G is likely to reflect a core impairment in grammar whereas that of PPA-L may be closely tied to the word retrieval and verbal working memory deficits that characterize this variant. This underscores the theoretical distinction between PPA-L and PPA-G, as well as the importance of including grammatical diversity measures in analyses of language production, especially for patients who do not display frank agrammatism. Further, the results suggest that measures of domain-specific language deficits (i.e., verb morphology vs. argument structure) are robust across tasks only in individuals with severe grammatical impairments.",Primary progressive aphasia; Syntax; Narrative; Language production

Studies were eligible for inclusion if the psychometric properties of pain measures were examined in Chinese children (aged 0–18 years).

However, it is not clear whether native language experience shapes the neural mechanisms of addressed and assembled phonologies. To address this question, we trained native Chinese and native English speakers to read the same artificial language (based on Korean Hangul) either through addressed (i.e., whole-word mapping) or assembled (i.e., grapheme-to-phoneme mapping) phonology. We found that, for both native Chinese and native English speakers, addressed phonology relied on the regions in the ventral pathway, whereas assembled phonology depended on the regions in the dorsal pathway. More importantly, we found that the neural mechanisms of addressed and assembled phonologies were shaped by native language experience. Specifically, one key region for addressed phonology (i.e., the left middle temporal gyrus) showed greater activation for addressed phonology in native Chinese speakers, while one key region for assembled phonology (i.e., the left supramarginal gyrus) showed more activation for assembled phonology in native English speakers.

Through a multi-step approach, the present study addresses the question of how web practitioners form their intention to consider Web Accessibility in the development process. Based on a systematic literature review, twelve main salient beliefs influencing the intention to consider Web Accessibility were identified. Applying the Theory of Planned Behavior, a theoretical model integrating these main salient beliefs was compiled and a questionnaire to test the model developed. A total of 342 web practitioners in various professional roles answered the questionnaire in an online study. Path analysis revealed that intention to consider Web Accessibility is stronger when users actively promote their needs, when web practitioners see Web Accessibility as part of their professional role, and when the consideration of Web Accessibility is perceived as beneficial for the quality of a product. Hence, it is recommended to involve users with a variety of abilities in the development process, to emphasize the responsibility and specialist role of web practitioners, and to actively promote Web Accessibility as a quality feature of a product.",Web accessibility; Web practitioners; Theory of planned behavior

Studies of MeHg exposure and negative health outcomes have shown conflicting results and it has been suggested that co-exposure to other contaminants and/or nutrients in fish may confound the effect of MeHg. Our objective was to examine the association between prenatal exposure to MeHg and language and communication development at three years, adjusting for intake of fish, n−3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n−3 LCPUFAs) and co-exposure to dioxins and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs). We used data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) collected between 2002 and 2008. The study sample consisted of 46,750 mother-child pairs. MeHg exposure was calculated from reported fish intake during pregnancy by a FFQ in mid-pregnancy. Children's language and communication skills were measured by maternal report on the Dale and Bishop grammar rating and the Ages and Stages communication scale (ASQ). We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regressions. Median MeHg exposure was 1.3μg/day, corresponding to 0.14μg/kgbw/week. An exposure level above the 90th percentile (>2.6μg/day, >0.29μg/kgbw/week) was defined as the high MeHg exposure. Results indicated an association between high MeHg exposure and unintelligible speech with an adjusted OR 2.22 (1.31, 3.72). High MeHg exposure was also associated with weaker communication skills adjusted OR 1.33 (1.03, 1.70). Additional adjustment for fish intake strengthened the associations, while adjusting for PCBs and n−3 LCPUFA from diet or from supplements had minor impact. In conclusion, significant associations were found between prenatal MeHg exposure above the 90th percentile and delayed language and communication skills in a generally low exposed population.",Methylmercury; Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study; Language development; Fish intake; Diet; Neurodevelopment; Prenatal exposure

Pronouns have an important place in daily communication which speakers and listeners rely heavily on for. Aphasia literature has evidenced that pronoun processing is impaired in people with aphasia (PWA), although explanations underpinning pronoun impairments are mixed. To address this, through a systematic literature review, we identified 42 studies which examined pronoun processing (both production and comprehension) in 474 PWA across 16 different languages. An initial meta-analysis was conducted on the overall data with all PWA and pronoun conditions with an outcome measure indicating whether or not pronoun processing is individually impaired in PWA. Further meta-analytic models were built to compare certain conditions of particular interest (e.g. reflexives vs object pronouns, object vs subject wh-pronouns) in an attempt to further disentangle the explanations behind their difficulty in use. Outputs from our meta-analysis suggest that: (i) a form of pronoun impairment is consistently present in aphasia regardless of aphasia type, fluency or language spoken; (ii) pronoun variables show selectivity in their impairment, for instance, reflexives are better preserved over object pronouns, and the subject-advantage in who-pronouns is language-selective; and (iii) other important linguistic variables that largely predict pronoun impairments include aspects like argument position of subject/object phrases, case marking, cliticization, and the presence of relative clause constructions.

We orthogonally manipulated the number of orthographic and phonological neighbors of words using the Levenshtein Distance metric (OLD20 and PLD20, respectively). The results showed opposite effects of phonological neighborhood density (PND) as a function of orthographic neighborhood density (OND). Larger N400 amplitudes were elicited by words with high PND compared with low PND when OND was high, and smaller N400 amplitudes were observed with high PND compared with low PND words when OND was low. We interpret these findings using the notion of cross-code consistency, according to which the compatibility of orthographic and phonological representations activated by a given word influences the process of recognizing that word. Words with similar numbers of orthographic and phonological neighbors have more consistent spellings and pronunciations across the neighborhood, and generate larger N400 amplitudes.",Visual word recognition; Phonological neighbors; Orthographic neighbors; ERPs

Children with ASD show substantial heterogeneity in difficulties with different language components, but it remains unknown whether this variability is also present in HR-sibs. Method Receptive (RL) and expressive language (EL) were evaluated in siblings of typically developing children (low-risk (LR) sibs, N = 33) and HR-sibs (N = 30) at 36 months, using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), the Dutch version of the Reynell Developmental Language Scales – 2nd edition (RDLS-2) and spontaneous language analysis (SL). Next, composite scores for receptive and expressive phonology, grammar, semantics and pragmatics were formed. Group comparisons were performed and delays in the different language components were explored. Results HR-sibs scored significantly lower than LR-sibs on all standardized measures of RL. For EL, significantly lower scores were only found using the MSEL and not using the RDLS-2 nor using SL. HR-sibs scored significantly lower than LR-sibs for receptive and expressive semantics and receptive grammar. HR-sibs with characteristics of ASD presented with less language difficulties than HR-sibs without characteristics of ASD. The majority of HR-sibs showed a delay in one or more language components but these were not consistently detected by the different measures. Conclusions Language delays are highly prevalent in HR-sibs and their representation resembles the language profile of children with ASD. Evaluation of language at the level of phonology, grammar, semantics and pragmatics will detect considerably more children experiencing delayed language than holistic approaches.",Receptive language; Expressive language; Language components; High-risk siblings; Autism spectrum disorder

Crenezumab is an antiamyloid monoclonal antibody that binds monomeric and aggregated forms of amyloid β, with highest affinity for oligomers; it is in development for early stages of sporadic AD and for ADAD. Methods This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study of the efficacy of crenezumab versus placebo in asymptomatic PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers from family kindreds with ADAD in Colombia. Participants were randomized to receive either crenezumab or placebo for 260 weeks. The study was designed to enroll a planned total of 300 participants, including 200 preclinical mutation carriers (approximately 100 treatment, 100 placebo) and an additional control group of mutation noncarriers from the same family kindreds included to mask mutation carrier status (100 placebo only). The primary outcome is change in the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative ADAD Composite Cognitive Test Score from baseline to week 260. Secondary outcomes include time to progression to mild cognitive impairment due to AD or dementia due to AD; changes in dementia severity, memory, and overall neurocognitive functioning; and changes in amyloid–positron emission tomography, fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging volumes, and cerebrospinal fluid levels of β amyloid, tau, and p-tau. Safety and tolerability are assessed. Results Two hundred fifty-two participants were enrolled between December 2013 and February 2017. Discussion We describe the first large-scale, potentially label-enabling clinical trial of a preclinical treatment for ADAD. Results from this trial will inform on the efficacy of crenezumab for delaying onset of, slowing decline in, or preventing cognitive impairment in individuals with preclinical ADAD and will foster an improved understanding of AD biomarkers and their relationship to clinical outcomes.",Alzheimer's disease; Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease; Preclinical Alzheimer's disease; Prevention; Clinical trial; Crenezumab; Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative

In this study, we translated all MABC-2 items and validated them with respect to content, construct and criteria validity. The validation process involved 13 experts in Motor Development and a total of 844 children (3–13 years old) from two different states in Brazil. A cross-cultural translation method yielded a Brazilian–Portuguese version of the battery. The expert panel confirmed language clarity and pertinence of the items. High intra- and inter-rater reliability and internal consistency for the MABC-2 was established for Brazilian children. A discriminant analysis confirmed the MABC-2 power (.80) to differentiate children with DCD and those at risk for DCD from typically developing children. Predictive validity was observed for the impairment scores and a percentile main effect was found in the repeated measures ANOVA (ICC: .93 and .73, respectively).

Usually, three challenges must be tackled in order to solve the issues at stake: 1) Defining fluency from a threefold interdisciplinary perspective (acoustic and perceptual phonetics, computer science, L2 education); 2) Using a cost-effective algorithm; 3) Testing the procedure with actual learners’ data. Despite rapid technical developments in the field of automatic speech processing, the tools which are actually available for learners are still scarce, and most of them rely on automatic speech recognition (ASR). Moreover, most research on the topic is focusing on English as the target L2. Therefore, in this article, we address the following research questions: (a) is it possible to use a non-ASR-based low-level signal segmentation algorithm to predict human expert assessment of phonetic fluency in beginner Japanese learners of French in a text-reading task during the first stages of their learning? (b) if the answer to (a) is positive, then what are the best predictors of phonetic fluency among a set of available measures (see below for more details)? (c) is it possible to use this algorithm to monitor the evolution of phonetic fluency (and of its associated predictors) in these learners in a longitudinal study? As a first step, a corpus of French sentences read aloud by 12 Japanese learners of different proficiency levels in French was used to design a prediction system. The read-aloud speech data was perceptually annotated by three human experts on four dimensions: overall speech fluency, speech rate, regularity of speech rate, speech fluidity (i.e. smoothness of transitions between phones). Inter-rater agreement and reliability were high for all dimensions, and the average human ratings were compared with the scores provided by our prediction system. The results show strong correlations between human and automatic scores of speech rate and regularity of speech rate, and a weak correlation for speech fluidity. Automatic scores were finally combined together through a multiple linear regression model in order to predict overall speech fluency. The best model led to a correlation coefficient of .92 between automatic and human ratings, with a root-mean-square error of .38. In the second step of this study, a corpus of identical sentences read aloud four times over two years by 12 Japanese learners of French (after 4, 7, 12, and 19 months of French courses in Japan) was fed to the automatic system. The results show regular progress in overall speech fluency, which fits with the regular progress the Japanese learners under scrutiny were expected to make through their academic program in French at their university in Japan every semester. Our study suggests a positive answer to our first and third research questions, with speech rate as the best predictor to answer our second research question. In a pedagogical perspective, it seems that such a simple algorithm could be integrated in a CAPT tool to monitor learners’ progress in phonetic fluency in reading-aloud tasks.",Fluency; Automatic; Assessment; French; Japanese; Longitudinal

Marshall,2018,The somatosensory mismatch negativity as a window into body representations in infancy,article,International Journal of Psychophysiology,ScienceDirect,"How the body is represented in the developing brain is a topic of growing interest. The current study takes a novel approach to investigating neural body representations in infants by recording somatosensory mismatch negativity (sMMN) responses elicited by tactile stimulation of different body locations. Recent research in adults has suggested that sMMN amplitude may be influenced by the relative distance between representations of the stimulated body parts in somatosensory cortex. The current study uses a similar paradigm to explore whether the sMMN can be elicited in infants, and to test whether the infant sMMN response is sensitive to the somatotopic organization of somatosensory cortex. Participants were healthy infants (n = 31) aged 6 and 7 months. The protocol leveraged a discontinuity in cortical somatotopic organization, whereby the representations of the neck and the face are separated by representations of the arms, the hands and the shoulder. In a double-deviant oddball protocol, stimulation of the hand (100 trials, 10% probability) and neck (100 trials, 10% probability) was interspersed among repeated stimulation of the face (800 trials, 80% probability). Waveforms showed evidence of an infant sMMN response that was significantly larger for the face/neck contrast than for the face/hand contrast. These results suggest that, for certain combinations of body parts, early pre-attentive tactile discrimination in infants may be influenced by distance between the corresponding cortical representations. The results provide the first evidence that the sMMN can be elicited in infants, and pave the way for further applications of the sMMN in studying body representations in preverbal infants.",

Hirsch and Varda Gross-Tsur and Fortu Benarroch,2015,A disease specific questionnaire for assessing behavior in individuals with Prader–Willi syndrome,article,Comprehensive Psychiatry,ScienceDirect,"Objective Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic multisystem disorder with various medical, cognitive, behavioral and psychiatric problems. PWS is caused by the lack of expression of paternal genes on chromosome 15q2-q13 due to a deletion (70–75%), uniparental disomy (25–30%) or imprinting center defect (<5%). The common PWS behavioral and psychiatric characteristics are very typical in all ethnicities and were reported worldwide. Still, each individual has a specific profile of these common traits and the severity of his or her symptoms varies over time. Behavioral problems are the most important factor affecting the quality of life of both the individuals and their families. There is a need for a standardized tool to assess the specific behavioral profile of each individual and its present severity, in order to enable physicians to tailor the specific treatment needed and assist in a more accurate clinical follow up. To the best of our knowledge no such a tool has been standardized and published. We developed, based on the literature (mainly Forster and Gourash's paradigm) and our clinical experience, a 37 item disease specific questionnaire, the “PWS Behavioral Questionnaire” (PWSBQ) for assessing behavior in PWS patients. The purpose of the present study was to validate this tool in the entire adolescent and adult PWS population in Israel. Methods The PWSBQ focuses on five major domains—abnormal emotional regulation, food-seeking related behavior, lack of flexibility, oppositional behavior and interpersonal problems and lastly body related behaviors. Caregivers of all Hebrew speaking individuals with PWS over the age of 12years attending the Israeli national multidisciplinary PWS clinic were recruited. Of the 54 eligible individuals, 53 participated. They were interviewed with the PWSBQ and in addition filled the “Hyperphagia Questionnaire” and the “Child Behavioral Checklist” (CBCL). After verifying the questionnaire's content validity, all items on the PWSBQ were analyzed for internal reliability by calculating Cronbach's α. Criterion validity was evaluated by correlation testing with regard to the Hyperphagia Questionnaire and CBCL. In order to assess the questionnaire's interpretability, the correlation between the PWSBQ and the “Clinical Global Impression” (CGI) scores was evaluated. Results The PWSBQ total score was positively correlated with both the CBCL total score and the CGI score (0.662 and 0.549, p<0.001 respectively). Of the five domains, four had acceptable internal reliability (excluding the body related behaviors domain, which was thus removed from the total score). Criterion validity was established for the four domains remaining in the statistical analysis (abnormal emotional regulation, food seeking related behavior, lack of flexibility and oppositional behavior and interpersonal problems). Conclusions Our findings suggest that the PWSBQ is a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of current behavioral problems among individuals with PWS. Although further research is needed in order to verify PWSBQ's ability to identify changes in the behavioral status of a given individual, it can now be used both in research and in a clinical setting, enabling the physician to plan the most suitable treatment based on the current behavioral status.",

It remains unclear, however, to what extent this is also the case for classroom-based foreign language learning, particularly in children. To this end, we presented a mismatch negativity (MMN) experiment during EEG recordings as part of a longitudinal developmental study: 38 monolingual (Swiss-) German speaking children (7.5 years) were tested shortly before they started to learn English at school and followed up one year later. Moreover, 22 (Swiss-) German adults were recorded. Instead of the originally found positive mismatch response in children, an MMN emerged when applying a high-pass filter of 3Hz. The overlap of a slow-wave positivity with the MMN indicates that two concurrent mismatch processes were elicited in children. The children’s MMN in response to the non-native speech contrast was smaller compared to the native speech contrast irrespective of foreign language learning, suggesting that no additional neural resources were committed to processing the foreign language speech sound after one year of classroom-based learning.",Mismatch negativity (MMN); Mismatch response (MMR); Speech sound processing; Foreign language learning; ERP mapping

Longitudinal investigation of prediction for self-stigma is scarce and none is conducted in early psychosis. We aimed to prospectively examine baseline predictors of self-stigma in early psychosis patients in the context of a 3-year follow-up of a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) comparing 1-year extension of early intervention (EI) with step-down psychiatric care for first-episode psychosis (FEP). Method One hundred sixty Chinese patients were recruited from a specialized EI program for FEP in Hong Kong after they had completed this 2-year EI service, and underwent a 12-month RCT. Participants were followed up and reassessed 3years after inclusion to the trial. Comprehensive evaluation encompassing clinical, functional, subjective quality of life and treatment-related variables were conducted. Data analysis was based on 136 participants who completed self-stigma assessment at 3-year follow-up. Results Fifty patients (36.8%) had moderate to high levels of self-stigma at 3-year follow-up. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that female gender, prior psychiatric hospitalization, longer duration of untreated psychosis and greater positive symptom severity at study intake independently predicted self-stigma at the end of 3-year study period. Conclusion Our results of more than one-third of early psychosis patients experienced significant self-stigma underscore the clinical needs for early identification and intervention of self-stigmatization in the initial years of psychotic illness.

We assessed adolescents' word, pseudoword and text reading fluency, as well as their rapid naming abilities, at the beginning and after a half-year of education. The results showed that fluency development for real words, pseudowords and texts continues beyond the primary grades, and that the degree of improvement was similar across educational tracks. Word reading fluency and change in word reading fluency predicted text reading fluency development. No additional effect was found for pseudoword reading fluency. Finally, rapid naming ability was not only related to initial text reading fluency, but also to development of text reading fluency. Implications of these findings for assessment and intervention are discussed.",Rapid naming; Reading fluency; Longitudinal; Multiple-group latent change analysis; Adolescents

Strings of Arabic numerals and of number words (e.g., THREE, EIGHT) were presented in separate conditions of English and Hebrew. Significant rightward biases were seen among native Hebrew readers, regardless of English reading level; whereas native English readers (both bidirectional and monodirectional) did not show significant biases to either the left or the right. The spatial bias in bisecting either Arabic numeral strings or number words was related to the habitual reading direction of the participant.

It may be affected by the growth and evolution of one’s values, attributes, relationships with the community, personal memories of life events, habits, and skills. Behaviours and decisions of an individual are largely directed by his/her personality. Identification of such a personality trait can be performed based on an individual’s handwriting features. Handwriting may be unique for each person and a person’s nature, behaviour, and certain psychological aspects can be inferred based on it. It is introduced as the field of graphology, also called graphoanalysis, to analyze personality based on handwriting. We perceived that many researchers have worked on personality and/or behaviour identification based on handwriting, however, most of them were limited to a few numbers of features. According to graphology, there is a vast range of features of handwriting strokes which carry psychological characteristics of the writer. In this survey, we present links between handwriting and personality psychology and examine different mechanisms for features extraction to predict a writer’s personality. Psychologically supported handwriting features help to understand personality traits. The paper relates these features and encourages the use of computer-based graphology for personality prediction.

Whether phonological working memory is supported by fronto-parietal brain regions associated with short-term memory storage or perisylvian brain structures implicated in speech perception and production is unclear, perhaps due to variability in stimuli, task demands, and individuals. We used fMRI to assess neurophysiological responses while individuals performed two tasks with closely matched stimuli but divergent task demands—nonword repetition and nonword discrimination—at two levels of phonological working memory load. Using analyses designed to address intersubject variability, we found significant neural responses to the critical contrast of high vs. low phonological working memory load in both tasks in a set of regions closely resembling those involved in speech perception and production. Moreover, within those regions, the voxel-wise patterns of load-related activation were highly correlated between the two tasks. These results suggest that brain regions in the temporal and frontal lobes encapsulate the core neurocomputational components of phonological working memory; an architecture that becomes increasingly evident as neural responses are examined in successively finer-grained detail in individual participants.",fMRI; Individual-subject analyses; Nonword discrimination; Nonword repetition; Phonological working memory; Pseudowords

We examined whether an intervention increased adherence to 5-a-day diet and physical activity guidelines during a 54-month postintervention period among South African adolescents and whether its effects weakened at long-term (42 and 54 months postintervention) compared with short-term (3, 6, and 12 months postintervention) follow-up. Methods We randomized 18 randomly selected schools serving grade 6 learners (mean age = 12.6) in a township and a semirural area in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, to one of the two 12-hour interventions: health promotion, targeting healthful diet and physical activity; attention-matched control, targeting sexual risk behaviors. We tested the intervention's effects on adherence to 5-a-day diet and physical activity guidelines using generalized estimating equations logistic regression models adjusting for baseline behavior and clustering within schools. Results Health promotion intervention participants had higher odds of meeting 5-a-day diet and physical activity guidelines than control participants. The effect on 5-a-day diet did not weaken at long-term compared with short-term follow-up, but the effect on physical activity guidelines was weaker at long-term follow-up, mainly because of a reduced effect on muscle-strengthening physical activity. The intervention also increased health promotion attitude and intention and health knowledge and reduced binge drinking compared with the control group. Conclusions A 12-hour intervention in grade 6 shows promise in increasing self-reported adherence to healthful diet and physical activity guidelines during a 4.5-year postintervention period among South African adolescents.",Physical activity; Fruit and vegetable consumption; South Africa; Adolescents; Intervention; Cluster-randomized controlled trial

Using data from 749 families, we tested a model with 5th-grade variables that differed by generation as potential mediators linking student generation to 10th-grade academic performance. Results showed that immigrants were academically behind at 5th grade but caught up by 7th. Only economic hardship mediated the long term relation between student generation and 10th-grade academic performance; maternal educational expectations and child language hassles, English usage, discrimination, and mainstream values helped explained the early academic deficit of immigrant children.

However, less is known on whether MCT, or its specific modules, are effective in ameliorating reasoning biases e.g. belief flexibility. As inflexibility in appraisal has been associated with psychosis and major depressive disorder (MDD), this study examined the efficacy of a 4-session MCT on delusions, depression, and belief flexibility, in two clinical groups (Psychosis and Depression). Methods This study adopted a single-blind randomised controlled design, with patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (and delusions) and patients with MDD being randomised, respectively, into the MCT condition or a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. The MCT intervention consisted of specific modules targeting belief flexibility. Participants were assessed before and after treatment, and at 1- and 6-month follow-ups. Results Among the 113 participants, 27 patients with psychosis and 29 patients with MDD attended MCT. There were significant improvements in psychotic symptoms, especially delusions, for the Psychosis group, and in depressive symptoms for the MDD group. Symptom improvements following MCT were of large effect sizes, were significantly greater than TAU, and persisted at 6-month. Belief flexibility also improved in both groups, although changes were smaller in size and were not significantly greater than TAU. Limitations An active control condition was not included.

In the second part, school adjustment assessed by mothers and teachers of adopted children were compared. The findings documented a significant decrease in school motivation from first to third grade among adopted children but not among non-adopted. Among non-adopted children there was a significant decrease in hyperactive behaviour which was not the case for adopted children. Although there were some differences in mothers’ and teachers’ assessments of adopted children, there was a significant decrease in their assessments of school motivation. The same decrease was not found for relationship in school. Hyperactive behaviour and language skills interfere with school motivation both in mothers’ and teachers’ assessments. Adopted children with less hyperactive behavior and a good command of the Norwegian language, had better school motivation.

We propose a hodotopical (delocalized) and dynamic model of language processing, which challenges the traditional modular and serial view. According to this model, following the visual input, the language network is organized in parallel, segregated (even if interconnected) large-scale cortico-subcortical sub-networks underlying semantic, phonological and syntactic processing. Our model offers several advantages (i) it explains double dissociations during stimulation (comprehension versus naming disorders, semantic versus phonemic paraphasias, syntactic versus naming disturbances, plurimodal judgment versus naming disorders); (ii) it takes into account the cortical and subcortical anatomic constraints; (iii) it explains the possible recovery of aphasia following a lesion within the “classical” language areas; (iv) it establishes links with a model executive functions.",Language; Anatomo-functional connectivity; Hodotopy; Brain networks; Awake surgery; Direct electrical stimulation; Axonal pathways; Brain plasticity

All participants were native Cantonese speakers. It was found that the severity of aphasia and verbal-semantic impairment was associated with significantly more co-verbal gestures.

Previous studies have shown that there is a hierarchy of responses from posterior to anterior vOT regions (along the y-axis) that corresponds with increasing levels of recognition - from perceptual to semantic processing, respectively. In contrast, the functional differences between superior and inferior vOT responses (i.e. along the z-axis) have not yet been elucidated. To investigate, we conducted an extensive review of the literature and found that peak activation for reading varies by more than 1 cm in the z-axis. In addition, we investigated functional differences between superior and inferior parts of left vOT by analysing functional MRI data from 58 neurologically normal skilled readers performing 8 different visual processing tasks. We found that group activation in superior vOT was significantly more sensitive than inferior vOT to the type of task, with more superior vOT activation when participants were matching visual stimuli for their semantic or perceptual content than producing speech to the same stimuli. This functional difference along the z-axis was compared to existing boundaries between cytoarchitectonic areas around the OTs. In addition, using dynamic causal modelling, we show that connectivity from superior vOT to anterior vOT increased with semantic content during matching tasks but not during speaking tasks whereas connectivity from inferior vOT to anterior vOT was sensitive to semantic content for matching and speaking tasks. The finding of a functional dissociation between superior and inferior parts of vOT has implications for predicting deficits and response to rehabilitation for patients with partial damage to vOT following stroke or neurosurgery.",Connectivity; fMRI; Fusiform gyrus; Occipito-temporal sulcus; Reading and object recognition

Advances in web-enabled and multi-function devices have created a perceived need to stay “wired” to multiple media sources. The increased demand that these activities place on information processing resources has raised concerns about the quality of learning and performance under multitasking conditions. Young children, whose attention systems and executive functions are immature, are seen to be especially at risk. To evaluate these concerns the costs and benefits of “everyday” multitasking (e.g., driving, studying, multimedia learning) are examined in relation to the classic experimental literatures on divided attention in task-switching and dual-task performance. These literatures indicate that multitasking is almost always less efficient (time, accuracy) and can result in a more superficial learning than single-task performance. Alternatively, when the cognitive, perceptual, and response requirements of the tasks are controlled by the individual, when learning platforms are developmentally appropriate, and when practice is permitted, multitasking strategies can not only be successful but can result in enhanced visual and perceptual skills and knowledge acquisition. Future progress will come from advances in cognitive and computational modelling, from training attention and brain networks, and from the neuroergonomic evaluation of performance that will enable the design of work and learning environments that are optimized for multitasking.",Multitasking; Task switching; Dual-task performance; Attention; Executive functioning; Distractibility; Multimedia learning; Cognitive modelling; Threaded cognition; Neuroergonomics

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of exposures to maternal symptoms of ante- and post-natal CMD on infant social–emotional development in a low-income setting. Methods A prospective community-based investigation in which a cohort of pregnant women was recruited in rural northern Vietnam and followed until 6 months postpartum. Psychosocial and biological data were collected in four assessment waves. The outcome was 6-month old infants' scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Social–Emotional Questionnaire. Direct and indirect effects of maternal CMD on the outcome were tested simultaneously with path analysis. Results Complete data were available for 378 mother–infant dyads. There were no direct effects of ante- or post-natal CMD on infant Social–Emotional scores. However, there was an indirect pathway (path coefficient −1.11, 95% CI −1.79 to −0.42) in which antenatal CMD were associated with increased likelihood of postnatal CMD, which were associated with reduced parenting self-efficacy and less affectionate and warm parenting practices, which were associated with lower infant social–emotional scores. Parenting self-efficacy and practices also mediated the adverse effects of a woman being young or of high parity or experiencing poverty, intimate partner violence, a poor relationship with her own mother, non-economic life adversity and insufficient breastmilk, on infant social–emotional development. Limitations We acknowledge some limitations including (1) a moderate rate of attrition, (2) the use of a screening test for perinatal CMD, (3) the Bayley scales are not yet validated for use in Vietnam and (4) possible response bias in which maternal perceptions of their infants were influenced by their mood.

We were interested in how verbal WM accuracy may be affected by WM load, unilateral DLPFC stimulation, and gender, as previous studies showed gender-dependent brain activation during verbal WM tasks. Methods We utilized a modified verbal n-Back task hypothesized to increase demands on executive attention. We examined “online” WM performance while participants received transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and implicit learning performance in a post-stimulation WM task. Results Significant lateralized “online” stimulation effects were found only in the highest WM load condition revealing that males benefit from left DLPFC stimulation, while females benefit from right DLPFC stimulation. High WM load performance in the left DLPFC stimulation was significantly related to post-stimulation recall performance. Conclusions Our findings support the idea that lateralized stimulation effects in high verbal WM load may be gender-dependent. Further, our post-stimulation results support the idea that increased left hemisphere activity may be important for encoding verbal information into episodic memory as well as for facilitating retrieval of context-specific targets from semantic memory.",Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS); Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); Working memory (WM); Executive attention and verbal WM load

This project focuses on the content of language based on autobiographical narratives of five basic emotions. In persons with schizophrenia and healthy controls, we employed a comprehensive automated analysis of lexical use and we identified specific words and semantically or functionally related words derived from dictionaries that occurred significantly more often in narratives of either group. Patients employed a similar number of words but differed in lower expressivity and complexity, more self-reference and more repetitions. We developed a classification method for predicting subject status and tested its accuracy in a leave-one-subject-out evaluation procedure. We identified a set of 18 features that achieved 65.7% accuracy in predicting clinical status based on single emotion narratives, and 74.4% accuracy based on all five narratives. Subject clinical status could be determined automatically more accurately based on narratives related to anger or happiness experiences and there were a larger number of lexical differences between the two groups for these emotions compared to other emotions.",Emotion; Lexical features; LIWC; Diction; Learning-based analyses; Text classification

The results found that only Polish listeners accurately perceived the /pt/ cluster and perception was reflected within a late positive component of the ERP waveform. Furthermore, evidence of discrimination of /pt/ and /pət/ onsets in the neural signal was found even for non-native listeners who could not perceive the difference.

We use data from the 2012 Encuesta Longitudinal de Primera Infancia, a nationally representative survey of early childhood (0–6 years old) in Chile, which includes a test of cognitive development validated for Mapuche preschoolers. Our results indicate that the cognitive gap between Mapuche children and non-Indigenous children in Chile starts before they enter primary school (SD = 0.2, p < 0.001), which coincides with the lower limit of the gap found in previous studies during school years. In linear models of cognitive development, socioeconomic resources, and parental behaviors account for part of the gap between Mapuche children and non-Indigenous children, but not for all of it.

Auditory-verbal, later termed Phonological (Ph) STM or Phonological Loop, comprises two sub-components: i) the main storage system, the Phonological Short-Term Store (PhSTS), to which auditory verbal stimuli have direct access and where phonologically coded information is retained for a few seconds; ii) a Rehearsal Process (REH), which actively maintains the trace held in the PhSTS, preventing its decay and conveys visual verbal material to the PhSTS, after the process of Phonological Recoding (PhREC, or Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion) has taken place. PhREC converts visuo-verbal graphemic representations into phonological ones. The neural correlates of PhSTM include two discrete regions in the left hemisphere: the temporo-parietal junction (PhSTS) and the inferior frontal gyrus in the premotor cortex (REH). The neural basis of PhREC has been much less investigated. A few single case studies of patients made anarthric by focal or degenerative cortical damage, who show a pattern of impairment indicative of a deficit of PhREC, sparing the REH process, suggest that the primary motor cortex (M1) might be involved. To test this hypothesis in healthy participants with a neurophysiological approach, we measured the corticospinal excitability of M1, by means of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)-induced Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs), during the execution of phonological judgements on auditorily vs. visually presented words (Experiment #1). Crucially, these phonological tasks involve REH, while PhREC is required only with visual presentation. Results show MEPs with larger amplitude when stimuli are presented visually. Task difficulty does not account for this difference and the result is specific for linguistic stimuli, indeed visual and auditory stimuli that cannot be verbalized lead to different behavioral and neurophysiological patterns (Experiment #2). The increase of corticospinal excitability when words are presented visually can be then interpreted as an indication of the involvement of M1 in PhREC. The present findings elucidate the neural correlates of PhREC, suggesting an involvement of the peripheral motor system in its activity.",Phonological short-term memory; Phonological recoding; Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion; Primary motor cortex; Corticospinal excitability

This could be explained from a biological and environmental point of view, but also from a methodological one. The aims of this study were as follows: assess cognitive and linguistic performance using the BSID-III in a population of healthy preterm infants at 24 and 36 months (corrected age); analyze whether the correction for prematurity should be applied, decide when to stop using corrected age and evaluate possible improvements between 24 and 36 months. Methods Developmental outcome was assessed at 24 and 36 months (corrected age) with the BSID-III in 75 healthy preterm (GA=32.5±1.97; BW=1631.55±453.92) and 69 term-born children (GA=39.77±1.00; BW=3298.95±457.27). Results Preterm infants had significantly lower scores than those of term infants in Cognitive (COG) and Language (LANG REC, LANG EC) scales of the BSID-III at both 24 and 36 months, considering both corrected (CA) and chronological (UCA) age. At 24 months, significant differences between corrected and chronological scores were found for each BSID-III scale, while at 36 months, significant differences between corrected and chronological scores were found for LANG scales. Only the scores in the COG scale were statistically different between 24 and 36 months (F=4.894, P=0.009, η2=0.075). Considering only the preterm sample at 24 months, the differences between CA and UCA scores in the COG scale were significantly correlated to GA (p=0.000) and days in hospital (p=0.002;), while differences between CA and UCA scores in the LANG ESP scale were significantly correlated to GA (p=0.010), days in hospital (p=0.001), and birth weight (p=0.007). At 36 months, no significant correlations were found. Conclusions Preterm birth is followed by poorer cognitive and language outcomes during infancy than full-term birth. Age correction of prematurity is useful if the child is under 2 years of age; however, our findings raise concerns about the need for age correction, considering that at later ages, healthy preterm children have a higher rate of developmental delay compared with term infants. With regard to cognitive development, preterm children seem to recover from their initial disadvantage; however, with regard to linguistic development, data confirm that preterm infants are at risk for language difficulties.",Prematurity; Cognitive development; Language development; Corrected age; Chronological age; Age correction for prematurity

The availability of unilateral cochlear implantation (CI) auditory speech perception and spoken vocabulary enabled them to reach near ageappropriate levels. This holds especially for children in spoken language environments. However, speech perception in complex listening situations and the acquisition of complex verbal skills remains difficult. Bilateral CI was expected to enhance the acquisition of verbal intelligence by improved understanding of speech in noise. Methods This study examined the effect of bilateral CI on verbal intelligence of 49 deaf children (3;5–8;0 years). Relations between speech perception in noise, auditory short-term memory and verbal intelligence were analysed with multiple linear regressions. In addition, the interaction of educational setting, mainstream or special, on these relations was analysed. Results Children with bilateral CI obtained higher scores on verbal intelligence. Significant associations were present between speech perception in noise, auditory short-term memory and verbal intelligence. Conclusion Children with simultaneous bilateral CIs showed better speech perception in noise than children with unilateral CIs, which mediated by the auditory short-term memory capacity, enhanced the ability to acquire more complex verbal skills for BICI children in mainstream education.",Hearing impairment; Cochlear implant; Children; Verbal intelligence; Speech perception

In contrast, many developing countries lack the resources to provide these services. Research evidence suggests that one way to compensate for delays in identification and rehabilitation for children with hearing loss is to involve the family in the early intervention process. However, evidence is deficient around the facilitation of parental involvement in early intervention for families from developing countries. The aim of this study was to investigate the perception of parents from a developing country who have a child with hearing loss to discover the factors that may influence their involvement in early intervention, identify facilitators/barriers for their involvement, and identify the specific needs of involved parents. Method A qualitative collective case study methodology was used in the form of semi-structured interviews with twenty-one participants. Results Two global themes emerged. Firstly, factors influencing parental involvement. This included five subthemes: better communication as the key to building rapport and providing support; disappointment with the service; physical and human resources make a difference; consideration of life beyond the habilitation sessions; and my child matters the most. The second global theme-parental needs-included four subthemes: building trust; ensuring generalization; improving child outcomes; and managing needs of parents versus services. All the discussed themes are supported by quotations from the interviews. Conclusion The findings suggest that parents of children with hearing loss in developing countries perceive the services provided for their children to be disjointed and not well coordinated. Based on the parent perceptions a set of guidelines that provide a scaffold for service providers working with children with hearing loss in developing countries is outlined. The guidelines are designed to assist services for children with hearing loss in developing countries improve the delivery of their services and increase family involvement, which in turn; will assist in improving their child and family related outcomes.",Hearing loss; Child; Family; Participation; Developing countries; And aural habilitation

Kraus,2013,The auditory brainstem is a barometer of rapid auditory learning,article,Neuroscience,ScienceDirect,"To capture patterns in the environment, neurons in the auditory brainstem rapidly alter their firing based on the statistical properties of the soundscape. How this neural sensitivity relates to behavior is unclear. We tackled this question by combining neural and behavioral measures of statistical learning, a general-purpose learning mechanism governing many complex behaviors including language acquisition. We recorded complex auditory brainstem responses (cABRs) while human adults implicitly learned to segment patterns embedded in an uninterrupted sound sequence based on their statistical characteristics. The brainstem’s sensitivity to statistical structure was measured as the change in the cABR between a patterned and a pseudo-randomized sequence composed from the same set of sounds but differing in their sound-to-sound probabilities. Using this methodology, we provide the first demonstration that behavioral-indices of rapid learning relate to individual differences in brainstem physiology. We found that neural sensitivity to statistical structure manifested along a continuum, from adaptation to enhancement, where cABR enhancement (patterned>pseudo-random) tracked with greater rapid statistical learning than adaptation. Short- and long-term auditory experiences (days to years) are known to promote brainstem plasticity and here we provide a conceptual advance by showing that the brainstem is also integral to rapid learning occurring over minutes.",auditory; brainstem; statistical learning

The evolution and trajectory of primary negative symptoms were under-studied. We aimed at evaluating the prevalence and stability of primary negative symptoms, and factors associated with persistent primary negative symptoms in a first-episode sample. Method Ninety-three Hong Kong Chinese aged 18 to 55years presenting with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder were studied. Data on premorbid adjustment, socio-demographics, and baseline clinical and cognitive profiles were obtained. Psychopathological and vocational reassessments were conducted at 12, 24 and 36months. Primary negative symptoms were defined as the presence of clinically significant negative symptoms excluding depression and extra-pyramidal signs. Results At baseline, 25.8% of subjects exhibited primary negative symptoms. A quarter of patients had their initial primary negative symptoms status retained 12months after treatment initiation. In both Year 2 and Year 3 of study period, around 70% of subjects had their primary negative symptoms status maintained for 12months. At the end of three-year follow-up, 23.7% were categorized as having persistent primary negative symptoms. Male sex, unemployment at intake, prolonged duration of untreated psychosis, poorer premorbid academic and social functioning, poorer insight and worse vocational outcome were found to be associated with persistent primary negative symptoms.

This is especially pronounced for languages other than English. We address this problem, taking Spanish as an example of such a language, by building new simplification-specific datasets of synonyms and paraphrases using freely available resources. We test their usefulness in the LS task by adding them, in various combinations, to the existing text simplification (TS) training dataset in a phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) approach. Our best systems significantly outperform the state-of-the-art LS systems for Spanish, by the number of transformations performed and the grammaticality, simplicity and meaning preservation of the output sentences. The results of a detailed manual analysis show that some of the newly built TS resources, although they have a good lexical coverage and lead to a high number of transformations, often change the original meaning and do not generate simpler output when used in this PBSMT setup. The good combinations of these additional resources with the TS training dataset and a good choice of language model, in contrast, improve the lexical coverage and produce sentences which are grammatical, simpler than the original, and preserve the original meaning well.",Automated text simplification; Lexical coverage; External resources

At present, it is common to have to fill out forms electronically in order to carry out administrative procedures. The web interfaces of public transactional e-Services must be accessible by system users, regardless of whether they are disabled or not, according to the regulatory framework. This accessibility is not always taken into consideration in online forms in a process flow. One possible reason for this is the fact that guides are not available to assist in the design and evaluation of their accessibility. It is necessary for the transactional processes on Government e-Service websites to be accessible and well designed, in accordance with the current standards. In order to achieve this goal, the standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) must be complied with, according to legislation. However, these guidelines do not cover many of the obstacles faced by people with disabilities, as well as the general public, while filling out web forms, thus leaving accessibility problems undetected and unsolved. For this reason, web accessibility standards are not enough and should be supplemented by official government design patterns focused on transactional e-Services and online forms.

Tractography-based parcellation was used to define the subcomponents of left IFG and consistently identified four subregions in both humans and macaques. This parcellation scheme for left IFG in human was supported by specific coactivation patterns and functional characterization for each subregion. During evolution and development, we found increased functional balance, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, functional integration, and functional couplings. We also observed higher fractional anisotropy values, i.e. better myelination of dorsal and ventral white matter language pathways during evolution and development. We assume that the resting-state functional connectivity and task-related coactivation mapping are associated with hierarchical language processing.

The aim of this study was to describe growth trajectories of linguistic, motor and cognitive skills among ELGA children, compared to full-term (FT) peers, from the first to the third year of life, a crucial period for development. Growth curve analysis was used to examine individual and group differences in terms of initial status at 12 months and rate of growth through the second and the third year of life with five points of assessment. Twenty-eight monolingual Italian children, of whom 17 were ELGA (mean GA 25.7 weeks) and 11 were FT children, were assessed through the BSID-III at 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months for language skills and at 12, 24 and 30 months for motor and cognitive skills. ELGA children presented significantly lower scores than FT peers in language, motor and cognitive skills and they did not overcome their disadvantage by 3 years, even if their corrected age was taken into account. Concerning growth curves, in motor development a significant increasing divergence was found showing a Matthew effect with the preterm sample falling further behind the FT sample. In linguistic and cognitive development, instead, a stable gap between the two samples was found. In addition, great inter-individual differences in rate of change were observed for language development in both samples. Our findings highlight the theoretical and clinical relevance of analyzing, through growth curve analyses, the developmental trajectories of ELGA children in language skills taking into account their inter-individual variability also across motor and cognitive domains. Learning outcomes: After reading this article, the reader will interpret: (a) characteristics and growth trajectories of ELGA children from the first to the third year of life with respect to FT children in language, motor and cognitive development; (b) the method of growth curve analyses to describe group as well as inter-individual trajectories; (c) the rate of inter-individual variability in language as well as motor and cognitive skills, which gives useful indications for early interventions.",Extremely preterm children; Individual growth trajectories; Language development; Motor development; Cognitive development

In a user study (n=40) of search in the domain of genomics, a representation of the participant’s domain knowledge was constructed using self-ratings of knowledge of genomics-related terms (n=409). Cognitive effort features associated with reading eye movement patterns were calculated for each reading instance during the search tasks. The results show correlations between the cognitive effort due to reading and an individual’s level of domain knowledge.

Cappa and Enrico Smeraldi and Roberto Cavallaro,2015,Detecting syntactic and semantic anomalies in schizophrenia,article,Neuropsychologia,ScienceDirect,"One of the major challenges in the study of language in schizophrenia is to identify specific levels of the linguistic structure that might be selectively impaired. While historically a main semantic deficit has been widely claimed, results are mixed, with also evidence of syntactic impairment. This might be due to heterogeneity in materials and paradigms across studies, which often do not allow to tap into single linguistic components. Moreover, the interaction between linguistic and neurocognitive deficits is still unclear. In this study, we concentrated on syntactic and semantic knowledge. We employed an anomaly detection task including short and long sentences with either syntactic errors violating the principles of Universal Grammar, or a novel form of semantic errors, resulting from a contradiction in the computation of the whole sentence meaning. Fifty-eight patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia were compared to 30 healthy subjects. Results showed that, in patients, only the ability to identify syntactic anomaly, both in short and long sentences, was impaired. This result cannot be explained by working memory abilities or psychopathological features. These findings suggest the presence of an impairment of syntactic knowledge in schizophrenia, at least partially independent of the cognitive and psychopathological profile. On the contrary, we cannot conclude that there is a semantic impairment, at least in terms of compositional semantics abilities.",Language; Schizophrenia; Syntax; Semantics; Anomaly; Grammaticality judgments

Impaired naming is attributed to failure of lexical retrieval, which is a multi-staged process subserved by anatomically segregated brain regions. By dissecting the neurocognitive processes involved in impaired naming, we aimed to disentangle the clinical and neuroanatomical heterogeneity of this syndrome. Twenty-one individuals (66.7% females, age range 53–83 years) who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for logopenic variant and had at least two clinical and language assessments, 1 year apart, were recruited and matched for age, sex distribution and level of education with a healthy control sample (n = 18). All participants underwent a structural brain scan at the first visit and surface-wise statistical analysis using Freesurfer. Seventeen participants with logopenic variant underwent amyloid imaging, with 14 demonstrating high amyloid retention. Based on their performance on single-word comprehension, repetition and confrontation naming, three subgroups of logopenic cases with distinctive linguistic profiles and distribution of atrophy were identified. The first subgroup (n = 10) demonstrated pure anomia and left-sided atrophy in the posterior inferior parietal lobule and lateral temporal cortex. The second subgroup (n = 6), presented additional mild deficits in single-word comprehension, and also exhibited bilateral thinning of the fusiform gyri. The third subgroup (n = 5) showed additional impaired single-word repetition, and cortical thinning focused on the left superior temporal gyrus. The subgroups differed in the proportion of cases with high amyloid retention and in the rate of decline of naming performance over time, suggesting that neurodegeneration spreads differentially throughout regions subserving word processing. In line with previous reports, these results confirm the extensive damage to the language network and, in part, explain the clinical heterogeneity observed across logopenic cases.",Primary progressive aphasia; Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia; Alzheimer's disease; Anomia

Since then, lateralized features have been observed in virtually all phylogenetic branches, suggesting evolutionary conservation, although its adaptive role is still not clear. In humans, the field remains greatly shaped by early observations on language, but the advent of brain imaging revealed that functional and structural laterality is not only widespread, extending to memory, decision-making and emotion, but also that it is plastic. In this review, we systematize information regarding structural and functional hemispheric asymmetries of the healthy brain and their associations with cognition and behavior.

TBI severity is a factor of poor outcome, but most studies include a majority of children with mild and moderate TBI. The aims of this study were to estimate EF impairment after severe childhood TBI and to explore factors predicting EF outcome. The secondary aim was to compare recovery trajectories by age-at-injury groups. Methods This was a prospective longitudinal study of children with severe TBI who were tested for EFs by performance-based tests and questionnaires at 3, 12 and 24 months. Results Children with TBI (n=65) showed significant impairment in working memory, inhibition, attention and global EF, with little or no recovery at 24 months. For flexibility and performance-based EF score, children were impaired at 3 months only and showed normal scores by 12 months. No impairment was found in planning. At 3 and 24 months, Glasgow Coma Scale score and parental education predicted global EF. Coma length was not a significant predictor of outcome. Age at injury predicted progress in EF, but the relationship was not linear; children 10–12 years old at injury showed better outcome than older and younger children. Conclusions EFs are impaired after severe TBI in childhood. The relationship between age at injury and outcome is not linear.

We aimed to describe the perspectives of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their parents with regard to communication and decision making. Study Design Qualitative study. Setting & Participants Children with CKD (n=34) and parents (n=62) from 6 centers across 6 cities in Australia, Canada, and the United States participated in 16 focus groups. Analytical Approach Transcripts were analyzed thematically. Results We identified 4 themes: (1) disempowered by knowledge imbalance (unprepared and ill-informed, suspicion of censorship, and inadequacy as technicians), (2) recognizing own expertise (intuition and instinct unique to parental bond, emerging wisdom and confidence, identifying opportunities for control and inclusion, and empowering participation in children), (3) striving to assert own priorities (negotiating broader life impacts, choosing to defer decisional burden, overprotected and overruled, and struggling to voice own preferences), and (4) managing child’s involvement (respecting child’s expertise, attributing “risky” behaviors to rebellion, and protecting children from illness burden). Limitations Only English-speaking participants were recruited, which may limit the transferability of the findings. We collected data from child and parent perspectives; however, clinician perspectives may provide further understanding of the difficulties of communication and decision making in pediatrics. Conclusions Parents value partnership with clinicians and consider long-term and quality-of-life implications of their child’s illness. Children with CKD want more involvement in treatment decision making but are limited by vulnerability, fear, and uncertainty. There is a need to support the child to better enable him or her to become a partner in decision making and prepare him or her for adulthood. Collaborative and informed decision making that addresses the priorities and concerns of both children and parents is needed.",

We focus on the distinction between pragmatic and lexical constraints accounts. High-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) offer a unique perspective on this debate, as they acquire substantial vocabularies despite impoverished social-pragmatic skills. We tested children and adolescents with ASD in a paradigm examining mutual exclusivity for words and facts. Words were interpreted contrastively more often than facts. Word performance was associated with vocabulary size; fact performance was associated with social-communication skills. Thus mutual exclusivity does not appear to be driven by pragmatics, suggesting that it is either a lexical constraint or a reflection of domain-general learning processes.",Mutual exclusivity; Word learning; Pragmatics; Autism; Asperger’s syndrome

Significant convergence of print and speech processing was also observed in both languages across a network of left-hemisphere regions joint for both L1 and L2. Despite significant increases in behavioural measures of L2 proficiency, only a few signs of longitudinal change in L2 brain activation were found. In contrast, L1 showed widespread differences in processing across time, suggesting that the neurobiological footprint of reading is dynamic and plastic even in adults, with L2 immersion impacting L1 processing.

By means of an Independent Components Analysis, a data-driven approach to functional connectivity of the brain, the fMRI data collected during a grammar-learning task were decomposed into maps representing separate cognitive processes. These included the default mode, task-positive, working memory, visual, cerebellar and emotional networks. We further tested for differences within the components, representing individual differences between the High and Average LAA learners. We found high analytical abilities to be coupled with stronger contributions to the task-positive network from areas adjacent to bilateral Broca’s region, stronger connectivity within the working memory network and within the emotional network. Average LAA participants displayed stronger engagement within the task-positive network from areas adjacent to the right-hemisphere homologue of Broca's region and typical to lower level processing (visual word recognition), and increased connectivity within the default mode network. The significance of each of the identified networks for the grammar learning process is presented next to a discussion on the established markers of inter-individual learners’ differences.

However, whether phonological encoding is automatic remains controversial. The present experiment examined whether adult congenitally deaf readers show evidence of automatic use of phonological information during visual word recognition. In an ERP masked priming lexical decision experiment, deaf participants responded to target words preceded by a pseudohomophone (koral – CORAL) or an orthographic control prime (toral – CORAL). Responses were faster for the pseudohomophone than for the orthographic control condition. The N250 and N400 amplitudes were reduced for the pseudohomophone when compared to the orthographic control condition. Furthermore, the magnitude of both the behavioral and the ERP pseudohomophone effects in deaf readers was similar to that of a group of well-matched hearing controls. These findings reveal that phonological encoding is available to deaf readers from the early stages of visual word recognition. Finally, the pattern of correlations of phonological priming with reading ability suggested that the amount of sub-lexical use of phonological information could be a main contributor to reading ability for hearing but not for deaf readers.",Deaf readers; Phonological processing; Reading ability; Lexical decision; Masked priming; Sandwich masked priming

We assessed whether pesticide exposure was associated with impaired neurobehavioral outcomes in children aged 6–9 years. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 140 children living near banana plantations and plantain farms in the Talamanca County, Costa Rica and assessed their neurobehavioral performance. Exposure was determined by analyzing urinary metabolites of chlorpyrifos (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, TCPy), mancozeb (ethylenethiourea, ETU), and pyrethroids (3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 3-PBA). Repeated urine samples were obtained for 36 children. We estimated associations of pesticide concentrations with neurobehavioral outcomes using multivariable linear and logistic regression models. Median (25th–75th percentiles) TCPy, ETU, and 3-PBA concentrations were 1.4 (.7–3.1), 1.2 (.7–3.0), and .8 (.5–1.5) μg/L, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) ranged between .32 and .67. After adjustment for potential confounders, higher urinary TCPy concentrations were associated with poorer working memory in boys (n = 59) (β per 10-fold increase in TCPy concentrations = −7.5, 95% CI: −14.4, −.7); poorer visual motor coordination (β = −1.4, 95% CI: −2.7, −.1); increased prevalence of parent-reported cognitive problems/inattention (adjusted OR per 10-fold increase in urinary concentrations = 5.8, 95% CI: 1.6, 22.9), oppositional disorders (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.0, 16.0), and ADHD (aOR = 6.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 28.6), and; decreased ability to discriminate colors (aOR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.6, 30.3; the higher the score the worse).

Higher 3-PBA concentrations were associated with poorer processing speed scores, particularly in girls (β = −8.8, 95% CI: −16.1, −1.4). Our findings indicate that children living near banana and plantain plantations are exposed to pesticides that may affect their neurodevelopment, which for certain domains may differ between boys and girls.

The reviewed literature (N = 31, published between 2008 and 2020) revealed several characteristics of second language digital reading environments, tasks, and readers. First, characteristics of digital environments were availability and choice of authentic texts, degrees of linearity, lay-out characteristics, and integrated tools. Second, task characteristics evolved around different reading purposes, navigating elements, and features of digital texts, information management, and interaction. And third, reader characteristics included language and reading proficiency levels; readers' perceptions of their self-efficacy, locus of control, and of themselves as second language readers; and readers' topic, lexical, and world knowledge. These characteristics seemed to enhance motivation, interaction, and understanding, but posed challenges as well, by demanding additional skills, strategies, time, memory capacity, and concentration. The literature provided divergent insights about digital reading strategy use. The consensus seemed to be that the more one reads in a digital environment in the second language, the more digital reading strategies are used. However, increases in strategy use did not necessarily result in better reading comprehension. This review also revealed discrepancies between perceived and actual strategy use, and between teachers' expectations of strategy use and students' actions. We found that educational contexts were being represented more frequently than others. The research was predominantly explorative and qualitative. Based on these findings, recommendations for future research were made. We recommend a clearer focus on the unique aspects of reading in a second language, on the affordances of digital reading, and on the teachers' perspective. In order to move the research on digital reading in a second language forward, we would also advocate a wider scope and more diversity in research designs.",Applications in subject areas; Information literacy; Media in education; Teaching/learning strategies; 21st century abilities

For late second language (L2) learners on the other hand, the extent to which the neural architecture supporting syntactic processing is similar to or different from that of native speakers is still unclear. In a series of four experiments, we used electroencephalography to investigate the link between beta oscillatory activity and the processing of grammatical gender agreement in Dutch determiner-noun pairs, for Dutch native speakers, and for German L2 learners of Dutch. In Experiment 1 we show that for native speakers, grammatical gender agreement violations are yet another among many syntactic factors that modulate beta oscillatory activity during sentence comprehension. Beta power is higher for grammatically acceptable target words than for those that mismatch in grammatical gender with their preceding determiner. In Experiment 2 we observed no such beta modulations for L2 learners, irrespective of whether trials were sorted according to objective or subjective syntactic correctness. Experiment 3 ruled out that the absence of a beta effect for the L2 learners in Experiment 2 was due to repetition of the target nouns in objectively correct and incorrect determiner-noun pairs. Finally, Experiment 4 showed that when L2 learners are required to explicitly focus on grammatical information, they show modulations of beta oscillatory activity, comparable to those of native speakers, but only when trials are sorted according to participants' idiosyncratic lexical representations of the grammatical gender of target nouns. Together, these findings suggest that beta power in L2 learners is sensitive to violations of grammatical gender agreement, but only when the importance of grammatical information is highlighted, and only when participants' subjective lexical representations are taken into account.",EEG; Beta oscillations; Grammatical gender; Cross-language effects; Idiosyncratic lexical representations

However, this novel word learning ability has been studied only in the context of single word-picture pairings. We examined the ability of people with chronic aphasia to learn novel words using a paradigm that presents new word forms together with a limited set of different possible visual referents and requires the identification of the correct word-object associations on the basis of online feedback. We also studied the relationship between word learning ability and aphasia severity, word processing abilities, and verbal short-term memory (STM). We further examined the influence of gross lesion location on new word learning. The word learning task was first validated with a group of forty-five young adults. Fourteen participants with chronic aphasia were administered the task and underwent tests of immediate and long-term recognition memory at 1 week. Their performance was compared to that of a group of fourteen matched controls using growth curve analysis. The learning curve and recognition performance of the aphasia group was significantly below the matched control group, although above-chance recognition performance and case-by-case analyses indicated that some participants with aphasia had learned the correct word-referent mappings. Verbal STM but not word processing abilities predicted word learning ability after controlling for aphasia severity. Importantly, participants with lesions in the left frontal cortex performed significantly worse than participants with lesions that spared the left frontal region both during word learning and on the recognition tests. Our findings indicate that some people with aphasia can preserve the ability to learn a small novel lexicon in an ambiguous word-referent context. This learning and recognition memory ability was associated with verbal STM capacity, aphasia severity and the integrity of the left inferior frontal region.",New word learning; Aphasia; Short-term memory; Inferior frontal regions

The younger students are, the more important is a focus on potential rather than achievement. Teacher judgments (TJs) as measures of intelligence are particularly important where objective IQ tests are not standard. Although most studies on TJs have been conducted within classrooms, few have accounted for the nested data structure. We predicted TJs of student's cognitive ability through both established and under-researched factors pertaining to student, teacher, and classroom using multilevel analysis. Student intelligence was the strongest predictor at both individual (positive effect) and class-average level (negative effect), followed by parent level of education. Better-known students received higher TJs. Student sex and linguistic background had no effect. Teachers were comparably able to rank their students.

We aimed to use a regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate the features of spontaneous brain activity in MDD patients screening positive on the 32-item Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32). Methods Nineteen MDD patients screening positive (HCL-32(+); 9 males; 24.9±5.7 years) and 18 patients screening negative (HCL-32(−); 9 males; 27.1±6.7 years), together with 24 healthy controls (HC; 11 males; 26.4±3.9 years) were studied. ReHo maps were compared and an receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to confirm the utility of the identified ReHo differences in classifying the patients. Results The MDD versus HC showed different ReHo in many brain areas, especially in the frontal and parietal cortex. The HCL-32(+) versus HCL-32(−) showed significant increase of ReHo in the right medial superior frontal cortex, left inferior parietal cortex and middle/inferior temporal cortex, and decrease of ReHo in the left postcentral cortex and cerebellum. ROC analysis showed good sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing these two subgroups of MDD. Limitations Recruited patients were all on antidepressants and standard mania rating scales were not performed to assess their hypomanic symptoms. Conclusions The rs-fMRI measurement of ReHo in distributed brain regions may be putative biomarkers which could differentiate subthreshold BD from MDD.",Major depressive disorder; HCL‐32; Resting-state fMRI; Regional homogeneity

Results Nd waveforms were elicited from adults and children with TD, but not from children with ADHD. Further, those with ADHD exhibited significantly smaller auditory responses at 100ms (Ta). P3bs were elicited in all three groups by targets but not by unattended deviants. Performance was significantly poorer in children with ADHD than TD and RTs were more variable. Conclusions Children with ADHD evidenced poorer attention allocation, as measured by Nd and hits, but were not more distracted by unattended deviants, as measured by P3b and false alarms, than children with TD. Significance Findings for Nd, P3b, and Ta considered together suggest that deficits in auditory selective attention in children with ADHD may be attributable to reduced information early in the processing stream.",Selective attention; Nd; ADHD; ERP; Auditory; Ta

The aim was to establish standardized tractography of language pathways as a predictor of language outcome in clinical neurosurgery. Methods We prospectively analyzed 50 surgical cases of patients with left perisylvian, diffuse gliomas. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging (DTI)-based tractography of the 5 main language tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus [AF], Frontal Aslant Tract [FAT], Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus [IFOF], Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus [ILF], Uncinate Fasciculus [UF]) and spatial analysis of tumor and tracts was performed. Postoperative imaging and the resulting resection map were analyzed for potential surgical injury of tracts. The language status was assessed preoperatively, postoperatively and after 3 months using the Aachen Aphasia Test and Berlin Aphasia Score. Correlation analyses, two-step cluster analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyze associations of tractography results with language outcome after surgery. Results In 14 out of 50 patients (28%), new aphasic symptoms were detected 3 months after surgery. The preoperative infiltration of the AF was associated with functional worsening (cc = 0.314; p = 0.019). Cluster analysis of tract injury profiles revealed two areas particularly related to aphasia: the temporo-parieto-occipital junction (TPO; temporo-parietal AF, middle IFOF, middle ILF) and the temporal stem/peri-insular white matter (middle IFOF, anterior ILF, temporal UF, temporal AF). Injury to these areas (TPO: OR: 23.04; CI: 4.11 – 129.06; temporal stem: OR: 21.96; CI: 2.93 – 164.41) was associated with a higher-risk of persisting aphasia. Conclusions Tractography of language pathways can help to determine the individual aphasia risk profile pre-surgically. The TPO and temporal stem/peri-insular white matter were confirmed as functional nodes particularly sensitive to surgical injuries.",Glioma; DTI; Risk stratification; Aphasia; Tractography; Language pathways; Arcuate fasciculus; Brain tumor

It has been proposed that at short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), automatic processes are engaged, while at long SOAs, controlled processes are activated. Here, we explored whether the magnitude of event-related potentials (ERPs) in 18-month-old children are SOA-dependent to further understand the developmental mechanisms underlying semantic priming during early language acquisition. Children were exposed to an auditory semantic priming task in two invariant SOA conditions (1000 ms and 1600 ms). The results showed that the amplitudes of N2, N400 and late posterior negativity (LPN) components were modulated by semantic relatedness, but only those of N2 and LPN were modulated by the SOA length. The amplitudes of the frontally distributed N2 were larger at long than at short SOAs, while the posteriorly distributed LPN was larger over the right hemisphere at the short SOA and more pronounced over the left hemisphere at the long SOA. These findings suggest that both automatic and controlled processes contribute to priming effects in the developing brain, but neural resources underlying these processes might differ.",Semantic priming; Language-related ERPs; Automatic activation  controlled mechanisms; Language development

To promote this process, it is necessary to assess personal recovery validly and reliably. The Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS) is the most established measure in recovery research. The aim of the current study is to examine the factor structure of the German version of the RAS (RAS-G). Methods One hundred and fifty-six German-speaking clients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from a community mental health service completed the RAS-G plus measures of recovery attitudes, self-stigma, psychotic symptoms, depression, and functioning. A confirmatory factor analysis of the original 24-item RAS version was conducted to examine its factor structure, followed by reliability and validity testing of the extracted factors. Results The CFA yielded five factors capturing 14 items which showed a substantial overlap with the original subscales Personal Confidence and Hope, Goal and Success Orientation, Willingness to Ask for Help, Reliance on Others, and No Domination by Symptoms. The factors demonstrated mean to excellent reliability (0.59–0.89) and satisfactory criterial validity by positive correlations with measures of recovery attitudes and functioning, and negative correlations with measures of self-stigma, and psychotic and depressive symptoms. Conclusions The study results are discussed in the light of other studies examining the factor structure of the RAS.

High-speed mobile Internet access and mobile devices have enabled the development of robust technologies such as machine translation, automated speech recognition, voice synthesis, and even speech-to-speech translation. Communication applications that support sign language recognition are also being introduced and upgraded. Nonetheless, people with speech, hearing, or mental impairment still require special communication assistance, especially for medical purposes; this makes their health and life dependent on other people. Automatic solutions for speech recognition or voice synthesis from the text are poor fits for communication in the medical domain because they are dependent on error-prone statistical models. Additionally, in emergency cases, rapid information exchange is essential. Systems dependent on manual text input are insufficient. Recently introduced systems for automatic sign language recognition are dependent on statistical models and image and gesture quality. Such systems remain in early development and are based mostly on minimal hand gestures unsuitable for medical purposes. Furthermore, Internet-dependent solutions cannot be used in most countries requiring humanitarian aid. We propose a high-speed, intuitive, Internet-free, voice-free, and text-free tool suited for emergency medical communication. Our solution is a pictogram-based communication application that provides easy communication means for individuals who are speech- or hearing-impaired, have mental health issues impairing communication, or non-natives who do not speak the local language. It provides support and clarification in communication with such people using intuitive icons and interactive symbols easy to find on a mobile device. Such pictogram-based communication can be quite effective and, ultimately, make some people’s lives happier, easier, and safer.

We present findings regarding test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct validity, and concurrent validity of the new measure. Results indicate adequate psychometric properties across examined areas for the new measure, including strong concurrent correlation (r=.80) with a standardized diagnostic science measure, the Preschool Science Assessment (Greenfield et al., 2014).

We sought to further characterize developmental neurology in children with molecularly-confirmed cblC. Thirteen children at our center with cblC, born since implementation of expanded newborn screening in New York State, undertook standard-of-care evaluations with a pediatric neurologist and pediatric ophthalmologist. At most recent follow-up (mean age 50months, range 9–84months), of twelve children with early-onset cblC, three (25%) had a history of clinical seizures and two (17%) meet criteria for microcephaly. A majority of children had hypotonia and nystagmus. Twelve out of thirteen (92%) underwent neurodevelopmental evaluation (mean age 41months; range 9–76months), each child tested with standardized parental interviews and, where possible, age- and disability-appropriate neuropsychological batteries. All patients showed evidence of developmental delay with the exception of one patient with a genotype predictive of attenuated disease and near-normal biochemical parameters. Neurodevelopmental deficits were noted most prominently in motor skills, with relative preservation of socialization and communication skills. Nine children with early-onset cblC underwent magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) at mean age of 47months (range 6–81months); common abnormalities included callosal thinning, craniocaudally short pons, and increased T2 FLAIR signal in periventricular and periatrial white matter. Our study further characterizes variable neurodevelopmental phenotypes in treated cblC, and provides insights into the etiopathogenesis of disordered neurodevelopment frequently encountered in cblC. Plasma homocysteine and MMA, routinely measured at clinical follow-up, may be poor predictors for neurodevelopmental outcomes. Additional data from large, prospective, multi-center natural history studies are required to more accurately define the role of these metabolites and others, as well as that of other genetic and environmental factors in the etiopathogenesis of the neurologic components of this disorder.",Methylmalonic acidemia; Homocystinuria; Cobalamin C; Neurodevelopment; Newborn screening;

The sign language considered was the Spanish sign language (LSE: Lengua de Signos Española). This system consists of an advanced visual interface (where a deaf person can specify a sequence of signs in sign-writing), a language translator (for generating the sequence of words in Spanish), and finally, a text to speech converter. The visual interface allows a sign sequence to be defined using several sign-writing alternatives. The paper details the process for designing the visual interface proposing solutions for HCI-specific challenges when working with the Deaf (i.e. important difficulties in writing Spanish or limited sign coverage for describing abstract or conceptual ideas). Three strategies were developed and combined for language translation to implement the final version of the language translator module. The summative evaluation, carried out with Deaf from Madrid and Toledo, includes objective measurements from the system and subjective information from questionnaires. The paper also describes the first Spanish-LSE parallel corpus for language processing research focused on specific domains. This corpus includes more than 4000 Spanish sentences translated into LSE. These sentences focused on two restricted domains: the renewal of the identity document and driver’s license.

Anderson and Harvey Sussman,2012,Nonword repetition and phoneme elision in adults who do and do not stutter,article,Journal of Fluency Disorders,ScienceDirect,"The purpose of the present study was to explore the phonological working memory of adults who stutter through the use of a non-word repetition and a phoneme elision task. Participants were 14 adults who stutter (M=28 years) and 14 age/gender matched adults who do not stutter (M=28 years). For the non-word repetition task, the participants had to repeat a set of 12 non-words across four syllable lengths (2-, 3-, 4-, and 7-syllables) (N=48 total non-words). For the phoneme elision task, the participants repeated the same set of non-words at each syllable length, but with a designated target phoneme eliminated. Adults who stutter were significantly less accurate than adults who do not stutter in their initial attempts to produce the longest non-words (i.e., 7-syllable). Adults who stutter also required a significantly higher mean number of attempts to accurately produce 7-syllable non-words than adults who do not stutter. For the phoneme elision task, both groups demonstrated a significant reduction in accuracy as the non-words increased in length; however, there was no significant interaction between group and syllable length. Thus, although there appear to be advancements in the phonological working memory for adults who stutter relative to children who stutter, preliminary data from the present study suggest that the advancements may not be comparable to those demonstrated by adults who do not stutter. Educational objectives At the end of this activity the reader will be able to (a) summarize the nonword repetition data that have been published thus far with children and adults who stutter; (b) describe the subvocal rehearsal system, an aspect of the phonological working memory that is critical to nonword repetition accuracy; (c) employ an alternative means to explore the phonological working memory in adults who stutter, the phoneme elision task; and (d) discuss both phonological and motoric implications of deficits in the phonological working memory.",Phonological working memory; Nonword repetition; Phoneme elision; Adults who stutter

For this study, children aged 6–8years were recruited as follows: 17 children with DCD, 18 at risk of DCD and 35 without obvious problems in motor coordination. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC-2) was used to measure motor performance and identify the motor incoordination. This study developed a battery of tests to assess limb praxis using a praxis imagery questionnaire, gesture representation, and questions about knowledge of object use. In the comparison of subtests within the praxis test, significant differences were observed across groups on the praxis imagery questionnaire and gesture representation tests but not on knowledge of object use. Similar results were observed in the correlation analyses, in which a weak relationship between MABC-2 and praxis tests was observed. The DCD group had lower scores on the praxis imagery questionnaire, whereas the group at risk of DCD had lower scores on most gesture production tests. Our study provides a better understanding of the nature of the childhood dyspraxia and sheds light on its effect on motor coordination to identify praxis tests with specific clinical meanings in children with movement disorders.",Childhood dyspraxia; Developmental coordination disorder; Motor imagery; Gesture representation; Object use

Meta-analytic evidence for a cortical-subcortical network likely subserving prediction,article,Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews,ScienceDirect,"Predictive coding is an increasingly influential and ambitious concept in neuroscience viewing the brain as a ‘hypothesis testing machine’ that constantly strives to minimize prediction error, the gap between its predictions and the actual sensory input. Despite the invaluable contribution of this framework to the formulation of brain function, its neuroanatomical foundations have not been fully defined. To address this gap, we conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 39 neuroimaging studies of three functional domains (action perception, language and music) inherently involving prediction. The ALE analysis revealed a widely distributed brain network encompassing regions within the inferior and middle frontal gyri, anterior insula, premotor cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, temporoparietal junction, striatum, thalamus/subthalamus and the cerebellum. This network is proposed to subserve domain-general prediction and its relevance to motor control, attention, implicit learning and social cognition is discussed in light of the predictive coding scheme. Better understanding of the presented network may help advance treatments of neuropsychiatric conditions related to aberrant prediction processing and promote cognitive enhancement in healthy individuals.",Prediction; Prediction error; Predictive coding; Music; Language; Action perception; Network; Hierarchical; Meta-analysis; Neuroimaging

Using a sample of 688 kindergarteners from 45 classrooms, we found that challenges in the transition to kindergarten were prevalent based on teacher report. More than 70% of the children were reported to have difficulty in at least one area, and over 30% of children had challenges in all five areas. Meeting academic demands and being organized were two of the most common challenges kindergarteners experienced. Gender and IEP status consistently predicted transition difficulties, in that boys struggled more than girls, and children with disabilities (on the basis of IEP provision) were more likely to have difficulties than those without IEPs.

The present study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), a new questionnaire specifically tailored to assess subthreshold forms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in adulthood. Methods 102 adults endorsing at least one DSM-5 symptom criterion for ASD (ASDc), 143 adults diagnosed with a feeding and eating disorder (FED), and 160 subjects with no mental disorders (CTL), were recruited from 7 Italian University Departments of Psychiatry and administered the following: SCID-5, Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale 14-item version (RAADS-14), and AdAS Spectrum. Results The AdAS Spectrum demonstrated excellent internal consistency for the total score (Kuder–Richardson's coefficient=.964) as well as for five out of seven domains (all coefficients>.80) and sound test–retest reliability (ICC=.976). The total and domain AdAS Spectrum scores showed a moderate to strong (>.50) positive correlation with one another and with the AQ and RAADS-14 total scores. ASDc subjects reported significantly higher AdAS Spectrum total scores than both FED (p<.001) and CTL (p<.001), and significantly higher scores on the Childhood/adolescence, Verbal communication, Empathy, Inflexibility and adherence to routine, and Restricted interests and rumination domains (all p<.001) than FED, while on all domains compared to CTL. CTL displayed significantly lower total and domain scores than FED (all p<.001). A significant effect of gender emerged for the Hyper– and hyporeactivity to sensory input domain, with women showing higher scores than men (p=.003). A Diagnosis* Gender interaction was also found for the Verbal communication (p=.019) and Empathy (p=.023) domains. When splitting the ASDc in subjects with one symptom criterion (ASD1) and those with a ASD, and the FED in subjects with no ASD symptom criteria (FED0) and those with one ASD symptom criterion (FED1), a gradient of severity in AdAS Spectrum scores from CTL subjects to ASD patients, across FED0, ASD1, FED1 was shown. Conclusions The AdAS Spectrum showed excellent internal consistency and test–retest reliability and strong convergent validity with alternative dimensional measures of ASD. The questionnaire performed differently among the three diagnostic groups and enlightened some significant effects of gender in the expression of autistic traits.",

The CI, however, must be accompanied by a long-term and intense auditory training regimen in order to possibly acquire spoken language with the device. This research investigates families' experiences when they opted for the CI and undertook the task of auditory training, but the child failed to achieve what might be clinically considered “success” – the ability to function solely using spoken language. Using a science and technology studies informed approach that places the CI within a complex sociotechnical system, this research shows the uncertain trajectory of the CI, as well as the contingency of the very notions of success and failure. To do so, data from in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of parents (n = 11) were collected. Results show the shifting definitions of failure and success within families, as well as suggest areas for further exploration regarding clinical practice and pediatric CIs. First, professionals' messaging often conveyed to parents a belief in the infallibility of the CI, this potentially caused “soft failure” to go undetected and unmitigated. Second, speech assessments used in clinical measurements of outcomes did not capture a holistic understanding of a child's identity and social integration, leaving out an important component for consideration of what a 'good outcome' is. Third, minority parents experience structural racism and clinical attitudes that may render “failure” more likely to be identified and expected in these children, an individualizing process that allows structural failures to go uncritiqued.",Deaf; Cochlear implant; Narratives; Failure; Disability

While speech errors have traditionally been seen as categorical substitutions of one sound for another, acoustic/articulatory analyses show they partially reflect the intended sound. When “pig” is mispronounced as “big,” the resulting /b/ sound differs from correct productions of “big,” moving towards intended “pig”—revealing the role of graded sound representations in speech production. Investigating the origins of such phenomena requires detailed estimation of speech sound distributions; this has been hampered by reliance on subjective, labor-intensive manual annotation. Computational methods can address these issues by providing for objective, automatic measurements. We develop a novel high-precision computational approach, based on a set of machine learning algorithms, for measurement of elicited speech. The algorithms are trained on existing manually labeled data to detect and locate linguistically relevant acoustic properties with high accuracy. Our approach is robust, is designed to handle mis-productions, and overall matches the performance of expert coders. It allows us to analyze a very large dataset of speech errors (containing far more errors than the total in the existing literature), illuminating properties of speech sound distributions previously impossible to reliably observe. We argue that this provides novel evidence that two sources both contribute to deviations in speech errors: planning processes specifying the targets of articulation and articulatory processes specifying the motor movements that execute this plan. These findings illustrate how a much richer picture of speech provides an opportunity to gain novel insights into language processing.",Speech production; Automatic phonetic analysis; Speech errors; Machine learning; Structured prediction

These studies support the development of early interventions that reduce treatment delay and promote recovery. However, the enduring impact of DUP is largely unknown, partly due to the paucity of prospective long-term studies. Although the DUP–outcome relationship is commonly assumed to be linear, the threshold effect has not been adequately examined. Objective To explore the relationship between DUP and long-term symptomatic remission. Methods This was a prospective study of a cohort of 153 first-episode psychosis patients in Hong Kong at the 13-year follow-up. The patients were categorized into short (≤30days), medium (31–180days) and long (>180days) DUP groups. Results The long-term outcome was ascertained in 73% of the patients. Nearly half of the patients (47%) fulfilled the criteria for symptomatic remission. The short DUP group experienced a significantly higher remission rate over the course of the illness. The odds of long-term symptomatic remission was significantly reduced in the medium DUP (by 89%) and long DUP (by 85%) groups compared with the short DUP group. Further analysis showed that DUP had a specific impact on negative symptom remission. Conclusion The findings support the threshold theory that DUP longer than 30days adversely impacts the long-term outcome.

Despite the role of children’s receptive skills as a foundation for later productive word use, receptive language skills have received surprisingly little attention.

For this purpose, 65 French-speaking children have been tested at 16, 22, 29 and 36 months. The results of the current study suggest that up to the age of two, although parent reports of lexical comprehension and/or production account for a portion of variance in later receptive, productive or general language outcome, they have less predictive validity than a direct measure of early lexical comprehension.

Design Forty-seven students aged between 6 and 13 years participated in the study; all presented with profound or severe prelingual bilateral deafness, and all used digital hearing aids or cochlear implants. Students’ text comprehension skills, decoding skills and oral comprehension skills (both lexical and grammatical) were evaluated. Results Logistic regression analysis indicated that neither the type of assistive technology, age at time of fitting or activation, socioeconomic status, nor school stage could predict the presence or absence of difficulties in text comprehension. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis indicated that neither decoding skills, nor lexical age could predict competency in text comprehension; however, grammatical age could explain 41% of the variance. Probing deeper into the effect of grammatical understanding, logistic regression analysis indicated that a participant’s understanding of reversible passive object-verb-subject sentences and reversible predicative subject-verb-object sentences accounted for 38% of the variance in text comprehension.

Negative attitudes held by persons of authority like teachers can lead to social, economic and educational obstacles in the lives of PWS. Method The current study used an Arabic translation of an adapted version of the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes-Stuttering (POSHA-S) to explore Arab teachers’ knowledge and attitudes toward stuttering as well as strategies they adopt to cope with the problem in class. The participants were 262 in-service and 209 pre-service public school teachers in Kuwait. The results are contrasted to those of Arab parents in Kuwait reported earlier. Results Although many of the teachers knew a person who stutters well and were sensitive in their interactions with PWS, major findings of this study suggest that many were misinformed about the causes of stuttering and held stereotypical views about PWS, comparable to those reported in the literature. Very few differences were noted between opinions of teachers who were still in training and those who were practicing for an average of 11 years.

The quantitative data from the questionnaire was analysed using SPSS and the interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed qualitatively. The findings suggest that the students endorsed a number of language learning goals, such as knowledge orientation, international orientation and instrumental orientation. The role of parental encouragement, peer group pressure and language learning anxiety was limited. Although the questionnaire pointed to moderate levels of self-constructs, this was different for motivated learners who reported positive self-evaluations.

Bataille and R. Gil and F. {Du Boisgueheneuc},2017,Operating environment for awake brain surgery – Choice of tests,article,Neurochirurgie,ScienceDirect,"Introduction The indication for awake brain surgery depends on a prerequisite, i.e. recognition that the brain area concerned is truly eloquent, and identification of one or more functions that must be preserved. These functions are determined preoperatively in collaboration with the patient, and neuropsychological tests considered to be the most relevant are performed in the operating room according to each team's technical preferences. Operating environment The neurosurgeon must choose transfer equipment considered to be relevant. Although a minimal technological environment is an option, a surgical team with great human wealth is essential, composed of specialized personnel with complementary skills. Choice and implementation of intraoperative tests The choice of intraoperative tests, which can be relatively simple for certain primary functions, can be much more difficult for high-level cognitive functions. No consensus has been reached concerning these tests, which must therefore be selected on an individual basis. Intraoperative testing must be based on preoperative multidisciplinary decisions made jointly by the neurosurgeon, neurologist, speech therapist and neuropsychologist. Conclusions Numerous operating tools and technology transfers are available for neurosurgical teams performing awake brain surgery but none – or very few – of them constitutes a mandatory prerequisite. In contrast, the transition from the concept of eloquent brain area to that of brain functions that must be preserved requires highly skilled multidisciplinary human resources. This goal will be more likely achieved in centers highly specialized in functional oncological neurosurgery.",Functional brain surgery; Operating room; Technology transfer; Awake brain surgery; Intraoperative testing

Typically, patients with frontal lesions caused by stroke or tumours have been grouped together to obtain sufficient power. However, it has been debated whether it is methodologically appropriate to group together patients with neurological lesions of different aetiologies. Despite this debate, very few studies have directly compared the performance of patients with different neurological aetiologies on neuropsychological measures. The few that did included patients with both anterior and posterior lesions. We present the first comprehensive retrospective comparison of the impact of lesions of different aetiologies on neuropsychological performance in a large number of patients whose lesion solely affects the frontal cortex. We investigated patients who had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), high (HGT) or low grade (LGT) tumour, or meningioma, all at the post-operative stage. The same frontal ‘executive’ (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, Stroop Colour-Word Test, Letter Fluency-S; Trail Making Test Part B) and nominal (Graded Naming Test) tasks were compared. Patients' performance was compared across aetiologies controlling for age and NART IQ scores. Assessments of focal frontal lesion location, lesion volume, global brain atrophy and non-specific white matter (WM) changes were undertaken and compared across the four aetiology. We found no significant difference in performance between the four aetiology subgroups on the ‘frontal’ executive and nominal tasks. However, we found strong effects of premorbid IQ on all cognitive tasks and robust effects of age only on the frontal tasks. We also compared specific aetiology subgroups directly, as previously reported in the literature. Overall we found no significant differences in the performance of CVA and tumour patients, or LGT and HGT patients or LGT, HGT and meningioma's on our four frontal tests. No difference was found with respect to the location of frontal lesions, lesion volume, global brain atrophy and non-specific WM changes between the subgroups. Our results suggest that the grouping of frontal patients caused by different aetiologies is a pragmatic, justified methodological approach that can help to further understanding of the organisation of frontal executive functions.",Executive functions; Frontal lesions; Aetiology; Cognitive performance; Stroke; Tumour

Moreover, with structural equation modeling we observed that the development of lexical competence in children with hearing loss is stable over time, and a child's lexical competence can be explained best by his or her lexical competence assessed on a previous measurement occasion. If you look back, differences in lexical competence among children with hearing loss stay unfortunately the same. Educational placement, use of sign language at home, intelligence, use of hearing devices, and onset of deafness can account for the differences among children with hearing loss.",Hearing status; Hearing loss; Reading vocabulary; Vocabulary development; Developmental rates; Child variables; Family variables; Educational variables

However, songbirds demonstrate behavioral features resembling human speech learning. Two circuits have a preeminent role in this human behavior; namely, the corticostriatal and the cerebrocerebellar motor loops. While the striatal contribution can be traced back to the avian anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), the sensorimotor adaptation functions of the cerebellum appear to be human specific in acoustic communication. This review contributes to an ongoing discussion on how birdsong translates into human speech. While earlier approaches were focused on higher linguistic functions, we place the motor aspects of speaking at center stage.

However, the fractionation of the central executive among the elderly has been less well explored, and Miyake’s et al. latent structure has not yet been integrated with other models that propose additional components, such as access to long-term information. Here we administered a battery of classic and newer neuropsychological tests of executive functions to 122 healthy individuals aged between 48 and 91years. The test scores were subjected to a latent variable analysis (LISREL), and yielded four factors. The factor structure obtained was broadly consistent with Miyake et al.’s three-factor model. However, an additional factor, which was labeled ‘efficiency of access to long-term memory’, and a mediator factor (‘speed of processing’) were apparent in our structural equation analysis. Furthermore, the best model that described executive functioning in our sample of healthy elderly adults included a two-factor solution, thus indicating a possible mechanism of dedifferentiation, which involves larger correlations and interdependence of latent variables as a consequence of cognitive ageing.

Critically, the imaging results showed that visual familiarity, as opposed to lexical frequency, had a strong effect on activation in ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Activation here was also greater for Kanji than Hiragana words and this was not due to their inherent differences in visual complexity.

These two lexical categories also differ in their phonological makeup (functors being shorter and more minimal) and frequency of occurrence (individual functors being much more frequent than most content words). The frequency-based discrimination of the two categories could constitute a powerful mechanism for infants to acquire the basic building blocks of language. As functors constitute closed classes and content words come in open classes, we examined whether 8-month-old monolingual infants relied on word frequency to categorize and track functors and content words. In six artificial grammar-learning experiments, we have found that infants process frequent words as belonging to closed classes, and infrequent words as belonging to open classes, and they map the relative order of these categories following the basic word order of their native language. These findings provide the earliest evidence that infants use word frequency as a cue to lexical categories and combine them to build rudimentary representations of grammar.",word frequency; function words; content words; infants; lexical categorization; word order; acquisition of grammar; headturn preference; open-class/closed-class distinction

The aim of the experiments is to carry out an in-depth exploration of morphological processing in children with Ds and TD children. In the first experiment children performed a definition task; in the second children had to provide a plural form for singular words. The results show a significant BF effect in only the first experiment. In the second experiment this morphological variable does not reach significance, but the variable we called Ending phoneme (a phonological variable that refers to the last phoneme of the bases prior to the addition of plural morphemes) does. The results also show that children with Ds score significantly below the two control groups in both experiments, with no significant differences between control groups.

Here, we examined a previously unexplored domain: speech motor learning. We investigated whether speech motor learning in unimpaired participants can be enhanced using a single-session tDCS experiment, and investigated whether the timing of tDCS relative to a behavioral task affected performance. Participants (N = 80) performed a twenty minute learning task with nonwords containing non-native consonant clusters (e.g., GDEEVOO), and were assigned to groups receiving either sham or active tDCS either immediately before or during the task. Both accuracy and properties of errors were examined throughout the course of the practice task, and then practice was compared to a retention period 30 min later (R1) and two days later (R2). For cluster and whole-(non)word accuracy measures, acquisition was observed for all groups during the practice session. Compared to the beginning of practice, the tDCS-Before group showed significantly greater improvement than both the sham group and the tDCS-During group at R1. An effect was also observed for vowel duration in errors (/gdivu/ → [gədivu]), with the tDCS-Before group showing significant shortening of vowel errors throughout practice. Overall, the findings suggest that tDCS can improve speech motor learning, and that the improvement may be greater when tDCS is applied immediately before practice, warranting further exploration of this new domain for tDCS research.",tDCS; Speech; Motor learning; Motor control

Previous research has shown that associations predicted behavior independent of explicit measures. In this study, it was investigated whether math–anxiety associations would be related to math anxiety and whether they predicted math behavior as well as state math anxiety independent of explicitly measured math anxiety. In addition, the domain specificity of math–anxiety associations for predicting math behavior was investigated. Adolescents’ anxiety associations and self-reported anxiety were assessed for three domains: math anxiety, foreign language (English) anxiety, and trait anxiety. A sample of 189 secondary school students performed three single-target implicit association tests, performed a math problem solving task, and filled out questionnaires. Overall, adolescents showed stronger math–anxiety associations in comparison with math–calmness associations. In contrast to our hypotheses, math–anxiety associations were not related and did not uniquely or specifically predict math behavior and state math anxiety. Explicit anxiety measures demonstrated specificity in predicting math and English grades as well as state math anxiety. The innovative aspects of this study are the investigation of implicitly measured math–anxiety associations and the relation to math anxiety and math behavior. Further research is needed to develop tasks that are better able to capture the most relevant math–threat associations and to investigate which math behavior might be most strongly influenced by these associations.",Math anxiety; Implicit association test; Math behavior; Math performance; School; Adolescents

Methods Healthy participants were required to complete a verbal working memory task while receiving tACS bilaterally over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) versus sham DLPFC stimulation. After completion of the online and post-stimulation working memory tasks, participants were asked to rate the level of success-confidence on the two preceding working memory tasks. Results As expected, online working memory accuracy was improved in the active bilateral DLPFC condition versus sham stimulation. Importantly, this working memory enhancement was related to post-stimulation self-evaluation scores. Conclusions Theoretically, our findings indicated that cognitive-control representations (e.g., working memory accuracy) could serve as the optimal frame of reference for later retrospective metacognitive judgments.

Evidence from Parkinson's disease,article,Neuropsychologia,ScienceDirect,"Parkinson's disease (PD), which involves basal ganglia degeneration, affects language as well as motor function. However, which aspects of language are impaired in PD and under what circumstances remains unclear. We examined whether lexical and grammatical aspects of language are differentially affected in PD, and whether this dissociation is moderated by sex as well as the degree of basal ganglia degeneration. Our predictions were based on the declarative/procedural model of language. The model posits that grammatical composition, including in regular inflection, depends importantly on left basal ganglia procedural memory circuits, whereas irregular and other lexicalized forms are memorized in declarative memory. Since females tend to show declarative memory advantages as compared to males, the model further posits that females should tend to rely on this system for regulars, which can be stored as lexicalized chunks. We tested non-demented male and female PD patients and healthy control participants on the intensively studied paradigm of English regular and irregular past-tense production. Mixed-effects regression revealed PD deficits only at regular inflection, only in male patients. The degree of left basal ganglia degeneration, as reflected by right-side hypokinesia, predicted only regular inflection, and only in male patients. Left-side hypokinesia did not show this pattern. Past-tense frequency effects suggested that the female patients retrieved regular as well as irregular past-tense forms from declarative memory, whereas the males retrieved only irregulars. Sensitivity analyses showed that the pattern of findings was robust. The results, which are consistent with the declarative/procedural model, suggest a grammatical deficit in PD due to left basal ganglia degeneration, with a relative sparing of lexical retrieval. Female patients appear to compensate for this deficit by relying on chunks stored in declarative memory. More generally, the study elucidates the neurocognition of inflectional morphology and provides evidence that sex can influence how language is computed in the mind and brain.",Regular and irregular inflectional morphology; Parkinson's disease; Sex differences; Compensation; Hypokinesia; Basal ganglia

While much previous research has shown that entry into tracks is socially selective, less is known whether there are effects of being exposed to a particular school track on educational success and which mechanisms are contributing to these effects. We investigate this question by comparing the learning progress in reading and mathematics of students in the upper and intermediate schooling track over five years of secondary schooling, based on large-scale German-wide longitudinal data (NEPS-SC3). Even when restricting our sample to a group of students with similar preconditions and controlling for skills at the beginning of secondary schooling, we find that the learning progress in the upper track is higher for both domains, suggesting scissor effects of track exposure. It is mainly the average performance level of the class, and to a lesser degree its social background composition, which mediates these effects. In contrast, migration background composition of the class and instructional quality perceived by students hardly contribute to explaining increasing learning gains in the upper track.",Tracking; Learning progress; German secondary education; Learning environment; Social stratification

Previous research has suggested that stuttering attitudes of respondents from North America and Europe (i.e., “The West”), though characterized by stereotypes and potential stigma, are more positive than those from several other regions of the world. This inference assumes that public attitudes within various regions characterized by “The West” are similar. Purpose This study aimed to determine the extent to which public stuttering attitudes are similar or different both within regions of three different European countries and between or among five different European countries or similar geographic areas. It also aimed to compare these European attitudes to attitudes from 135 samples around the world using a standard measure. Material and methods Using convenience sampling, 1111 adult respondents from eight different investigations completed the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes-Stuttering (POSHA-S) in the dominant language of each country or area. In Study I, the authors compared attitudes within three different regions of Bosnia & Herzegovina, Italy, and Norway. In Study II, the authors compared attitudes between combined samples from Bosnia & Herzegovina, Italy, and Norway (with additional respondents from Sweden), and two other samples, one from Germany and the other from Ireland and England. Results Attitudes of adults from the three samples within Bosnia & Herzegovina, Italy, and Norway were remarkably similar. By contrast, attitudes between the five different countries or area were quite dramatically different. Demographic variables on the POSHA-S did not predict the rank order of these between-country/area differences. Compared to the POSHA-S worldwide database, European attitudes ranged from less positive than average (i.e., Italians) to more positive than average (i.e., Norwegians and Swedes).

Thirteen CWS and 13 CWNS divided into two age groups (younger, 8–12 years; n = 6, older, 13–15 years, n = 7) repeated nonwords varying in phonological properties over two sessions separated by an hour. Participants in both groups also completed several baseline measures, including tests of digit span and nonword repetition (NRT). A marginal trend for lower speech accuracy was noted in the CWS compared to the CWNS in the NWR task. The younger CWS also performed poorly compared to the older CWS and age-matched CWNS in the NRT. Findings provided weak support for limitations in initial encoding and subsequent retrieval of phonemic information. The CWS demonstrated significantly reduced inter-articulatory coordination for the 3-syllable nonwords. While both groups demonstrated significantly slower movements with increase in nonword complexity at the 3-syllable level, such differences were enhanced in the CWS group and influenced further by participant age. Additionally, digit span influenced movement coordination in both groups with only the CWNS showing a significant negative correlation between the digit span scores and movement variability at the onset of practice in Session 1.

Language is one of the areas that may be affected. Early lexical development measurements have revealed possible delays associated with low gestational age, but no studies have analyzed lexical processing using real-time measures in this at-risk population. Aims To explore the effects of preterm birth on the robustness of phonological representations and lexical processing speed. Subjects and methods Eighteen two-year-old VLBW healthy preterms (≤32weeks of gestation; ≤1500g) and a matched group of at term infants, equivalent in age, gender, SES, linguistic environment and expressive lexicon were compared in a ‘looking-while-listening’ task, using correctly pronounced and mispronounced known words involving a vowel change. Percentage of target fixation, longest look duration, shift rate and orientation latency measures were used to analyze possible between-group differences in phonological representation and familiar word recognition processes. Results Based on the percentage of fixation time measure both groups succeeded at word recognition and responded similarly to mispronunciations. However, preterms significantly differed from full‐terms in processing speed measures, showing longer look duration, lower shift rate and slower orientation latencies to target from distracter. Conclusions Preterm birth negatively affects lexical processing speed. Birth weight and gestational age are two critical variables in these results. Slower language processing in preterms can compromise the acquisition of more complex lexical and grammatical representations later in development and may underlie poor language outcomes frequently observed in children born very prematurely.",Preterm; Very-low-birth-weight; Word recognition; Phonological representation; Vowel mispronunciation; Processing speed

We consider two contexts where Norwegian displays variable word order, viz. subject placement in main and embedded clauses, and the variable word order found inside the DP in possessive constructions. We identify the conditions under which each word order is chosen in the target language, both with respect to syntax and information structure, and investigate the frequency of the different orders in child-directed speech. In both cases it is shown that the children have both word orders in place from the onset of production of relevant utterances and that they are sensitive to the distinctions between the two from early on. Nevertheless, in their earliest production, the children seem to have a preference for the word order that is the least frequent one in the input. These findings indicate that frequency by itself is not sufficient to explain children's preferences in early production. Instead, the findings in the child data are accounted for in terms of an economy principle of movement that is argued to be operative in early child language.",Subject positions; Possessives; Norwegian; Word order; Input frequency; Economy

A preliminary investigation using the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale,article,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,ScienceDirect,"Anxiety difficulties and disorders are common in children and youth people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but only a few studies have specifically examined informant agreement in non-referred samples. The present study examined informant agreement between 38 Singaporean caregiver–child dyads using the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale Parent Version (SCAS-P) and the SCAS Child self-report (SCAS-C) respectively. The young people with ASD (mean age 12 years 10 months) completed the SCAS-C, while their caregivers completed the SCAS-P, the Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised and the Developmental Behavior Checklist. There was overall moderately good agreement between caregivers and children's reporting of anxiety symptoms. Intra-class correlations were highest in the Separation Anxiety, Generalized Anxiety and Physical Injury subscales. Fourteen of the 38 SCAS items, most of which described overt anxiety symptoms, showed strong or moderate inter-rater agreement. Higher severity of autism symptoms was associated with poorer agreement in the Generalized Anxiety, Panic and Obsessions/Compulsions SCAS subscales. These preliminary findings suggest that the SCAS may be a useful measure for reporting anxiety symptoms in terms of satisfactory agreement between caregivers and young people in non-referred settings.

The present study explored this question in relation to stuttering, and examined whether dual task conditions that engaged sustained attention or working memory (WM) affected speech fluency in different ways. We also considered whether fluency changes were associated with changes in speech rate and language. Methods : Nineteen adults who stutter (AWS) and 20 controls produced spontaneous speech under a baseline condition and two dual task conditions: one involving a sustained attention task, the other involving WM demands. Results : Both groups produced fewer stutter-like disfluencies under dual task relative to baseline conditions and this reduction did not differ between the two dual tasks (attention vs. WM). Speech rate and language variables, which were potentially influenced by attention conditions, were not affected by dual tasks in the same way as disfluencies, and appeared to be unassociated with fluency results. Conclusions : Findings indicate that atypical disfluencies decrease when attention is divided, even when secondary task demands are minimal, as they were in the sustained attention task. For simple secondary tasks, fluency changes do not appear to be a byproduct of slowed rate and are not accompanied by observable changes in language. These results demonstrate that simple manipulations of attention can induce measurable effects on aspects of speech production, and may be a useful tool for facilitating fluency in clinical intervention.",attention; dual task; fluency; stuttering; working memory

To reveal these features comparison was made with an age and gender related child with a similar palatal or hearing problem. Methods Language was tested with an age appropriate language test namely the Dutch version of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals. Regarding articulation a phonetic inventory, phonetic analysis and phonological process analysis was performed. A nominal scale with four categories was used to judge the overall speech intelligibility. A voice and resonance assessment included a videolaryngostroboscopy, a perceptual evaluation, acoustic analysis and nasometry. Results The most striking communication problems in this child were expressive and receptive language delay, moderately impaired speech intelligibility, the presence of phonetic and phonological disorders, resonance disorders and a high-pitched voice. The explanation for this pattern of communication is not completely straightforward. The language and the phonological impairment, only present in the child with the Nager syndrome, are not part of a more general developmental delay. The resonance disorders can be related to the cleft palate, but were not present in the child with the isolated cleft palate. One might assume that the cul-de-sac resonance and the much decreased mandibular movement and the restricted tongue lifting are caused by the restricted jaw mobility and micrognathia. To what extent the suggested mandibular distraction osteogenesis in early childhood allows increased mandibular movement and better speech outcome with increased oral resonance is subject for further research. Conclusion According to the results of this study the speech and language management must be focused on receptive and expressive language skills and linguistic conceptualization, correct phonetic placement and the modification of hypernasality and nasal emission.",Nager syndrome; Acrofacial dysostosis; Speech; Articulation; Language; Mandibular ditraction osteogenesis

The role of frequency and (morphological) regularity of verbs in agrammatism is also explored. For these investigations a sentence completion task was developed. Overall, Aspect was found significantly more impaired than Tense, and Tense significantly more impaired than Agreement. No dissociation was observed between past and future Tense, or between perfective and imperfective Aspect, for any of the two agrammatic participants. No verb regularity effect was detected and only a verb frequency effect in the Tense condition was observed for one of the participants. It is suggested that the two agrammatic participants have a morphosyntactic deficit, while one of them has an additional lexical deficit. Moreover, it is argued that the increased processing demands of Tense and Aspect, which carry interpretable features, render them more vulnerable compared to Agreement, which bears an uninterpretable feature and is a local, strictly grammatical operation. The significantly worse performance of the two agrammatic participants on Aspect than on Tense is attributed to the more “subjective” nature of the former category.",Agrammatism; Tense; Agreement; Aspect; Interpretability; Greek

Underspecification theory says that the phonemes that have unmarked feature values are even more abstract in that the feature is omitted from the representation altogether. This makes phoneme representations in words more sparse than the fully specified phonetic representations of the same words. Eulitz and Lahiri (2004) demonstrated that this theory predicts certain asymmetries in the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) response to phoneme contrasts. We expand on this research by demonstrating underspecification-driven asymmetry in the brain response to laryngeal feature contrasts in English (i.e. what makes /d/ and /t/ different). We add a new test by showing that the asymmetry disappears if the MMN paradigm is modified to encourage the formation of phonetic memory traces instead of phonemic memory traces.

The SVR model strongly influences current education practices, although its validity is still questioned. This review identified 56 studies on the three components of the SVR model in English-speaking children attending elementary school. A meta-analysis on these data showed that decoding and linguistic comprehension are moderately correlated, and that both decoding and linguistic comprehension are highly correlated with reading comprehension. Decoding and linguistic comprehension explain 50% of the variance of reading comprehension, and measurement error explains an additional 22%. Further research is needed to identify other variables that could predict reading comprehension after controlling for decoding and linguistic comprehension. Word reading accuracy was the assessment approach to decoding that best relates to reading comprehension. Various approaches to the assessment of linguistic comprehension produced similar results. In conclusion, reading comprehension is a more complex phenomenon than that described by the SVR model. However, decoding and linguistic comprehension, two variables that are simple to evaluate, provide a good approximation to reading comprehension measures for children in elementary school. Resumen La Concepción Simple de la Lectura (CSL) es un modelo que trata de explicar la comprensión lectora a partir de dos factores: la descodificación y la comprensión general del lenguaje. La CSL está teniendo una notable influencia en la práctica educativa aunque su validez aún se pone en duda. En esta revisión se identificaron cincuenta y seis investigaciones en las que se incluían los tres componentes de la CSL en alumnos de Educación Primaria hablantes de inglés. En el metanálisis de los datos obtenidos se encontró que había una correlación moderada entre descodificación y comprensión del lenguaje, y que ambas variables tenían una correlación alta con la comprensión lectora. La descodificación y la comprensión del lenguaje explicaban un 50% de la varianza de la comprensión lectora, y el error de medida explicaba un 22% adicional. Es necesaria más investigación sobre otras variables que puedan predecir la comprensión lectora tras controlar el efecto de la descodificación y la comprensión del lenguaje. La precisión en la lectura de palabras era la forma de evaluación de la descodificación que más se relacionaba con la comprensión lectora. Las distintas formas de medir la comprensión del lenguaje produjeron resultados similares. Se concluye que la comprensión lectora es un fenómeno más complejo que lo que se describe en la CSL. Sin embargo, la descodificación y la comprensión del lenguaje, que son variables fáciles de medir, permiten un buen acercamiento a la comprensión lectora de los alumnos de Educación Primaria.",Decoding; Language comprehension; Meta-analysis; Reading comprehension; Simple view of reading; Descodificación; Comprensión del lenguaje; Metanálisis; Comprensión lectora; Concepción simple de la lectura

Evans,2017,Imaging structural covariance in the development of intelligence,article,NeuroImage,ScienceDirect,"Verbal and non-verbal intelligence in children is highly correlated, and thus, it has been difficult to differentiate their neural substrates. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that verbal and non-verbal intelligence can be dissociated and focal cortical regions corresponding to each have been demonstrated. However, the pattern of structural covariance corresponding to verbal and non-verbal intelligence remains unexplored. In this study, we used 586 longitudinal anatomical MRI scans of subjects aged 6–18 years, who had concurrent intelligence quotient (IQ) testing on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. Structural covariance networks (SCNs) were constructed using interregional correlations in cortical thickness for low-IQ (Performance IQ=100±8, Verbal IQ=100±7) and high-IQ (PIQ=121±8, VIQ=120±9) groups. From low- to high-VIQ group, we observed constrained patterns of anatomical coupling among cortical regions, complemented by observations of higher global efficiency and modularity, and lower local efficiency in high-VIQ group, suggesting a shift towards a more optimal topological organization. Analysis of nodal topological properties (regional efficiency and participation coefficient) revealed greater involvement of left-hemispheric language related regions including inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri for high-VIQ group. From low- to high-PIQ group, we did not observe significant differences in anatomical coupling patterns, global and nodal topological properties. Our findings indicate that people with higher verbal intelligence have structural brain differences from people with lower verbal intelligence – not only in localized cortical regions, but also in the patterns of anatomical coupling among widely distributed cortical regions, possibly resulting to a system-level reorganization that might lead to a more efficient organization in high-VIQ group.",Verbal and performance intelligence; Cortical thickness; Structural covariance network; Neuroimaging; Cognitive development

Assessments of the support needs of children must account for the influence of age. Method: Four hundred fifty (450) Spanish children with intellectual disability (ages 5-16) were assessed with the SIS-C Spanish. To test for measurement invariance and latent differences, the SIS-C Spanish standardization sample was linked to the SIS-C English normative sample. Models developed during the norming process were used to investigate measurement equivalence across age groups, differences in latent means, and differences in latent variances and standard deviations. Results: Findings suggested that all items on the SIS-C Spanish could reliably be used to measure support needs of children ages 5-16. When exploring age-related differences at the latent level, however, data showed latent mean differences in support need domain scores across age cohorts. Conclusions: The same set of items can be used to measure support needs in children ages 5-16, but age-related influences must be considered in developing norms for the SIS-C Spanish as well as in planning supports for children.

Video recordings of teacher–child interactions during reading of a narrative text were transcribed and analyzed for the timing, content, and form of utterances. Results of latent profile analysis revealed three distinct teacher profiles of talk during book reading that we termed: Moderate Comprehenders (MC, 68% of sample), Discuss & Reflect Comprehenders (DRC, 19%), and Preview & Discuss Comprehenders (PDC, 12%). These profiles differed most in the timing (e.g., before versus after reading for PDC and DRC, respectively) and content of talk (e.g., low- versus high-cognitive demand topics for MC vs. PDC/DRC). The less common DRC and PDC teacher profiles were associated with higher amounts of child talk and more elaborate child utterances within the reading session.

It is thought growth factors may mediate this putative relationship, particularly by augmenting plasticity mechanisms in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for learning and memory. Among these factors, glucocorticoids, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hormones that have considerable and diverse physiological importance, are thought to effect normal and exercise-induced hippocampal plasticity. Despite these predictions, relatively few published human studies have tested hypotheses that relate exercise and fitness to the hippocampus, and none have considered the potential links to all of these hormonal components. Here we present cross-sectional data from a study of recognition memory; serum BDNF, cortisol, IGF-1, and VEGF levels; and aerobic capacity in healthy young adults. We measured circulating levels of these hormones together with performance on a recognition memory task, and a standard graded treadmill test of aerobic fitness. Regression analyses demonstrated BDNF and aerobic fitness predict recognition memory in an interactive manner. In addition, IGF-1 was positively associated with aerobic fitness, but not with recognition memory.

These complementary measures are derived from keystroke logging data, which were collected from an experiment among 68 students who wrote two descriptive texts, one in their mother tongue and the other in their second language. By using correlation and principal component analyses, we have reduced the set of variables and created a new multidimensional model to better address the complexity of fluency in writing. This model consists of four dimensions: (a) production, (b) process variation, (c) revision, and (d) pause behavior.

Predictive validity of the proposed remission definition was under-studied. Relationship of remission with subjective quality of life (QoL) was inadequately addressed with inconsistent findings being observed. Method One hundred and four Hong Kong Chinese aged 18 to 55years presenting with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder were studied. Socio-demographics, baseline clinical and functioning profiles were obtained. Psychopathological and functional reassessments were conducted at 6, 12 and 24months. Subjective QoL was measured at 12 and 24months. Symptomatic remission was operationally defined according to the consensus criteria developed by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group (RSWG), comprising both symptom-severity and 6-month duration components. Results At 12months, 59.6% of patients achieved symptomatic remission. Remitted patients had significantly lower symptom severity, more favorable psychosocial functioning and better subjective QoL at 12months than non-remitted counterparts. Attainment of remission at 12months was significantly associated with fewer positive, negative, depressive and disorganization symptoms, higher levels of functioning and subjective QoL at 24months. Linear regression analysis indicated that remission status independently predicted functional outcome even when the effects of educational level, baseline functioning and negative symptom scores were controlled for. Conclusion The operationally defined symptomatic remission formulated by the RSWG represented a clinically valid construct that was found to be closely related to both concurrent and longitudinal outcomes on psychopathology, functioning and subjective QoL in the early stage of schizophrenia.",Symptomatic remission; Predictive validity; First-episode schizophrenia; Functional outcome; Quality of life

Wang,2017,Neural bases of congenital amusia in tonal language speakers,article,Neuropsychologia,ScienceDirect,"Congenital amusia is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder of fine-grained pitch processing. In this fMRI study, we examined the neural bases of congenial amusia in speakers of a tonal language – Cantonese. Previous studies on non-tonal language speakers suggest that the neural deficits of congenital amusia lie in the music-selective neural circuitry in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, it is unclear whether this finding can generalize to congenital amusics in tonal languages. Tonal language experience has been reported to shape the neural processing of pitch, which raises the question of how tonal language experience affects the neural bases of congenital amusia. To investigate this question, we examined the neural circuitries sub-serving the processing of relative pitch interval in pitch-matched Cantonese level tone and musical stimuli in 11 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 11 musically intact controls. Cantonese-speaking amusics exhibited abnormal brain activities in a widely distributed neural network during the processing of lexical tone and musical stimuli. Whereas the controls exhibited significant activation in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the lexical tone condition and in the cerebellum regardless of the lexical tone and music conditions, no activation was found in the amusics in those regions, which likely reflects a dysfunctional neural mechanism of relative pitch processing in the amusics. Furthermore, the amusics showed abnormally strong activation of the right middle frontal gyrus and precuneus when the pitch stimuli were repeated, which presumably reflect deficits of attending to repeated pitch stimuli or encoding them into working memory. No significant group difference was found in the right IFG in either the whole-brain analysis or region-of-interest analysis. These findings imply that the neural deficits in tonal language speakers might differ from those in non-tonal language speakers, and overlap partly with the neural circuitries of lexical tone processing (e.g. right STG).",Neural bases; Congenital amusia; Lexical tone; Music; Cantonese; fMRI

In some of these studies, rTMS was also combined with speech therapy. Results In total, seven meta-analyses and 59studies (23randomized clinical trials) were included in this systematic review. The methods used in these studies were heterogeneous. Only six studies did not find that rTMS had a significant effect on language performance. Conclusions The evidence from the peer-reviewed literature suggests that rTMS is an effective tool in post-stroke aphasia rehabilitation. However, the precise mechanisms that underlie the effects of rTMS and the reorganization of language networks in patients who have had a stroke remain unclear.

Within non-generativist approaches to language acquisition, children's language acquisition is often viewed an emergent response to a highly patterned linguistic environment, at least some of which is tailored by caregivers to children's cognitive and social needs. Some cross-cultural research, however, has disputed whether caregivers modify speech to children in all cultures, and whether or to what extent special infant- or child-directed speech is necessary for successful language acquisition. In this paper we present new cross-linguistic and cross-cultural data on baby talk or janyarrp among Gurindji people. Using a corpus of naturalistic family interactions and interviews with Gurindji people of northern Australia we describe the phonological modifications and specific lexicon of baby talk and investigate its possible functions. Several phonological reductions were found which are familiar from baby talk and child speech in other languages, including rhotic replacement and cluster reduction. More unusually, baby talk neutralizes the three-way coronal contrast in Gurindji Kriol, the language which Gurindji children learn at home. The functions of baby talk for Gurindji people likewise seem to comprise familiar baby talk functions like holding attention as well as less familiar functions, such facilitating children's imitations in production.",Child-directed speech; Infant-directed speech; Language development; Baby talk; Phonology; Australian languages

In addition to this, however, there was a context effect in the sensorimotor region as well as a BOI effect in the parietal region (involved in object representation).

Here, we tested the hypothesis that this decrease in stuttering frequency may be because speech of the normal speaker dictates the speech rhythm of a person who stutters. We used an automated, sensitive acoustic technique—Envelope Modulation Spectral (EMS) analysis— that allowed us to document speech rhythm. Method Seventeen adults who stutter (AWS) read sentences under two conditions: solo reading and choral reading. Percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS), the rate of speech, and speech rhythm were calculated from the recorded sentences from AWS. Further, AWS speech rhythm during solo reading was compared with typical adults. EMS was extracted for the full signal and seven-octave bands. From the extracted envelope six predictor variables (peak frequency, peak amplitude, energy in the spectrum 3–6 Hz, energy in the spectrum from 0 to 4 Hz, energy in the spectrum from 4 to 10 Hz, and the ratio of energy below4 Hz/above 4 Hz) were computed. Results Significant decrease in stuttering frequency and rate of speech was noticed in choral reading when compared to the solo reading condition. Further, analysis of EMS results suggested the statistically significant difference between two reading conditions (for peak frequency and peak amplitude), and between two groups for all predictor variables. Conclusion Overall, current results highlight that decreases in stuttering during the choral reading is characterized by a decrease in rate and changes in some aspects of speech rhythm in Kannada speaking AWS.",Stuttering; Speech rhythm; Choral reading; Adults who stutter; Envelope modulation spectrum

It is therefore important to better understand how age-related differences in neurostructural factors such as cortical thickness (CT) and cortical surface area (CSA) are related to neurophysiological sensitivity to speech cues in younger and older adults. Age-related differences in CT and CSA of bilateral auditory-related areas were extracted using FreeSurfer in younger and older adults with normal peripheral hearing. Behavioral and neurophysiological sensitivity to prosodic speech cues (word stress and fundamental frequency of oscillation) was evaluated using discrimination tasks and a passive oddball paradigm, while EEG was recorded, to quantify mismatch negativity responses. Results revealed (a) higher neural sensitivity (i.e., larger mismatch negativity responses) to word stress in older adults compared to younger adults, suggesting a higher importance of prosodic speech cues in the speech processing of older adults, and (b) lower CT in auditory-related regions in older compared to younger individuals, suggesting neuronal loss associated with aging. Within the older age group, less neuronal loss (i.e., higher CT) in a right auditory-related area (i.e., the supratemporal sulcus) was related to better performance in fundamental frequency discrimination, while higher CSA in left auditory-related areas was associated with higher neural sensitivity toward prosodic speech cues as evident in the mismatch negativity patterns. Overall, our results offer evidence for neurostructural changes in aging that are associated with differences in the extent to which left and right auditory-related areas are involved in speech processing in older adults. We argue that exploring age-related differences in brain structure and function associated with decline in speech perception in older adults may help develop much needed rehabilitation strategies for older adults with central age-related hearing loss.",Prosody perception; Aging; Central hearing loss; Auditory atrophy; Cortical thickness; Cortical surface area; Mismatch negativity; AST hypothesis; Lateralization; Dedifferentiation

Bidelman,2014,Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain,article,Hearing Research,ScienceDirect,"Age-related decline in hearing abilities is a ubiquitous part of aging, and commonly impacts speech understanding, especially when there are competing sound sources. While such age effects are partially due to changes within the cochlea, difficulties typically exist beyond measurable hearing loss, suggesting that central brain processes, as opposed to simple peripheral mechanisms (e.g., hearing sensitivity), play a critical role in governing hearing abilities late into life. Current training regimens aimed to improve central auditory processing abilities have experienced limited success in promoting listening benefits. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that in young adults, musical training positively modifies neural mechanisms, providing robust, long-lasting improvements to hearing abilities as well as to non-auditory tasks that engage cognitive control. These results offer the encouraging possibility that musical training might be used to counteract age-related changes in auditory cognition commonly observed in older adults. Here, we reviewed studies that have examined the effects of age and musical experience on auditory cognition with an emphasis on auditory scene analysis. We infer that musical training may offer potential benefits to complex listening and might be utilized as a means to delay or even attenuate declines in auditory perception and cognition that often emerge later in life.

While the microstructural properties of the FAT and the right AF did not show age-related differences over the age range we investigated, the left AF evidenced increasing fractional anisotropy with age. Microstructural properties of the AF in both hemispheres, however, predicted receptive and expressive language. Length of the left FAT also predicted receptive language, which provides initial suggestion that this pathway is important for language development.

Recent work in humans suggests that exercise training induces changes in hippocampal volume, but it is not known if aerobic exercise and fitness also impact the entorhinal cortex. In animal models, aerobic exercise increases expression of growth factors, including brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This exercise-enhanced expression of growth hormones may boost synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival and differentiation, potentially supporting function and structure in brain areas including but not limited to the hippocampus. Here, using voxel based morphometry and a standard graded treadmill test to determine cardio-respiratory fitness (Bruce protocol; ·VO2 max), we examined if entorhinal and hippocampal volumes were associated with cardio-respiratory fitness in healthy young adults (N=33). In addition, we examined if volumes were modulated by recognition memory performance and by serum BDNF, a putative marker of synaptic plasticity. Our results show a positive association between volume in right entorhinal cortex and cardio-respiratory fitness. In addition, average gray matter volume in the entorhinal cortex, bilaterally, was positively associated with memory performance.

In previous studies, the N1 component of the ERP was shown to reflect print tuning but also to be sensitive to lexical effects. It remains unclear, however, whether these two aspects of orthographic processing occur at the same time or in different time windows during the lengthy N1 component. Moreover, it is unclear whether these processes develop late or occur already at early stages of literacy acquisition and whether this is similar for native languages and languages acquired later in life. To address these questions, 27 children were tested longitudinally, i.e. before (mean: 7.6 years) and after one year of classroom-based English instruction. Additionally, 22 adult speakers of English as a foreign language (mean: 25.1 years) were investigated. A 128-channel EEG was recorded while participants performed a one-back task with native German words, English words, pseudowords and false-font strings. The event-related EEG analysis of early and late N1 phases revealed early effects related to print tuning and late effects related to lexical processing in the native, but not in the second language of adult readers. In the absence of lexicality effects in children, print tuning effects were found across both early and late N1 segments.

Sixteen adults and 23 children completed two fMRI runs of an auditory lexical-semantic decision task with a button-press response, using reverse speech as control condition. Children and adults showed similar activation in bilateral temporal and left inferior frontal regions. Greater activation in adults than in children was seen in left inferior parietal, premotor, and inferior frontal regions, and in bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA). Specifically for semantically incongruous sentences, adults also showed greater activation than children in left inferior frontal cortex, possibly related to enhanced ‘top-down’ control. Age-dependent activation increases in motor-related regions were shown to be unrelated to overt motor responses, but could be associated with covert speech accompanying semantic decision.

The current study evaluated the development of neural systems for selective attention in children from lower SES backgrounds. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were acquired from 33 children from lower SES and 14 children from higher SES backgrounds during a dichotic listening task. The lower SES group was followed longitudinally for one year. At age four, the higher SES group exhibited a significant attention effect (larger ERP response to attended compared to unattended condition), an effect not observed in the lower SES group. At age five, the lower SES group exhibited a significant attention effect comparable in overall magnitude to that observed in the 4-year-old higher SES group, but with poorer distractor suppression (larger response to the unattended condition). Together, these findings suggest both a maturational delay and divergent developmental pattern in neural mechanisms for selective attention in young children from lower compared to higher SES backgrounds. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of studying neurodevelopment within narrow age ranges and in children from diverse backgrounds.",Selective attention; Development; ERPs; SES; Children

For this purpose, 46 papers published between 2002 and 2016 on text comprehension in individuals with DS were analysed and reported. It emerged that, although most people with DS learn to read, text comprehension represents an area of particular weakness. Failure in text comprehension is determined by poor oral linguistic skills (vocabulary, morphosyntax) and difficulties in cognitive abilities (inference making) as well as in verbal memory. On the other hand, text comprehension is supported by some general cognitive abilities such as the ability to learn from a context and the knowledge of the story structure.

We assessed multiple language abilities, phonological awareness, and letter-word knowledge in a sample of 489 predominantly African-American children from low-income homes. In preschool, kindergarten, and first grade we found significant positive correlations among measures of language, phonological awareness, and letter-word knowledge, and cross-age continuity in constructs. Using path and mediational analysis, we found effects of early language on later code-related skills and grade one reading. We also found effects of code-based skills on language. Vocabulary plays a central role in carrying early language effects and is the language ability most strongly associated with early reading. Discourse abilities have direct and indirect effects on emerging language abilities. Letter-word knowledge strongly predicts later letter-word knowledge and grade one reading and decoding. We found effects of early letter-word knowledge and phonological skills awareness in prekindergarten and kindergarten on first grade reading and decoding, accounting for intelligence, age, and gender. The direct and indirect effect combination of those early skills accounted for 32.1% of the variance in first grade reading and 29.3% of the variance in first grade decoding. Early language skills accounted for 9.5% of first grade reading and 7.8% of first grade decoding.

As these studies have only used behavioral measures, we exploited the fine-grained temporal resolution of EEG/ERPs to examine neural signatures of foreign- and native-accented sentence comprehension in older adults. Older adults, all normal-hearing monolingual English speakers, listened to foreign Chinese-accented and native English-accented sentences while ERPs were recorded. Foreign- and native-accented sentences contained semantic or pronoun errors, or were semantically and grammatically correct. We also gathered behavioral measures of sentence comprehension, and examined how neural activity during sentence processing relates to individual differences in listeners’ attitudes towards accented speakers, linguistic and cognitive skills, and hearing acuity. Older adults showed high comprehension accuracy of both foreign-accented and native-accented sentences. In contrast, ERP data showed different neural responses to foreign- and native-accented sentences: Semantic errors elicited an N400 effect in native-accented sentences, but not in foreign-accented sentences. Grammatical errors elicited a P600, not further qualified by accent type. Hearing acuity and individual differences in language attitudes, cognitive and linguistic variables did not systematically correlate with ERP patterns. These findings suggest that older adults are ultimately engaging in foreign-accented sentence comprehension, but non-native pre-lexical speech signals do not attain activation needed for strong lexical activation during online processing, resulting in strained and more effortful higher-level processing of semantics downstream the sentence.",Language comprehension; Aging; ERPs; Foreign-accent; Grammar; Semantics

The semantic association between verbs and nouns constitutes an important building block for the construction of sentences. In this large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, involving 336 subjects between the ages of 5 and 18 years, we investigated the neural correlates of covert verb generation in children. Using group independent component analysis (ICA), seven task-related components were identified including the mid-superior temporal gyrus, the most posterior aspect of the superior temporal gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the angular gyrus, and medial aspect of the parietal lobule (precuneus/posterior cingulate). A highly left-lateralized component was found including the medial temporal gyrus, the frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the angular gyrus. The associated independent component (IC) time courses were analyzed to investigate developmental changes in the neural elements supporting covert verb generation. Observed age effects may either reflect specific local neuroplastic changes in the neural substrates supporting language or a more global transformation of neuroplasticity in the developing brain. The results are analyzed and presented in the framework of two theoretical models for neurocognitive brain development. In this context, group ICA of fMRI data from our large sample of children aged 5–18 years provides strong evidence in support of the regionally weighted model for cognitive neurodevelopment of language networks.",

We sought to identify factors that influence the formation, quality, and duration of these relationships and to develop testable hypotheses for intervention strategies. Findings suggest several themes related to relationship formation with non-parental adults, including barriers (e.g., youth's fears of being hurt) and facilitators (e.g., patience from the adult). Distinct themes were also identified relating to the ongoing development and longevity of these relationships. Youth also described multiple types of support and positive contributions to their development. Proposed intervention strategies include systematic incorporation of important non-parental adults into transition planning, enhanced training and matching procedures within formal mentoring programs, assistance for youth to strengthen their interpersonal awareness and skills, and the targeting of specific periods of need when linking youth to sources of adult support.

Ford County, Kansas, was selected as a case study. Interviews were conducted with officials and an online survey marketed through Facebook was undertaken, receiving 547 responses. Results showed white men were particularly vulnerable to tornadoes as they were more likely to ignore warnings. Hispanics, older people and those with tornado experience were also at higher risk if they heard an alert from an EWS they distrusted or did not understand. Population growth in these groups and technology changes have helped cause the recent fatality rise and, unless changes are made to the EWS, the continued increase in size of these groups will lead to more people becoming at risk from, or perishing in, tornadoes.

Our goal was to characterize (a) the implementation fidelity, to describe the teaching functions and implementation procedures for teaching those language intervention strategies and (b) the intervention fidelity with which caregivers used strategies for facilitating their children’s language development. Because training procedures are not well described in the implementation and professional development literature, a new framework was developed and its feasibility was assessed in an attempt to characterize the teaching functions and specific implementation procedures used across studies. Among the 270 intervention studies reviewed, there were 124 in which caregivers were taught to implement language intervention strategies. Teaching functions included a variety of implementation procedures, with 95% of studies sharing information, 80% incorporating modeling, 65% providing feedback, and only 18% using prompting/guiding/scaffolding.

It has been previously shown that computer-assisted intervention is not only an effective method for developing various skills, allowing both learning with teachers and practicing on their own time without the teacher's direct attention, but it nonetheless increases the motivation and results in faster acquisition of these skills. In this paper we present the first step in developing the LeFCA framework, that will be used for teaching children with autism basic skills and concepts. Within the pilot project, we produced four games for developing matching, pointing out (based on visual and auditory stimuli) and labeling skills, which are considered to be primary skills needed for learning. The results of our preliminary study showed that the created software in native language is completely clear and user friendly for kids with Autism and other special needs, and that is systematically and developmentally appropriately sequenced for learning. Additionally, we found that children were able to generalize learned skills, through a transfer to a new medium or environment without any needed training (i.e. computer).

Despite this, educational performance in children with CI continues to lag behind their hearing peers. From animal models and human neuroimaging studies it has been proposed the integrative functions of auditory cortex are compromised by crossmodal plasticity. This has been argued to result partly from the use of a visual language. Here we argue that ‘cochlear implant sensitive periods’ comprise both auditory and language sensitive periods, and thus cannot be fully described with animal models. Despite prevailing assumptions, there is no evidence to link the use of a visual language to poorer CI outcome. Crossmodal reorganisation of auditory cortex occurs regardless of compensatory strategies, such as sign language, used by the deaf person. In contrast, language deprivation during early sensitive periods has been repeatedly linked to poor language outcomes. Language sensitive periods have largely been ignored when considering variation in CI outcome, leading to ill-founded recommendations concerning visual language in CI habilitation.",Cochlear implant; Deafness; Functional decoupling; Crossmodal reorganisation; Delayed/insecure language acquisition

When aphasia interferes with verbal abilities, gestures become even more relevant, compensating for and/or facilitating verbal communication. However, small-scale clinical studies yielded diverging results with regard to a therapeutic gesture benefit for lexical retrieval. Based on recent functional neuroimaging results, delineating a speech-gesture integration network for lexical learning in healthy adults, we hypothesized that the commonly observed variability may stem from differential patholinguistic profiles in turn depending on lesion pattern. Therefore we used a controlled novel word learning paradigm to probe the impact of gestures on lexical learning, in the lesioned language network. Fourteen patients with chronic left hemispheric lesions and mild residual aphasia learned 30 novel words for manipulable objects over four days. Half of the words were trained with gestures while the other half were trained purely verbally. For the gesture condition, rootwords were visually presented (e.g., Klavier, [piano]), followed by videos of the corresponding gestures and the auditory presentation of the novel words (e.g., /krulo/). Participants had to repeat pseudowords and simultaneously reproduce gestures. In the verbal condition no gesture-video was shown and participants only repeated pseudowords orally. Correlational analyses confirmed that gesture benefit depends on the patholinguistic profile: lesser lexico-semantic impairment correlated with better gesture-enhanced learning. Conversely largely preserved segmental-phonological capabilities correlated with better purely verbal learning. Moreover, structural MRI-analysis disclosed differential lesion patterns, most interestingly suggesting that integrity of the left anterior temporal pole predicted gesture benefit. Thus largely preserved semantic capabilities and relative integrity of a semantic integration network are prerequisites for successful use of the multimodal learning strategy, in which gestures may cause a deeper semantic rooting of the novel word-form. The results tap into theoretical accounts of gestures in lexical learning and suggest an explanation for the diverging effect in therapeutical studies advocating gestures in aphasia rehabilitation.",Gesture; Language; Lexical learning; Aphasia; Lesion

Overall, EL students performed significantly below never-EL students on reading and mathematics assessments at Grade 3, with EL students making greater academic gains across time points than never-EL students. Students who were reclassified after third grade and after fourth grade closed, or began to close, the academic opportunity gap by the end of fifth grade, providing promising evidence suggesting that reclassification policies are adequate for identifying those students who no longer need EL services. Students who continued to be classified as EL from third through fifth grades continued to score significantly lower than never-ELs, and in many cases other EL groups, indicating that there exists a group of EL students who continue to make inadequate reading and mathematics gains across late elementary school.

This pattern of performance implies damage to syntactic processes operating between semantics and phonological output. Damage here may lead to lexical selection errors and a deficit in combining words to form phrases. We investigated MH's knowledge and processing of noun syntax in mass and count nouns. She produced more count nouns than mass nouns. She showed impaired knowledge of noun syntax in judgement tasks and production tasks, with mass noun syntax being more impaired than count. We interpret these results in terms of a two-stage model of lexical retrieval. We propose that syntactic information represented at the lemma level is activated even in bare noun production, and can be differentially impaired across noun categories. That same damage can lead to semantic errors in production. For MH limited syntactic options are available to support production, and these favour count noun production.

To answer this question, we review research on the neural correlates of colour categories, and categorical responses in preverbal infants and non-human animals. With respect to language, the reviewed findings suggest that colour categorisation often involves automatic language processing. At the same time, evidence from non-human animals, infants, and patients with brain lesions indicates that colour categorisation may also occur in the absence of language. Concerning perception, there is little convincing evidence that the bottom-up processes of colour perception are the origin of colour categories. Instead, colour categorisation might simply build upon the continuous colour perception and interact with perception through the direction of attention to colour differences that are relevant to categorisation. We make three suggestions for future research. First, future research in all areas requires methodological improvements, in particular in stimulus control. Second, future research should overcome the universalist-realist debate and go beyond a simple contrast between perception and language. Third, the link between object colours and colour categories provides an alternative approach that might reveal the ecological origin of colour categories. The ecological approach promises establishing evolutionary and developmental continuity between categorical responses in non-human animals, infants and adult humans.",Colour categorisation; Colour perception; Sapir-Whorf-hypothesis; Cognitive development; Animal cognition

Contemporary neuroscience indicates that anterior temporal regions and the “ventral” language pathway also make a significant contribution, yet there is no computationally-implemented model of the dual pathway, nor any synthesis of normal and aphasic behavior. The “Lichtheim 2” model was implemented by developing a new variety of computational model which reproduces and explains normal and patient data but also incorporates neuroanatomical information into its architecture.

The properties of the Italian nominal system were exploited since it allows to explore exhaustively fine-grained phenomena in the inflectional processing. An event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment was carried out where Italian masculine and feminine nouns were visually presented to 50 healthy participants in an overt inflectional task: the generation of the plural from the singular and vice versa. The grammatical gender and the citation form suffix of nouns were manipulated in a factorial design. Functional data showed that inflectional operations for nouns activate an extensive cortical network involving the left inferior and right superior frontal gyri, the left and right middle temporal gyri, the posterior cingulate cortex and the cerebellum. Activations were variably modulated by the distributional features of gender-dependent properties of nouns. Particularly, cortical activity increased during inflectional operations for small and/or scarcely consistent inflectional classes.

Self-stigma as a moderating variable can be decisive whether more insight leads to better or worse outcome. On the other hand, self-stigma can act as a mediator between insight and outcomes. We therefore examined self-stigma both as a moderator and a mediator. Methods Insight, self-stigma, demoralization, symptoms, and functioning were assessed among 145 outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using questionnaires and structured interviews. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the cross-sectional data. Results Results confirmed self-stigma as a moderator: The association of insight and demoralization was stronger as self-stigma increased. Self-stigma also partially mediated the positive relationship between insight and demoralization. Moreover, demoralization fully mediated the adverse associations of self-stigma with psychotic symptoms and global functioning. Discussion Given the decisive role of self-stigma regarding the detrimental consequences of insight, interventions should address self-stigma, particularly if psychoeducational or other interventions have increased insight.

The neuropsychological profiles of lv-PPA and typical clinical AD are, however, distinct. In particular, these two syndromes differ on attention span measures, where auditory attention span is more impaired in lv-PPA than in AD and visuospatial span appears more impaired in AD than in lv-PPA. The neural basis of these span profiles, however, remains unclear. Method Sixteen lv-PPA and 21 AD matched patients, and 15 education-matched healthy controls were recruited. All participants were assessed by a neurologist and completed a neuropsychological assessment that included the Wechsler Memory Scale–III Digit and Spatial Span tasks, and underwent a high-resolution structural brain MRI to conduct cortical thickness analyses. Results Patient groups were impaired on all span tasks compared to Controls. In addition, performance on Digit Span Forward (DSF) was significantly lower in the lv-PPA than the AD group, while Spatial Span Forward (SSF) was significantly lower in the AD than the lv-PPA group. No differences were found between patient groups on the Digit or Spatial Span Backward tasks. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that reduced DSF performance correlated to thinning of the left superior temporal gyrus in the lv-PPA group, whereas reduced SSF performance was related to bilateral precentral sulcus and parieto-occipital thinning in the AD group. Analyses of the backward span tasks revealed that reduced Spatial Span Backward (SSB) performance in the lv-PPA group related to cortical thinning of the left superior parietal lobule. Conclusions This study demonstrates that while lv-PPA and AD commonly share the same underlying neuropathology, their span profiles are distinct and are mediated by divergent patterns of cortical degeneration.",Digit and Spatial span; Working memory; Primary progressive aphasia; Logopenic progressive aphasia; Alzheimer's disease

It investigates how Gyeongsang-Korean (GK) and Seoul-Korean (SK) listeners process English lexical stress. GK does not have lexical stress but has lexical pitch accents, whereas SK has neither; GK listeners are thus hypothesized to be more sensitive to pitch as a cue to lexical contrasts than SK listeners. GK and SK listeners completed a task in which they recalled four-item sequences of Korean words differing suprasegmentally (pitch accent contrast) or segmentally (phonemic contrast). The results showed a significant L1-by-contrast-type interaction, with GK listeners outperforming SK listeners in the pitch accent contrast condition. These results confirm GK listeners’ greater sensitivity to pitch in the L1. The same GK and SK listeners, who were matched in English proficiency, and native English listeners completed a similar task with English words differing suprasegmentally (stress contrast) or segmentally (phonemic contrast).

The clinical evidence for the transmodal function of vATL is largely based on studies of semantic dementia patients with severe anomia, who also show impaired performance on nonverbal tasks that involve the retrieval of knowledge about objects and their prototypical use, such as the production of tool use pantomimes. Yet, evidence from patients with apraxia and functional neuroimaging studies in healthy adults does not implicate vATL in pantomime production. We, therefore, compared semantic retrieval of object-action associations for overt verb and pantomime production from picture and word stimuli. Our results show that, independent of stimulus modality, the retrieval of object-action associations for verb, but not pantomime, production is related to activity in bilateral vATL. Bilateral vATL activation was also observed for meaningless verbal responses that did not require the retrieval of object-action associations. Taken together, our results suggest that bilateral vATL is not engaged in the retrieval of object-action associations per se, but rather supports semantic representations that are functionally specialized for language.

The role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and lateral orbitofrontal cortex in counterfactual emotions and choice,article,Neuropsychologia,ScienceDirect,"Counterfactual feelings of regret occur when people make comparisons between an actual outcome and a better outcome that would have occurred under a different choice. We investigated the choices of individuals with damage to the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and the lateral orbital frontal cortex (LOFC) to see whether their emotional responses were sensitive to regret. Participants made choices between gambles, each with monetary outcomes. After every choice, subjects learned the consequences of both gambles and rated their emotional response to the outcome. Normal subjects and lesion control subjects tended to make better choices and reported post-decision emotions that were sensitive to regret comparisons. VMPFC patients tended to make worse choices, and, contrary to our predictions, they reported emotions that were sensitive to regret comparisons. In contrast, LOFC patients made better choices, but reported emotional reactions that were insensitive to regret comparisons.

Dada las condiciones de vulnerabilidad en que estos niños nacen y viven sus primeros meses, y la diversidad de contextos a los que llegan una vez son adoptados, es necesario un estudio exhaustivo de los factores que influyen en su desarrollo social e intelectual con el fin de potenciar aquellos que lo promuevan. Dentro del desarrollo intelectual de estos niños, el desarrollo del lenguaje juega un papel muy importante, pues es la base de un desenvolvimiento futuro seguro, a nivel social y emocional. Debido a las condiciones que rodean a la adopción, los niños y niñas adoptados pueden presentar trayectorias de desarrollo retrasadas o diferentes a las de los que viven con sus familias biológicas en hogares monolingües o multilingües.

Tal incertidumbre puede superarse mediante el acceso a información basada en la evidencia que ayude a tomar decisiones clínicas apropiadas.

Language development plays an important role in children's general development, since it is the foundation of their future security at a social and emotional level. Because of the special conditions surrounding international adoption, children adopted from abroad may present delayed or different trajectories from children growing up with their biological families (in monolingual or multilingual homes). With children adopted from abroad, parents and educators can run into difficulties when deciding if and when they should seek professional intervention.

The proposed approach is based on multi-objective differential evolution (DE) that optimises five coreference resolution scorers, namely Muc, Bcub, Ceafm, Ceafe and Blanc. The main goal is to determine the best combination of different mention classifiers and the most relevant set of features for anaphora resolution. The proposed method is evaluated for three leading Indian languages, namely Hindi, Bengali and Tamil. Experiments on the benchmark datasets of ICON-2011 Shared Task on Anaphora Resolution in Indian Languages show that our proposed approach attains good level of accuracies, which are often better with respect to the state-of-the-art systems.

The relationships between sub-components of premorbid adjustment and outcomes on symptoms and cognition in first-episode schizophrenia were under-studied. In the current study, we prospectively followed up 93 patients aged 18–55 years presenting with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. Psychopathological and cognitive assessments were conducted at baseline, clinical stabilization, 12, 24 and 36 months. Premorbid adjustment was sub-divided into discrete functional domains, developmental stages and premorbid-course types based on ratings of the Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS). The study focused on early developmental stages to minimize contamination by prodromal symptoms. Results indicated that gender differences in premorbid functioning were primarily related to early-adolescence adjustment and academic domain. Social domain was more strongly related to negative symptoms, while academic domain was more consistently linked to cognitive outcome (Wisconsin Card Sorting test and verbal fluency). Patients with stable-poor premorbid course had more severe negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. In conclusion, in a Chinese cohort of first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, sub-components of early premorbid adjustment were shown to be differentially related to clinical and cognitive measures. The results highlighted the importance of applying a more refined delineation of premorbid functioning in studying illness outcome.",Premorbid adjustment; First-episode psychosis; Schizophrenia; Negative symptoms; Cognitive functions

As such, it is crucial to understand its development, antecedents and consequences. The current study investigates the development of different working memory components (phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, central executive), the influence of different aspects of the teacher-student relationship (closeness, conflict, dependency) and its predictive value for academic achievement (reading, spelling, mathematics) across the transition from kindergarten to first grade. The sample consisted of 107 kindergarten children. Working memory tasks were administered at the end of kindergarten and first grade. Teachers reported on teacher-student relationship quality in the middle of first grade. Standardized tests were used to assess academic achievement at the end of first grade. Results indicate moderate to large increases in the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad and large gains in the central executive. Dependency of the student towards the teacher significantly predicted visuospatial sketchpad performance at the end of first grade. Reading was significantly predicted by the visuospatial sketchpad and phonological loop in kindergarten, while for spelling the visuospatial sketchpad was important. Finally, mathematics was predicted by performance on the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad. The current study indicates the importance of the affective quality of the teacher-student relationship for working memory performance, which in turn is important for academic achievement. It is therefore critical to attend to the early detection and prevention or intervention of working memory problems in the classroom in order to prevent future academic problems. Additionally, maintaining a positive relationship with students and encouraging their independent exploration may be important when preventing such problems, complementary to cognitive or other types of training and intervention.",Working memory; Teacher-student relationship; Academic achievement; First grade; Transition

This paper focuses on the early representation of word order. It questions the validity of the results obtained with the Weird Word Order methodology (Akhtar, 1999) in which children are presented with ungrammatical sentences. These results have previously been considered as major evidence for the constructivist, usage-based approach to word order development according to which young children initially encode word order as a verb-specific lexical property which only slowly develops into abstract knowledge at age 3 or 4 (e.g., Abbot-Smith et al., 2001, Matthews et al., 2005, Matthews et al., 2007). The critical review presented here addresses various problems with the results and their interpretation. The discussion questions the relationship between theory and data as well as methodological issues related to the small number of observations and the discarding of data not missing at random. It is argued that the data not only fail to support the constructivist account, but they actually bring evidence for the alternative hypothesis according to which children, from early on, represent word order abstractly.",Language development; Grammar; Word order; Lexical frequency; Usage-based framework

The multi-layered architecture takes as input raw images of objects (referents) and streams of word’s phonemes (labels), builds an adequate representation, recognizes the current context, and associates label with referents incrementally, by employing a Self-Organizing Map which creates new association nodes (prototypes) as required, adjusts the existing prototypes to better represent the input stimuli and removes prototypes that become obsolete/unused. The model takes into account the current context to retrieve the correct meaning of words with multiple meanings. Simulations show that the model can reach up to 78% of word–referent association accuracy in ambiguous situations and approximates well the learning rates of humans as reported by three different authors in five Cross-Situational Word Learning experiments, also displaying similar learning patterns in the different learning conditions.",Self-organizing maps; Cross-situational word learning; Context; Learning representations; Neurocomputational model

Latent growth models indicated that both Spanish and English proficiency in kindergarten predicted levels of English reading in third through eighth grade, but that only English proficiency was uniquely predictive. English productive vocabulary was found to be a better predictor of later English reading than more complex measures, i.e., listening comprehension and story retell, contrary to findings for native English speakers. Oral language did not predict later growth rates. Findings suggest the need for educational efforts to develop oral language during early childhood for this underserved population. Findings further suggest that such early efforts may be necessary, but insufficient to accelerate ELLs' reading trajectories as they move into adolescence.",At-risk learners; Oral language; Reading development; Longitudinal studies

An eye-tracking study of Danish learning toddlers,article,Journal of Experimental Child Psychology,ScienceDirect,"Previous research has shown that Danish-learning children lag behind in early lexical acquisition compared with children learning a number of other languages. This delay has been ascribed to the opaque phonetic structure of Danish, which appears to have fewer reliable segmentation cues than other closely related languages. In support of this hypothesis, recent work has shown that the phonetic properties of Danish negatively affect online language processing in young Danish children. In this study, we used eye-tracking to investigate whether the challenges associated with processing Danish also affect how Danish-learning children between 24 and 35 months of age establish and learn novel label–object mappings. The children were presented with a series of novel mappings, either ostensively (one novel object presented alone on the screen) or ambiguously (one novel object presented together with a familiar one), through carrier phrases with different phonetic structures (more vs less opaque). Our results showed two main trends. First, Danish-learning children performed poorly on the task of mapping novel labels onto novel objects. Second, when learning did occur, accuracy was affected by the phonetic opacity of the speech stimuli. We suggest that this finding results from the interplay of a perceptually challenging speech input and a slower onset of early vocabulary experience, which in turn may delay the onset of word learning skills in Danish-learning children.",Word learning; Speech processing; Phonetic structure; Mutual exclusivity; Eye-tracking; Danish

An eye-tracker recorded children’s attention to videos while they were taught novel words with a gaze cue or an arrow cue. Videos included objects when they were static or when they were manipulated to demonstrate the object’s function. Word learning was measured immediately after videos and one week later. In contrast to an arrow cue, children in both groups looked longer at a gaze cue and had more contingent looks from the gaze cue to the referent. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that across both groups, children with higher versus lower social competence skills recalled more semantic features about the referent in the gaze condition.

In the present longitudinal study including three measurement points, this relation was targeted. At the beginning of the study, the participating children were 5–6-year-olds. By assessing participants’ fine motor skills, their executive functioning, and their non-verbal intelligence, their cross-sectional and cross-lagged interrelations were examined. Additionally, performance in these three areas was used to predict early school achievement (in terms of mathematics, reading, and spelling) at the end of participants’ first grade. Correlational analyses and structural equation modeling revealed that fine motor skills, non-verbal intelligence and executive functioning were significantly interrelated. Both fine motor skills and intelligence had significant links to later school achievement. However, when executive functioning was additionally included into the prediction of early academic achievement, fine motor skills and non-verbal intelligence were no longer significantly associated with later school performance suggesting that executive functioning plays an important role for the motor-cognitive performance link.",Motor control; Fine motor skills; Cognitive performance; Executive function; Academic achievement; School readiness

Our behavioural results showed that phonetic coding ability and empathy, but not phonological working memory, predict L2 pronunciation aptitude in advanced learners. Second, functional neuroimaging revealed this behavioural trait to be correlated with hemodynamic responses of the cerebral network of speech motor control and auditory-perceptual areas.

To assess the involvement of inhibition, we conducted delta plot analyses of naming RTs and examined the N2 component of the ERP. We found longer mean naming RTs and a larger N2 amplitude in the low relative to the high name agreement condition. For action naming we found a negative correlation between the slopes of the slowest delta segment and the difference in N2 amplitude between the low and high name agreement conditions.

A second aim was to compare phonological processes of HA and CI users. Method Children with hearing loss (CWHL, N = 25) were compared to children with normal hearing (CWNH, N = 30) with similar age, gender, linguistic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Speech samples obtained from a list of 88 words, derived from three standardized speech tests, were analyzed using the CASALA (Computer Aided Speech and Language Analysis) program to evaluate participants’ phonological systems, based on lax (a process appeared at least twice in the speech of at least two children) and strict (a process appeared at least five times in the speech of at least two children) counting criteria. Results Developmental phonological processes were eliminated in the speech of younger and older CWNH while eleven developmental phonological processes persisted in the speech of both age groups of CWHL. CWHL showed a similar trend of age of elimination to CWNH, but at a slower rate. Children with HAs and CIs produced similar phonological processes. Final consonant deletion, weak syllable deletion, backing, and glottal replacement were present in the speech of HA users, affecting their overall speech intelligibility. Conclusions Developmental and non-developmental phonological processes persist in the speech of children with mild to profound hearing loss compared to their peers with typical hearing. The findings indicate that it is important for clinicians to consider phonological assessment in pre-school CWHL and the use of evidence-based speech therapy in order to reduce non-developmental and non-age-appropriate developmental processes, thereby enhancing their speech intelligibility.",Phonological processes; Children with normal hearing; Cochlear implant; Hearing aid; Hearing loss; Speech production

The boundaries were either naturally cued (Experiment 1), or cued exclusively by pitch and duration (Experiment 2, 3). French-learning 6- and 8-month-olds both perceived the natural boundary, but neither perceived the boundary when only two cues were present. In contrast, German-learning infants develop from not perceiving the two-cue boundary at 6 months to perceiving it at 8 months, just like German-learning 8-month-olds listening to German (Wellmann, Holzgrefe, Truckenbrodt, Wartenburger, & Höhle, 2012). In a control experiment (Experiment 4), we found little difference between German and French adult listeners, suggesting that later, French listeners catch up with German listeners.

Participants took part in a five-session eye tracking study where they read reduced-relative prime-target pairs with the same initial verb. Half of the verbs in these sentences were repeated across the five sessions and half were novel to each session. Total fixation times on the syntactically challenging parts of prime sentences decreased across sessions, suggesting participants implicitly learned the structure. Additional priming was also observed at the critical regions of the target sentences, and the magnitude of this effect did not change over the five sessions.

We also examined the relationships between outcome measures and age at initial institutionalization, length of institutionalization, and age at adoption. On measures of general language, early literacy, and non-verbal IQ, the IA group performed significantly below their age-peers reared in biological families at both time points, but the group differences disappeared on receptive vocabulary and kindergarten concept knowledge at the second time point. Furthermore, the majority of children reached normative age expectations between 1 and 2 years post-adoption on all standardized measures. Although the age at adoption, age of institutionalization, length of institutionalization, and time in the adoptive family all demonstrated significant correlations with one or more outcome measures, the negative relationship between length of institutionalization and child outcomes remained most robust after controlling for the other variables. Results point to much flexibility and resilience in children's capacity for language acquisition as well as the potential primacy of length of institutionalization in explaining individual variation in IA children's outcomes. Learning outcomes: (1) Readers will be able to understand the importance of pre-adoption environment on language and early literacy development in internationally adopted children.

However, it is unknown whether they can generate predictions by combining these associations with knowledge of linguistic structure. We recorded the eye movements of pre-schoolers while they listened to sentences such as Pingu will ride the horse. Upon hearing ride, children predictively looked at a horse (a strongly associated and plausible patient of ride), and mostly ignored a cowboy (equally strongly associated, but an implausible patient). In a separate experiment, children did not rapidly look at the horse when they heard You can show Pingu … “riding”, showing that they do not quickly activate strongly associated patients when there are no structural constraints.

Those who are deemed as decision-makers often use a variety of methods to arrive at their decision. However, it is unclear what these decision-making practices entail. As a result, a systematic literature review was conducted of the last 36years to: (1) determine if a specific process exists to effectively identify a communication system for an individual with CCN; (2) identify the key components of feature matching; and (3) identify if a procedure exists for the comparison of communication systems. A total of 27 articles met the inclusion criteria and were organized and reported into three major categories: (1) reports and tools for identifying present level of performance; (2) communication system comparison; and (3) decision making process for the identification of a communication system.

However, there is still debate over whether the existence of this stage reflects primarily cognitive or linguistic constraints. Analyses of longitudinal data from two Deaf children, Mei and Cal, not exposed to an accessible first language (American Sign Language – ASL) until the age of 6years, suggest that a linguistic constraint is observed when cognition is relatively spared. These older children acquiring a first language after delayed exposure exhibit aspects of a two-word stage of language development. Results from intelligence assessments, achievement tests, drawing tasks, and qualitative cognitive analyses show that Mei and Cal are at least of average intelligence and ability. However, results from language analyses clearly show differences from both age peers and younger native signers in the early two-word stage, providing new insights into the nature of this phase of language development.",First language acquisition; American Sign Language; Two-word stage; Language and cognition

Reactions to ‘The myth of language universals’ (Evans and Levinson, 2009a, Evans and Levinson, 2009b) divide in response to these new challenges. Chomskyan-inspired ‘C-linguists’ defend a status quo, based on intuitive data and disparate universalizing abstract frameworks, reflecting 30 years of changing models. Linguists driven by interests in richer data and linguistic diversity, ‘D-linguists’, though more responsive to the new developments, have tended to lack an integrating framework. Here we outline such an integrative framework of the kind we were presupposing in ‘Myth’, namely a coevolutionary model of the interaction between mind and cultural linguistic traditions which puts variation central at all levels – a model that offers the right kind of response to the new challenges. In doing so we traverse the fundamental questions raised by the commentary in this special issue: What constitutes the data, what is the place of formal representations, how should linguistic comparison be done, what counts as explanation, what is the source of design in language? Radical changes in data, methods and theory are upon us. The future of the discipline will depend on responses to these changes: either the field turns in on itself and atrophies, or it modernizes, and tries to capitalize on the way language lies at the intersection of all the disciplines interested in human nature.",Language universals; Universal grammar; Linguistic typology; Linguistic diversity; Coevolution; Descriptive linguistics; Theoretical linguistics; Language evolution; Linguistic variation

In experiment 1, 96 participants aged 9–14 years carried out an interactive task when communication was easy (no barrier, ‘NB’) and difficult (the speech of one participant was filtered through a vocoder, ‘VOC’). Previous recordings from 20 adults were used as reference. Measures of VSA (ERB2), F1 and F2 ranges (ERB) and articulation rate were obtained. Children's VSA were significantly larger than adults'. From the age of 11, vowel hyperarticulation was evident in VOC, but only because VSA were gradually reducing with age in NB. The results suggest that whilst large VSA do not prevent children from hyperarticulating vowels, the manner in which this is achieved may not be adult-like. Experiment 2 was conducted to verify that large VSA were not a by-product of children being unable to see each other. Thirteen participants carried out the same task face-to-face with their interlocutor. Comparisons to matched participants from experiment 1 showed no differences in VSA, indicating that the audio-only modality did not influence results.

Using two unique data sets, one collected in a source country (Palestine) and the other in a host country (France), we are able to make visible a type of migration that has remained largely invisible to date. Combining quantitative analysis and a case study approach, we examine patterns as well as the motivations for Arab women's migration, categorizing motivations as political, educational, and employment-related, but also highlighting how political and economic forces, as well as educational and familial motives, are difficult to disentangle, and may shift over time. We also contextualize our findings historically by exploring the multifaceted manner in which structural factors, such as political systems and economic forces, influence both decisions to leave one's home and reception in the host country in gendered ways. In particular, we find that in recent decades new opportunities have emerged for women to migrate to pursue educational goals.",

Promoting symbolic gestures for preverbal children in low-income families supports responsive parent–child relationships,article,Early Childhood Research Quarterly,ScienceDirect,"Gestures are a natural form of communication between preverbal children and parents which support children's social and language development; however, low-income parents gesture less frequently, disadvantaging their children. In addition to pointing and waving, children are capable of learning many symbolic gestures, known as “infant signs,” if modeled by adults. The practice of signing with infants is increasingly popular in middle-income populations around the world, but has not been examined as an intervention to promote positive qualities of the parent–child relationship. This study tested whether an infant sign intervention (ISI) encouraging low-income parents to use symbolic gestures could enhance the parent–child relationship. A final sample of twenty-nine toddlers and their families were followed for 7 months after assignment to the ISI or a control group. Children and mothers in ISI group families used more symbolic gestures than those in control families. Mothers’ in the ISI group were more attuned to changes in children's affect and more responsive to children's distress cues. Mothers in the intervention group also viewed their children more positively, reducing parenting-related stress.

The relationships among these competencies as well as their predictive value on language development at 24 months and the contribution of biological, medical and social risk factors on language delay at 24 months were also analysed. One hundred and four monolingual Italian very preterms (mean gestational age 29.5 weeks) without major cerebral damages, and a comparison group of 20 monolingual healthy Italian full-terms were followed at 12, 18 and 24 months by administering to their parents the Italian short forms of the MacArthur-Bates CDI. Preterms showed a slower acquisition in gesture/action production, word comprehension, and word production with an increasing divergence with respect to full-terms from 12 to 24 months, when 20% of preterms were delayed in word production (<10th percentile) and 14% did not combine words yet. Lexical competencies at 12 months and together with gestures/actions at 18 months were predictive of word production at 24 months, with a stronger contribution of word comprehension at 12 months and of word production at 18 months. Male gender, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and low maternal educational level increased the risk of language delay at 24 months. Our findings suggest there to be a slower rate of communicative-linguistic development in very preterms with an increasing difference in their gestural and lexical competencies in the second year of life with respect to full-terms. The interplay of the above competencies and biological, medical and social risk factors increase the risk of language delay at 24 months in very preterm infants.",Preterm birth; Gestures/actions; Receptive and expressive lexicon; MacArthur-Bates CDI; Developmental trajectories

In total, 2154 children and families, as well as the 165 directors of their Head Start centers, participated in the nationally representative Family and Child Experiences Survey (2003 cohort). Child and family background and involvement data, as well as center outreach information, were collected through self-report surveys and interviews. Descriptive analyses showed that families were regularly involved in children's learning in all three contexts, although no ceiling effects were observed. Inferential analyses revealed that family background and process factors were the most substantial predictors of family involvement at the beginning (i.e., fall) of the Head Start year, and many of these factors continued to predict involvement at the end (i.e., spring) of the year. However, effect sizes were generally small. Center factors, including goals and incentives for involvement, were not linked to family involvement in fall or spring. In sum, findings indicate that most Head Start families were regularly involved with children's learning in diverse ways, but that involvement could be further increased. Distinct patterns of modest family predictors emerged, with center outreach indicated as a factor that could potentially be enhanced.",Head Start; Family involvement; Family and Child Experiences Survey dataset

Famous face identification was studied in 22 presurgical and 14 postsurgical temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients and 20 healthy comparison subjects using free recall and multiple choice (MC) paradigms. Right TLE patients exhibited presurgical deficits in famous face recognition, and postsurgical deficits in both famous face recognition and familiarity judgments. However, they did not exhibit any problems with naming before or after surgery. In contrast, left TLE patients demonstrated both pre- and postsurgical deficits in famous face naming but no significant deficits in recognition or familiarity. Double dissociations in performance between groups were alleviated by altering task demands. Postsurgical right TLE patients provided with MC options correctly identified greater than 70% of famous faces they initially rated as unfamiliar. Left TLE patients accurately chose the name for nearly all famous faces they recognized (based on their verbal description) but initially failed to name, although they tended to rapidly lose access to this name. We believe alterations in task demands activate alternative routes to semantic and lexical networks, demonstrating that unique pathways to such stored information exist, and suggesting a different role for each ATL in identifying visually presented famous faces. The right ATL appears to play a fundamental role in accessing semantic information from a visual route, with the left ATL serving to link semantic information to the language system to produce a specific name. These findings challenge several assumptions underlying amodal models of semantic memory, and provide support for the integrated multimodal theories of semantic memory and a distributed representation of concepts.",Famous face naming and recognition; Epilepsy surgery; Models of semantic memory

The results showed that the functional integration of speech production networks decreases with age, while at the same time this has a marginal effect on behavioral outcomes in high-performing older adults. Moreover, a significant task demand/age interaction was found in functional connectivity within the anterior and posterior subnetworks of the verbal fluency network.

Cortical magnetoencephalography responses occurred bilaterally but the experimental effects only in the left hemisphere. Superior temporal activity at 300–600ms, probably reflecting acoustic-phonetic processing, lasted longer for foreign phonology than for native phonology.

McQueen,2014,Richness of information about novel words influences how episodic and semantic memory networks interact during lexicalization,article,NeuroImage,ScienceDirect,"The complementary learning systems account of declarative memory suggests two distinct memory networks, a fast-mapping, episodic system involving the hippocampus, and a slower semantic memory system distributed across the neocortex in which new information is gradually integrated with existing representations. In this study, we investigated the extent to which these two networks are involved in the integration of novel words into the lexicon after extensive learning, and how the involvement of these networks changes after 24h. In particular, we explored whether having richer information at encoding influences the lexicalization trajectory. We trained participants with two sets of novel words, one where exposure was only to the words' phonological forms (the form-only condition), and one where pictures of unfamiliar objects were associated with the words' phonological forms (the picture-associated condition). A behavioral measure of lexical competition (indexing lexicalization) indicated stronger competition effects for the form-only words. Imaging (fMRI) results revealed greater involvement of phonological lexical processing areas immediately after training in the form-only condition, suggesting that tight connections were formed between novel words and existing lexical entries already at encoding. Retrieval of picture-associated novel words involved the episodic/hippocampal memory system more extensively. Although lexicalization was weaker in the picture-associated condition, overall memory strength was greater when tested after a 24hour delay, probably due to the availability of both episodic and lexical memory networks to aid retrieval. It appears that, during lexicalization of a novel word, the relative involvement of different memory networks differs according to the richness of the information about that word available at encoding.",Lexical acquisition; fMRI; Associative memory; Complementary learning systems; Overnight consolidation

The required timing, phonation and articulatory strength settings for each contrast act synergistically in the voiceless set, but it is unclear how the contrasting requirements for voiced geminates are implemented. Twenty adult speakers were recorded producing target words with medial singleton and geminate stops preceded by long and short vowels. Several temporal and non-temporal measures (duration, VOT, percent voicing, f0, F1, intensity, H1∗–H2∗) were taken in the surrounding vowels and in the closure and release phases. Results show that closure duration is the most important cue for distinguishing both voicing and gemination. Active and passive voicing patterns in the closure of voiceless and voiced stops point to [voice] as the main distinctive feature, with [tense] as a secondary feature for voiceless and for geminate stops, with a graded effect. Non-temporal correlates show geminates to have increased tension and creak. Crucially though, voicing is still active in voiced geminates, and release properties have more in common with lenis than fortis languages, leading to a complex profile for this marked category of sounds.",Voicing; Gemination; Fortis; (non-)Temporal; Arabic; Linear Mixed Effects Modelling; Random Forests

Previous data allowed us to hypothesize that they used the key word strategy, consisting of identifying (some of) the frequent content words, and deriving an overall representation of the sentence's meaning ignoring the function words. The results supported the hypothesis. The second aim was to establish the relationships between this strategy and the linguistic and phonological abilities of deaf participants. The results show that vocabulary increased with reading level, but syntax, evaluated with the use of function words, did not. This suggests that using the key word strategy during long periods of time increases knowledge of content words but not syntax, probably because function words are neglected by this strategy. The results also showed that the deaf participants had a fairly large orthographical lexicon. This implies that the extensive use of the key word strategy allows them to store lexical information. The next question was whether the written word representations of the deaf participants were memorized as mere logograms, or if they had been stored in connection with the phonological representations of the corresponding words. The metaphonological tasks conducted produced evidence indicating that deaf participants used both orthographic and phonological representations. A factor analysis of the metaphonological tasks together with reading and spelling confirmed that both factors were necessary to explain the whole variance in the deaf group.",

We overcame this problem by controlling the input to a computational model so that amount of exposure to linguistic input (quantity) and the quality of that input (lexical diversity) were independently manipulated. Sublexical, lexical, and multi-word knowledge were charted across development (Study 1), showing that while input quantity may be important early in learning, lexical diversity is ultimately more crucial, a prediction confirmed against children’s data (Study 2). The model trained on a lexically diverse input also performed better on nonword repetition and sentence recall tests (Study 3) and was quicker to learn new words over time (Study 4). A language input that is rich in lexical diversity outperforms equivalent richness in quantity for learned sublexical and lexical knowledge, for well-established language tests, and for acquiring words that have never been encountered before.",Input quantity; Lexical diversity; Vocabulary acquisition; CLASSIC; Language acquisition

First, children crack into language by comparing their own representations of reality with others' utterances regarding reality, and they acquire negation, irrealis, and pretend, epistemic operators that impact the truth value of others' utterances, with pretend (P) indicating transitions from truthfully-described worlds to fictional worlds, meaning that truth values are not to be applied to others' utterances. This sets the stage for children to create fictional worlds for themselves, with their understanding of the epistemic operator pretend forging with their ability to conduct thought transformations to yield pretend that (PT), first based on perceptually-coupled thought transformations that draw on perceptual similarity to transform physically-available objects, and later, based on perceptually-decoupled thought transformations that draw on long-term memory to create imaginary and mentalizing transformations. Next, in pretend with (PW), children use their emerging metarepresentational skills to engage in social pretend play, comparing their own representations of reality with those of others and creating mappings between others' representations of the real world and the fictional world that their utterances engender in both their own and in others' minds. In mind play, these abilities merge in the strategic use of pretend with to create fictional worlds for others in non-play contexts. The model highlights children's engagement in social pretend play as part of a language-based, social enterprise centered on maintaining interaction with others.",Pretend play; Thought transformations; Truth value; Epistemic operators; Negation; Irrealis

Participants were assigned to either a Black talker or White talker; within this talker manipulation, participants were either put into a condition with a digital image of their assigned model talker or one without an image. Liking was measured through attractiveness rating. Participants accommodated toward vowels selectively; the low vowels /æ ɑ/ showed the strongest effects of imitation compared to the vowels /i o u/, but the degree of this trend varied across conditions. In addition to these findings of phonetic selectivity, the degree to which these vowels were imitated was subtly affected by attractiveness ratings and this also interacted with the experimental condition.

We conducted a large-scale corpus study in order to discover what these factors have in common. The underlying generalization appears to be processing complexity: we show that a variety of factors that are related to verbal cluster word order, can also be related to the processing complexity of the cluster's context. This implies that one of the word orders might be easier to process — when processing load is high, speakers will go for the easier option. Therefore, we also investigate which of the two word orders might be easier to process. By testing for associations with factors indicating a higher or lower processing complexity of the verb and its context, we find evidence for the hypothesis that the word order where the main verb comes last is easier to process.",Verb cluster; Processing complexity; Word order; Language variation; Dutch; Corpus linguistics

Explanations for phonetic reduction of predictable forms tend to take one of two approaches: Intelligibility-based accounts hold that talkers maximize intelligibility of words that might otherwise be difficult to recognize; production-based accounts hold that variation reflects the speed of lexical access and retrieval in the language production system. Here we examine phonetic variation as a function of phonological neighborhood density, capitalizing on the fact that words from dense phonological neighborhoods tend to be relatively difficult to recognize, yet easy to produce. We show that words with many phonological neighbors tend to be phonetically reduced (shortened in duration and produced with more centralized vowels) in connected speech, when other predictors of phonetic variation are brought under statistical control.

In doing so, we relate IAM representations to word length, sequence, frequency, repetition, and orthographic neighborhood effects in behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies along the ventral visual stream. We then examine to what extent lexical competition can account for anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation and the N2/N400 complex. The subsequent section presents the Associative Read-Out Model (AROM), which extends the scope of IAMs by introducing explicit memory and semantic representations. Thereby, it can account for false memories, and familiarity and recollection – explaining why memory signal variances are greater for studied than non-studied items. Since the AROM captures associative spreading across semantic long-term memory, it can also account for different temporal lobe functions, and allows for item-level predictions of the left inferior frontal gyrus’ BOLD response. Finally, we use the AROM to examine whether semantic cohesiveness can account for effects previously ascribed to affective word features, i.e. emotional valence, and show that this is the case for positive, but not for negative valence.",Word recognition; Associative spreading; Multiple Read-Out Model (MROM); Semantic process model; Episodic memory

We examine the development of higher-order thinking in 64 preschool-aged children, observed from 14 to 58 months in naturalistic situations at home. We used children's spontaneous talk about and with relations (i.e., higher-order thinking talk, or HOTT) as a window onto their higher-order thinking skills. We find that surface HOTT, in which relations between representations are more immediate and easily perceptible, appears before—and is far more frequent than—structure HOTT, in which relations between representations are more abstract and less easy to perceive. Child-specific factors (including early vocabulary and gesture use, first-born status, and family income) predict differences in children's onset (i.e., age of acquisition) of HOTT and its trajectory of use across development. Although HOTT utterances tend to be longer and more syntactically complex than non-HOTT utterances, HOTT frequently appears in non-complex utterances, and a substantial proportion of children achieve complex utterance onset prior to the onset of HOTT. This finding suggests that complex language is neither necessary nor sufficient for HOTT to occur; other factors above and beyond complex linguistic skills are involved in the onset and use of higher-order thinking. Finally, we found that the trajectory of HOTT, particularly structure HOTT—but not complex utterances—during the preschool period predicts standardized outcome measures of inference and analogy skills in grade school, which underscores the crucial role that this kind of early talk plays for later outcomes.",Higher-order thinking; Reasoning development; Early language development; Complex language; Naturalistic observation

We contrast two accounts for the processing of such anomalous sentences: a syntactic account, in which the representations constructed for anomalous sentences are similar in nature to the ones constructed for well-formed sentences; and a semantic account, in which the representations constructed for anomalous sentences are erroneous, or altogether missing, and interpretation is achieved on the basis of semantic representations instead. To distinguish between these accounts, we used structural priming. First, we ruled out the possibility that anomaly per se influences the magnitude of the priming effect: Prime sentences with morphologically incorrect verbs produced similarly enhanced priming (lexical boost) to sentences with the same correct verbs (Exp. 1). Second, we found that prime sentences with a novel verb (Exp. 2) or a semantically and syntactically incongruent verb (Exp. 3) produced a priming effect, which was the same as that produced by well-formed sentences. In accord with the syntactic account, we conclude that the syntactic representations of anomalous sentences are similar to those constructed for well-formed sentences. Our results furthermore suggest that lexically-independent syntactic information is robust enough to produce well-formed syntactic representations during processing without requiring aid from lexically-based syntactic information.",Anomalous sentences; Lexically-independent syntactic representations; Language comprehension; Structural priming

We directly compared morphological to both semantic and formal/orthographic priming (shared letters) on verbs. Masked priming was used to reduce strategic effects related to prime perception and to suppress semantic priming effects. The three types of priming led to distinct ERP and behavioral patterns: semantic priming was not found, while formal and morphological priming resulted in diverging ERP patterns. These results are consistent with models of lexical processing that make reference to morphological structure.

Benasich,2012,Time course of ERP generators to syllables in infants: A source localization study using age-appropriate brain templates,article,NeuroImage,ScienceDirect,"Event-related potentials (ERPs) have become an important tool in the quest to understand how infants process perceptual information. Identification of the activation loci of the ERP generators is a technique that provides an opportunity to explore the neural substrates that underlie auditory processing. Nevertheless, as infant brain templates from healthy, non-clinical samples have not been available, the majority of source localization studies in infants have used non-realistic head models, or brain templates derived from older children or adults. Given the dramatic structural changes seen across infancy, all of which profoundly affect the electrical fields measured with EEG, it is important to use individual MRIs or age-appropriate brain templates and parameters to explore the localization and time course of auditory ERP sources. In this study 6-month-old infants were presented with a passive oddball paradigm using consonant–vowel (CV) syllables that differed in voice onset time. Dense-array EEG/ERPs were collected while the infants were awake and alert. In addition, MRIs were acquired during natural non-sedated sleep for a subset of the sample. Discrete dipole and distributed source models were mapped onto individual and averaged infant MRIs. The CV syllables elicited a positive deflection at about 200ms followed by a negative deflection that peaked around 400ms. The source models generated placed the dipoles at temporal areas close to auditory cortex for both positive and negative responses. Notably, an additional dipole for the positive peak was localized at the frontal area, at the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) level. ACC activation has been reported in adults, but has not, to date, been reported in infants during processing of speech-related signals. The frontal ACC activation was earlier but smaller in amplitude than the left and right auditory temporal activations. These results demonstrate that in infancy the ERP generators to CV syllables are localized in cortical areas similar to that reported in adults, but exhibit a notably different temporal course. Specifically, ACC activation in infants significantly precedes auditory temporal activation, whereas in adults ACC activation follows that of temporal cortex. We suggest that these timing differences could be related to current maturational changes, to the ongoing construction of language-specific phonetic maps, and/or to more sensitive attentional switching as a response to speech signals in infancy.",Anterior cingulate cortex; Auditory cortex; Event-related potentials; Infants; MRI; Source localization

Evidence from new data and a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis using publicly available data,article,Neuropsychologia,ScienceDirect,"Several studies (e.g., Wicha et al., 2003b; DeLong et al., 2005) have shown that readers use information from the sentential context to predict nouns (or some of their features), and that predictability effects can be inferred from the EEG signal in determiners or adjectives appearing before the predicted noun. While these findings provide evidence for the pre-activation proposal, recent replication attempts together with inconsistencies in the results from the literature cast doubt on the robustness of this phenomenon. Our study presents the first attempt to use the effect of gender on predictability in German to study the pre-activation hypothesis, capitalizing on the fact that all German nouns have a gender and that their preceding determiners can show an unambiguous gender marking when the noun phrase has accusative case. Despite having a relatively large sample size (of 120 subjects), both our preregistered and exploratory analyses failed to yield conclusive evidence for or against an effect of pre-activation. The sign of the effect is, however, in the expected direction: the more unexpected the gender of the determiner, the larger the negativity. The recent, inconclusive replication attempts by Nieuwland et al. (2018) and others also show effects with signs in the expected direction. We conducted a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis using our data and the publicly available data from these recent replication attempts. Our meta-analysis shows a relatively clear but very small effect that is consistent with the pre-activation account and demonstrates a very important advantage of the Bayesian data analysis methodology: we can incrementally accumulate evidence to obtain increasingly precise estimates of the effect of interest.",ERP; Pre-activation; Predictions; Grammatical gender; Bayesian meta-analysis

A mixed method research design was used. Participant dyads (adults who stutter and their fluent life partner) each completed one semi-structured qualitative interview and two questionnaires: the Overall Assessment of Speakers’ Experience of Stuttering (OASES), and the Medical Short Form 36 (SF-36). Interviews were analysed qualitatively and significant themes evaluated. Quantitative results of the OASES and SF-36 were analysed, and scores correlated to determine the strength of any clinically significant relationships. Results indicated that people who stutter and their fluent partners reported similar experiences in reactions to stuttering and perceived difficulties in communication. However, no relationship was seen between the two groups in perceived impact on quality of life. Qualitative results indicated that the participants shared life experiences including reactions to stuttering, treatment undertaken and support. Such findings lend support to a broad-based clinical programme for adults who stutter that includes the fluent partner as an agent of change in their treatment. Findings also support the utilisation of qualitative and quantitative research techniques to elucidate relevant psychosocial life themes and experiences for those who live with a stutter.

Previous eye-tracking research has shown that the within-category phonetic details of consonants and vowels constrain lexical activation. However, given the highly dynamic and variable nature of lexical tones, it is unclear whether the within-category phonetic details of lexical tones would similarly modulate lexical activation. Native Mandarin listeners and proficient adult English-speaking Mandarin learners were tested in a visual-world eye-tracking experiment. The target word contained a level tone and the competitor word contained a high-rising tone, or vice versa. The auditory stimuli were manipulated such that the target tone was either canonical (Standard condition), phonetically more distant from the competitor (Distant condition), or phonetically closer to the competitor (Close condition). Growth curve analyses on fixations suggest that, compared to the Standard condition, Mandarin listeners’ target-over-competitor word activation was enhanced in the Distant condition and inhibited in the Close condition, whereas English listeners’ target-over-competitor word activation was inhibited in both the Distant and Close conditions. These results suggest that within-category tonal information influences both native and non-native Mandarin listeners’ word recognition, but does so differently for the two groups.",Mandarin tones; Spoken word recognition; Within-category tonal information; Eye tracking

Some have suggested that abstract syntactic priming (i.e., with no lexical overlap) derives from implicit learning, whereas the lexical boost derives from explicit short-term memory (STM) for the prime (e.g., Chang, Dell, & Bock, 2006). To address this issue, we assessed twelve people with aphasia (PWA) with varying degrees of STM and language deficits and eleven age-matched healthy control speakers in a syntactic priming experiment. Despite the PWA's difficulty in maintaining phonological, semantic, and structural information, as evidenced by various STM and sentence repetition measures, they showed lexical boost effects comparable to those of healthy speakers. Moreover, the size of the lexical boost was unrelated to the degree of STM deficit, suggesting that the lexical boost does not rely on explicit memory.

In this article, we investigated whether interhemispheric transfer processes (IHT) are likely to be involved in developmental dyslexia. In this study, we tested 13 children with developmental dyslexia and 13 matched controls (aged 8 to 13 years) in four different tasks. In a tactile transfer task, the dyslexic children&rsquo;s performance was less accurate. In a standard Poffenberger paradigm, dyslexic children performed slower than the controls in all conditions and did not show any difference between crossed and uncrossed conditions. Furthermore, they showed an increased asymmetry of performance according to the responding hand, while controls gave more coherent responses. In a visual task of object orientation discrimination, dyslexic children had slower Response Times (RTs) than controls, especially for mirror-reversed objects in the right visual field. Finally, a higher number of dyslexic children showed mirror-drawing or mirror-writing with respect to controls. Our results as a whole show that children with DD are impaired in interhemispheric transfer, although the differences in performance among dyslexic individuals suggest the impairment of different psychophysiological mechanisms. As such, a common origin in terms of connectivity problems is proposed.",interhemispheric transfer; developmental dyslexia; mirror writing; crossed-uncrossed difference paradigm

Clitic production is considered a good clinical marker for Italian monolingual children suffering from specific language impairment (SLI) (Bortolini et al. 2006). Moreover, this task is reported to be particularly challenging for early second language children (EL2), who are less accurate than their peers in this task (Vender et al. 2016). Even though the typology of errors committed by the two populations (non-impaired bilinguals and SLI children) is generally different, it can be difficult to keep them apart from each other and, as a consequence, to identify a language impairment in bilingual children. However, it has been suggested that the difficulties exhibited by EL2 children in clitic production are related to their competence in their L2 and that they should disappear as soon as their mastery of the L2 increases. To test this prediction, we assessed clitic production in a group of 31 bilingual children having Italian as their L2 (mean age 10;2), comparing their performance to that of a group of 33 Italian monolingual children (mean age 10;2). The bilingual children used their L1 on a daily basis, as assessed by means of a bilingual exposure questionnaire, and had on average eight years of exposure to Italian; moreover, they performed similarly to monolinguals in a receptive vocabulary task, indicating that their competence in Italian was good. Consistently with our predictions, we found that bilingual children performed very accurately in the clitic elicitation task, similarly to monolinguals, confirming that the deficits previously found in EL2 children were not related to bilingualism itself, but more likely to their still incomplete competence in Italian.",clitic production; early second language learners; bilingualism; specific language impairment

QMT is a structured sensorimotor training program aimed at improving coordination, attention, and emotional well-being through behavioral, electrophysiological, neuroanatomical, and molecular changes. In accordance with this argument, we first describe the general neurobiological mechanisms underpinning emotional states and emotion regulation. Next, we review the relationships between QMT, positive emotional state, and increased emotion regulation, and discuss the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these relationships. We consider the relationships between motion, emotion, and cognition, and highlight the need for integrated training paradigms involving these three trajectories. Such training paradigms provide cognitively engaging exercises to improve emotion regulation, which in turn affects adaptive behaviors.

One of the methods that focuses primarily on the diagnosis and therapy of such learning difficulties is the one developed by Fred Warnke. The diagnostic solutions of the method were motivated by the following assumptions: (a) Automation of hearing, vision, and motor functions can be improved based on the level of brain activity; (b) the development and automation of phonological analysis and synthesis are based on cooperation between the two brain hemispheres. The main purpose of this paper is to present and discuss some research results that show the usefulness of diagnosis of the first stage of the Warnke method, as well as the training determined by it, in improving the phonological memory, language, and reading and writing skills of a group of four Polish children with special needs. The range of automation of each function was estimated on the basis of the values obtained in the diagnoses (initial and final). The final diagnosis showed an improvement in the levels of speech, reading, and writing.

Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was performed to investigate the whole-brain functional connectivity differences by network-based statistics (NBS), and the differences in network efficiency were investigated by graph theory between the two groups (false discovery rate corrected for multiple comparisons, q = 0.05). Compared with the Mandarin monolingual group, Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals increased functional connectivity between the bilateral frontoparietal and temporal regions and decreased functional connectivity in the bilateral occipital cortex and between the right sensorimotor region and bilateral prefrontal cortex. No significant differences in network efficiency were found between the two groups. Compared with the Mandarin monolinguals, Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals had no significant discrepancies in network efficiency. However, the Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals developed a more strongly connected subnetwork related to language control, inhibition, phonological and semantic processing, and memory retrieval, whereas a weaker connected subnetwork related to visual and phonology processing, and speech production also developed.",Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals; Mandarin monolinguals; resting state fMRI; network-based statistics (NBS); graph theory; functional network connectivity

The paper reports two studies. The first study presents data on 77 children bilingual in Gaelic/English recruited across four levels of primary school on reading in Gaelic. The second study looks at the performance on a version of the test adapted for English, comparing the performance of two groups of children (bilinguals Gaelic/English and monolinguals English) on several linguistic skills, including sentence comprehension and reading. About 40 monolingual English subjects in EME, living in the same urban area, were administered the English version. The reading abilities of the children attending EME and GME schools were comparable, supporting the idea of no disadvantage on reading from attending a school with the medium of a minority language.

Indeed, monolingual readers of more consistent orthographies such as Italian or German learn to read more quickly than monolingual English readers. Here, we assessed whether long-lasting bilingualism would mitigate orthography-specific differences in reading speed and whether the order in which orthographies with a different regularity are learned matters. We studied high-proficiency Italian-English and English-Italian bilinguals, with at least 20 years of intensive daily exposure to the second language and its orthography and we simulated sequential learning of the two orthographies with the CDP++ connectionist model of reading. We found that group differences in reading speed were comparatively bigger with Italian stimuli than with English stimuli. Furthermore, only Italian bilinguals took advantage of a blocked presentation of Italian stimuli compared to when stimuli from both languages were presented in mixed order, suggesting a greater ability to keep language-specific orthographic representations segregated. These findings demonstrate orthographic constraints on bilingual reading, whereby the level of consistency of the first learned orthography affects later learning and performance on a second orthography.

The paper presents the results and conclusions related to the use of the Warnke method in improving the phonological competence of a bilingual girl aged seven, which learned two languages simultaneously (Polish and Italian) in her family environment. The case study method was used. The main objective was to assess the effectiveness of the first stage of the Warnke method in improving reading and writing skills in a bilingual child. The Warnke method focuses primarily on the diagnosis and training of the phonological competence and was based on the following assumptions: (a) the automation of hearing, vision, and motor functions can be improved at the level of brain activity; (b) the development and automation of phonological analysis and synthesis are based on the cooperation of the brain hemispheres. The preliminary and final results of the diagnosis obtained for basic brain functions (visual, motor, and auditory) and the level of literacy skills were analyzed and compared. The reading and writing abilities, before and after training with the Warnke method, were assessed using the symptomatic tests. The obtained results showed that during and after training with the method, there was noticeable progress in eight basic functions (visual, motor and auditory). Improvement was also seen in the following areas: knowledge of letters; pairing phonemes with letters; technique, speed, and fluency of reading and writing. The quality of reading and writing was verified and confirmed by symptomatic tests. The conducted study suggests that the observed learning disabilities were caused by deficits in the central processing functions, which resulted in a lower level of phonological skills.",bilingualism; the Warnke method; automation of hearing; vision and motor functions; reading and writing skills

An additional area of interest was to examine the extent to which use of and exposure to both heritage and majority language affected the development of the children’s reading comprehension in both of their spoken languages. A total of forty bilingual and forty monolingual children were assessed in oral language skills and decoding in Year 1 and Year 3 in primary school. After one school year, they were assessed in oral language skills, decoding, and reading comprehension in Year 2 and Year 4. The results showed that the bilinguals performed better than the monolinguals in decoding in all years, suggesting that exposure to a first language with transparent orthography (Greek) may benefit the development of word reading skills. However, the bilinguals scored lower in oral language skills and reading comprehension than their monolingual peers. This finding underlined the significant role of oral language skills in the development of bilinguals’ reading comprehension. Both oral language skills and decoding contributed to reading comprehension in bilinguals but the effects of oral language skills on reading comprehension were stronger than the effects of decoding.

Although dyslexia diagnosis has been addressed by these tests in clinical practice, it is difficult to extract information about the brain processes involved in the different tasks and, then, to go deeper into its biological basis. Thus, the use of biomarkers can contribute not only to the diagnosis but also to a better understanding of specific learning disorders such as dyslexia. In this work, we use Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to discover differences among controls and dyslexic subjects using signal processing and artificial intelligence techniques. Specifically, we measure phase synchronization among channels, to reveal the functional brain network activated during auditory processing. On the other hand, to explore synchronicity patterns risen by low-level auditory processing, we used specific stimuli consisting in band-limited white noise, modulated in amplitude at different frequencies. The differential information contained in the functional (i.e., synchronization) network has been processed by an anomaly detection system that addresses the problem of subjects variability by an outlier-detection method based on vector quantization. The results, obtained for 7 years-old children, show that the proposed method constitutes an useful tool for clinical use, with the area under ROC curve (AUC) values up to 0.95 in differential diagnosis tasks.",functional connectivity; EEG; anomaly detection; self-organizing maps; phase locking value; circular correlation

Results were interpreted in the context of country-specific SLT service-related policies and SLT training as well as migration history. There seems to be a gap between the SLTs’ knowledge about the specific requirements for providing Speech Language Therapy (SLT) for multilingual children and their common practice, which—despite the continuous need of further training—points to sufficient awareness but a lack of materials or resources.

Similarly, children understand and produce subject RCs earlier and with greater accuracy than object RCs in a variety of languages with head-initial relative clauses, as English, Hebrew and Italian. These findings cannot be a coincidence but reflect the fact that what children acquire first is also easier to process by adults. In this article, we support this observation by investigating subject and object RCs in children and adults speaking French and Italian. These languages display subject and object relatives as in (1), but they also have a type of object relative in which the subject is postverbal.

IDHC use in mixed Hispanic communities such as Miami may be problematic due to differences in dialect and object labels.

Data were collected from Hispanic 16-month-old infants (N = 27; females = 13) from a mixture of Latin American backgrounds residing in Miami, FL, USA, and compared to archival data from the IDHC Mexican norming sample (N = 60; females = 31). Findings indicate significant differences in the rate of comprehension between the two samples with infants from mixed Latin American backgrounds demonstrating lower rates of comprehension for words flagged as unknown/uncommon. Moreover, Spanish vocabulary scores for infants from mixed Hispanic communities were significantly lower compared to the Mexican norming sample. Use of total vocabulary score (i.e., Spanish + English) attenuated these issues in administrating the IDHC to bilingual infants from mixed Hispanic communities. Results suggest that comprehension of some IDHC words is influenced by Hispanic family background.

At frontal sites, only the phonological task showed left lateralization. The following N400 (300&ndash;450 ms) showed an interesting interaction: Match trials elicited greater left asymmetry on frontal regions to phonological than to semantic than to visual-perceptual tasks, whereas mismatch trials induced an inverted asymmetry, marked by greater amplitude over right frontal sites, regardless of the task. Concerning the late N400 (450&ndash;600 ms), phonological and semantic tasks showed an overlapping pattern, with left lateralization in match and right lateralization in mismatch conditions. Results point to complex task- and time-dependent hemispheric asymmetries in word matching.",brain asymmetry; N400; Late N400; semantic incongruity; EEG

The present study investigated whether a distinctive variety spoken by Galician new speakers (neofalantes) has emerged in the community and whether listeners’ language background influences accent identification abilities and patterns. Galician-Spanish bilingual listeners completed an accent identification task and were asked to comment on factors influencing their decision. Results demonstrated that all listeners could identify Galician-dominant better than Spanish-dominant bilinguals but could not identify neofalantes. Neofalantes were categorised as both Spanish- and Galician-dominant, supporting the idea that neofalantes have a hybrid variety. This finding suggests that listeners have a gradient representation of language background variation, with Galician-like and Spanish-like accents functioning as anchors and the neofalantes’ accent situated somewhere in the middle. Identification accuracy was similar for all listeners but neofalantes showed heightened sensitivity to the Galician-dominant variety, suggesting that evaluation of sociophonetic features depends on the listener’s language and social background. These findings contribute to our understanding of sociolinguistic awareness in bilingual contexts.",new speakers; accent identification; sociolinguistic awareness; bilingual speech processing; Galician phonetics; minority languages

In order to examine effects of ND on adult word learning during an ecologically valid task, eight nonwords varying in neighborhood density (4 dense, 4 sparse) were taught to 50 typical adults in the context of a lecture. Half of the participants (n = 25) were solely exposed to the phonological forms of the nonwords, while the other half of the participants (n = 25) were exposed to both the phonological forms and orthographic representations. Results indicated that participants who only heard the nonwords learned more dense words than sparse words, similar to prior work. However, participants who heard as well as saw the nonwords learned dense words and sparse words to a similar degree, in addition to overall greater learning of sparse words. Thus, learning of sparse words can improve when orthographic information supplements the phonological information.

The children&rsquo;s lexical development in English and Romanian was assessed at five different points over a two-year period via the PPVT-4 (peabody picture vocabulary test 4) and a specially adapted PPVT-4 for Romanian. The children&rsquo;s lexical repertoires were further analyzed to uncover home versus school and cognate versus non-cognate acquisitional differences. In addition, because there is no database of lexical items acquired by monolingual Romanian children, the PPVT-4 adapted for Romanian was administered to 22 monolingual six-year-old Romanian children in Sibiu, Romania. The findings indicate the following: (i) the three bilinguals&rsquo; receptive vocabulary in English was below average when they joined kindergarten, and at or above average two years later; (ii) their lexical growth in Romanian was steady; (iii) the bilinguals&rsquo; scores for words belonging to a home register reflected ceiling effects in English and Romanian (i.e., were very well known); (iv) academic words were known to an equal extent in English and Romanian, but scores were lower than for the home register; and (v) there was no definitive evidence of cognate facilitation. A comparison of the monolingual and bilingual Romanian repertoires reflects the following: (i) equally high scores for home items; (ii) differences in scores in the academic register in favour of the Romanian monolinguals; and (iii) important lifestyle and cultural differences between the groups. The Romanian children, for example, were more familiar than their Canadian counterparts with items related to home maintenance, such as șmirghăluiește (&lsquo;sanding&rsquo;) and mistrie (&lsquo;trowel&rsquo;), or items probably learned in school, such as foca (&lsquo;walrus&rsquo;) and broască țestoasă (&lsquo;tortoise&rsquo;).",Romanian; English; lexical development; child language acquisition; sequential bilingualism; bilingual kindergarteners

The results of the 46 original studies show that indeed, the majority, 54.3%, reported beneficial effects of bilingualism on cognitive control tasks; however, 28.3% found mixed results and 17.4% found evidence against its existence. Methodological differences seem to explain these mixed results: Particularly, the varying selection of the bilingual participants, the use of nonstandardized tests, and the fact that individual differences were often neglected and that longitudinal designs were rare. Therefore, a serious risk for bias exists in both directions (i.e., in favor of and against the bilingual advantage). To conclude, we found some evidence for a bilingual advantage in cognitive control; however, if significant progress is to be made, better study designs, bigger data, and more longitudinal studies are needed.",bilingual advantage; bilingualism; cognitive control; individual differences; longitudinal studies; methodology

Method: This closed-set test was evaluated with normal-hearing children aged 5 to 11 years. Development and validation of the speech materials were accomplished in two experimental phases. Twenty-six children participated in phase I, where the test materials were piloted to ensure that the selected words were age appropriate and that the form of Arabic used was familiar to the children. Sixteen children participated in phase II where test–retest reliability, age effects, and critical differences were measured. A computerized implementation was used to present stimuli and collect responses. Children selected one of four response options displayed on a screen for each trial. Results: Two lists of 32 words were developed with two levels of difficulty, easy and hard. Assessment of test–retest reliability for the final version of the lists showed a strong agreement.

The present study examined and compared, for the first time, the home learning environment of children diagnosed with DS and children diagnosed with WS to investigate whether different cognitive profiles were reflected in their home literacy and number experiences. Methods and procedures: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a web-based survey from 58 parents and one foster parent of primary school children with DS (n = 35) and WS (n = 24) mostly based in the UK. The survey targeted the children’s general level of functioning and academic skills; type, format, and frequency of home learning activities; parents’ expectations for their child’s academic outcomes; parents’ attitudes towards literacy and mathematics; children’s interest towards mathematics; and the use of technology to support home learning activities. Outcomes and results: Our results showed that, overall, the home learning environment of children with DS and children with WS were similar but changed based on the child’s cognitive profile. Comparative analyses showed that parents of children with DS engaged more often in activities supporting counting than parents of children with WS, despite both groups reporting difficulties with this skill. Moreover, our results indicated that literacy-based activities occurred more often than mathematics-based activities and that the home numeracy environment was characterized by activities supporting different mathematical skills such as counting, arithmetic, and numeracy. Parents in both groups engaged with their child in both formal and informal literacy and mathematics-based activities, but informal activities occurred more often when supporting counting and number recognition skills. Conclusions and implications: The current study provides evidence that the home learning environment of children with DS and children with WS include different literacy- and mathematics-based activities and that the home learning environment changes on the basis of the child’s strengths and weaknesses.

Both learning and processing of language in children and adults, at various putative ‘levels’ of representation, appear to be highly integrated and interdependent, and function simultaneously rather than sequentially. The fact that half of the field sees these findings as trivially true and the other half argues fiercely against them suggests to us that the sciences of language are on the brink of a paradigm shift. We submit a new scientific visualization for language, in which stacked levels of linguistic representation are replaced by trajectories in a multidimensional space. This is not a mere redescription. Processing language in the brain equates to traversing such a space in regions afforded by multiple probabilistic cues that simultaneously activate different linguistic representations. Much still needs to be done to convert this scientific visualization into actual implemented models, but at present it allows language scientists to envision new concepts and venues for research that may assist the field in transitioning to a new conceptualization, and provide a clear direction for the next decade.",dynamical systems; language; language acquisition; psycholinguistics; sentence processing; scientific visualization

Information regarding the HSs’ language experience was collected by means of a parental questionnaire. Results revealed significant between-group differences concerning the total corpus and the subcorpora of nouns and verbs. Within-group comparisons showed that both groups produced significantly more nouns than verbs and more verbs than adjectives.

The prosodic transfer hypothesis (PTH) proposes that native prosodic structures may be adapted to facilitate acquisition of L2 prosodic structure. Our study presents new evidence from three Anglophone advanced learners of L2 French that indicates ceiling performance for pronoun production (99% accuracy in 300 tokens over nine interviews) and grammaticality judgment (98% accuracy). This native-like performance demonstrates target French morphosyntax and prosody, built—as predicted by the PTH—by licensing pronominal free clitics in a new pre-verbal L2 position distinct from post-verbal L1. Furthermore, the learners’ data confirms accurate prosody by way of appropriate prominence patterns in clitic + host sequences, correct use of clitics with prefixed verbs, use of stacked pronouns, as well as correct prosodic alternations involving liaison and elision.

Interestingly, bilingual children who acquire French together with German produce postverbal subjects to an extremely low degree in mean length of utterance (MLU)-phases compared with monolingual children (Jansen 2015). Arguably, they skip the postverbal subject phase and are accelerated with respect to monolingual children. In our study, we tested whether multilingualism can speed up the acquisition process in French. A production test with 62 multilingual children (starting at 2;7 acquiring two, three, or four L1s) was administered in Spain and Germany to elicit finite verbs and DP (Determiner Phrase) subjects in French. The children&rsquo;s proficiency in French was measured on the basis of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) (Dunn et al. 1993). In comparison with monolinguals studied in the literature, the bilingual children and the children who acquired more than two languages were accelerated with respect to the placement of subjects in the postverbal position. Although the multilingual children who ranked low in the PPVT exhibited all kinds of structures as responses to the test items that are characteristic of early French, such as null-subjects, root infinites and bare nouns, they did not use postverbal subjects. The absence of postverbal subjects was observed not only in children who acquired either German (or English) at the same time as French, as did the bilingual children in Jansen&rsquo;s (2015) study, but also in children who acquired, in addition to French, a Romance language like Spanish, Catalan, or Italian, all null-subject languages which allow postverbal subjects in the adult language. Following (Biberauer and Richards 2006), the extended projection principle (EPP) feature of T (Tense) can be satisfied in different ways across languages: if a DP is necessary, which it is in adult French, it can be raised from Spec,vP (specifier of vP, of the small-verb Phrase) to Spec,TP (specifier of Tense Phrase) (in which case the finite verb surfaces in T). This is the default of EPP satisfaction in T. It is this option which is facilitated and boosts the acquisition of the preverbal subject position in early bilingual, trilingual, and multilingual French. The result that the children who acquired a null-subject language such as Spanish also enjoyed an advantage in French, adult Spanish being a language that allows for postverbal subjects, indicates that it is plausible that the default character of DP-raising for EPP satisfaction, instantiated in all languages involved, is the reason for its high relevance in the early French of bilingual, trilingual, and multilingual children. If our analysis of the multilingual data is plausible, monolingual French children exhibit more variation in satisfying the EPP-feature (in T) than children who acquire one or more other languages in addition to French, an observation which goes back to (Meisel 1989).",French; postverbal subjects; EPP satisfaction; cross-linguistic influence

Contrasting switch and stay trials provided an index for whole-language inhibition, while contrasting bivalent and univalent stimuli provided an index for item-specific inhibition.

Spanish gender is encoded by word-final, unstressed vowels (/a e o/), which may diphthongize in word-boundary vowel sequences. English neutralizes unstressed final vowels and separates across-word vocalic sequences. The realization of gender vowels as schwa, due to cross-linguistic influence, may remain undetected if not directly analyzed. To explore the potential over-reporting of gender accuracy, we conducted parallel phonetic and morphosyntactic analyses of read and semi-spontaneous speech produced by 11 Monolingual speakers and 13 Early and 13 Late Spanish-English bilinguals. F1 and F2 values were extracted at five points for all word-final unstressed vowels and vowel sequences. All determiner phrases (DPs) from narratives were coded for morphological and contextual parameters. Early bilinguals exhibited clear patterns of vowel centralization and higher rates of hiatuses than the other groups. However, the morphological analysis yielded very few errors. A follow-up integrated analysis revealed that /a and o/ were realized as centralized vowels, particularly with [+Animate] nouns. We propose that bilinguals&rsquo; schwa-like realizations can be over-interpreted as target Spanish vowels. Such variable vowel realization may be a factor in the vulnerability to attrition in gender marking in Spanish as a heritage language.",Spanish-English bilinguals; gender; vowels; vowel centralization; vowel sequences

Twenty-seven monolingual Greek-speaking and twenty-nine bilingual Albanian-Greek children with ASD were tested on ToM reasoning in verbal and low-verbal ToM tasks, an executive function 2-back task, and a sentence repetition task. Results revealed that bilingual children with ASD performed better than monolinguals with ASD in the low-verbal ToM and the 2-back tasks. In the sentence repetition task, bilinguals scored higher than monolinguals in complex sentences, and specifically in adverbials and relatives. Regarding the relations between ToM, EF, and sentence repetition, the monolingual group&rsquo;s performance in the verbal ToM tasks was associated with complement syntax, whereas, for the bilingual children with ASD, performance in both verbal and low-verbal ToM tasks was associated with EF and adverbial clause repetition.

Recent studies indicate that the interaction of complex morphosyntax and variable levels of consistent input result in some aspects of Irish grammar having a long trajectory of acquisition or not being fully acquired. Indeed, for the small group of children who are L1 speakers of Irish, identifying which “end point” of this trajectory is appropriate against which to assess these children’s acquisition of Irish is difficult. In this study, data were collected from 135 proficient adult speakers and 306 children (aged 6–13 years) living in Irish-speaking (Gaeltacht) communities, using specially designed measures of grammatical gender. The results show that both quality and quantity of input appear to impact on acquisition of this aspect of Irish morphosyntax: even the children acquiring Irish in homes where Irish is the dominant language showed poor performance on tests of grammatical gender marking, and the adult performance on these tests indicate that children in Irish-speaking communities are likely to be exposed to input showing significant grammatical variability in Irish gender marking. The implications of these results will be discussed in terms of language convergence, and the need for intensive support for mother-tongue speakers of Irish.",morphosyntax; grammatical gender; bilingualism; Irish; acquisition targets

Gender-agreement violations were associated with an enhanced anterior negativity between 250 and 500 ms post-target onset in the TD children group. In contrast, children with DLD showed no such effect. This absence of the left anterior negativity (LAN) effect suggests weaker lexical representation of morphosyntactic gender features and/or non-adult-like morphosyntactic gender feature checking for the DLD children.

Nevertheless, it is a matter of debate which principles guide the adult speaker’s choice and the child’s acquisition order of these variants. Various proposals have suggested that frequency shapes adult language use and language acquisition. Taking the domain of nominal modification as its testing ground, this paper explores in two studies the role that frequency of structures plays for adults’ and children’s structural choices in German. In Study 1, 133 three- to six-year-old children and 21 adults were tested with an elicited production task prompting participants to identify an agent or a patient referent among a set of alternatives. Study 2 analyzed a corpus of child-directed speech to examine the frequency of passive relative clauses, which children, similar to adults, produced very often in Study 1. Importantly, passive relatives were found to be infrequent in the child input. These two results show that the high production rate of rare structures, such as passive relatives, is difficult to account for with frequency. We claim that the relation between frequency in natural speech and use of a given variant in a specific context is indirect: speakers may opt for the less grammatically complex computation rather than for the variant most frequently used in spontaneous speech.",frequency; relative clause; elicited production; passive; German; corpus; child-directed speech; passive subject relative clause

The results reveal the differential contribution of nonverbal cognitive skills across English and Spanish. Cognition was not significantly related to performance on either grammatical cloze or narrative tasks in Spanish. Narrative tasks in English were significantly predicted by processing speed, after controlling for age and exposure. Grammatical cloze tasks in English posed an additional cognitive demand on working memory.

Here, we examine whether timing affects acquisition of the bilingual child’s heritage language, possibly modulating the effects of environmental and child-internal factors. The performance of 6- to 12-year-old Greek heritage children residing in Germany (age of onset of German: 0–4 years) was assessed across a range of nine syntactic structures via the Greek LITMUS (Language Impairment Testing in Multilingual Settings) Sentence Repetition Task. Based on previous studies on monolingual Greek, the structures were classified as “early” (main clauses (SVO), coordination, clitics, complement clauses, sentential negation, non-referential wh-questions) or as “late” (referential wh-questions, relatives, adverbial clauses). Current family use of Greek and formal instruction in Greek (environmental), chronological age, and age of onset of German (child-internal) were assessed via the Questionnaire for Parents of Bilingual Children (PABIQ); short-term memory (child-internal) was measured via forward digit recall. Children’s scores were generally higher for early than for late acquired structures. Performance on the three early structures with the highest scores was predicted by the amount of current family use of Greek. Performance on the three late structures was additionally predicted by forward digit recall, indicating that higher short-term memory capacity is beneficial for correctly reconstructing structurally complex sentences. We suggest that the understanding of heritage language development and the role of child-internal and environmental factors will benefit from a consideration of timing in the acquisition of the different structures.",timing in acquisition; heritage language acquisition; sentence repetition; age of onset; current language use; heritage language instruction; short-term memory; Greek; early acquired phenomena; late acquired phenomena

Very few of them were longitudinal studies, which is essential to understand developmental relationships between LD and later language impairment. In this study, we compare the prevalence of LD in low-risk preterm children to that of FT children in a longitudinal design ranging from 10 to 60 months of age. We also analyze which variables are related to a higher risk of LD at 22, 30 and 60 months of age.

ANOVA comparisons between groups and logistic regression analyses to identify possible predictors of language delay at 22, 30 and 60 months of age were performed. The results found indicate that there were practically no differences between gestational age groups. Healthy PT children, therefore, do not have, in general terms, a higher risk of language delay than FT children.

The tumor-related confounds further subdivide into tumor characteristics (e.g., tumor grade) and tumor-induced conditions (aphasia). The fMRI analysis confounds represent technical aspects of fMRI methods (e.g., a fixed versus an individual threshold). Modulating factors can modify language dominance without confounding it. They are not fMRI-specific, and they can impact language dominance both in healthy individuals and neurosurgical patients.

Research investigating treatment for lexical retrieval impairment in individuals with progressive anomia has focused primarily on monolingual speakers, and treatment in bilingual speakers is relatively unexplored. In this series of single-case experiments, 10 bilingual speakers with progressive anomia received lexical retrieval treatment designed to engage relatively spared cognitive-linguistic abilities and promote word retrieval. Treatment was administered in two phases, with one language targeted per phase. Cross-linguistic cognates (e.g., rose and rosa) were included as treatment targets to investigate their potential to facilitate cross-linguistic transfer. Performance on trained and untrained stimuli was evaluated before, during, and after each phase of treatment, and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Participants demonstrated a significant treatment effect in each of their treated languages, with maintenance up to one year post-treatment for the majority of participants. Most participants showed a significant cross-linguistic transfer effect for trained cognates in both the dominant and nondominant language, with fewer than half of participants showing a significant translation effect for noncognates. A gradual diminution of translation and generalization effects was observed during the follow-up period.

These two domains were chosen as they clearly entail the two different definition types, that is, lexicographic and scientific. Results indicated that scientific school subject marks are more predictive of definitional skills than linguistic school marks are. The opposite direction (i.e., how definitional skills are predictive of school achievement) appears less clear. In sum, the results, although preliminary, suggest that definitional skills represent a bridge towards school achievement as they promote good marks in all disciplines.

However, current diagnostic techniques are not designed for frequent mass screening, delaying therapeutic intervention and worsening prognoses. To be able to detect AD at an early stage, ideally at a pre-clinical stage, speech analysis emerges as a simple low-cost non-invasive procedure. Objectives: In this work it is our objective to do a systematic review about speech-based detection and classification of Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease with the purpose of identifying the most effective algorithms and best practices. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed from Jan 2015 up to May 2020 using ScienceDirect, PubMed and DBLP. Articles were screened by title, abstract and full text as needed. A manual complementary search among the references of the included papers was also performed. Inclusion criteria and search strategies were defined a priori. Results: We were able: to identify the main resources that can support the development of decision support systems for AD, to list speech features that are correlated with the linguistic and acoustic footprint of the disease, to recognize the data models that can provide robust results and to observe the performance indicators that were reported. Discussion: A computational system with the adequate elements combination, based on the identified best-practices, can point to a whole new diagnostic approach, leading to better insights about AD symptoms and its disease patterns, creating conditions to promote a longer life span as well as an improvement in patient quality of life.

To address this issue, we used a mixed-effects modeling approach to examine the influences of test characteristics (i.e., test directions) and examinee characteristics (i.e., expressive and receptive language abilities) on cognitive test performance.

The main findings showed that self-rated proficiency in the non-English language accounted for unique variance in verbal fluency that was not accounted for directly by self-rated proficiency in English. This outcome is consistent with cross-language interference, but is also consistent with an account that assumes bilingual disadvantages in verbal fluency and picture naming are due to bilinguals having weaker links between semantic concepts and their phonological form.

How do L2 learners develop phonological categories to acquire a vocabulary when they cannot reliably tell them apart? This study aimed to test the possibility that learners establish new L2 categories but perceive phonological overlap between them when they perceive an L2 phone. That is, they perceive it to be an instance of more than one of their L2 phonological categories. If so, improvements in discrimination accuracy with L2 experience should correspond to a reduction in overlap. Japanese native speakers differing in English L2 immersion, and native English speakers, completed a forced category goodness rating task, where they rated the goodness of fit of an auditory stimulus to an English phonological category label. The auditory stimuli were 10 steps of a synthetic /r/&ndash;/l/ continuum, plus /w/ and /j/, and the category labels were L, R, W, and Y. Less experienced Japanese participants rated steps at the /l/-end of the continuum as equally good versions of /l/ and /r/, but steps at the /r/-end were rated as better versions of /r/ than /l/. For those with more than 2 years of immersion, there was a separation of goodness ratings at both ends of the continuum, but the separation was smaller than it was for the native English speakers. Thus, L2 listeners appear to perceive a phonological overlap between /r/ and /l/. Their performance on the task also accounted for their responses on /r/&ndash;/l/ identification and AXB discrimination tasks. As perceived phonological overlap appears to improve with immersion experience, assessing category overlap may be useful for tracking L2 phonological development.",Perceptual Assimilation Model; second language speech learning; English /r/ and /l/; Japanese; English as a second language; categorical perception; speech perception

An Analysis through a Battery of Behavioral Tests,article,Languages,MDPI,"Background: The present study aims to investigate the effect of the first language (L1) orthography on the perception of the second language (L2) vowel contrasts and whether orthographic effects occur at the sublexical level. Methods: Fourteen adult Greek learners of English participated in two AXB discrimination tests: one auditory and one orthography test. In the auditory test, participants listened to triads of auditory stimuli that targeted specific English vowel contrasts embedded in nonsense words and were asked to decide if the middle vowel was the same as the first or the third vowel by clicking on the corresponding labels. The orthography test followed the same procedure as the auditory test, but instead, the two labels contained grapheme representations of the target vowel contrasts. Results: All but one vowel contrast could be more accurately discriminated in the auditory than in the orthography test. The use of nonsense words in the elicitation task eradicated the possibility of a lexical effect of orthography on auditory processing, leaving space for the interpretation of this effect on a sublexical basis, primarily prelexical and secondarily postlexical. Conclusions: L2 auditory processing is subject to L1 orthography influence.

By framing avian &ldquo;second-song&rdquo; (S2) learning and use within the human second-language (L2) context, we lay the groundwork for a scientifically-rich dialogue between disciplines. We begin by summarizing basic birdsong research, focusing on how songs are learned and on constraints on learning. We then consider commonalities in vocal learning across humans and birds, in particular the timing and neural mechanisms of learning, variability of input, and variability of outcomes. For S2 and L2 learning outcomes, we address the respective roles of age, entrenchment, and social interactions. We proceed to orient current and future birdsong inquiry around foundational features of human bilingualism: L1 effects on the L2, L1 attrition, and L1&lt;&ndash;&gt;L2 switching. Throughout, we highlight characteristics that are shared across species as well as the need for caution in interpreting birdsong research.

Smart classroom research has been quickly implemented to enhance education systems, resulting in higher engagement and empowerment of students, educators, and administrators. Despite decades of using emerging technology to improve teaching practices, critics often point out that methods miss adequate theoretical and technical foundations. As a result, there have been a number of conflicting reviews on different perspectives of smart classrooms. For a realistic smart classroom approach, a piecemeal implementation is insufficient. This survey contributes to the current literature by presenting a comprehensive analysis of various disciplines using a standard terminology and taxonomy. This multi-field study reveals new research possibilities and problems that must be tackled in order to integrate interdisciplinary works in a synergic manner. Our analysis shows that smart classroom is a rapidly developing research area that complements a number of emerging technologies.

Empowerment, a pillar of CBR, involves strengthening the capacity of people with disabilities, their families, and their communities to ensure reduction of disparities. This article outlines a scoping review that guided by the question: “What is known from the existing literature about the applicability of eLearning for capacity building in CBR?” This review did not uncover literature related to eLearning in CBR; however findings suggest that other disciplines, not explicitly tied to CBR, currently use eLearning to educate and empower professionals in the global south. We argue that eLearning technology could be an effective and sustainable solution for CBR programming in the global south for capacity development. Such technology could increase individuals with disabilities’ access to education and could provide opportunities for wider dissemination of knowledge, beyond typical funding cycles. With a goal of informing future CBR practice in eLearning, this article concludes by highlighting key lessons taken from other disciplines that have utilized eLearning in the global south.",eLearning; community based rehabilitation; global south; capacity building; sustainability

In heterogeneous classes the need for tailored direct teacher instruction is dependent upon students&rsquo; instructional needs. Realist review methodology is used to study how instructional strategies can add to catering for students&rsquo; different needs. The focus lies on two proactive strategies in which teachers cater for these differences, namely preteaching and extended instruction. The aim of this realist review is to verify how preteaching and extended instruction may contribute to catering for students&rsquo; different instructional needs. It is noticed that the complexity of differentiated teaching is not always reflected in studies on preteaching and extended instruction. The focus of many studies lies in measuring learning progress in a linear and fixed way for a selected group of students which is not aligned with theory on differentiated instruction which suggests cyclical teaching processes. To respond to students&rsquo; needs ongoing monitoring of cognitive and affective indicators of learning is needed.

We propose that concurrent enrollment programs are an under-recognized tool for extending the impact of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). The context of our study is an equity-focused university course in algebraic mathematical modeling that is also offered through concurrent enrollment in over 30 secondary schools to over 800 secondary students annually in our state of Minnesota, U.S.A. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of secondary school teachers&rsquo; experiences implementing the inquiry pedagogy and the equity goals of the course. Several results are important for UDL. Teachers (1) describe equity in social terms of race, ethnicity, income, immigration, and language status in addition to measures of academic success; (2) perceive improvements in students&rsquo; attitudes towards mathematics, school, and university education; (3) perceive student academic growth through mathematical writing; and (4) report close relationships with students. If higher education faculty design their on-campus classes to incorporate UDL principles, concurrent enrollment offers the potential to improve inclusive pathways from secondary schools to universities.",Undergraduate mathematics; mathematical modeling; inquiry learning; equity; access to higher education; universal design for learning; universal instructional design

We report the results from three experiments investigating German speakers’ agreement preferences with complex subjects joined by the correlative conjunctions sowohl…als auch (‘both…and’), weder…noch (‘neither…nor’) or entweder…oder (‘either…or’). We examine to what extent conjunction type and a conjunct’s relative proximity to the verb affect the acceptability and processibility of singular vs. plural agreement. Experiment 1 was an untimed acceptability rating task, Experiment 2 a timed sentence completion task, and Experiment 3 was a self-paced reading task. Taken together, our results show that number agreement with correlative coordination in German is primarily determined by a default constraint triggering plural agreement, which interacts with linear order and semantic factors. Semantic differences between conjunctions only affected speakers’ agreement preferences in the absence of processing pressure but not their initial agreement computation. The combined results from our offline and online experimental measures of German speakers’ agreement preferences suggest that the constraints under investigation do not only differ in their relative weighting but also in their relative timing during agreement computation.",correlative coordination; subject–verb agreement; German

Nevertheless, a considerable number of patients sustain aphasia and require speech and language therapy to overcome the difficulties. As a preliminary study, this article aims to distinguish aphasia caused from a temporoparietal lesion. Typically, temporal and parietal lesions cause Wernicke&rsquo;s aphasia and Anomic aphasia. Differential diagnosis between Anomic and Wernicke&rsquo;s has become controversial and subjective due to the close resemblance of Wernicke&rsquo;s to Anomic aphasia when recovering. Hence, this article proposes a clinical diagnosis system that incorporates normal coupling between the acoustic frequencies of speech signals and the language ability of temporoparietal aphasias to delineate classification boundary lines. The proposed inspection system is a hybrid scheme consisting of automated components, such as confrontation naming, repetition, and a manual component, such as comprehension. The study was conducted involving 30 participants clinically diagnosed with temporoparietal aphasias after a stroke and 30 participants who had experienced a stroke without aphasia. The plausibility of accurate classification of Wernicke&rsquo;s and Anomic aphasia was confirmed using the distinctive acoustic frequency profiles of selected controls. Accuracy of the proposed system and algorithm was confirmed by comparing the obtained diagnosis with the conventional manual diagnosis. Though this preliminary work distinguishes between Anomic and Wernicke&rsquo;s aphasia, we can claim that the developed algorithm-based inspection model could be a worthwhile solution towards objective classification of other aphasia types.",objective diagnosis; aphasia; hybrid aphasia diagnosis; acoustic frequency analysis

Reasonably, the systems reported in the literature within this field show significantly lower performance than those focused on transcribing non-pathological clean speech. It is mainly due to the difficulty of recognizing a more unintelligible voice, as well as due to the scarcity of annotated aphasic data. This work is mainly focused on applying novel semi-supervised learning methods to the AphasiaBank dataset in order to deal with these two major issues, reporting improvements for the English language and providing the first benchmark for the Spanish language for which less than one hour of transcribed aphasic speech was used for training. In addition, the influence of reinforcing the training and decoding processes with out-of-domain acoustic and text data is described by using different strategies and configurations to fine-tune the hyperparameters and the final recognition systems.
