AB  - The industry of intangible cultural heritage (ICH) tourism continues to grow, and social media can serve as an essential tool to promote this trend. Although ICH tourism development is outstanding in China, the language structure and restricted use of social media render ICH difficult for non-Chinese speakers to understand. Using content analysis, this study investigates the structure and relationships among cognitive elements of ICH tourism based on 9074 blogs posted between 2011 and 2020 on Weibo.com, one of the most popular social media platforms in China. The main analysis process consisted of matrix construction, dimension classification, and semantic network analysis. Findings indicated that the cognitive image of ICH tourism on social media can be divided into seven dimensions: institutions, ICH and inheritors, tourism products, traditional festivals and seasons, tourism facilities and services, visitors, and regions. This network vividly illustrates ICH tourism and depicts the roles of organizers, residents, inheritors, and tourists. Among these elements, institutions hold the greatest power to regulate and control ICH tourism activities, and folklore appears to be the most common type of ICH resource that can be developed into tourism activities. Practically, the results offer insight for policymakers regarding ways to better balance the relationships among heritage protection, the business economy, and people’s well-being. Such strategies can promote the industrialization of ICH tourism. In addition, through content analysis, this paper confirms the effectiveness of social media in providing a richer understanding of ICH tourism.

AB  - In recent years, rapid development has been made to the Internet of Things communication technologies, infrastructure, and physical resources management. These developments and research trends address challenges such as heterogeneous communication, quality of service requirements, unpredictable network conditions, and a massive influx of data. One major contribution to the research world is in the form of software-defined networking applications, which aim to deploy rule-based management to control and add intelligence to the network using high-level policies to have integral control of the network without knowing issues related to low-level configurations. Machine learning techniques coupled with software-defined networking can make the networking decision more intelligent and robust. The Internet of Things application has recently adopted virtualization of resources and network control with software-defined networking policies to make the traffic more controlled and maintainable. However, the requirements of software-defined networking and the Internet of Things must be aligned to make the adaptations possible. This paper aims to discuss the possible ways to make software-defined networking enabled Internet of Things application and discusses the challenges solved using the Internet of Things leveraging the software-defined network. We provide a topical survey of the application and impact of software-defined networking on the Internet of things networks. We also study the impact of machine learning techniques applied to software-defined networking and its application perspective. The study is carried out from the different perspectives of software-based Internet of Things networks, including wide-area networks, edge networks, and access networks. Machine learning techniques are presented from the perspective of network resources management, security, classification of traffic, quality of experience, and quality of service prediction. Finally, we discuss challenges and issues in adopting machine learning and software-defined networking for the Internet of Things applications.

TI  - Snake-Based Model for Automatic Roof Boundary Extraction in the Object Space Integrating a High-Resolution Aerial Images Stereo Pair and 3D Roof Models

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The accelerated urban development over the last decades has made it necessary to update spatial information rapidly and constantly. Therefore, cities’ three-dimensional models have been widely used as a study base for various urban problems. However, although many efforts have been made to develop new building extraction methods, reliable and automatic extraction is still a major challenge for the remote sensing and computer vision communities, mainly due to the complexity and variability of urban scenes. This paper presents a method to extract building roof boundaries in the object space by integrating a high-resolution aerial images stereo pair, three-dimensional roof models reconstructed from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and contextual information of the scenes involved. The proposed method focuses on overcoming three types of common problems that can disturb the automatic roof extraction in the urban environment: perspective occlusions caused by high buildings, occlusions caused by vegetation covering the roof, and shadows that are adjacent to the roofs, which can be misinterpreted as roof edges. For this, an improved Snake-based mathematical model is developed considering the radiometric and geometric properties of roofs to represent the roof boundary in the image space. A new approach for calculating the corner response and a shadow compensation factor was added to the model. The created model is then adapted to represent the boundaries in the object space considering a stereo pair of aerial images. Finally, the optimal polyline, representing a selected roof boundary, is obtained by optimizing the proposed Snake-based model using a dynamic programming (DP) approach considering the contextual information of the scene. The results showed that the proposed method works properly in boundary extraction of roofs with occlusion and shadows areas, presenting completeness and correctness average values above 90%, RMSE average values below 0.5 m for E and N components, and below 1 m for H component.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - CNN is particularly effective in extracting spatial features. However, the single-layer classifier constructed by activation function in CNN is easily interfered by image noise, resulting in reduced classification accuracy. To solve the problem, the advanced ensemble model XGBoost is used to overcome the deficiency of a single classifier to classify image features. To further distinguish the extracted image features, a CNN-XGBoost image classification model optimized by APSO is proposed, where APSO optimizes the hyper-parameters on the overall architecture to promote the fusion of the two-stage model. The model is mainly composed of two parts: feature extractor CNN, which is used to automatically extract spatial features from images; feature classifier XGBoost is applied to classify features extracted after convolution. In the process of parameter optimization, to overcome the shortcoming that traditional PSO algorithm easily falls into a local optimal, the improved APSO guide the particles to search for optimization in space by two different strategies, which improves the diversity of particle population and prevents the algorithm from becoming trapped in local optima. The results on the image set show that the proposed model gets better results in image classification. Moreover, the APSO-XGBoost model performs well on the credit data, which indicates that the model has a good ability of credit scoring.

TI  - Movement Tube Detection Network Integrating 3D CNN and Object Detection Framework to Detect Fall

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 8
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Unlike most of the existing neural network-based fall detection methods, which only detect fall at the time range, the algorithm proposed in this paper detect fall in both spatial and temporal dimension. A movement tube detection network integrating 3D CNN and object detection framework such as SSD is proposed to detect human fall with constrained movement tubes. The constrained movement tube, which encapsulates the person with a sequence of bounding boxes, has the merits of encapsulating the person closely and avoiding peripheral interference. A 3D convolutional neural network is used to encode the motion and appearance features of a video clip, which are fed into the tube anchors generation layer, softmax classification, and movement tube regression layer. The movement tube regression layer fine tunes the tube anchors to the constrained movement tubes. A large-scale spatio-temporal (LSST) fall dataset is constructed using self-collected data to evaluate the fall detection in both spatial and temporal dimensions. LSST has three characteristics of large scale, annotation, and posture and viewpoint diversities. Furthermore, the comparative experiments on a public dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieved sensitivity, specificity an accuracy of 100%, 97.04%, and 97.23%, respectively, outperforms the existing methods.

SN  - 2199-8531

AB  - The development of start-ups is a driving force of the local and regional economy. Therefore, it should be in the interest of municipal authorities to take actions for their organizational and resource support. In the conditions of limited public resources, however, it is a difficult and multifaceted task. Therefore, in this article, the authors attempt to determine the influence of local conditions on the establishment of start-ups. As a natural environment for the development of this type of entrepreneurship, cities were considered in which accessibility to infrastructure and human resources is high, and thus, by definition, conducive to creativity and innovation. Such a formulations of the objective and scope of the research allowed the existing theoretical and research gaps to be filled, relating to the identification and establishment of a hierarchy of local determinants of creating start-ups in the urban environment. The research in question was carried out on a representative sample of 287 Polish cities using questionnaire techniques and structural modelling. The results confirm the dominant influence of human and financial capital on the establishment of start-ups. The research also shows a slightly less significant influence of business incubators and technology parks on the creation of start-ups, which implies the need to improve the performance of these entities. The results also point to the positive role of direct city involvement in the development of this form of entrepreneurship.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The proliferation of distributed renewable energy resources (RESs) poses major challenges to the operation of microgrids due to uncertainty. Traditional online scheduling approaches relying on accurate forecasts become difficult to implement due to the increase of uncertain RESs. Although several data-driven methods have been proposed recently to overcome the challenge, they generally suffer from a scalability issue due to the limited ability to optimize high-dimensional continuous control variables. To address these issues, we propose a data-driven online scheduling method for microgrid energy optimization based on continuous-control deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We formulate the online scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). The objective is to minimize the operating cost of the microgrid considering the uncertainty of RESs generation, load demand, and electricity prices. To learn the optimal scheduling strategy, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based network is designed to extract temporal features of uncertainty and generate the optimal scheduling decisions in an end-to-end manner. To optimize the policy with high-dimensional and continuous actions, proximal policy optimization (PPO) is employed to train the neural network-based policy in a data-driven fashion. The proposed method does not require any forecasting information on the uncertainty or a prior knowledge of the physical model of the microgrid. Simulation results using realistic power system data of California Independent System Operator (CAISO) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - With the rapid increase in the world’s population, there is an ever-growing need for a sustainable food supply. Agriculture is one of the pillars for worldwide food provisioning, with fruits and vegetables being essential for a healthy diet. However, in the last few years the worldwide dispersion of virulent plant pests and diseases has caused significant decreases in the yield and quality of crops, in particular fruit, cereal and vegetables. Climate change and the intensification of global trade flows further accentuate the issue. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an approach to pest control that aims at maintaining pest insects at tolerable levels, keeping pest populations below an economic injury level. Under these circumstances, the early identification of pests and diseases becomes crucial. In this work, we present the first step towards a fully fledged, semantically enhanced decision support system for IPM. The ultimate goal is to build a complete agricultural knowledge base by gathering data from multiple, heterogeneous sources and to develop a system to assist farmers in decision making concerning the control of pests and diseases. The pest classifier framework has been evaluated in a simulated environment, obtaining an aggregated accuracy of 98.8%.

AB  - Worldwide increasing awareness of energy sustainability issues has been the main driver in developing the concepts of (Nearly) Zero Energy Buildings, where the reduced energy consumptions are (nearly) fully covered by power locally generated by renewable sources. At the same time, recent advances in Internet of Things technologies are among the main enablers of Smart Homes and Buildings. The transition of conventional buildings into active environments that process, elaborate and react to online measured environmental quantities is being accelerated by the aspects related to COVID-19, most notably in terms of air exchange and the monitoring of the density of occupants. In this paper, we address the problem of maximizing the energy efficiency and comfort perceived by occupants, defined in terms of thermal comfort, visual comfort and air quality. The case study of the University of Pisa is considered as a practical example to show preliminary results of the aggregation of environmental data.

AB  - Currently, private universities, as a result of the pandemic that the world is facing, are going through very delicate moments in several areas, both academic and financial. Academically, there are learning problems and these are directly related to the dropout rate, which brings financial problems. Added to this are the economic problems caused by the pandemic, where the rates of students who want to access a private education have dropped considerably. For this reason, it is necessary for all private universities to have support to improve their student income and avoid cuts in budgets and resources. However, the academic part represents a great effort to fulfill their academic activities, which are the priority, with attention on those interested in pursuing a training programs. To solve these problems, it is important to integrate technologies such as Chatbots, which use artificial intelligence in such a way that tasks such as providing information on an academic courses are addressed by them, reducing the administrative burden and improving the user experience. At the same time, this encourages people to be a part of the college.

AB  - Infrastructure is a fundamental sector for sustainable development and Earth observation has great potentials for sustainable infrastructure development (SID). However, implementations of the timely, large–scale and multi–source Earth observation are still limited in satisfying the huge global requirements of SID. This study presents a systematical literature review to identify trends of Earth observation for sustainable infrastructure (EOSI), investigate the relationship between EOSI and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and explore challenges and future directions of EOSI. Results reveal the close associations of infrastructure, urban development, ecosystems, climate, Earth observation and GIS in EOSI, and indicate their relationships. In addition, from the perspective of EOSI–SDGs relationship, the huge potentials of EOSI are demonstrated from the 70% of the infrastructure influenced targets that can be directly or indirectly derived from Earth observation data, but have not been included in current SDG indicators. Finally, typical EOSI cases are presented to indicate challenges and future research directions. This review emphasizes the contributions and potentials of Earth observation to SID and EOSI is a powerful pathway to deliver on SDGs.

AB  - The field of electric vehicle charging load modelling has been growing rapidly in the last decade. In light of the Paris Agreement, it is crucial to keep encouraging better modelling techniques for successful electric vehicle adoption. Additionally, numerous papers highlight the lack of charging station data available in order to build models that are consistent with reality. In this context, the purpose of this article is threefold. First, to provide the reader with an overview of the open datasets available and ready to be used in order to foster reproducible research in the field. Second, to review electric vehicle charging load models with their strengths and weaknesses. Third, to provide suggestions on matching the models reviewed to six datasets found in this research that have not previously been explored in the literature. The open data search covered more than 860 repositories and yielded around 60 datasets that are relevant for modelling electric vehicle charging load. These datasets include information on charging point locations, historical and real-time charging sessions, traffic counts, travel surveys and registered vehicles. The models reviewed range from statistical characterization to stochastic processes and machine learning and the context of their application is assessed.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) architecture, based on which a number of vehicles are served by UAVs equipped with computation resource. Each vehicle has to offload its computing tasks to the proper MEC server on the UAV due to the limited computation ability. To counter the problems above, we first model and analyze the transmission model and the security assurance model from the vehicle to the MEC server on UAV, and the task computation model of the local vehicle and the edge UAV. Then, the vehicle offloading problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem by jointly considering the task offloading, the resource allocation, and the security assurance. For tackling this hard problem, we decouple the multi-objective optimization problem as two subproblems and propose an efficient iterative algorithm to jointly make the MEC selection decision based on the criteria of load balancing and optimize the offloading ratio and the computation resource according to the Lagrangian dual decomposition. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves significant performance superiority compared with other schemes in terms of the successful task processing ratio and the task processing delay.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral remote sensing is an important monitoring technology for the soil moisture content (SMC) of agroecological systems in arid regions. This technology develops precision farming and agricultural informatization. However, hyperspectral data are generally used in data mining. In this study, UAV-based hyperspectral imaging data with a resolution o 4 cm and totaling 70 soil samples (0–10 cm) were collected from farmland (2.5 × 104 m2) near Fukang City, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Four estimation strategies were tested: the original image (strategy I), first- and second-order derivative methods (strategy II), the fractional-order derivative (FOD) technique (strategy III), and the optimal fractional order combined with the optimal multiband indices (strategy IV). These strategies were based on the eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) algorithm, with the aim of building the best estimation model for agricultural SMC in arid regions. The results demonstrated that FOD technology could effectively mine information (with an absolute maximum correlation coefficient of 0.768). By comparison, strategy IV yielded the best estimates out of the methods tested (R2val = 0.921, RMSEP = 1.943, and RPD = 2.736) for the SMC. The model derived from the order of 0.4 within strategy IV worked relatively well among the different derivative methods (strategy I, II, and III). In conclusion, the combination of FOD technology and the optimal multiband indices generated a highly accurate model within the XGBoost algorithm for SMC estimation. This research provided a promising data mining approach for UAV-based hyperspectral imaging data.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have huge potential to efficiently manage the automated operation of the internet of things (IoT) nodes deployed in smart cities. In smart cities, the major IoT applications are smart traffic monitoring, smart waste management, smart buildings and patient healthcare monitoring. The small size IoT nodes based on low power Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) standard and wireless sensor networks (WSN) (IEEE 802.15.4) standard are generally used for transmission of data to a remote location using gateways. The WSN based IoT (WSN-IoT) design problems include network coverage and connectivity issues, energy consumption, bandwidth requirement, network lifetime maximization, communication protocols and state of the art infrastructure. In this paper, the authors propose machine learning methods as an optimization tool for regular WSN-IoT nodes deployed in smart city applications. As per the author’s knowledge, this is the first in-depth literature survey of all ML techniques in the field of low power consumption WSN-IoT for smart cities. The results of this unique survey article show that the supervised learning algorithms have been most widely used (61%) as compared to reinforcement learning (27%) and unsupervised learning (12%) for smart city applications.

AB  - Year after year, mobile malware attacks grow in both sophistication and diffusion. As the open source Android platform continues to dominate the market, malware writers consider it as their preferred target. Almost strictly, state-of-the-art mobile malware detection solutions in the literature capitalize on machine learning to detect pieces of malware. Nevertheless, our findings clearly indicate that the majority of existing works utilize different metrics and models and employ diverse datasets and classification features stemming from disparate analysis techniques, i.e., static, dynamic, or hybrid. This complicates the cross-comparison of the various proposed detection schemes and may also raise doubts about the derived results. To address this problem, spanning a period of the last seven years, this work attempts to schematize the so far ML-powered malware detection approaches and techniques by organizing them under four axes, namely, the age of the selected dataset, the analysis type used, the employed ML techniques, and the chosen performance metrics. Moreover, based on these axes, we introduce a converging scheme which can guide future Android malware detection techniques and provide a solid baseline to machine learning practices in this field.

AB  - With the concept of Internet-of-Things, autonomous vehicles can provide higher driving efficiency, traffic safety, and freedom for the driver to perform other tasks. This paper first covers enabling technology involving a vehicle moving out of parking, traveling on the road, and parking at the destination. The development of autonomous vehicles relies on the data collected for deployment in actual road conditions. Research gaps and recommendations for autonomous intelligent vehicles are included. For example, a sudden obstacle while the autonomous vehicle executes the parking trajectory on the road is discussed. Several aspects of social problems, such as the liability of an accident affecting the autonomous vehicle, are described. A smart device to detect abnormal driving behaviors to prevent possible accidents is briefly discussed.

AB  - To address the problem of a serious Internet of Things (IoT) talent shortage, the Chinese government is encouraging universities and institutions to establish a major in IoT Engineering to train high-level IoT talent. Since 2011, 700 Chinese universities and institutions have established IoT Engineering undergraduate programs. We surveyed the history, status, curriculum, and problems of IoT undergraduate degree programs in China. Based on data collected from faculties, students, and graduates, we found that the IoT Engineering curriculum was an unsystematic patchwork and was deficient in practical platforms. We then provide suggestions for further development and exploration of IoT education by presenting a Technical Knowledge Map of IoT Engineering. This survey work on Chinese IoT education can prompt Chinese educators to reflect on its achievements and problems, which will contribute to IoT talent cultivation worldwide.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a topic of intense interest among the research and industrial community as it has had a revolutionary impact on human life. The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart devices, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart city, smart grid, among others. IoT devices’ security has become a serious concern nowadays, especially for the healthcare domain, where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security solutions are well established. However, due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the context-aware IoT security solutions, especially for a sensitive use case like IoT healthcare environment.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Technologies and services towards smart-vehicles and Intelligent-Transportation-Systems (ITS), continues to revolutionize many aspects of human life. This paper presents a detailed survey of current techniques and advancements in Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition (ANPR) systems, with a comprehensive performance comparison of various real-time tested and simulated algorithms, including those involving computer vision (CV). ANPR technology has the ability to detect and recognize vehicles by their number-plates using recognition techniques. Even with the best algorithms, a successful ANPR system deployment may require additional hardware to maximize its accuracy. The number plate condition, non-standardized formats, complex scenes, camera quality, camera mount position, tolerance to distortion, motion-blur, contrast problems, reflections, processing and memory limitations, environmental conditions, indoor/outdoor or day/night shots, software-tools or other hardware-based constraint may undermine its performance. This inconsistency, challenging environments and other complexities make ANPR an interesting field for researchers. The Internet-of-Things is beginning to shape future of many industries and is paving new ways for ITS. ANPR can be well utilized by integrating with RFID-systems, GPS, Android platforms and other similar technologies. Deep-Learning techniques are widely utilized in CV field for better detection rates. This research aims to advance the state-of-knowledge in ITS (ANPR) built on CV algorithms; by citing relevant prior work, analyzing and presenting a survey of extraction, segmentation and recognition techniques whilst providing guidelines on future trends in this area.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UAVs) are dramatically evolving and promoting several civil applications. However, they are still prone to many security issues that threaten public safety. Security becomes even more challenging when they are connected to the Internet as their data stream is exposed to attacks. Unmanned traffic management (UTM) represents one of the most important topics for small unmanned aerial systems for beyond-line-of-sight operations in controlled low-altitude airspace. However, without securing the flight path exchanges between drones and ground stations or control centers, serious security threats may lead to disastrous situations. For example, a predefined flight path could be easily altered to make the drone perform illegal operations. Motivated by these facts, this paper discusses the security issues for UTM’s components and addresses the security requirements for such systems. Moreover, we propose UTM-Chain, a lightweight blockchain-based security solution using hyperledger fabric for UTM of low-altitude UAVs which fits the computational and storage resources limitations of UAVs. Moreover, UTM-Chain provides secure and unalterable traffic data between the UAVs and their ground control stations. The performance of the proposed system related to transaction latency and resource utilization is analyzed by using cAdvisor. Finally, the analysis of security aspects demonstrates that the proposed UTM-Chain scheme is feasible and extensible for the secure sharing of UAV data.

TI  - Sentiment Analysis of Students’ Feedback with NLP and Deep Learning: A Systematic Mapping Study
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In the last decade, sentiment analysis has been widely applied in many domains, including business, social networks and education. Particularly in the education domain, where dealing with and processing students’ opinions is a complicated task due to the nature of the language used by students and the large volume of information, the application of sentiment analysis is growing yet remains challenging. Several literature reviews reveal the state of the application of sentiment analysis in this domain from different perspectives and contexts. However, the body of literature is lacking a review that systematically classifies the research and results of the application of natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) solutions for sentiment analysis in the education domain. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping study to structure the published information available. We used a stepwise PRISMA framework to guide the search process and searched for studies conducted between 2015 and 2020 in the electronic research databases of the scientific literature. We identified 92 relevant studies out of 612 that were initially found on the sentiment analysis of students’ feedback in learning platform environments. The mapping results showed that, despite the identified challenges, the field is rapidly growing, especially regarding the application of DL, which is the most recent trend. We identified various aspects that need to be considered in order to contribute to the maturity of research and development in the field. Among these aspects, we highlighted the need of having structured datasets, standardized solutions and increased focus on emotional expression and detection.

This paper primarily overviews recent studies on the scenes of intersection, aiming at improving the efficiency or guaranteeing the safety when vehicles pass the crossing. These studies are respectively surveyed from the perspectives of efficiency and safety. Firstly, recent contributions to efficiency-oriented, intersection management overviews from four scenes, including congestion avoidance, green light optimized speed advisory (GLOSA), trajectory planning, and emergency vehicle priority preemption control. Furthermore, the studies on intersection collision detection and abnormal information warning are surveyed in the safety category.

AB  - Sharing data and services in the Internet of Things (IoT) can give rise to significant security concerns with information being sensitive and vulnerable to attacks. In such an environment, objects can be either public resources or owned by humans. For this reason, the need of monitoring the reliability of all involved actors, both persons and smart objects, assuring that they really are who they claim to be, is becoming an essential property of the IoT, with the increase in the pervasive adoption of such a paradigm. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a new framework, called H2O (Human to Object). Our solution is able to continuously authenticate an entity in the network, providing a reliability assessment mechanism based on behavioral fingerprinting. A detailed security analysis evaluates the robustness of the proposed protocol; furthermore, a performance analysis shows the feasibility of our approach.

T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Many algorithms use clustering to improve vehicular ad hoc network performance. The expected points of many of these approaches support multiple rounds of data to the roadside unit and constantly include clustering in every round of single-hop data transmission towards the road side unit; however, the clustering in every round maximizes the number of control messages and there could be the possibility of collision and decreases in network energy. Multi-hop transmission prolongs the cluster head node’s lifetime and boosts the network’s efficiency. Accordingly, this article proposes a new fuzzy-clustering-based routing algorithm to benefit from multi-hop transmission clustering simultaneously. This research has analyzed the limitation of clustering in each round, different algorithms were used to perform the clustering, and multi-hop routing was used to transfer the data of every cluster to the road side unit. The fuzzy logic was used to choose the head node of each cluster. Three parameters, (1) distance of each node, (2) remaining energy, and (3) number of neighbors of every node, were considered as fuzzy criteria. The results of this research were compared to various other algorithms in relation to parameters like dead node in every round, first node expire, half node expire, last node expire, and the network lifetime. The simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other methods. On the other hand, the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) environment is vulnerable at the time of data transmission. The NS-2 software tool was used to simulate and evaluate the proposed fuzzy logic opportunistic routing’s performance results concerning end-to-end delay, packet delivery, and network throughput. We compare to the existing protocols, such as fuzzy Internet of Things (IoT), two fuzzy, and Fuzzy-Based Driver Monitoring System (FDMS). The performance comparison also emphasizes an effective utilization of the resources. Simulations on the highway environment show that the suggested protocol has an improved Quality of Service (QoS) efficiency compared to the above published methods in the literature.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Traffic congestion in expressway networks has a strong negative influence on regional development. Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of traffic congestion in expressway networks is critical for improving the exchange of products in regional production and promoting regional economic development. Nevertheless, existing studies pay less attention to these spatiotemporal patterns of traffic congestion. Considering that Origin–Destination (OD) data are available for the recorded spatial movements of vehicles in expressways, this study proposes a method with which to explore traffic congestion at the level of road segments in the regional expressway network, the mainstream of driving behaviors, and traffic regulations. Methods for analyzing spatial disparity and temporal changes in traffic congestion in expressway networks are also put forward in this paper. The empirical results show that the proposed methods could detect road segments where traffic congestion happens, and then uncover temporal patterns of several congested locations and spatial patterns of road segments with frequent congestion. These spatiotemporal patterns of traffic congestion could be in accord with the actual situation. This study provides a new approach to investigating traffic congestion in expressway networks based on low-cost data, which might be helpful for optimizing expressway network planning and promoting balanced regional development.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT)-based target tracking system is required for applications such as smart farm, smart factory, and smart city where many sensor devices are jointly connected to collect the moving target positions. Each sensor device continuously runs on battery-operated power, consuming energy while perceiving target information in a particular environment. To reduce sensor device energy consumption in real-time IoT tracking applications, many traditional methods such as clustering, information-driven, and other approaches have previously been utilized to select the best sensor. However, applying machine learning methods, particularly deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL), to address the problem of sensor selection in tracking applications is quite demanding because of the limited sensor node battery lifetime. In this study, we proposed a long short-term memory deep Q-network (DQN)-based Deep RL target tracking model to overcome the problem of energy consumption in IoT target applications. The proposed method is utilized to select the energy-efficient best sensor while tracking the target. The best sensor is defined by the minimum distance function (i.e., derived as the state), which leads to lower energy consumption. The simulation results show favorable features in terms of the best sensor selection and energy consumption.

AB  - In the digital era, almost every system is connected to a digital platform to enhance efficiency. Although life is thus improved, security issues remain important, especially in the healthcare sector. The privacy and security of healthcare records is paramount; data leakage is socially unacceptable. Therefore, technology that protects data but does not compromise efficiency is essential. Blockchain technology has gained increasing attention as it ensures transparency, trust, privacy, and security. However, the critical factors affecting efficiency require further study. Here, we define the critical factors that affect blockchain implementation in the healthcare industry. We extracted such factors from the literature and from experts, then used interpretive structural modeling to define the interrelationships among these factors and classify them according to driving and dependence forces. This identified key drivers of the desired objectives. Regulatory clarity and governance (F2), immature technology (F3), high investment cost (F6), blockchain developers (F9), and trust among stakeholders (F12) are key factors to consider when seeking to implement blockchain technology in healthcare. Our analysis will allow managers to understand the requirements for successful implementation.

AB  - Instagram is perhaps the most rapidly gaining in popularity of photo and video sharing social networking applications. It has been widely adopted by both end-users and organizations, posting their personal experiences or expressing their opinion during significant events and periods of crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the search for effective vaccine treatment. We identify the three major companies involved in vaccine research and extract their Instagram posts, after vaccination has started, as well as users’ reception using respective hashtags, constructing the datasets. Statistical differences regarding the companies are initially presented, on textual, as well as visual features, i.e., image classification by transfer learning. Appropriate preprocessing of English language posts and content analysis is subsequently performed, by automatically annotating the posts as one of four intent classes, thus facilitating the training of nine classifiers for a potential application capable of predicting user’s intent. By designing and carrying out a controlled experiment we validate that the resulted algorithms’ accuracy ranking is significant, identifying the two best performing algorithms; this is further improved by ensemble techniques. Finally, polarity analysis on users’ posts, leveraging a convolutional neural network, reveals a rather neutral to negative sentiment, with highly polarized user posts’ distributions.

The aim of this study was to perform a short-term prediction of traffic flow in Madrid, using different types of neural network architectures with a focus on convolutional residual neural networks, and it compared them with a classical time series analysis. The proposed convolutional residual neural network is superior in all of the metrics studied, and the predictions are adapted to various situations, such as holidays or possible sensor failures.

AB  - This article proposes a new framework for a Cloud-based eHealth platform concept focused on Cloud computing environments, since current and emerging approaches using digital clinical history increasingly demonstrate their potential in maintaining the quality of the benefits in medical care services, especially in computer-assisted clinical diagnosis within the field of infectious diseases and due to the worsening of chronic pathologies. Our objective is to evaluate and contrast the performance of the architectural patterns most commonly used for developing eHealth applications (i.e., service-oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices architecture (MSA)), using as reference the quantitative values obtained from the various performance tests and their ability to adapt to the required software attribute (i.e., versatile high-performance). Therefore, it was necessary to modify our platform to fit two architectural variants. As a follow-up to this activity, corresponding tests were performed that showed that the MSA variant functions better in terms of performance and response time compared to the SOA variant; however, it consumed significantly more bandwidth than SOA, and scalability in SOA is generally not possible or requires significant effort to be achieved. We conclude that the implementation of SOA and MSA depends on the nature and needs of organizations (e.g., performance or interoperability).

AB  - Studies on human mobility have a long history with increasingly strong interdisciplinary connections across social science, environmental science, information and technology, computer science, engineering, and health science. However, what is lacking in the current research is a synthesis of the studies to identify the evolutional pathways and future research directions. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic review of human mobility-related studies published from 1990 to 2020. Drawing on the selected publications retrieved from the Web of Science, we provide a bibliometric analysis and network visualisation using CiteSpace and VOSviewer on the number of publications and year published, authors and their countries and afflictions, citations, topics, abstracts, keywords, and journals. Our findings show that human mobility-related studies have become increasingly interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional, which have been strengthened by the use of the so-called ‘big data’ from multiple sources, the development of computer technologies, the innovation of modelling approaches, and the novel applications in various areas. Based on our synthesis of the work by top cited authors we identify four directions for future research relating to data sources, modelling methods, applications, and technologies. We advocate for more in-depth research on human mobility using multi-source big data, improving modelling methods and integrating advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, and machine and deep learning to address real-world problems and contribute to social good.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The development of a smart city and digital twin requires the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), where BIM models are to be integrated into GIS for visualization and/or analysis. However, the intrinsic differences between BIM and GIS have led to enormous problems in BIM-to-GIS data conversion, and the use of City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) has further escalated this issue. This study aims to facilitate the use of BIM models in GIS by proposing using the shapefile format, and a creative approach for converting Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to shapefile was developed by integrating a computer graphics technique. Thirteen building models were used to validate the proposed method. The result shows that: (1) the IFC-to-shapefile conversion is easier and more flexible to realize than the IFC-to-CityGML conversion, and (2) the computer graphics technique can improve the efficiency and reliability of BIM-to-GIS data conversion. This study can facilitate the use of BIM information in GIS and benefit studies working on digital twins and smart cities where building models are to be processed and integrated in GIS, or any other studies that need to manipulate IFC geometry in depth.

AB  - The emerging paradigm of the cognitive city, which augments smart cities with learning and behavioral change capabilities, is gaining increasing attention as a promising solution to the challenges of future mega-cities. Cognitive cities are built upon artificial learning and behavioral analysis techniques founded on the exploitation of human-machine collective intelligence. Hence, cognitive cities rely on the sharing of citizens’ daily-life data, which might be considered sensitive personal data. In this context, privacy and security of the shared information become critical issues that have to be addressed to guarantee the proper deployment of cognitive cities and the fundamental rights of people. This article provides a thorough literature review using the recommendations for systematic reviews proposed by Vom Brocke et al. and the PRISMA statement. We analyze peer-reviewed publications indexed in ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science until July 2020. We identify the main challenges on privacy and information security within cognitive cities, and the proposals described in the literature to address them. We conclude that many challenges remain open and we suggest several research lines that will require further examination in the years to come.

AB  - With growing evidence of the operational performance of cyber-physical manufacturing systems, there is a pivotal need for comprehending sustainable, smart, and sensing technologies underpinning data-driven decision-making processes. In this research, previous findings were cumulated showing that cyber-physical production networks operate automatically and smoothly with artificial intelligence-based decision-making algorithms in a sustainable manner and contribute to the literature by indicating that sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing systems function in an automated, robust, and flexible manner. Throughout October 2020 and April 2021, a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases was performed, with search terms including “Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics”, “sustainable smart manufacturing”, “cyber-physical production system”, “industrial big data”, “sustainable organizational performance”, “cyber-physical smart manufacturing system”, and “sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing system”. As research published between 2018 and 2021 was inspected, and only 426 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. By taking out controversial or ambiguous findings (insufficient/irrelevant data), outcomes unsubstantiated by replication, too general material, or studies with nearly identical titles, we selected 174 mainly empirical sources. Further developments should entail how cyber-physical production networks and Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics, by use of cognitive decision-making algorithms, enable the advancement of data-driven sustainable smart manufacturing.

TI  - Multi-Sector Oriented Object Detector for Accurate Localization in Optical Remote Sensing Images
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 10
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Oriented object detection in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) is a challenging task since the targets in ORSIs are displayed in an arbitrarily oriented manner and on small scales, and are densely packed. Current state-of-the-art oriented object detection models used in ORSIs primarily evolved from anchor-based and direct regression-based detection paradigms. Nevertheless, they still encounter a design difficulty from handcrafted anchor definitions and learning complexities in direct localization regression. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we proposed a novel multi-sector oriented object detection framework called MSO2-Det, which quantizes the scales and orientation prediction of targets in ORSIs via an anchor-free classification-to-regression approach. Specifically, we first represented the arbitrarily oriented bounding box as four scale offsets and angles in four quadrant sectors of the corresponding Cartesian coordinate system. Then, we divided the scales and angle space into multiple discrete sectors and obtained more accurate localization information by a coarse-granularity classification to fine-grained regression strategy. In addition, to decrease the angular-sector classification loss and accelerate the network’s convergence, we designed a smooth angular-sector label (SASL) that smoothly distributes label values with a definite tolerance radius. Finally, we proposed a localization-aided detection score (LADS) to better represent the confidence of a detected box by combining the category-classification score and the sector-selection score. The proposed MSO2-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on three widely used benchmarks, including the DOTA, HRSC2016, and UCAS-AOD data sets.

AB  - Since architect Nicholas Negroponte first proposed a vision of responsive architecture smart environments have been widely investigated, especially in the fields of computer science and engineering. Despite growing interest in the topic, a comprehensive review of research about smart environments from the architectural perspective is largely missing. In order to provide a formal understanding of smart environments in architecture, this paper conducts a systematic literature review of scholarly sources over the last decade, focusing on four related subjects: (1) responsive architecture, (2) kinetic architecture, (3) adaptive architecture and (4) intelligent buildings. Through this review, the paper identifies and examines interactive and collective behaviors in smart environments, thereby contributing to defining the properties of creative, smart spaces in the contemporary digital ecosystem. In addition, this research offers a means of systematically characterizing and constructing smart environments as interactive and collective platforms, enabling occupants to sense, experience and understand smart spaces.

AB  - The increasing interconnections of city services, the explosion of available urban data, and the need for multidisciplinary analysis and decision making for city sustainability require new technological solutions to cope with such complexity. Ontologies have become viable and effective tools to practitioners for developing applications requiring data and process interoperability, big data management, and automated reasoning on knowledge. We investigate how and to what extent ontologies have been used to support smart city services and we provide a comprehensive reference on what problems have been addressed and what has been achieved so far with ontology-based applications. To this purpose, we conducted a systematic literature review finalized to presenting the ontologies, and the methods and technological systems where ontologies play a relevant role in shaping current smart cities. Based on the result of the review process, we also propose a classification of the sub-domains of the city addressed by the ontologies we found, and the research issues that have been considered so far by the scientific community. We highlight those for which semantic technologies have been mostly demonstrated to be effective to enhance the smart city concept and, finally, discuss in more details about some open problems.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used extensively for search and rescue operations, surveillance, disaster monitoring, attacking terrorists, etc. due to their growing advantages of low-cost, high maneuverability, and easy deployability. This study proposes a mixed-integer programming model under a multi-objective optimization framework to design trajectories that enable a set of UAVs to execute surveillance tasks. The first objective maximizes the cumulative probability of target detection to aim for mission planning success. The second objective ensures minimization of cumulative path length to provide a higher resource utilization goal. A two-step variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is offered, which addresses the combinatorial optimization issue for determining the near-optimal sequence for cell visiting to reach the target. Numerical experiments and simulation results are evaluated in numerous benchmark instances. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach can favorably support practical deployability purposes.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 10
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The use of a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) in an urban traffic network allows for controlling the infrastructure of a traffic network and errors in its operations. In this research, a novel, stable predictive controller for urban traffic is proposed and state-space dynamics are used to estimate the number of vehicles at an isolated intersection and the length of its queue. This is a novel control strategy based on the type of traffic light and on the duration of the green-light phase and aims to achieve an optimal balance at intersections. This balance should be adaptable to the unchanging behavior of time and to the randomness of traffic situations. The proposed method reduces traffic volumes and the number of crashes involving cars by controlling traffic on an urban road using model predictive control. A single intersection in Tehran, the capital city of Iran, was considered in our study to control traffic signal timing, and model predictive control was used to reduce traffic. A model of traffic systems was extracted at the intersection, and the state-space parameters of the intersection were designed using the model predictive controller to control traffic signals based on the length of the vehicle queue and on the number of inbound and outbound vehicles, which were used as inputs. This process demonstrates that this method is able to reduce traffic volumes at each leg of an intersection and to optimize flow in a road network compared to the fixed-time method.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Smart cities and communities (SCC) constitute a new paradigm in urban development. SCC ideate a data-centered society aimed at improving efficiency by automating and optimizing activities and utilities. Information and communication technology along with Internet of Things enables data collection and with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) situation awareness can be obtained to feed the SCC actors with enriched knowledge. This paper describes AI perspectives in SCC and gives an overview of AI-based technologies used in traffic to enable road vehicle automation and smart traffic control. Perception, smart traffic control and driver modeling are described along with open research challenges and standardization to help introduce advanced driver assistance systems and automated vehicle functionality in traffic. To fully realize the potential of SCC, to create a holistic view on a city level, availability of data from different stakeholders is necessary. Further, though AI technologies provide accurate predictions and classifications, there is an ambiguity regarding the correctness of their outputs. This can make it difficult for the human operator to trust the system. Today there are no methods that can be used to match function requirements with the level of detail in data annotation in order to train an accurate model. Another challenge related to trust is explainability: models can have difficulty explaining how they came to certain conclusions, so it is difficult for humans to trust them.

AB  - The smart city concept, in which data from different systems are available, contains a multitude of critical infrastructures. This data availability opens new research opportunities in the study of the interdependency between those critical infrastructures and cascading effects solutions and focuses on the smart city as a network of critical infrastructures. This paper proposes an integrated resilience system linking interconnected critical infrastructures in a smart city to improve disaster resilience. A data-driven approach is considered, using artificial intelligence and methods to minimize cascading effects and the destruction of failing critical infrastructures and their components (at a city level). The proposed approach allows rapid recovery of infrastructures’ service performance levels after disasters while keeping the coverage of the assessment of risks, prevention, detection, response, and mitigation of consequences. The proposed approach has the originality and the practical implication of providing a decision support system that handles the infrastructures that will support the city disaster management system—make the city prepare, adapt, absorb, respond, and recover from disasters by taking advantage of the interconnections between its various critical infrastructures to increase the overall resilience capacity. The city of Lisbon (Portugal) is used as a case to show the practical application of the approach.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has attracted enormous interests due to its wide applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), smart homes and healthcare. In this paper, a low-resolution infrared array sensor-based HAR approach is proposed using the deep learning framework. The device-free sensing system leverages the infrared array sensor of 8×8 pixels to collect the infrared signals, which can ensure users’ privacy and effectively reduce the deployment cost of the network. To reduce the influence of temperature variations, a combination of the J-filter noise reduction method and the Butterworth filter is performed to preprocess the infrared signals. Long short-term memory (LSTM), a representative recurrent neural network, is utilized to automatically extract characteristics from the infrared signal and build the recognition model. In addition, the real-time HAR interface is designed by embedding the LSTM model. Experimental results show that the typical daily activities can be classified with the recognition accuracy of 98.287%. The proposed approach yields a better result compared to the existing machine learning methods, and it provides a low-cost yet promising solution for privacy-preserving scenarios.

AB  - In this era of big data, the amount of video content has dramatically increased with an exponential broadening of video streaming services. Hence, it has become very strenuous for end-users to search for their desired videos. Therefore, to attain an accurate and robust clustering of information, a hybrid algorithm was used to introduce a recommender engine with collaborative filtering using Apache Spark and machine learning (ML) libraries. In this study, we implemented a movie recommendation system based on a collaborative filtering approach using the alternating least squared (ALS) model to predict the best-rated movies. Our proposed system uses the last search data of a user regarding movie category and references this to instruct the recommender engine, thereby making a list of predictions for top ratings. The proposed study used a model-based approach of matrix factorization, the ALS algorithm along with a collaborative filtering technique, which solved the cold start, sparse, and scalability problems. In particular, we performed experimental analysis and successfully obtained minimum root mean squared errors (oRMSEs) of 0.8959 to 0.97613, approximately. Moreover, our proposed movie recommendation system showed an accuracy of 97% and predicted the top 1000 ratings for movies.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Internet of Things technologies are spurring new types of instructional games, namely reality-enhanced serious games (RESGs), that support training directly in the field. This paper investigates a key feature of RESGs, i.e., user performance evaluation using real data, and studies an application of RESGs for promoting fuel-efficient driving, using fuel consumption as an indicator of driver performance. In particular, we propose a reference model for supporting a novel smart sensing dataflow involving the combination of two modules, based on machine learning, to be employed in RESGs in parallel and in real-time. The first module concerns quantitative performance assessment, while the second one targets verbal recommendation. For the assessment module, we compared the performance of three well-established machine learning algorithms: support vector regression, random forest and artificial neural networks. The experiments show that random forest achieves a slightly better performance assessment correlation than the others but requires a higher inference time. The instant recommendation module, implemented using fuzzy logic, triggers advice when inefficient driving patterns are detected. The dataflow has been tested with data from the enviroCar public dataset, exploiting on board diagnostic II (OBD II) standard vehicular interface information. The data covers various driving environments and vehicle models, which makes the system robust for real-world conditions. The results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, attaining a high estimation correlation (R2 = 0.99, with random forest) and punctual verbal feedback to the driver. An important word of caution concerns users’ privacy, as the modules rely on sensitive personal data, and provide information that by no means should be misused.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) provide essential environmental services for the well-being of ecosystems and society. Due to the constant environmental, social, and economic transformations of cities, UGSs pose new challenges for management, particularly in fast-growing metropolitan areas. With technological advancement and the evolution of deep learning, it is possible to optimize the acquisition of UGS inventories through the detection of geometric patterns present in satellite imagery. This research evaluates two deep learning model techniques for semantic segmentation of UGS polygons with the use of different convolutional neural network encoders on the U-Net architecture and very high resolution (VHR) imagery to obtain updated information on UGS polygons at the metropolitan area level. The best model yielded a Dice coefficient of 0.57, IoU of 0.75, recall of 0.80, and kappa coefficient of 0.94 with an overall accuracy of 0.97, which reflects a reliable performance of the network in detecting patterns that make up the varied geometry of UGSs. A complete database of UGS polygons was quantified and categorized by types with location and delimited by municipality, allowing for the standardization of the information at the metropolitan level, which will be useful for comparative analysis with a homogenized and updated database. This is of particular interest to urban planners and UGS decision-makers.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The aim of the article is to present and analyze the implementation of intelligent lighting within the concept of smart energies and smart cities. Motivation and research hypothesis: Electricity consumption in the world is based largely on non-renewable energy. Until these full changes, it is necessary to look for opportunities to save and use it efficiently. Today’s cities are increasingly implementing the smart concept, of which smart energy is one area. One of the smart city elements implemented by cities is smart energy. Within this framework, a supported concept is the replacement of traditional lighting with LEDs (Light-Emitting Diodes), which contributes to energy and cost savings and reduces the pollution of the sky with artificial light, while increasing the efficiency of urban lighting. Positive effects of modern solutions include reduced lighting expenses and increased safety of residents. Methods and results of the research: The authors chose the case study method for their research. The authors present forecasts for the development, not only from the point of view of the number of lamps but also the cost efficiency pointing out the importance of this element in the context of building smart cities. These are specific benchmarks for cities that have not yet implemented this concept. Conclusions and interdisciplinary implications: solutions are desirable directions for the development of the smart city concept, bringing benefits and reducing external costs. Considerations show a quantitative development forecast and an indication of the possibility of achieving trade-offs and cost reductions. It translates into meeting the requirements of sustainable development providing tangible benefits. The analysis of the case studies is intended to show the effects that can be achieved and the wide range of applications (indicating that modern lamps are not just lighting, but a platform for urban services). The analyses presented are intended to serve as benchmarks showing the possibilities of reducing costs and increasing the quality of life of residents in modern cities. The indicated examples and analyses are of economic importance, they show managers, but also inhabitants, in which direction they should lead the smart city concept, which will allow saving costs, but also to increase the quality of life of inhabitants.

AB  - The trash disposal system, using standard trash bags, has been adopted by the government of the Republic of Korea (ROK) for more than two decades. This has caused a sanitary problem, as well as some secondary pollution. It is possible to solve this problem by deploying more manpower, but considering the manpower and maintenance costs that impose a heavy burden on the local governments who are experiencing tight financial situations, it would not be feasible. Thus, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based Smart Trash Separation Bin model that can reduce the cost of trash separation work has been proposed in this paper. The three efficient designs that respectively use a sensor, image processing, or spectroscope technology are presented. These IoT-based designs can bring significant merit to reducing the manpower costs, as well as the administrative cost involved.

AB  - Smart Agriculture or Agricultural Internet of things, consists of integrating advanced technologies (e.g., NFV, SDN, 5G/6G, Blockchain, IoT, Fog, Edge, and AI) into existing farm operations to improve the quality and productivity of agricultural products. The convergence of Industry 4.0 and Intelligent Agriculture provides new opportunities for migration from factory agriculture to the future generation, known as Agriculture 4.0. However, since the deployment of thousands of IoT based devices is in an open field, there are many new threats in Agriculture 4.0. Security researchers are involved in this topic to ensure the safety of the system since an adversary can initiate many cyber attacks, such as DDoS attacks to making a service unavailable and then injecting false data to tell us that the agricultural equipment is safe but in reality, it has been theft. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based intrusion detection system for DDoS attacks based on three models, namely, convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Each model’s performance is studied within two classification types (binary and multiclass) using two new real traffic datasets, namely, CIC-DDoS2019 dataset and TON_IoT dataset, which contain different types of DDoS attacks.

To achieve this, an instructional theory and intelligent techniques are combined, namely the Component Display Theory along with content-based filtering and multiple-criteria decision analysis, with the intention of providing personalized learning material and thus, improving student interaction. Until now, the majority of the research efforts mainly focus on adapting the presentation of learning material based on students’ characteristics. As such, there is free space for researching issues like delivering the appropriate type of learning material, in order to maintain the pedagogical affordance of the educational software. The blending of instructional design theories and sophisticated techniques can offer a more personalized and adaptive learning experience to learners of computer programming. The paper presents a fully operating intelligent educational software. It merges pedagogical and technological approaches for sophisticated learning material delivery to students. Moreover, it was used by undergraduate university students to learn Java programming for a semester during the COVID-19 lockdown. The findings of the evaluation showed that the presented way for delivering the Java learning material surpassed other approaches incorporating merely instructional models or intelligent tools, in terms of satisfaction and knowledge acquisition.

AB  - In this study, we aim to establish the factors that explain the technology acceptance of augmented reality (AR) in students’ engineering education. Technology acceptance of AR apps has been insufficiently investigated. We conceive a theoretical model to explain technology acceptance by relating behavioral intention to use with the variables subjective norm, technology optimism, technology innovativeness, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude toward using. An interactive AR app on electrical circuits was designed to assist students to overcome their difficulties in understanding how electricity works. A theoretical model was hypothesized and tested using structural equation modeling. The study was conducted using a sample of 190 engineering students. The results demonstrate the positive effect of technology optimism and technology innovativeness on perceived usefulness and attitude toward using, respectively. Furthermore, they suggest that attitude toward using is influenced by perceived usefulness but not directly by perceived ease of use. This could mean that students would be willing to use this app if they find it useful and not just easy to use. Finally, the results illustrate that attitude toward using firmly explains behavioral intention to use, which is consistent with the findings in previous studies. These results could guide how academics and higher education centers should approach the incorporation of these technologies in classrooms.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Facial emotion recognition (FER) is the procedure of identifying human emotions from facial expressions. It is often difficult to identify the stress and anxiety levels of an individual through the visuals captured from computer vision. However, the technology enhancements on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have yielded impressive results from gathering various forms of emotional and physical health-related data. The novel deep learning (DL) algorithms are allowing to perform application in a resource-constrained edge environment, encouraging data from IoMT devices to be processed locally at the edge. This article presents an IoMT based facial emotion detection and recognition system that has been implemented in real-time by utilizing a small, powerful, and resource-constrained device known as Raspberry-Pi with the assistance of deep convolution neural networks. For this purpose, we have conducted one empirical study on the facial emotions of human beings along with the emotional state of human beings using physiological sensors. It then proposes a model for the detection of emotions in real-time on a resource-constrained device, i.e., Raspberry-Pi, along with a co-processor, i.e., Intel Movidius NCS2. The facial emotion detection test accuracy ranged from 56% to 73% using various models, and the accuracy has become 73% performed very well with the FER 2013 dataset in comparison to the state of art results mentioned as 64% maximum. A t-test is performed for extracting the significant difference in systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and the heart rate of an individual watching three different subjects (angry, happy, and neutral).

AB  - Nowadays products are developed at a rapid pace, with shorter and shorter times between concept and go to market. With the advancement in technology, product designers and manufacturers can use new approaches to obtain information about their products and transform it into knowledge that they can use to improve the product. We developed the Poket Framework platform to facilitate the generation of product knowledge. In order to increase the reliability and safety in operation of electrical equipment, an evaluation is proposed, through tests and studies, using the original Poket Framework platform. Thus, several tests and studies were performed, which included testing and analyzing the correct integration in several use cases and remote data acquisition, and testing and analysis of the Poket Framework using literature established data sets of household appliances and electrical systems. Possible evolutions and Poket platform extensions are also considered.

AB  - Transmission, distribution, and micro-grid system operators are struggling with the increasing number of renewables and the changing nature of energy demand. This necessitates the use of prognostic methods based on ever shorter time series. This study depicted an attempt to develop an appropriate method by introducing a novel forecasting model based on the idea to use the Pareto fronts as a tool to select data in the forecasting process. The proposed model was implemented to forecast short-term electric energy demand in Poland using historical hourly demand values from Polish TSO. The study rather intended on implementing the range of different approaches—scenarios of Pareto fronts usage than on a complex evaluation of the obtained results. However, performance of proposed models was compared with a few benchmark forecasting models, including naïve approach, SARIMAX, kNN, and regression. For two scenarios, it has outperformed all other models by minimum 7.7%.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The spatial pattern of music venues is one of the key decision-making factors for urban planning and development strategies. Understanding the current configurations and future demands of music venues is fundamental to scholars, planners, and designers. There is an urgent need to discover the spatial pattern of music venues nationwide with high precision. This paper aims at an open data solution to discover the hidden hierarchical structure of the for-profit music venues and their dynamic relationship with urban economies. Data collected from the largest two public ticketing websites are used for clustering-based ranking modeling and spatial pattern discovery of music venues in 28 cities as recorded. The model is based on a multi-stage hierarchical clustering algorithm to level those cities into four groups according to the website records which can be used to describe the total music industry scale and activity vitality of cities. Data collected from the 2018 China City Statistical Year Book, including the GDP per capita, disposable income per capita, the permanent population, and the number of patent applications, are used as socio-economic indicators for the city-level potential capability of music industry development ranking. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and the Kendall rank correlation coefficient are applied to test the consistency of the above city-level rankings. The results are 0.782 and 0.744 respectively, which means there is a relatively significant correlation between the scale level of current music venue configuration and the potential to develop the music industry. Average nearest neighbor index (ANNI), quadrate analysis, and Moran’s I are used to identify the spatial patterns of music venues of individual cities. The results indicate that music venues in urban centers show more spatial aggregation, where the spatial accessibility of music activity services takes the lead significantly, while a certain amount of venues with high service capacity distribute in suburban areas. The findings can provide decision support for urban planners to formulate effective policies and rational site-selection schemes on urban cultural facilities, leading to smart city rational construction and sustainable economic benefit.

TI  - Feasibility Analyses of Real-Time Detection of Wildlife Using UAV-Derived Thermal and RGB Images
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 11
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Wildlife monitoring is carried out for diverse reasons, and monitoring methods have gradually advanced through technological development. Direct field investigations have been replaced by remote monitoring methods, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become the most important tool for wildlife monitoring. Many previous studies on detecting wild animals have used RGB images acquired from UAVs, with most of the analyses depending on machine learning–deep learning (ML–DL) methods. These methods provide relatively accurate results, and when thermal sensors are used as a supplement, even more accurate detection results can be obtained through complementation with RGB images. However, because most previous analyses were based on ML–DL methods, a lot of time was required to generate training data and train detection models. This drawback makes ML–DL methods unsuitable for real-time detection in the field. To compensate for the disadvantages of the previous methods, this paper proposes a real-time animal detection method that generates a total of six applicable input images depending on the context and uses them for detection. The proposed method is based on the Sobel edge algorithm, which is simple but can detect edges quickly based on change values. The method can detect animals in a single image without training data. The fastest detection time per image was 0.033 s, and all frames of a thermal video could be analyzed. Furthermore, because of the synchronization of the properties of the thermal and RGB images, the performance of the method was above average in comparison with previous studies. With target images acquired at heights below 100 m, the maximum detection precision and detection recall of the most accurate input image were 0.804 and 0.699, respectively. However, the low resolution of the thermal sensor and its shooting height limitation were hindrances to wildlife detection. The aim of future research will be to develop a detection method that can improve these shortcomings.

AB  - In this paper, the publicly available dataset for the Combined Diesel-Electric and Gas (CODLAG) propulsion system was used to obtain symbolic expressions for estimation of fuel flow, ship speed, starboard propeller torque, port propeller torque, and total propeller torque using genetic programming (GP) algorithm. The dataset consists of 11,934 samples that were divided into training and testing portions in an 80:20 ratio. The training portion of the dataset which consisted of 9548 samples was used to train the GP algorithm to obtain symbolic expressions for estimation of fuel flow, ship speed, starboard propeller, port propeller, and total propeller torque, respectively. After the symbolic expressions were obtained the testing portion of the dataset which consisted of 2386 samples was used to measure estimation performance in terms of coefficient of correlation (R2) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric, respectively. Based on the estimation performance in each case three best symbolic expressions were selected with and without decay state coefficients. From the conducted investigation, the highest R2 and lowest MAE values were achieved with symbolic expressions for the estimation of fuel flow, ship speed, starboard propeller torque, port propeller torque, and total propeller torque without decay state coefficients while symbolic expressions with decay state coefficients have slightly lower estimation performance.

AB  - This study proposes a new logical model for intelligent software architecture devoted to improving the efficiency of automated text understanding and text generation in industrial applications. The presented approach introduces a few patterns that provide a possibility to build adaptable and extensible solutions using machine learning technologies. The main idea is formalized by the concept of expounder hybridization. It summarizes an experience of document analysis and generation solutions development and social media analysis based on artificial neural networks’ practical use. The results of solving the task by the best expounder were improved using the method of aggregating multiple expounders. The quality of expounders’ combination can be further improved by introducing the pro-active competition between them on the basis of, e.g., auctioning algorithm, using several parameters including precision, solution performance and score. Analysis of the proposed approach was carried out using a dataset of legal documents including joint-stock company decision record sheets and protocols. The solution is implemented in an enterprise content management system and illustrated by an example of processing of legal documentation.

AB  - Integration of digital technologies and public health (or digital healthcare) helps us to fight the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is the biggest public health crisis humanity has faced since the 1918 Influenza Pandemic. In order to better understand the digital healthcare, this work conducted a systematic and comprehensive review of digital healthcare, with the purpose of helping us combat the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper covers the background information and research overview of digital healthcare, summarizes its applications and challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally puts forward the prospects of digital healthcare. First, main concepts, key development processes, and common application scenarios of integrating digital technologies and digital healthcare were offered in the part of background information. Second, the bibliometric techniques were used to analyze the research output, geographic distribution, discipline distribution, collaboration network, and hot topics of digital healthcare before and after COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated research on the integration of digital technologies and healthcare. Third, application cases of China, EU and U.S using digital technologies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and analyzed. Among these digital technologies, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 5G are most effective weapons to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Applications cases show that these technologies play an irreplaceable role in controlling the spread of the COVID-19. By comparing the application cases in these three regions, we contend that the key to China’s success in avoiding the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is to integrate digital technologies and public health on a large scale without hesitation. Fourth, the application challenges of digital technologies in the public health field are summarized. These challenges mainly come from four aspects: data delays, data fragmentation, privacy security, and data security vulnerabilities. Finally, this study provides the future application prospects of digital healthcare. In addition, we also provide policy recommendations for other countries that use digital technology to combat COVID-19.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of vehicles (IoV) is a rapidly emerging technological evolution of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). This paper proposes SafeDrive, a dynamic driver profile (DDP) using a hybrid recommendation system. DDP is a set of functional modules, to analyses individual driver’s behaviors, using prior violation and accident records, to identify driving risk patterns. In this paper, we have considered three synthetic data-sets for 1500 drivers based on their profile information, risk parameters information, and risk likelihood. In addition, we have also considered the driver’s historical violation/accident data-set records based on four risk-score levels such as high-risk, medium-risk, low-risk, and no-risk to predict current and future driver risk scores. Several error calculation methods have been applied in this study to analyze our proposed hybrid recommendation systems’ performance to classify the driver’s data with higher accuracy based on various criteria. The evaluated results help to improve the driving behavior and broadcast early warning alarm to the other vehicles in IoV environment for the overall road safety. Moreover, the propoed model helps to provide a safe and predicted environment for vehicles, pedestrians, and road objects, with the help of regular monitoring of vehicle motion, driver behavior, and road conditions. It also enables accurate prediction of accidents beforehand, and also minimizes the complexity of on-road vehicles and latency due to fog/cloud computing servers.

AB  - This paper analyses the contribution of residual network (ResNet) based convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture employed in two tasks related to plant phenotyping. Among the contemporary works for species recognition (SR) and infection detection of plants, the majority of them have performed experiments on balanced datasets and used accuracy as the evaluation parameter. However, this work used an imbalanced dataset having an unequal number of images, applied data augmentation to increase accuracy, organised data as multiple test cases and classes, and, most importantly, employed multiclass classifier evaluation parameters useful for asymmetric class distribution. Additionally, the work addresses typical issues faced such as selecting the size of the dataset, depth of classifiers, training time needed, and analysing the classifier’s performance if various test cases are deployed. In this work, ResNet 20 (V2) architecture has performed significantly well in the tasks of Species Recognition (SR) and Identification of Healthy and Infected Leaves (IHIL) with a Precision of 91.84% and 84.00%, Recall of 91.67% and 83.14% and F1 Score of 91.49% and 83.19%, respectively.

AB  - Contemporary higher education is gradually transforming. Meetings of teachers and students from lecture halls are increasingly moving into the digital space of the Internet, adopting the formula of distance learning. The advent of Society 5.0 and Economy 5.0 will imply further changes. The necessity to integrate the real and virtual world, increased demand for information, limited time resources, and the need to combine professional work with education will cause higher education, in order to prepare future citizens to function in the area of sharing resources, to be forced to further adaptive transformations. The subject of this article is the analysis of the impact of technology on changes in higher education with an indication of the model of future paths of education in the Economy 5.0 trend. The source of the article was exploratory research of secondary sources, including books, articles, and reports, which were subjected to a critical analysis of the content. The obtained results made it possible to design and implement an explanatory study among students based on the CAWI methodology. The collected material became the basis for the authors to prepare a proposal for a model of future educational paths in accordance with the Economy 5.0 trend in which the flexibility of place and time, customization of the offer, cooperation, adaptability of teaching methods and instruments, and the proactive role of the teacher as a mentor and trainer constitute a set of set guidelines in the teaching model of the future. This model will be able to be used by universities and training institutions in the field of professionalization of the management of teaching and organizational processes.

AB  - Over the decades, robotics technology has acquired sufficient advancement through the progression of 5G Internet, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, and Edge Computing. Though nowadays, Cobot and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) supported robots with edge computing paradigms have achieved remarkable performances in diverse applications, the existing SOA robotics technology fails to develop a multi-domain expert with high performing robots and demands improvement to Service-Oriented Brain, SOB (including AI model, driving service application and metadata) enabling robot for deploying brain and a new computing model with more scalability and flexibility. In this paper, instead of focusing on SOA and Robot as a Service (RaaS) model, we propose a novel computing architecture, addressed as Brainware Computing, for driving multiple domain-specific brains one-at-a-time in a single hardware robot according to the service, addressed as Brain as a Service (BaaS). In Brainware Computing, each robot can install and remove the virtual machine, which contains SOB and operating applications from the nearest edge cloud. Secondly, we provide an extensive explanation of the scope and possibilities of Brainware Computing. Finally, we demonstrate several challenges and opportunities and then concluded with future research directions in the field of Brainware Computing.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Anomaly detection has gained considerable attention in the past couple of years. Emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), are known to be among the most critical sources of data streams that produce massive amounts of data continuously from numerous applications. Examining these collected data to detect suspicious events can reduce functional threats and avoid unseen issues that cause downtime in the applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the data stream characteristics, many unresolved problems persist. In the existing literature, methods have been designed and developed to evaluate certain anomalous behaviors in IoT data stream sources. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that discuss all the aspects of IoT data processing. Thus, this paper attempts to fill this gap by providing a complete image of various state-of-the-art techniques on the major problems and core challenges in IoT data. The nature of data, anomaly types, learning mode, window model, datasets, and evaluation criteria are also presented. Research challenges related to data evolving, feature-evolving, windowing, ensemble approaches, nature of input data, data complexity and noise, parameters selection, data visualizations, heterogeneity of data, accuracy, and large-scale and high-dimensional data are investigated. Finally, the challenges that require substantial research efforts and future directions are summarized.

AB  - Web security plays a very crucial role in the Security of Things (SoT) paradigm for smart healthcare and will continue to be impactful in medical infrastructures in the near future. This paper addressed a key component of security-intrusion detection systems due to the number of web security attacks, which have increased dramatically in recent years in healthcare, as well as the privacy issues. Various intrusion-detection systems have been proposed in different works to detect cyber threats in smart healthcare and to identify network-based attacks and privacy violations. This study was carried out as a result of the limitations of the intrusion detection systems in responding to attacks and challenges and in implementing privacy control and attacks in the smart healthcare industry. The research proposed a machine learning support system that combined a Random Forest (RF) and a genetic algorithm: a feature optimization method that built new intrusion detection systems with a high detection rate and a more accurate false alarm rate. To optimize the functionality of our approach, a weighted genetic algorithm and RF were combined to generate the best subset of functionality that achieved a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. This study used the NSL-KDD dataset to simultaneously classify RF, Naive Bayes (NB) and logistic regression classifiers for machine learning. The results confirmed the importance of optimizing functionality, which gave better results in terms of the false alarm rate, precision, detection rate, recall and F1 metrics. The combination of our genetic algorithm and RF models achieved a detection rate of 98.81% and a false alarm rate of 0.8%. This research raised awareness of privacy and authentication in the smart healthcare domain, wireless communications and privacy control and developed the necessary intelligent and efficient web system. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm was applied to examine the F1-score and precisionperformance as compared to the NSL-KDD and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets using different scaling factors. The results showed that the proposed GA was greatly optimized, for which the average precision was optimized by 5.65% and the average F1-score by 8.2%.

AB  - The evolution of Mobile Networks and Internet of Things (IoT) architectures allows one to rethink the way smart cities infrastructures are designed and managed, and solve a number of problems in terms of human mobility. The territories that adopt the sensoring era can take advantage of this disruptive technology to improve the quality of mobility of their citizens and the rationalization of their resources. However, with this rapid development of smart terminals and infrastructures, as well as the proliferation of diversified applications, even current networks may not be able to completely meet quickly rising human mobility demands. Thus, they are facing many challenges and to cope with these challenges, different standards and projects have been proposed so far. Accordingly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been utilized as a new paradigm for the design and optimization of mobile networks with a high level of intelligence. The objective of this work is to identify and discuss the challenges of mobile networks, alongside IoT and AI, to characterize smart human mobility and to discuss some workable solutions to these challenges. Finally, based on this discussion, we propose paths for future smart human mobility researches.

AB  - Autonomy is the core capability of future systems, and architecture design is one of the critical issues in system development and implementation. To discuss the architecture of autonomous systems in the future, this paper reviews the developing progress of architectures from automation systems to autonomous systems. Firstly, the autonomy and autonomous systems in different fields are summarized. The article classifies and summarizes the architecture of typical automated systems and infer three suggestions for building an autonomous system architecture: extensibility, evolvability, and collaborability. Accordingly, this paper builds an autonomous waterborne transportation system, and the architecture is composed of the object layer, cyberspace layer, cognition layer, and application layer, the proposed suggestions made in the construction of the architecture are reflected in the inter-relationships at all layers. Through the cooperation of four layers, the autonomous waterborne transportation system can autonomously complete the system functions, such as system control and transportation service. In the end, the characteristics of autonomous systems are concluded, from which the future primary research directions and the challenges of autonomous systems are provided.

TI  - An Imbalanced Image Classification Method for the Cell Cycle Phase
T2  - Information

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - The cell cycle is an important process in cellular life. In recent years, some image processing methods have been developed to determine the cell cycle stages of individual cells. However, in most of these methods, cells have to be segmented, and their features need to be extracted. During feature extraction, some important information may be lost, resulting in lower classification accuracy. Thus, we used a deep learning method to retain all cell features. In order to solve the problems surrounding insufficient numbers of original images and the imbalanced distribution of original images, we used the Wasserstein generative adversarial network-gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for data augmentation. At the same time, a residual network (ResNet) was used for image classification. ResNet is one of the most used deep learning classification networks. The classification accuracy of cell cycle images was achieved more effectively with our method, reaching 83.88%. Compared with an accuracy of 79.40% in previous experiments, our accuracy increased by 4.48%. Another dataset was used to verify the effect of our model and, compared with the accuracy from previous results, our accuracy increased by 12.52%. The results showed that our new cell cycle image classification system based on WGAN-GP and ResNet is useful for the classification of imbalanced images. Moreover, our method could potentially solve the low classification accuracy in biomedical images caused by insufficient numbers of original images and the imbalanced distribution of original images.

AB  - Many countries are facing significant challenges in relation to providing adequate care for their elderly citizens. The roots of these issues are manifold, but include changing demographics, changing behaviours, and a shortage of resources. As has been witnessed in the health sector and many others in society, technology has much to offer in terms of supporting people’s needs. This paper explores the potential for ambient intelligence to address this challenge by creating a system that is able to passively monitor the home environment, detecting abnormal situations which may indicate that the inhabitant needs help. There are many ways that this might be achieved, but in this paper, we will describe our investigation into an approach involving unobtrusively ’listening’ to sound patterns within the home, which classifies these as either normal daily activities, or abnormal situations. The experimental system we built was composed of an innovative combination of acoustic sensing, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), which we argue in the paper that it provides a cost-effective approach to alerting care providers when an elderly person in their charge needs help. The majority of the innovation in our work concerns the AI in which we employ Machine Learning to classify the sound profiles, analyse the data for abnormal events, and to make decisions for raising alerts with carers. A Neural Network classifier was used to train and identify the sound profiles associated with normal daily routines within a given person’s home, signalling departures from the daily routines that were then used as templates to measure deviations from normality, which were used to make weighted decisions regarding calling for assistance. A practical experimental system was then designed and deployed to evaluate the methods advocated by this research. The methodology involved gathering pre-design and post-design data from both a professionally run residential home and a domestic home. The pre-design data gathered the views on the system design from 11 members of the residential home, using survey questionnaires and focus groups. These data were used to inform the design of the experimental system, which was then deployed in a domestic home setting to gather post-design experimental data. The experimental results revealed that the system was able to detect 84% of abnormal events, and advocated several refinements which would improve the performance of the system. Thus, the research concludes that the system represents an important advancement to the state-of-the-art and, when taken together with the refinements, represents a line of research which has the potential to deliver significant improvements to care provision for the elderly.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - We confirm that energy dissipation weighting provides the most accurate approach to determining the effective hydraulic conductivity (Keff) of a binary K grid. A deep learning algorithm (UNET) can infer Keff with extremely high accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.99). The UNET architecture could be trained to infer the energy dissipation weighting pattern from an image of the K distribution, although it was less accurate for cases with highly localized structures that controlled flow. Furthermore, the UNET architecture learned to infer the energy dissipation weighting even if it was not trained directly on this information. However, the weights were represented within the UNET in a way that was not immediately interpretable by a human user. This reiterates the idea that even if ML/DL algorithms are trained to make some hydrologic predictions accurately, they must be designed and trained to provide each user-required output if their results are to be used to improve our understanding of hydrologic systems.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - The wide application of encryption technology has made traffic classification gradually become a major challenge in the field of network security. Traditional methods such as machine learning, which rely heavily on feature engineering and others, can no longer fully meet the needs of encrypted traffic classification. Therefore, we propose an Inception-LSTM(ICLSTM) traffic classification method in this paper to achieve encrypted traffic service identification. This method converts traffic data into common gray images, and then uses the constructed ICLSTM neural network to extract key features and perform effective traffic classification. To alleviate the problem of category imbalance, different weight parameters are set for each category separately in the training phase to make it more symmetrical for different categories of encrypted traffic, and the identification effect is more balanced and reasonable. The method is validated on the public ISCX 2016 dataset, and the results of five classification experiments show that the accuracy of the method exceeds 98% for both regular encrypted traffic service identification and VPN encrypted traffic service identification. At the same time, this deep learning-based classification method also greatly simplifies the difficulty of traffic feature extraction work.

TI  - An Evolving TinyML Compression Algorithm for IoT Environments Based on Data Eccentricity
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 12
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Currently, the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) generate a large amount of sensor data at a very high pace, making it a challenge to collect and store the data. This scenario brings about the need for effective data compression algorithms to make the data manageable among tiny and battery-powered devices and, more importantly, shareable across the network. Additionally, considering that, very often, wireless communications (e.g., low-power wide-area networks) are adopted to connect field devices, user payload compression can also provide benefits derived from better spectrum usage, which in turn can result in advantages for high-density application scenarios. As a result of this increase in the number of connected devices, a new concept has emerged, called TinyML. It enables the use of machine learning on tiny, computationally restrained devices. This allows intelligent devices to analyze and interpret data locally and in real time. Therefore, this work presents a new data compression solution (algorithm) for the IoT that leverages the TinyML perspective. The new approach is called the Tiny Anomaly Compressor (TAC) and is based on data eccentricity. TAC does not require previously established mathematical models or any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed solution and validate it, a comparative analysis was performed on two real-world datasets with two other algorithms from the literature (namely Swing Door Trending (SDT) and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)). It was found that the TAC algorithm showed promising results, achieving a maximum compression rate of 98.33%. Additionally, it also surpassed the two other models regarding the compression error and peak signal-to-noise ratio in all cases.

TI  - Graph Convolutional Networks: Application to Database Completion of Wastewater Networks

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Wastewater networks are mandatory for urbanisation. Their management, including the prediction and planning of repairs and expansion operations, requires precise information on their underground components (manhole covers, equipment, nodes, and pipes). However, due to their years of service and to the increasing number of maintenance operations they may have undergone over time, the attributes and characteristics associated with the various objects constituting a network are not all available at a given time. This is partly because (i) the multiple actors that carry out repairs and extensions are not necessarily the operators who ensure the continuous functioning of the network, and (ii) the undertaken changes are not properly tracked and reported. Therefore, databases related to wastewater networks may suffer from missing data. To overcome this problem, we aim to exploit the structure of wastewater networks in the learning process of machine learning approaches, using topology and the relationship between components, to complete the missing values of pipes. Our results show that Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models yield better results than classical methods and represent a useful tool for missing data completion.

AB  - The main goal of this paper is to present new possibilities for the detection and recognition of different categories of electric and conventional (equipped with combustion engines) vehicles using a thermal video camera. The paper presents a draft of a possible detection and classification system of vehicle propulsion systems working with thermal analyses. The differences in thermal features of different vehicle categories were found out and statistically proved. The thermal images were obtained using an infrared thermography camera. They were utilized to design a database of vehicle class images of passenger vehicles (PVs), vans, and buses. The results confirmed the hypothesis that infrared thermography might be used for categorizing the vehicle type according to the thermal features of vehicle exteriors and machine learning methods for vehicle type recognition.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 12
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Networking is crucial for smart city projects nowadays, as it offers an environment where people and things are connected. This paper presents a chronology of factors on the development of smart cities, including IoT technologies as network infrastructure. Increasing IoT nodes leads to increasing data flow, which is a potential source of failure for IoT networks. The biggest challenge of IoT networks is that the IoT may have insufficient memory to handle all transaction data within the IoT network. We aim in this paper to propose a potential compression method for reducing IoT network data traffic. Therefore, we investigate various lossless compression algorithms, such as entropy or dictionary-based algorithms, and general compression methods to determine which algorithm or method adheres to the IoT specifications. Furthermore, this study conducts compression experiments using entropy (Huffman, Adaptive Huffman) and Dictionary (LZ77, LZ78) as well as five different types of datasets of the IoT data traffic. Though the above algorithms can alleviate the IoT data traffic, adaptive Huffman gave the best compression algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to propose a conceptual compression method for IoT data traffic by improving an adaptive Huffman based on deep learning concepts using weights, pruning, and pooling in the neural network. The proposed algorithm is believed to obtain a better compression ratio. Additionally, in this paper, we also discuss the challenges of applying the proposed algorithm to IoT data compression due to the limitations of IoT memory and IoT processor, which later it can be implemented in IoT networks.

TI  - A Semantic and Knowledge-Based Approach for Handover Management
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 12
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Handover Management (HM) is pivotal for providing service continuity, enormous reliability and extreme-low latency, and meeting sky-high data rates, in wireless communications. Current HM approaches based on a single criterion may lead to unnecessary and frequent handovers due to a partial network view that is constrained to information about link quality. In turn, HM approaches based on multicriteria may present a failure of handovers and wrong network selection, decreasing the throughput and increasing the packet loss in the network. This paper proposes SIM-Know, an approach for improving HM. SIM-Know improves HM by including a Semantic Information Model (SIM) that enables context-aware and multicriteria handover decisions. SIM-Know also introduces a SIM-based distributed Knowledge Base Profile (KBP) that provides local and global intelligence to make contextual and proactive handover decisions. We evaluated SIM-Know in an emulated wireless network. When the end-user device moves at low and moderate speeds, the results show that our approach outperforms the Signal Strong First (SSF, single criterion approach) and behaves similarly to the Analytic Hierarchy Process combined with the Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (AHP-TOPSIS, multicriteria approach) regarding the number of handovers and the number of throughput drops. SSF outperforms SIM-Know and AHP-TOPSIS regarding the handover latency metric because SSF runs a straightforward process for making handover decisions. At high speeds, SIM-Know outperforms SSF and AHP-TOPSIS regarding the number of handovers and the number of throughput drops and, further, improves the throughput, delay, jitter, and packet loss in the network. Considering the obtained results, we conclude that SIM-Know is a practical and attractive solution for cognitive HM.

AB  - The construction and operation of wind turbines have become an important part of the development of smart cities. However, the fault of the main drive chain often causes the outage of wind turbines, which has a serious impact on the normal operation of wind turbines in smart cities. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the commonly used main drive chain fault diagnosis method that only uses a single data source, a fault feature extraction and fault diagnosis approach based on data source fusion is proposed. By fusing two data sources, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) real-time monitoring system data and the main drive chain vibration monitoring data, the fault features of the main drive chain are jointly extracted, and an intelligent fault diagnosis model for the main drive chain in wind turbine based on data fusion is established. The diagnosis results of actual cases certify that the fault diagnosis model based on the fusion of two data sources is able to locate faults of the main drive chain in the wind turbine accurately and provide solid technical support for the high-efficient operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

AB  - The optimization for hardware processor and system for performing deep learning operations such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in resource limited embedded devices are recent active research area. In order to perform an optimized deep neural network model using the limited computational unit and memory of an embedded device, it is necessary to quickly apply various configurations of hardware modules to various deep neural network models and find the optimal combination. The Electronic System Level (ESL) Simulator based on SystemC is very useful for rapid hardware modeling and verification. In this paper, we designed and implemented a Deep Learning Accelerator (DLA) that performs Deep Neural Network (DNN) operation based on the RISC-V Virtual Platform implemented in SystemC in order to enable rapid and diverse analysis of deep learning operations in an embedded device based on the RISC-V processor, which is a recently emerging embedded processor. The developed RISC-V based DLA prototype can analyze the hardware requirements according to the CNN data set through the configuration of the CNN DLA architecture, and it is possible to run RISC-V compiled software on the platform, can perform a real neural network model like Darknet. We performed the Darknet CNN model on the developed DLA prototype, and confirmed that computational overhead and inference errors can be analyzed with the DLA prototype developed by analyzing the DLA architecture for various data sets.

AB  - With a large of time series dataset from the Internet of Things in Ambient Intelligence-enabled smart environments, many supervised learning-based anomaly detection methods have been investigated but ignored the correlation among the time series. To address this issue, we present a new idea for anomaly detection based on dynamic graph embedding, in which the dynamic graph comprises the multiple time series and their correlation in each time interval. We propose an entropy for measuring a graph’s information injunction with a correlation matrix to define similarity between graphs. A dynamic graph embedding model based on the graph similarity is proposed to cluster the graphs for anomaly detection. We implement the proposed model in vehicular edge computing for traffic incident detection. The experiments are carried out using traffic data produced by the Simulation of Urban Mobility framework. The experimental findings reveal that the proposed method achieves better results than the baselines by 14.5% and 18.1% on average with respect to F1-score and accuracy, respectively.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Mining ubiquitous sensing data is important but also challenging, due to many factors, such as heterogeneous large-scale data that is often at various levels of abstraction. This also relates particularly to the important aspects of the explainability and interpretability of the applied models and their results, and thus ultimately to the outcome of the data mining process. With this, in general, the inclusion of domain knowledge leading towards semantic data mining approaches is an emerging and important research direction. This article aims to survey relevant works in these areas, focusing on semantic data mining approaches and methods, but also on selected applications of ubiquitous sensing in some of the most prominent current application areas. Here, we consider in particular: (1) environmental sensing; (2) ubiquitous sensing in industrial applications of artificial intelligence; and (3) social sensing relating to human interactions and the respective individual and collective behaviors. We discuss these in detail and conclude with a summary of this emerging field of research. In addition, we provide an outlook on future directions for semantic data mining in ubiquitous sensing contexts.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The concept of smart cities has gained significant momentum in science and policy circles over the past decade. This study aims to provide an overview of the structure and trends in the literature on smart cities. Bibliometric analysis and science mapping techniques using VOSviewer and CiteSpace are used to identify the thematic focus of over 5000 articles indexed in the Web of Science since 1991. In addition to providing insights into the thematic evolution of the field, the three-decade study period is divided into two sub-periods (1991–2015 and 2016–2021). While splitting the dataset into more sub-periods would have been desirable, we decided to only examine two sub-periods as only very few papers have been published until 2010. The annual number of publications has progressively increased since then, with a surge in the annual number of publications observable from 2015 onwards. The thematic analysis showed that the intellectual base of the field has been very limited during the first period, but has expanded significantly since 2015. Over time, some thematic evolutions, such as further attention to linkages to climate change and resilience, and more emphasis on security and privacy issues, have been made. The thematic analysis shows that existing research on smart cities is dominated by either conceptual issues or underlying technical aspects. It is, therefore, essential to do more research on the implementation of smart cities and actual and/or potential contributions of smart cities to solving societal issues. In addition to elaborating on thematic focus, the study also highlights major authors, journals, references, countries, and institutions that have contributed to the development of the smart cities literature.

AB  - It is well known that many chronic diseases are associated with unhealthy diet. Although improving diet is critical, adopting a healthy diet is difficult despite its benefits being well understood. Technology is needed to allow an assessment of dietary intake accurately and easily in real-world settings so that effective intervention to manage being overweight, obesity, and related chronic diseases can be developed. In recent years, new wearable imaging and computational technologies have emerged. These technologies are capable of performing objective and passive dietary assessments with a much simplified procedure than traditional questionnaires. However, a critical task is required to estimate the portion size (in this case, the food volume) from a digital image. Currently, this task is very challenging because the volumetric information in the two-dimensional images is incomplete, and the estimation involves a great deal of imagination, beyond the capacity of the traditional image processing algorithms. In this work, we present a novel Artificial Intelligent (AI) system to mimic the thinking of dietitians who use a set of common objects as gauges (e.g., a teaspoon, a golf ball, a cup, and so on) to estimate the portion size. Specifically, our human-mimetic system “mentally” gauges the volume of food using a set of internal reference volumes that have been learned previously. At the output, our system produces a vector of probabilities of the food with respect to the internal reference volumes. The estimation is then completed by an “intelligent guess”, implemented by an inner product between the probability vector and the reference volume vector. Our experiments using both virtual and real food datasets have shown accurate volume estimation results.

AB  - Energy consumption is a crucial domain in energy system management. Recently, it was observed that there has been a rapid rise in the consumption of energy throughout the world. Thus, almost every nation devises its strategies and models to limit energy usage in various areas, ranging from large buildings to industrial firms and vehicles. With technological advancements, computational intelligence models have been successfully contributing to the prediction of the consumption of energy. Machine learning and deep learning-based models enhance the precision and robustness compared to traditional approaches, making it more reliable. This article performs a review analysis of the various computational intelligence approaches currently being utilized to predict energy consumption. An extensive survey procedure is conducted and presented in this study, and relevant works are discussed. Different criteria are considered during the aggregation of the relevant studies relating to the work. The author’s perspective, future trends and various novel approaches are also presented as a part of the discussion. This article thereby lays a foundation stone for further research works to be undertaken for energy prediction.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Automatic crack identification for pipeline analysis utilizes three-dimensional (3D) image technology to improve the accuracy and reliability of crack identification. A new technique that integrates a deep learning algorithm and 3D shadow modeling (3D-SM) is proposed for the automatic identification of corrosion cracks in pipelines. Since the depth of a corrosion crack is below the surrounding area of the crack, a shadow of the crack is projected when the crack is exposed under light sources. In this study, we analyze the shadow areas of cracks through 3D shadow modeling (3D-SM) and identify the evolving cracks through the shape analysis of the shadows. To denoise the 3D images, the connected domain analysis is implemented so that the shadow groups of the evolving cracks can be retained and the scattered shadow groups that occur due to insignificant defects can be eliminated. Moreover, a novel deep neural network is developed to process the 3D images. The proposed automatic crack identification method successfully processes the 3D images efficiently and accurately diagnoses the corrosion cracks. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves satisfactory performance with 93.53% accuracy and a 92.04% regression rate.

AB  - A single Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) is a disturbance source of modern wireless systems depending on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Satellite Communication (SatCom). In particular, significant applications such as aeronautics and satellite communication can be severely affected by intentional and unintentional interference, which are unmitigated. The matter requires finding a radical and effective solution to overcome this problem. The methods used for overcoming the RFI include interference detection, interference classification, interference geolocation, tracking and interference mitigation. RFI source geolocation and tracking methodology gained universal attention from numerous researchers, specialists, and scientists. In the last decade, various conventional techniques and algorithms have been adopted in geolocation and target tracking in civil and military operations. Previous conventional techniques did not address the challenges and demand for novel algorithms. Hence there is a necessity for focussing on the issues associated with this. This survey introduces a review of various conventional geolocation techniques, current orientations, and state-of-the-art techniques and highlights some approaches and algorithms employed in wireless and satellite systems for geolocation and target tracking that may be extremely beneficial. In addition, a comparison between different conventional geolocation techniques has been revealed, and the comparisons between various approaches and algorithms of geolocation and target tracking have been addressed, including H∞ and Kalman Filtering versions that have been implemented and investigated by authors.

AB  - The district heating (DH) industry is facing an important transformation towards more efficient networks that utilise significantly lower water temperatures to distribute the heat. This change requires taking advantage of new technologies, and Machine Learning (ML) is a popular direction. In the last decade, we have witnessed an extreme growth in the number of published research papers that focus on applying ML techniques to the DH domain. However, based on our experience in the field, and an extensive review of the state-of-the-art, we perceive a mismatch between the most popular research directions, such as forecasting, and the challenges faced by the DH industry. In this work, we present our findings, explain and demonstrate the key gaps between the two communities and suggest a road-map ahead towards increasing the impact of ML research in the DH industry.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a key and growing technology for many critical real-life applications, where it can be used to improve decision making. The existence of several sources of uncertainty in the IoT infrastructure, however, can lead decision makers into taking inappropriate actions. The present work focuses on proposing a risk-based IoT decision-making framework in order to effectively manage uncertainties in addition to integrating domain knowledge in the decision-making process. A structured literature review of the risks and sources of uncertainty in IoT decision-making systems is the basis for the development of the framework and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) case studies. More specifically, as one of the main targeted challenges, the potential sources of uncertainties in an IoT framework, at different levels of abstraction, are firstly reviewed and then summarized. The modules included in the framework are detailed, with the main focus given to a novel risk-based analytics module, where an ensemble-based data analytic approach, called Calibrated Random Forest (CRF), is proposed to extract useful information while quantifying and managing the uncertainty associated with predictions, by using confidence scores. Its output is subsequently integrated with domain knowledge-based action rules to perform decision making in a cost-sensitive and rational manner. The proposed CRF method is firstly evaluated and demonstrated on a HAR scenario in a Smart Home environment in case study I and is further evaluated and illustrated with a remote health monitoring scenario for a diabetes use case in case study II. The experimental results indicate that using the framework’s raw sensor data can be converted into meaningful actions despite several sources of uncertainty. The comparison of the proposed framework to existing approaches highlights the key metrics that make decision making more rational and transparent.

AB  - For the last decade the Smart City concept has been under development, fostered by the growing urbanization of the world’s population and the need to handle the challenges that such a scenario raises. During this time many Smart City projects have been executed–some as proof-of-concept, but a growing number resulting in permanent, production-level deployments, improving the operation of the city and the quality of life of its citizens. Thus, Smart Cities are still a highly relevant paradigm which needs further development before it reaches its full potential and provides robust and resilient solutions. In this paper, the focus is set on the Internet of Things (IoT) as an enabling technology for the Smart City. In this sense, the paper reviews the current landscape of IoT-enabled Smart Cities, surveying relevant experiences and city initiatives that have embedded IoT within their city services and how they have generated an impact. The paper discusses the key technologies that have been developed and how they are contributing to the realization of the Smart City. Moreover, it presents some challenges that remain open ahead of us and which are the initiatives and technologies that are under development to tackle them.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 3

SN  - 2624-8921

AB  - Modern hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) like the fourth generation of Toyota Prius incorporate multiple planetary gears (PG) to interconnect various power components. Previous studies reported that increasing the number of planetary gears from one to two reduces energy consumption. However, these studies did not compare one PG and two PGs topologies at their optimal operation. Moreover, the size of the powertrain components are not the same and hence the source of reduction in energy consumption is not clear. This paper investigates the effect of the number of planetary gears on energy consumption under optimal operation of the powertrain components. The powertrains with one and two PGs are considered and an optimal simultaneous torque distribution and mode selection strategy is proposed. The proposed energy management strategy (EMS) optimally distributes torque demands amongst the power components whilst also controlling clutches (i.e., mode selection). Results show that increasing from one to two PGs reduces energy consumption by 4%.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Open public places, such as pedestrian streets, parks, and squares, are vulnerable when the pedestrians thronged into the sidewalks. The crowd count changes dynamically over time with various external factors, such as surroundings, weekends, and peak hours, so it is essential to predict the accurate and timely crowd count. To address this issue, this study introduces graph convolutional network (GCN), a network-based model, to predict the crowd flow in a walking street. Compared with other grid-based methods, the model is capable of directly processing road network graphs. Experiments show the GCN model and its extension STGCN consistently and significantly outperform other five baseline models, namely HA, ARIMA, SVM, CNN and LSTM, in terms of RMSE, MAE and R2. Considering the computation efficiency, the standard GCN model was selected to predict the crowd. The results showed that the model obtains superior performances with higher prediction precision on weekends and peak hours, of which R2 are above 0.9, indicating the GCN model can capture the pedestrian features in the road network effectively, especially during the periods with massive crowds. The results will provide practical references for city managers to alleviate road congestion and help pedestrians make smarter planning and save travel time.

AB  - In this study, based on multi-access edge computing (MEC), we provided the possibility of cooperating manufacturing processes. We tried to solve the job shop scheduling problem by applying DQN (deep Q-network), a reinforcement learning model, to this method. Here, to alleviate the overload of computing resources, an efficient DQN was used for the experiments using transfer learning data. Additionally, we conducted scheduling studies in the edge computing ecosystem of our manufacturing processes without the help of cloud centers. Cloud computing, an environment in which scheduling processing is performed, has issues sensitive to the manufacturing process in general, such as security issues and communication delay time, and research is being conducted in various fields, such as the introduction of an edge computing system that can replace them. We proposed a method of independently performing scheduling at the edge of the network through cooperative scheduling between edge devices within a multi-access edge computing structure. The proposed framework was evaluated, analyzed, and compared with existing frameworks in terms of providing solutions and services.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The sparse data in PM2.5 air quality monitoring systems is frequently happened on large-scale smart city sensing applications, which is collected via massive sensors. Moreover, it could be affected by inefficient node deployment, insufficient communication, and fragmented records, which is the main challenge of the high-resolution prediction system. In addition, data privacy in the existing centralized air quality prediction system cannot be ensured because the data which are mined from end sensory nodes constantly exposed to the network. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel edge computing framework, named Federated Compressed Learning (FCL), which provides efficient data generation while ensuring data privacy for PM2.5 predictions in the application of smart city sensing. The proposed scheme inherits the basic ideas of the compression technique, regional joint learning, and considers a secure data exchange. Thus, it could reduce the data quantity while preserving data privacy. This study would like to develop a green energy-based wireless sensing network system by using FCL edge computing framework. It is also one of key technologies of software and hardware co-design for reconfigurable and customized sensing devices application. Consequently, the prototypes are developed in order to validate the performances of the proposed framework. The results show that the data consumption is reduced by more than 95% with an error rate below 5%. Finally, the prediction results based on the FCL will generate slightly lower accuracy compared with centralized training. However, the data could be heavily compacted and securely transmitted in WSNs.

AB  - With the increasing use of mobile devices, malware attacks are rising, especially on Android phones, which account for 72.2% of the total market share. Hackers try to attack smartphones with various methods such as credential theft, surveillance, and malicious advertising. Among numerous countermeasures, machine learning (ML)-based methods have proven to be an effective means of detecting these attacks, as they are able to derive a classifier from a set of training examples, thus eliminating the need for an explicit definition of the signatures when developing malware detectors. This paper provides a systematic review of ML-based Android malware detection techniques. It critically evaluates 106 carefully selected articles and highlights their strengths and weaknesses as well as potential improvements. Finally, the ML-based methods for detecting source code vulnerabilities are discussed, because it might be more difficult to add security after the app is deployed. Therefore, this paper aims to enable researchers to acquire in-depth knowledge in the field and to identify potential future research and development directions.

AB  - Short-term load forecasting (STLF) is fundamental for the proper operation of power systems, as it finds its use in various basic processes. Therefore, advanced calculation techniques are needed to obtain accurate results of the consumption prediction, taking into account the numerous exogenous factors that influence the results’ precision. The purpose of this study is to integrate, additionally to the conventional factors (weather, holidays, etc.), the current aspects regarding the global COVID-19 pandemic in solving the STLF problem, using a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model. To evaluate and validate the impact of the new variables considered in the model, the simulations are conducted using publicly available data from the Romanian power system. A comparison study is further carried out to assess the performance of the proposed model, using the multiple linear regression method and load forecasting results provided by the Romanian Transmission System Operator (TSO). In this regard, the Mean Squared Error (MSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are used as evaluation indexes. The proposed methodology shows great potential, as the results reveal better error values compared to the TSO results, despite the limited historical data.

AB  - Remote monitoring sensor systems play a significant role in the evaluation and minimization of natural disasters and risk. This article presents a sustainable and real-time early warning system of sensors employed in flash flood prediction by using a rolling forecast model based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Golden Ratio Optimization (GROM) methods. This Early Flood Warning System (EFWS) aims to support decision makers by providing reliable and accurate information and warning about any possible flood events within an efficient lead-time to reduce any damages due to flash floods. In this work, to improve the performance of the EFWS, an ANN forecast model based on a new optimization method, GROM, is developed and compared to the traditional ANN model. Furthermore, due to the lack of literature regarding the optimal ANN structural model for forecasting the flash flood, this paper is one of the first extensive investigations into the impact of using different exogenous variables and parameters on the ANN structure. The effect of using a rolling forecast model compared to fixed model on the accuracy of the forecasts is investigated as well. The results indicate that the rolling ANN forecast model based on GROM successfully improved the model accuracy by 40% compared to the traditional ANN model and by 93.5% compared to the fixed forecast model.

AB  - Social distancing (SD) is an effective measure to prevent the spread of the infectious Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, a lack of spatial awareness may cause unintentional violations of this new measure. Against this backdrop, we propose an active surveillance system to slow the spread of COVID-19 by warning individuals in a region-of-interest. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a vision-based real-time system that can detect SD violations and send non-intrusive audio-visual cues using state-of-the-art deep-learning models. Second, we define a novel critical social density value and show that the chance of SD violation occurrence can be held near zero if the pedestrian density is kept under this value. The proposed system is also ethically fair: it does not record data nor target individuals, and no human supervisor is present during the operation. The proposed system was evaluated across real-world datasets.

AB  - More and more digital 3D city models might evolve into spatiotemporal instruments with time as the 4th dimension. For digitizing the current situation, 3D scanning and photography are suitable tools. The spatial future could be integrated using 3D drawings by public space designers and architects. The digital spatial reconstruction of lost historical environments is more complex, expensive and rarely done. Three-dimensional co-creative digital drawing with citizens’ collaboration could be a solution. In 2016, the City of Ghent (Belgium) launched the “3D city game Ghent” project with time as one of the topics, focusing on the reconstruction of disappeared environments. Ghent inhabitants modelled in open-source 3D software and added animated 3D gamification and Transmedia Storytelling, resulting in a 4D web environment and VR/AR/XR applications. This study analyses this low-cost interdisciplinary 3D co-creative process and offers a framework to enable other cities and municipalities to realise a parallel virtual universe (an animated digital twin bringing the past to life). The result of this co-creation is the start of an “Animated Spatial Time Machine” (AniSTMa), a term that was, to the best of our knowledge, never used before. This research ultimately introduces a conceptual 4D space–time diagram with a relation between the current physical situation and a growing number of 3D animated models over time.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Floods have been a major cause of destruction, instigating fatalities and massive damage to the infrastructure and overall economy of the affected country. Flood-related devastation results in the loss of homes, buildings, and critical infrastructure, leaving no means of communication or travel for the people stuck in such disasters. Thus, it is essential to develop systems that can detect floods in a region to provide timely aid and relief to stranded people, save their livelihoods, homes, and buildings, and protect key city infrastructure. Flood prediction and warning systems have been implemented in developed countries, but the manufacturing cost of such systems is too high for developing countries. Remote sensing, satellite imagery, global positioning system, and geographical information systems are currently used for flood detection to assess the flood-related damages. These techniques use neural networks, machine learning, or deep learning methods. However, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) coupled with convolution neural networks have not been explored in these contexts to instigate a swift disaster management response to minimize damage to infrastructure. Accordingly, this paper uses UAV-based aerial imagery as a flood detection method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract flood-related features from the images of the disaster zone. This method is effective in assessing the damage to local infrastructures in the disaster zones. The study area is based on a flood-prone region of the Indus River in Pakistan, where both pre-and post-disaster images are collected through UAVs. For the training phase, 2150 image patches are created by resizing and cropping the source images. These patches in the training dataset train the CNN model to detect and extract the regions where a flood-related change has occurred. The model is tested against both pre-and post-disaster images to validate it, which has positive flood detection results with an accuracy of 91%. Disaster management organizations can use this model to assess the damages to critical city infrastructure and other assets worldwide to instigate proper disaster responses and minimize the damages. This can help with the smart governance of the cities where all emergent disasters are addressed promptly.

AB  - Low power wide area networks (LPWAN) are comprised of small devices having restricted processing resources and limited energy budget. These devices are connected with each other using communication protocols. Considering their available resources, these devices can be used in a number of different Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Another interesting paradigm is machine learning, which can also be integrated with LPWAN technology to embed intelligence into these IoT applications. These machine learning-based applications combine intelligence with LPWAN and prove to be a useful tool. One such IoT application is in the medical field, where they can be used to provide multiple services. In the scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of LPWAN-based medical services has gained particular attention. This article describes various COVID-19-related healthcare services, using the the applications of machine learning and LPWAN in improving the medical domain during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We validate our idea with the help of a case study that describes a way to reduce the spread of any pandemic using LPWAN technology and machine learning. The case study compares k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and trust-based algorithms for mitigating the flow of virus spread. The simulation results show the effectiveness of KNN for curtailing the COVID-19 spread.

AB  - Purpose: the purpose of this study was to assess the evolution of computed tomography (CT) findings and lung residue in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, via quantified evaluation of the disease, using a computer aided tool. Materials and methods: we retrospectively evaluated 341 CT examinations of 140 patients (68 years of median age) infected with COVID-19 (confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)), who were hospitalized, and who received clinical and CT examinations. All CTs were evaluated by two expert radiologists, in consensus, at the same reading session, using a computer-aided tool for quantification of the pulmonary disease. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included the healthy residual parenchyma, ground glass opacity, consolidation, and total lung volume. Results: statistically significant differences (p value ≤ 0.05) were found among quantified volumes of healthy residual parenchyma, ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and total lung volume, considering different clinical conditions (stable, improved, and worsened). Statistically significant differences were found among quantified volumes for healthy residual parenchyma, GGO, and consolidation (p value ≤ 0.05) between dead patients and discharged patients. CT was not performed on cadavers; the death was an outcome, which was retrospectively included to differentiate findings of patients who survived vs. patients who died during hospitalization. Among discharged patients, complete disease resolutions on CT scans were observed in 62/129 patients with lung disease involvement ≤5%; lung disease involvement from 5% to 15% was found in 40/129 patients, while 27/129 patients had lung disease involvement between 16 and 30%. Moreover, 8–21 days (after hospital admission) was an “advanced period” with the most severe lung disease involvement. After the extent of involvement started to decrease—particularly after 21 days—the absorption was more obvious. Conclusions: a complete disease resolution on chest CT scans was observed in 48.1% of discharged patients using a computer-aided tool to quantify the GGO and consolidation volumes; after 16 days of hospital admission, the abnormalities identified by chest CT began to improve; in particular, the absorption was more obvious after 21 days.

AB  - Research on SARS-CoV-2 and its social implications have become a major focus to interdisciplinary teams worldwide. As interest in more direct solutions, such as mass testing and vaccination grows, several studies appear to be dedicated to the operationalization of those solutions, leveraging both traditional and new methodologies, and, increasingly, the combination of both. This research examines the challenges anticipated for preventative testing of SARS-CoV-2 in schools and proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agent-based model crafted specifically for school scenarios. This research shows that in the absence of real data, simulation-based data can be used to develop an artificial intelligence model for the application of rapid assessment of school testing policies.

AB  - In the last decade, technological advancements in the cyber-physical system have set the basis for real-time and context-aware services to ease human lives. The citizens, especially travelers, want to experience a safe, healthy, and timely journey to their destination. Smart and on-ground real-time traffic analysis helps authorities further improve decision-making to ensure safe and convenient traveling. In this paper, we proposed a transport-control model that exploits cyber-physical systems (CPS) and sensor-technology to continuously monitor and mine the big city data for smart decision-making. The system makes use of travel-time, traffic intensity, vehicle’s speed, and current road conditions to construct a weighted city graph representing the road network. Traditional graph algorithms with efficient implementation technologies are employed to respond to commuters’ and authorities’ needs in order to achieve a smart and optimum transportation system. To efficiently process the incoming big data streams, the proposed architecture uses the Apache GraphX tool with several parallel processing nodes, along with Spark and Hadoop that ultimately provide better performance against various state-of-the-art solutions. The system is thoroughly evaluated in terms of system throughput and processing time, revealing that the proposed system is efficient, robust, and scalable.

AB  - Smart city networks involve many applications that impose specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, thus representing a challenging scenario for network management. Solutions aiming to guarantee QoS support have not been deployed in large-scale networks. Traffic classification is a mechanism used to manage different aspects, including QoS requirements. However, conventional traffic classification methods, such as the port-based method, are inefficient because of their inability to handle dynamic port allocation and encryption. Traffic classification using machine learning has gained research interest as an alternative method to achieve high performance. In fact, machine learning embeds intelligence into network functions, thus improving network management. In this study, we apply machine learning algorithms to predict network traffic classification. We apply four supervised learning algorithms: support vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and decision tree. We also apply a port-based method of traffic classification based on applications’ popular assigned port numbers. Then, we compare the results of this method to those obtained from the machine learning algorithms. The evaluation results indicate that the decision tree algorithm provides the highest average accuracy among the evaluated algorithms, at 99.18%. Moreover, network traffic classification using machine learning provides more accurate results and higher performance than the port-based method.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the advancement of technology and the arrival of miniaturized environmental sensors that offer greater performance, the idea of building mobile network sensing for air quality has quickly emerged to increase our knowledge of air pollution in urban environments. However, with these new techniques, the difficulty of building mathematical models capable of aggregating all these data sources in order to provide precise mapping of air quality arises. In this context, we explore the spatio-temporal geostatistics methods as a solution for such a problem and evaluate three different methods: Simple Kriging (SK) in residuals, Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Kriging with External Drift (KED). On average, geostatistical models showed 26.57% improvement in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to the standard Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) technique in interpolating scenarios (27.94% for KED, 26.05% for OK, and 25.71% for SK). The results showed less significant scores in extrapolating scenarios (a 12.22% decrease in the RMSE for geostatisical models compared to IDW). We conclude that univariable geostatistics is suitable for interpolating this type of data but is less appropriate for an extrapolation of non-sampled places since it does not create any information.

AB  - There is a massive growth in malicious software (Malware) development, which causes substantial security threats to individuals and organizations. Cybersecurity researchers makes continuous efforts to defend against these malware risks. This research aims to exploit the significant advantages of Transfer Learning (TL) and Fine-Tuning (FT) methods to introduce efficient malware detection in the context of imbalanced families without the need to apply complex features extraction or data augmentation processes. Therefore, this paper proposes a visualized malware multi-classification framework to avoid false positives and imbalanced datasets’ challenges through using the fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN)-based TL models. The proposed framework comprises eight different FT CNN models including VGG16, AlexNet, DarkNet-53, DenseNet-201, Inception-V3, Places365-GoogleNet, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-V2. First, the binary files of different malware families were transformed into 2D images and then forwarded to the FT CNN models to detect and classify the malware families. The detection and classification performance was examined on a benchmark Malimg imbalanced dataset using different, comprehensive evaluation metrics. The evaluation results prove the FT CNN models’ significance in detecting malware types with high accuracy that reached 99.97% which also outperforms the performance of related machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based malware multi-classification approaches tested on the same malware dataset.

AB  - A repeatable and deterministic non-random weight initialization method in convolutional layers of neural networks examined with the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FSGM). Using the FSGM approach as a technique to measure the initialization effect with controlled distortions in transferred learning, varying the dataset numerical similarity. The focus is on convolutional layers with induced earlier learning through the use of striped forms for image classification. Which provided a higher performing accuracy in the first epoch, with improvements of between 3–5% in a well known benchmark model, and also ~10% in a color image dataset (MTARSI2), using a dissimilar model architecture. The proposed method is robust to limit optimization approaches like Glorot/Xavier and He initialization. Arguably the approach is within a new category of weight initialization methods, as a number sequence substitution of random numbers, without a tether to the dataset. When examined under the FGSM approach with transferred learning, the proposed method when used with higher distortions (numerically dissimilar datasets), is less compromised against the original cross-validation dataset, at ~31% accuracy instead of ~9%. This is an indication of higher retention of the original fitting in transferred learning.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - COVID-19 is a community-acquired infection with symptoms that resemble those of influenza and bacterial pneumonia. Creating an infection control policy involving isolation, disinfection of surfaces, and identification of contagions is crucial in eradicating such pandemics. Incorporating social distancing could also help stop the spread of community-acquired infections like COVID-19. Social distancing entails maintaining certain distances between people and reducing the frequency of contact between people. Meanwhile, a significant increase in the development of different Internet of Things (IoT) devices has been seen together with cyber-physical systems that connect with physical environments. Machine learning is strengthening current technologies by adding new approaches to quickly and correctly solve problems utilizing this surge of available IoT devices. We propose a new approach using machine learning algorithms for monitoring the risk of COVID-19 in public areas. Extracted features from IoT sensors are used as input for several machine learning algorithms such as decision tree, neural network, naïve Bayes classifier, support vector machine, and random forest to predict the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic and calculate the risk probability of public places. This research aims to find vulnerable populations and reduce the impact of the disease on certain groups using machine learning models. We build a model to calculate and predict the risk factors of populated areas. This model generates automated alerts for security authorities in the case of any abnormal detection. Experimental results show that we have high accuracy with random forest of 97.32%, with decision tree of 94.50%, and with the naïve Bayes classifier of 99.37%. These algorithms indicate great potential for crowd risk prediction in public areas.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - This work deals with the presentation of a spiking neural network as a means for efficiently solving the reduction of dimensionality of data in a nonlinear manner. The underneath neural model, which can be integrated as neuromorphic hardware, becomes suitable for intelligent processing in edge computing within Internet of Things systems. In this sense, to achieve a meaningful performance with a low complexity one-layer spiking neural network, the training phase uses the metaheuristic Artificial Bee Colony algorithm with an objective function from the principals in the machine learning science, namely, the modified Stochastic Neighbor Embedding algorithm. To demonstrate this fact, complex benchmark data were used and the results were compared with those generated by a reference network with continuous-sigmoid neurons. The goal of this work is to demonstrate via numerical experiments another method for training spiking neural networks, where the used optimizer comes from metaheuristics. Therefore, the key issue is defining the objective function, which can relate optimally the information at both sides of the spiking neural network. Certainly, machine learning techniques have advanced in defining efficient loss functions that can become suitable objective function candidates in the metaheuristic training phase. The practicality of these ideas is shown in this article. We use MSE values for evaluating the relative quality of the results and also co-ranking matrices.

AB  - With the increasing deployment of IoT devices and applications, a large number of devices that can sense and monitor the environment in IoT network are needed. This trend also brings great challenges, such as data explosion and energy insufficiency. This paper proposes a system that integrates mobile edge computing (MEC) technology and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technology to improve the service supply capability of WSN-assisted IoT applications. A novel optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total system energy consumption under the constraints of data transmission rate and transmitting power requirements by jointly considering power allocation, CPU frequency, offloading weight factor and energy harvest weight factor. Since the problem is non-convex, we propose a novel alternate group iteration optimization (AGIO) algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into three subproblems, and alternately optimizes each subproblem using the group interior point iterative algorithm. Numerical simulations validate that the energy consumption of our proposed design is much lower than the two benchmark algorithms. The relationship between system variables and energy consumption of the system is also discussed.

T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 14
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for remote sensing has the advantages of high flexibility, convenient operation, low cost, and wide application range. It fills the need for rapid acquisition of high-resolution aerial images in modern photogrammetry applications. Due to the insufficient parallaxes and the computation-intensive process, dense real-time reconstruction for large terrain scenes is a considerable challenge. To address these problems, we proposed a novel SLAM-based MVS (Multi-View-Stereo) approach, which can incrementally generate a dense 3D (three-dimensional) model of the terrain by using the continuous image stream during the flight. The pipeline of the proposed methodology starts with pose estimation based on SLAM algorithm. The tracked frames were then selected by a novel scene-adaptive keyframe selection method to construct a sliding window frame-set. This was followed by depth estimation using a flexible search domain approach, which can improve accuracy without increasing the iterate time or memory consumption. The whole system proposed in this study was implemented on the embedded GPU based on an UAV platform. We proposed a highly parallel and memory-efficient CUDA-based depth computing architecture, enabling the system to achieve good real-time performance. The evaluation experiments were carried out in both simulation and real-world environments. A virtual large terrain scene was built using the Gazebo simulator. The simulated UAV equipped with an RGB-D camera was used to obtain synthetic evaluation datasets, which were divided by flight altitudes (800-, 1000-, 1200 m) and terrain height difference (100-, 200-, 300 m). In addition, the system has been extensively tested on various types of real scenes. Comparison with commercial 3D reconstruction software is carried out to evaluate the precision in real-world data. According to the results on the synthetic datasets, over 93.462% of the estimation with absolute error distance of less then 0.9%. In the real-world dataset captured at 800 m flight height, more than 81.27% of our estimated point cloud are less then 5 m difference with the results of Photoscan. All evaluation experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

AB  - Crowd size estimation is a challenging problem, especially when the crowd is spread over a significant geographical area. It has applications in monitoring of rallies and demonstrations and in calculating the assistance requirements in humanitarian disasters. Therefore, accomplishing a crowd surveillance system for large crowds constitutes a significant issue. UAV-based techniques are an appealing choice for crowd estimation over a large region, but they present a variety of interesting challenges, such as integrating per-frame estimates through a video without counting individuals twice. Large quantities of annotated training data are required to design, train, and test such a system. In this paper, we have first reviewed several crowd estimation techniques, existing crowd simulators and data sets available for crowd analysis. Later, we have described a simulation system to provide such data, avoiding the need for tedious and error-prone manual annotation. Then, we have evaluated synthetic video from the simulator using various existing single-frame crowd estimation techniques. Our findings show that the simulated data can be used to train and test crowd estimation, thereby providing a suitable platform to develop such techniques. We also propose an automated UAV-based 3D crowd estimation system that can be used for approximately static or slow-moving crowds, such as public events, political rallies, and natural or man-made disasters. We evaluate the results by applying our new framework to a variety of scenarios with varying crowd sizes. The proposed system gives promising results using widely accepted metrics including MAE, RMSE, Precision, Recall, and F1 score to validate the results.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - As Internet of Things (IoT) networks expand globally with an annual increase of active devices, providing better safeguards to threats is becoming more prominent. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is the most viable solution that mitigates the threats of cyberattacks. Given the many constraints of the ever-changing network environment of IoT devices, an effective yet lightweight IDS is required to detect cyber anomalies and categorize various cyberattacks. Additionally, most publicly available datasets used for research do not reflect the recent network behaviors, nor are they made from IoT networks. To address these issues, in this paper, we have the following contributions: (1) we create a dataset from IoT networks, namely, the Center for Cyber Defense (CCD) IoT Network Intrusion Dataset V1 (CCD-INID-V1); (2) we propose a hybrid lightweight form of IDS—an embedded model (EM) for feature selection and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for attack detection and classification. The proposed method has two models: (a) RCNN: Random Forest (RF) is combined with CNN and (b) XCNN: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is combined with CNN. RF and XGBoost are the embedded models to reduce less impactful features. (3) We attempt anomaly (binary) classifications and attack-based (multiclass) classifications on CCD-INID-V1 and two other IoT datasets, the detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT dataset (Balot) and the CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 dataset (DoH20), to explore the effectiveness of these learning-based security models. Using RCNN, we achieved an Area under the Receiver Characteristic Operator (ROC) Curve (AUC) score of 0.956 with a runtime of 32.28 s on CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 71.46 s on Balot, and 0.986 with a runtime of 35.45 s on DoH20. Using XCNN, we achieved an AUC score of 0.998 with a runtime of 51.38 s for CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 72.12 s for Balot, and 0.999 with a runtime of 72.91 s for DoH20. Compared to KNN, XCNN required 86.98% less computational time, and RCNN required 91.74% less computational time to achieve equal or better accurate anomaly detections. We find XCNN and RCNN are consistently efficient and handle scalability well; in particular, 1000 times faster than KNN when dealing with a relatively larger dataset-Balot. Finally, we highlight RCNN and XCNN’s ability to accurately detect anomalies with a significant reduction in computational time. This advantage grants flexibility for the IDS placement strategy. Our IDS can be placed at a central server as well as resource-constrained edge devices. Our lightweight IDS requires low train time and hence decreases reaction time to zero-day attacks.

SN  - 2073-431X

AB  - With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, more and more smart devices are connected to the Internet. Since these devices were designed for better connections with each other, very limited security mechanisms have been considered. It would be costly to develop separate security mechanisms for the diverse behaviors in different devices. Given new and changing devices and attacks, it would be helpful if the characteristics of diverse device types could be dynamically learned for better protection. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to device type identification through network traffic analysis for anomaly detection in IoT. Firstly, the characteristics of different device types are learned from their generated network packets using supervised learning methods. Secondly, by learning important features from selected device types, we further compare the effects of unsupervised learning methods including One-class SVM, Isolation forest, and autoencoders for dimensionality reduction. Finally, we evaluate the performance of anomaly detection by transfer learning with autoencoders. In our experiments on real data in the target factory, the best performance of device type identification can be achieved by XGBoost with an accuracy of 97.6%. When adopting autoencoders for learning features from the network packets in Modbus TCP protocol, the best F1 score of 98.36% can be achieved. Comparable performance of anomaly detection can be achieved when using autoencoders for transfer learning from the reference dataset in the literature to our target site. This shows the potential of the proposed approach for automatic anomaly detection in smart factories. Further investigation is needed to verify the proposed approach using different types of devices in different IoT environments.

AB  - Sustainable development can be attained at a microlevel and having smart campuses around the world presents an opportunity to achieve city-wide smartness. In the process of attaining smartness on campuses, the elements requiring attention must be investigated. There are many publications on smart campuses, and this investigation used the bibliometric analysis method to identify such publications produced over the last decade. A matrix of 578 nodes and 3217 edges was developed from 285 publications on smart campus construction and procurement. Fifteen cluster themes were produced from the bibliometric analysis. The findings revealed that China contributed 48.4% of all published articles on the smart campus. The findings presented a framework from the cluster themes under the four broad infrastructure areas of building construction or repurposing, technology and IT network, continuous improvement, and smart learning and teaching management. The implications of the findings identified that IT project management, traditional procurement strategy, and standard forms of contracts such as the New Engineering Contract (NEC) and the Joint Contract Tribunal (JCT) are applicable in the procurement of smart cities.

The paper presents an algorithm for analyzing urban planning conflicts. The material for the study was data from social networks, microblogging, blogs, instant messaging, forums, reviews, video hosting services, thematic portals, online media, print media and TV related to the construction of the North-Eastern Chord (NEC) in Moscow (RF). To analyze the content of social media, a multimodal approach was used. The paper presents the results of research on the development of methods and approaches for constructing mathematical and neural network models for analyzing the social media users’ perceptions based on their digital footprints. Artificial neural networks, differential equations, and mathematical statistics were involved in building the models. Differential equations of dynamic systems were based on observations enabled by machine learning. Mathematical models were developed to quickly detect, prevent, and address conflicts in urban planning in order to manage urban systems efficiently. In combination with mathematical and neural network model the developed approaches, made it possible to draw a conclusion about the tense situation around the construction of the NEC, identify complaints of residents to constructors and city authorities, and propose recommendations to resolve and prevent conflicts. Research data could be of use in solving similar problems in sociology, ecology, and economics.

AB  - Since its emergence in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has swept through many cities around the world, claiming millions of lives and causing major socio-economic impacts. The pandemic occurred at an important historical juncture when smart solutions and technologies have become ubiquitous in many cities. Against this background, in this review, we examine how smart city solutions and technologies have contributed to resilience by enhancing planning, absorption, recovery, and adaptation abilities. For this purpose, we reviewed 147 studies that have discussed issues related to the use of smart solutions and technologies during the pandemic. The results were synthesized under four themes, namely, planning and preparation, absorption, recovery, and adaptation. This review shows that investment in smart city initiatives can enhance the planning and preparation ability. In addition, the adoption of smart solutions and technologies can, among other things, enhance the capacity of cities to predict pandemic patterns, facilitate an integrated and timely response, minimize or postpone transmission of the virus, provide support to overstretched sectors, minimize supply chain disruption, ensure continuity of basic services, and offer solutions for optimizing city operations. These are promising results that demonstrate the utility of smart solutions for enhancing resilience. However, it should be noted that realizing this potential hinges on careful attention to important issues and challenges related to privacy and security, access to open-source data, technological affordance, legal barriers, technological feasibility, and citizen engagement. Despite this, this review shows that further development of smart city initiatives can provide unprecedented opportunities for enhancing resilience to the pandemic and similar future events.

TI  - Using Machine Learning to Predict Retrofit Effects for a Commercial Building Portfolio
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 14
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Buildings account for 40% of the energy consumption and 31% of the CO2 emissions in the United States. Energy retrofits of existing buildings provide an effective means to reduce building consumption and carbon footprints. A key step in retrofit planning is to predict the effect of various potential retrofits on energy consumption. Decision-makers currently look to simulation-based tools for detailed assessments of a large range of retrofit options. However, simulations often require detailed building characteristic inputs, high expertise, and extensive computational power, presenting challenges for considering portfolios of buildings or evaluating large-scale policy proposals. Data-driven methods offer an alternative approach to retrofit analysis that could be more easily applied to portfolio-wide retrofit plans. However, current applications focus heavily on evaluating past retrofits, providing little decision support for future retrofits. This paper uses data from a portfolio of 550 federal buildings and demonstrates a data-driven approach to generalizing the heterogeneous treatment effect of past retrofits to predict future savings potential for assisting retrofit planning. The main findings include the following: (1) There is high variation in the predicted savings across retrofitted buildings, (2) GSALink, a dashboard tool and fault detection system, commissioning, and HVAC investments had the highest average savings among the six actions analyzed; and (3) by targeting high savers, there is a 110–300 billion Btu improvement potential for the portfolio in site energy savings (the equivalent of 12–32% of the portfolio-total site energy consumption).

PY  - 2021

IS  - 14
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Numerous reviews are posted every day on travel information sharing platforms and sites. Hotels want to develop a customer recommender system to quickly and effectively identify potential target customers. TripAdvisor, the travel website that provided the data used in this study, allows customers to rate the hotel based on six criteria: Value, Service, Location, Room, Cleanliness, and Sleep Quality. Existing studies classify reviews into positive, negative, and neutral by extracting sentiment terms through simple sentimental analysis. However, this method has limitations in that it does not consider various aspects of hotels well. Therefore, this study performs fine-tuning the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model using review data with rating labels on the TripAdvisor site. This study suggests a multi-criteria recommender system to recommend a suitable target customers for the hotel. As the rating values of six criteria of TripAdvisor are insufficient, the proposed recommender system uses fine-tuned BERT to predict six criteria ratings. Based on this predicted ratings, a multi-criteria recommender system recommends personalized Top-N customers for each hotel. The performance of the multi-criteria recommender system suggested in this study is better than that of the benchmark system, a single-criteria recommender system using overall ratings.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - As automated vehicles have been considered one of the important trends in intelligent transportation systems, various research is being conducted to enhance their safety. In particular, the importance of technologies for the design of preventive automated driving systems, such as detection of surrounding objects and estimation of distance between vehicles. Object detection is mainly performed through cameras and LiDAR, but due to the cost and limits of LiDAR’s recognition distance, the need to improve Camera recognition technique, which is relatively convenient for commercialization, is increasing. This study learned convolutional neural network (CNN)-based faster regions with CNN (Faster R-CNN) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) V2 to improve the recognition techniques of vehicle-mounted monocular cameras for the design of preventive automated driving systems, recognizing surrounding vehicles in black box highway driving videos and estimating distances from surrounding vehicles through more suitable models for automated driving systems. Moreover, we learned the PASCAL visual object classes (VOC) dataset for model comparison. Faster R-CNN showed similar accuracy, with a mean average precision (mAP) of 76.4 to YOLO with a mAP of 78.6, but with a Frame Per Second (FPS) of 5, showing slower processing speed than YOLO V2 with an FPS of 40, and a Faster R-CNN, which we had difficulty detecting. As a result, YOLO V2, which shows better performance in accuracy and processing speed, was determined to be a more suitable model for automated driving systems, further progressing in estimating the distance between vehicles. For distance estimation, we conducted coordinate value conversion through camera calibration and perspective transform, set the threshold to 0.7, and performed object detection and distance estimation, showing more than 80% accuracy for near-distance vehicles. Through this study, it is believed that it will be able to help prevent accidents in automated vehicles, and it is expected that additional research will provide various accident prevention alternatives such as calculating and securing appropriate safety distances, depending on the vehicle types.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Smart home applications are ubiquitous and have gained popularity due to the overwhelming use of Internet of Things (IoT)-based technology. The revolution in technologies has made homes more convenient, efficient, and even more secure. The need for advancement in smart home technology is necessary due to the scarcity of intelligent home applications that cater to several aspects of the home simultaneously, i.e., automation, security, safety, and reducing energy consumption using less bandwidth, computation, and cost. Our research work provides a solution to these problems by deploying a smart home automation system with the applications mentioned above over a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi (RPI) device. The RPI is used as a central controlling unit, which provides a cost-effective platform for interconnecting a variety of devices and various sensors in a home via the Internet. We propose a cost-effective integrated system for smart home based on IoT and Edge-Computing paradigm. The proposed system provides remote and automatic control to home appliances, ensuring security and safety. Additionally, the proposed solution uses the edge-computing paradigm to store sensitive data in a local cloud to preserve the customer’s privacy. Moreover, visual and scalar sensor-generated data are processed and held over edge device (RPI) to reduce bandwidth, computation, and storage cost. In the comparison with state-of-the-art solutions, the proposed system is 5% faster in detecting motion, and 5 ms and 4 ms in switching relay on and off, respectively. It is also 6% more efficient than the existing solutions with respect to energy consumption.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Information security is considered one of the most important issues in various infrastructures related to the field of data communication where most of the modern studies focus on finding effective and low-weight secure approaches. Digital watermarking is a trend in security techniques that hides data by using data embedding and data extraction processes. Watermarking technology is integrated into different frames without adding an overheard as in the conventional encryption. Therefore, it is efficient to be used in data encryption for applications that run over limited resources such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, different digital watermarking algorithms and approaches are presented. Additionally, watermarking requirements and challenges are illustrated in detail. Moreover, the common architecture of the watermarking system is described. Furthermore, IoT technology and its challenges are highlighted. Finally, the paper provides the motivations, objectives and applications of the recent secure watermarking techniques in IoT and summarises them into one table. In addition, the paper highlights the potential to apply the modified watermark algorithms to secure IoT networks.

TI  - Systematic Review of Contextual Suggestion and Recommendation Systems for Sustainable e-Tourism
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 15
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Agenda 2030 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 and 11 recognizes tourism as one of the central industries to global development to tackle global challenges. With the transformation of information and communication technologies (ICT), e-tourism has evolved globally to establish commercial relationships using the Internet for offering tourism-related products, including giving personalised suggestions. The contextual suggestion has emerged as a modified recommendation system that is integrated with information-retrieval techniques within large databases to provide tourists with a list of suggestions based on contexts, such as location, time of day, or day of the week (weekdays or weekends). This study surveyed literature in the field of contextual suggestion and recommendation systems with a focus on e-tourism. The concerns linked with approaches used in contextual suggestion and recommendation systems are highlighted in this systematic review, while motivations, recommendations, and practical implications in e-tourism are also discussed in this paper. A query search using the keywords “contextual suggestion system”, “recommendation system”, and “tourism” identified 143 relevant articles published from 2012 to 2020. Four major repositories are considered for searching, namely, (i) Science Direct, (ii) Scopus, (iii) IEEE, and (iv) Web of Science. This review was carried out under the protocols of four phases, namely, (i) query searching in major article repositories, (ii) removal of duplicates, (iii) scan of title and abstract, and (iv) complete reading of articles. To identify the gaps in current research, a taxonomy analysis was exemplified into categories and subcategories. The main categories were highlighted as (i) review articles, (ii) model/framework, and (iii) applications. Critical analysis was carried out on the basis of the available literature on the limitations of approaches used in contextual suggestion and recommendation systems. In conclusion, the approaches used are mainly based on content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, preference-based product ranking, and language modelling. The evaluation measures for the contextual suggestion system include precision, normalized discounted cumulative, and mean reciprocal rank, while test collections comprise Internet resources. Given that the tourism industry contributed to the environmental and social-economic development, contextual suggestion and recommendation systems have presented themselves to be relevant in integrating and achieving SDG 9 and SDG 11 in many ways such as web-based e-services by the government sector and smart gadgets based on reliable and real-time data and information for city planners as well as law enforcement personnel in a sustainable city.

AB  - The envisioned smart city domains are expected to rely heavily on artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) approaches for their operations, where the basic ingredient is data. Privacy of the data and training time have been major roadblocks to achieving the specific goals of each application domain. Policy makers, the research community, and the industrial sector have been putting their efforts into addressing these issues. Federated learning, with its distributed and local training approach, stands out as a potential solution to these challenges. In this article, we discuss the potential interplay of different technologies and AI for achieving the required features of future smart city services. Having discussed a few use-cases for future eHealth, we list design goals and technical requirements of the enabling technologies. The paper confines its focus on federated learning. After providing the tutorial on federated learning, we analyze the Federated Learning research literature. We also highlight the challenges. A solution sketch and high-level research directions may be instrumental in addressing the challenges.

AB  - Based on the constant need for safety and operational cost optimization, the air-cargo industry is continually evolving in the context of Industry 4.0. Used wisely, data can help the industry to provide critical resilience that will allow authorities to take proper measures/actions in response to unexpected disasters and secure societal protection. The “INTELLICONT” project combines state-of-the-art technologies blended with novel solutions to improve the loading/unloading time, the structural status awareness, and the safety and security of the air-cargo related operations (prior to, during, and after the flight), as well as to enhance their capabilities related to the execution of their duties. The suggested system is contextually aligned and harmonized with the existing international and EU regulations. In the present work, the remote monitoring and control system for intelligent aircraft cargo containers have been presented from the software perspective. The intelligent containers integrate three types of sensors, Structural Health Monitoring, fire suppression, and locking status indication. The focus has been given to the design and development of a Human Machine Interface (HMI) capable to visualize all related data for better and safer control of the aircraft cargo. It is shown that the system can contribute to making the air transportations safer, environmentally friendlier, faster and with the lowest possible cost.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Currently, smart farming is considered an effective solution to enhance the productivity of farms; thereby, it has recently received broad interest from service providers to offer a wide range of applications, from pest identification to asset monitoring. Although the emergence of digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), has led to significant advances in the smart farming industry, farming operations still need more efficient solutions. On the other hand, the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, is growing rapidly across many civil application domains. This paper aims to develop a farm monitoring system that incorporates UAV, LPWAN, and IoT technologies to transform the current farm management approach and aid farmers in obtaining actionable data from their farm operations. In this regard, an IoT-based water quality monitoring system was developed because water is an essential aspect in livestock development. Then, based on the Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN®) technology, a multi-channel LoRaWAN® gateway was developed and integrated into a vertical takeoff and landing drone to convey collected data from the sensors to the cloud for further analysis. In addition, to develop LoRaWAN®-based aerial communication, a series of measurements and simulations were performed under different configurations and scenarios. Finally, to enhance the efficiency of aerial-based data collection, the UAV path planning was optimized. Measurement results showed that the maximum achievable LoRa coverage when operating on-air via the drone is about 10 km, and the Longley–Rice irregular terrain model provides the most suitable path loss model for the scenario of large-scale farms, and a multi-channel gateway with a spreading factor of 12 provides the most reliable communication link at a high drone speed (up to 95 km/h). Simulation results showed that the developed system can overcome the coverage limitation of LoRaWAN® and it can establish a reliable communication link over large-scale wireless sensor networks. In addition, it was shown that by optimizing flight paths, aerial data collection could be performed in a much shorter time than industrial mission planning (up to four times in our case).

AB  - The tremendous number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, with their ubiquity, has provided us with unprecedented productivity and simplified our daily life. At the same time, the insecurity of these technologies ensures that our daily lives are surrounded by vulnerable computers, allowing for the launch of multiple attacks via large-scale botnets through the IoT. These attacks have been successful in achieving their heinous objectives. A strong identification strategy is essential to keep devices secured. This paper proposes and implements a model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in IoT networks that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to detect and classify binary and multiclass IoT network data. The proposed model is validated using the BoT-IoT, IoT Network Intrusion, MQTT-IoT-IDS2020, and IoT-23 intrusion detection datasets. Our proposed binary and multiclass classification model achieved an exceptionally high level of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - IEEE 802.11ax uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based random access (UORA) is a new feature for random channel access in wireless local area networks (WLANs). Similar to the legacy random access scheme in WLANs, UORA performs the OFDMA backoff (OBO) procedure to access the channel and decides on a random OBO counter within the OFDMA contention window (OCW) value. An access point (AP) can determine the OCW range and inform each station (STA) of it. However, how to determine a reasonable OCW range is beyond the scope of the IEEE 802.11ax standard. The OCW range is crucial to the UORA performance, and it primarily depends on the number of contending STAs, but it is challenging for the AP to accurately and quickly estimate or keep track of the number of contending STAs without the aid of a specific signaling mechanism. In addition, the one for this purpose incurs an additional delay and overhead in the channel access procedure. Therefore, the performance of a UORA scheme can be degraded by an improper OCW range, especially when the number of contending STAs changes dynamically. We first observed the effect of OCW values on channel efficiency and derived its optimal value from an analytical model. Next, we proposed a simple yet effective OBO control scheme where each STA determines its own OBO counter in a distributed manner rather than adjusting the OCW value globally. In the proposed scheme, each STA determines an appropriate OBO counter depending on whether the previous transmission was successful or not so that collisions can be mitigated without leaving OFDMA resource units unnecessarily idle. The results of a simulation study confirm that the throughput of the proposed scheme is comparable to the optimal OCW-based scheme and is improved by up to 15 times compared to the standard UORA scheme.

AB  - With the ongoing efforts for widespread Internet of Things (IoT) adoption, one of the key factors hindering the wide acceptance of IoT is security. Securing IoT networks such as the electric power grid or water supply systems has emerged as a major national and global priority. To address the security issue of IoT, several studies are being carried out that involve the use of, but are not limited to, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and edge/fog computing. Authentication and authorization are crucial aspects of the CIA triad to protect the network from malicious parties. However, existing authorization and authentication schemes are not sufficient for handling security, due to the scale of the IoT networks and the resource-constrained nature of devices. In order to overcome challenges due to various constraints of IoT networks, there is a significant interest in using machine learning techniques to assist in the authentication and authorization process for IoT. In this paper, recent advances in authentication and authorization techniques for IoT networks are reviewed. Based on the review, we present a taxonomy of authentication and authorization schemes in IoT focusing on machine learning-based schemes. Using the presented taxonomy, a thorough analysis is provided of the authentication and authorization (AA) security threats and challenges for IoT. Furthermore, various criteria to achieve a high degree of AA resiliency in IoT implementations to enhance IoT security are evaluated. Lastly, a detailed discussion on open issues, challenges, and future research directions is presented for enabling secure communication among IoT nodes.

AB  - The exponential evolution of technology and the growth of the elderly population are two phenomena that will inevitably interact with increasing frequency in the future. This paper analyses scientific literature as a means of furthering progress in sustainable technology for senior living. We carried out a bibliometric analysis of papers published in this area and compiled by the Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus, examining the main participants and advances in the field from 2000 to the first quarter of 2021. The study describes some interesting research projects addressing three different aspects of older adults’ daily lives—health, daily activities and wellbeing—and policies to promote healthy aging and improve the sustainability of the healthcare system. It also looks at lines of research into transversal characteristics of technology. Our analysis showed that publications mentioning sustainability technologies for older adults have been growing progressively since the 2000s, but that the big increase in the number of research works in this area took place during the period 2016–2021. These more recent works show a tendency to study those factors that improve healthy aging, ensure the social inclusion of the elderly through technology and prolong the time in which they can live independent lives thanks to smart environments. Current research gaps in the literature are also discussed.

AB  - From the end of 2019, the world has been facing the threat of COVID-19. It is predicted that, before herd immunity is achieved globally via vaccination, people around the world will have to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic using precautionary steps. This paper suggests a COVID-19 identification and control system that operates in real-time. The proposed system utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) platform to capture users’ time-sensitive symptom information to detect potential cases of coronaviruses early on, to track the clinical measures adopted by survivors, and to gather and examine appropriate data to verify the existence of the virus. There are five key components in the framework: symptom data collection and uploading (via communication technology), a quarantine/isolation center, an information processing core (using artificial intelligent techniques), cloud computing, and visualization to healthcare doctors. This research utilizes eight machine/deep learning techniques—Neural Network, Decision Table, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, OneR, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Dense Neural Network (DNN), and the Long Short-Term Memory technique—to detect coronavirus cases from time-sensitive information. A simulation was performed to verify the eight algorithms, after selecting the relevant symptoms, on real-world COVID-19 data values. The results showed that five of these eight algorithms obtained an accuracy of over 90%. Conclusively, it is shown that real-world symptomatic information would enable these three algorithms to identify potential COVID-19 cases effectively with enhanced accuracy. Additionally, the framework presents responses to treatment for COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Botnets, groups of malware-infected hosts controlled by malicious actors, have gained prominence in an era of pervasive computing and the Internet of Things. Botnets have shown a capacity to perform substantial damage through distributed denial-of-service attacks, information theft, spam and malware propagation. In this paper, a systematic literature review on botnets is presented to the reader in order to obtain an understanding of the incentives, evolution, detection, mitigation and current trends within the field of botnet research in pervasive computing. The literature review focuses particularly on the topic of botnet detection and the proposed solutions to mitigate the threat of botnets in system security. Botnet detection and mitigation mechanisms are categorised and briefly described to allow for an easy overview of the many proposed solutions. The paper also summarises the findings to identify current challenges and trends within research to help identify improvements for further botnet mitigation research.

TI  - Preserving Geo-Indistinguishability of the Emergency Scene to Predict Ambulance Response Time
T2  - Mathematical and Computational Applications

PY  - 2021
VL  - 26
IS  - 3
SN  - 2297-8747

AB  - Emergency medical services (EMS) provide crucial emergency assistance and ambulatory services. One key measurement of EMS’s quality of service is their ambulances’ response time (ART), which generally refers to the period between EMS notification and the moment an ambulance arrives on the scene. Due to many victims requiring care within adequate time (e.g., cardiac arrest), improving ARTs is vital. This paper proposes to predict ARTs using machine-learning (ML) techniques, which could be used as a decision-support system by EMS to allow a dynamic selection of ambulance dispatch centers. However, one well-known predictor of ART is the location of the emergency (e.g., if it is urban or rural areas), which is sensitive data because it can reveal who received care and for which reason. Thus, we considered the ‘input perturbation’ setting in the privacy-preserving ML literature, which allows EMS to sanitize each location data independently and, hence, ML models are trained only with sanitized data. In this paper, geo-indistinguishability was applied to sanitize each emergency location data, which is a state-of-the-art formal notion based on differential privacy. To validate our proposals, we used retrospective data of an EMS in France, namely Departmental Fire and Rescue Service of Doubs, and publicly available data (e.g., weather and traffic data). As shown in the results, the sanitization of location data and the perturbation of its associated features (e.g., city, distance) had no considerable impact on predicting ARTs. With these findings, EMSs may prefer using and/or sharing sanitized datasets to avoid possible data leakages, membership inference attacks, or data reconstructions, for example.

TI  - An Efficient Hardware Design for a Low-Latency Traffic Flow Prediction System Using an Online Neural Network
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 16
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in human brains. They are trained in a batch learning mode; hence, the whole training data should be ready before the training task. However, this is not applicable for many real-time applications where data arrive sequentially such as online topic-detection in social communities, traffic flow prediction, etc. In this paper, an efficient hardware implementation of a low-latency online neural network system is proposed for a traffic flow prediction application. The proposed model is implemented with different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict the traffic flow with high accuracy where the Hedge Backpropagation (HBP) model achieves the least mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.001. The proposed system is implemented using floating point and fixed point arithmetics on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) part of the ZedBoard. The implementation is provided using BRAM architecture and distributed memory in FPGA in order to achieve the best trade-off between latency, the consumption of area, and power. Using the fixed point approach, the prediction times using the distributed memory and BRAM architectures are 150 ns and 420 ns, respectively. The area delay product (ADP) of the proposed system is reduced by 17 × compared with the hardware implementation of the latest proposed system in the literature. The execution time of the proposed hardware system is improved by 200 × compared with the software implemented on a dual core Intel i7-7500U CPU at 2.9 GHz. Consequently, the proposed hardware model is faster than the software model and more suitable for time-critical online machine learning models.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 9
IS  - 8
SN  - 2227-9032

AB  - To enhance the forecasting accuracy of daily teleconsultation demand, this study proposes an ensemble hybrid deep learning model. The proposed ensemble CNN attention-based BILSTM model (ECA-BILSTM) combines shallow convolutional neural networks (CNNs), attention mechanisms, and bidirectional long short-term memory (BILSTM). Moreover, additional variables are selected according to the characteristics of teleconsultation demand and added to the inputs of forecasting models. To verify the superiority of ECA-BILSTM and the effectiveness of additional variables, two actual teleconsultation datasets collected in the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC) are used as the experimental data. Results showed that ECA-BILSTMs can significantly outperform corresponding benchmark models. And two key additional variables were identified for teleconsultation demand prediction improvement. Overall, the proposed ECA-BILSTM model with effective additional variables is a feasible promising approach in teleconsultation demand forecasting.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - A successful application of low-cost 3D cameras in combination with artificial intelligence (AI)-based 3D object detection algorithms to outdoor mobile mapping would offer great potential for numerous mapping, asset inventory, and change detection tasks in the context of smart cities. This paper presents a mobile mapping system mounted on an electric tricycle and a procedure for creating on-street parking statistics, which allow government agencies and policy makers to verify and adjust parking policies in different city districts. Our method combines georeferenced red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) imagery from two low-cost 3D cameras with state-of-the-art 3D object detection algorithms for extracting and mapping parked vehicles. Our investigations demonstrate the suitability of the latest generation of low-cost 3D cameras for real-world outdoor applications with respect to supported ranges, depth measurement accuracy, and robustness under varying lighting conditions. In an evaluation of suitable algorithms for detecting vehicles in the noisy and often incomplete 3D point clouds from RGB-D cameras, the 3D object detection network PointRCNN, which extends region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) to 3D point clouds, clearly outperformed all other candidates. The results of a mapping mission with 313 parking spaces show that our method is capable of reliably detecting parked cars with a precision of 100% and a recall of 97%. It can be applied to unslotted and slotted parking and different parking types including parallel, perpendicular, and angle parking.

AB  - A method of direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation for FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) radar is presented. In addition to MUSIC, which is the popular high-resolution DoA estimation algorithm, deep learning has recently emerged as a very promising alternative. It is proposed in this paper to use a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for DoA estimation. The 3D-CNN extracts from the radar data cube spectrum features of the region of interest (RoI) centered on the potential positions of the targets, thereby capturing the spectrum phase shift information, which corresponds to DoA, along the antenna axis. Finally, the results of simulations and experiments are provided to demonstrate the superior performance, as well as the limitations, of the proposed 3D-CNN.

AB  - Due to Internet of Things (IoT), it has become easy to surveil the critical regions. Images are important parts of Surveillance Systems, and it is required to protect the images during transmission and storage. These secure surveillance frameworks are required in IoT systems, because any kind of information leakage can thwart the legal system as well as personal privacy. In this paper, a secure surveillance framework for IoT systems is proposed using image encryption. A hyperchaotic map is used to generate the pseudorandom sequences. The initial parameters of the hyperchaotic map are obtained using partial-regeneration-based non-dominated optimization (PRNDO). The permutation and diffusion processes are applied to generate the encrypted images, and the convolution neural network (CNN) can play an essential role in this part. The performance of the proposed framework is assessed by drawing comparisons with competitive techniques based on security parameters. It shows that the proposed framework provides promising results as compared to the existing techniques.

AB  - Citizens play a core role in sustainable cities as users of the services delivered by cities and as active participants in initiatives aimed at making cities more sustainable. This paper considers the role of citizens as information providers and discusses the conditions under which citizens can participate in the development of sustainable cities. The objective of this study is to document the sustainability of an urban transit system and evaluate its compliance, with citizen participation as a major contributor. The methodology used is intensive field visits, interviews, and a mixed analysis of Sant Andreu de Palomar District in Barcelona city. The circulating vehicles are quantitatively monitored, qualitative problems are detected, and the typology of vehicles and other aspects identified and detailed in the study are indicated. All this information is contrasted with that of the technological sensors in the sectors. The results indicate that vehicles in the current pattern of urban density planned under incorrect sensor operation influence sustainable behavior through agglomerative clustering. This paper provides recommendations for future urban sustainability assessment research, including the employment of mixed-methods research, among other strategies. This article is intended to assist policymakers and traffic engineers in evaluating the sustainability of urban transportation infrastructure projects considering citizens as sensors.

TI  - Network Intrusion Detection Based on an Efficient Neural Architecture Search
T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 8
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Deep learning has been applied in the field of network intrusion detection and has yielded good results. In malicious network traffic classification tasks, many studies have achieved good performance with respect to the accuracy and recall rate of classification through self-designed models. In deep learning, the design of the model architecture greatly influences the results. However, the design of the network model architecture usually requires substantial professional knowledge. At present, the focus of research in the field of traffic monitoring is often directed elsewhere. Therefore, in the classification task of the network intrusion detection field, there is much room for improvement in the design and optimization of the model architecture. A neural architecture search (NAS) can automatically search the architecture of the model under the premise of a given optimization goal. For this reason, we propose a model that can perform NAS in the field of network traffic classification and search for the optimal architecture suitable for traffic detection based on the network traffic dataset. Each layer of our depth model is constructed according to the principle of maximum coding rate attenuation, which has strong consistency and symmetry in structure. Compared with some manually designed network architectures, classification indicators, such as Top-1 accuracy and F1 score, are also greatly improved while ensuring the lightweight nature of the model. In addition, we introduce a surrogate model in the search task. Compared to using the traditional NAS model to search the network traffic classification model, our NAS model greatly improves the search efficiency under the premise of ensuring that the results are not substantially different. We also manually adjust some operations in the search space of the architecture search to find a set of model operations that are more suitable for traffic classification. Finally, we apply the searched model to other traffic datasets to verify the universality of the model. Compared with several common network models in the traffic field, the searched model (NAS-Net) performs better, and the classification effect is more accurate.

TI  - Intelligent Stretch Optimization in Information Centric Networking-Based Tactile Internet Applications
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 16
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The fifth-generation (5G) mobile network services are currently being made available for different use case scenarios like enhanced mobile broadband, ultra-reliable and low latency communication, and massive machine-type communication. The ever-increasing data requests from the users have shifted the communication paradigm to be based on the type of the requested data content or the so-called information-centric networking (ICN). The ICN primarily aims to enhance the performance of the network infrastructure in terms of the stretch to opt for the best routing path. Reduction in stretch merely reduces the end-to-end (E2E) latency to ensure the requirements of the 5G-enabled tactile internet (TI) services. The foremost challenge tackled by the ICN-based system is to minimize the stretch while selecting an optimal routing path. Therefore, in this work, a reinforcement learning-based intelligent stretch optimization (ISO) strategy has been proposed to reduce stretch and obtain an optimal routing path in ICN-based systems for the realization of 5G-enabled TI services. A Q-learning algorithm is utilized to explore and exploit the different routing paths within the ICN infrastructure. The problem is designed as a Markov decision process and solved with the help of the Q-learning algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy finds the optimal routing path for the delay-sensitive haptic-driven services of 5G-enabled TI based upon their stretch profile over ICN, such as the augmented reality /virtual reality applications. Moreover, we compare and evaluate the simulation results of propsoed ISO strategy with random routing strategy and history aware routing protocol (HARP). The proposed ISO strategy reduces 33.33% and 33.69% delay as compared to random routing and HARP, respectively. Thus, the proposed strategy suggests an optimal routing path with lesser stretch to minimize the E2E latency.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The paper describes the process of designing a simple fiducial marker. The marker is meant for use in augmented reality applications. Unlike other systems, it does not encode any information, but it can be used for obtaining the position, rotation, relative size, and projective transformation. Also, the system works well with motion blur and is resistant to the marker’s imperfections, which could theoretically be drawn only by hand. Previous systems put constraints on colors that need to be used to form the marker. The proposed system works with any saturated color, leading to better blending with the surrounding environment. The marker’s final shape is a rectangular area of a solid color with three lines of a different color going from the center to three corners of the rectangle. Precise detection can be achieved using neural networks, given that the training set is very varied and well designed. A detailed literature review was performed, and no such system was found. Therefore, the proposed design is novel for localization in the spatial scene. The testing proved that the system works well both indoor and outdoor, and the detections are precise.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Indoor navigation systems incorporating augmented reality allow users to locate places within buildings and acquire more knowledge about their environment. However, although diverse works have been introduced with varied technologies, infrastructure, and functionalities, a standardization of the procedures for elaborating these systems has not been reached. Moreover, while systems usually handle contextual information of places in proprietary formats, a platform-independent model is desirable, which would encourage its access, updating, and management. This paper proposes a methodology for developing indoor navigation systems based on the integration of Augmented Reality and Semantic Web technologies to present navigation instructions and contextual information about the environment. It comprises four modules to define a spatial model, data management (supported by an ontology), positioning and navigation, and content visualization. A mobile application system was developed for testing the proposal in academic environments, modeling the structure, routes, and places of two buildings from independent institutions. The experiments cover distinct navigation tasks by participants in both scenarios, recording data such as navigation time, position tracking, system functionality, feedback (answering a survey), and a navigation comparison when the system is not used. The results demonstrate the system’s feasibility, where the participants show a positive interest in its functionalities.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 16
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - To provide more accurate and stable recommendations, it is necessary to combine display information with implicit information and to dig out potential information. Existing methods only consider explicit feedback information or implicit feedback information unilaterally and ignore the potential information of explicit feedback information and implicit feedback information, which is also crucial to the accuracy of the recommendation system. However, the traditional Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN) recommendation ignores the attribute information in the meta-path and the interaction between the user and the item and, instead, only considers the linear characteristics of the user-object often ignoring its non-linear characteristics. Aiming at the potential information acquisition problem from assorted feedback, we propose a new top-N recommendation method MFDNN for Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs). First, we consider explicit and implicit feedback information to determine the potential preferences of users and the potential features of the product. Then, matrix factorization (MF) and a deep neural network (DNN) are fused to learn independent feature embeddings through MF and DNN, and fully considering the linear and non-linear characteristics of the user-object. MFDNN was tested on several real data sets, such as Movie-Lens, and compared with benchmark experiments. MFDNN significantly improved the hit ratio (HR) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). Further research showed that the meta-path bias had an excellent effect on the gain of potential information mining and the fusion of explicit and implicit information in the accuracy and stability of user interest classification.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 16
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are generally considered to be the next generation of engineered systems. However, the actual application of CPSs in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is still at a low level. The sensing method in the construction process plays a very important role in the establishment of CPSs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the application potential of computer vision-based sensing methods and provide practical suggestions through a literature review. This paper provides a review of the current application of CPSs in the AEC industry, summarizes the current knowledge gaps, and discusses the problems with the current construction site sensing approach. Considering the unique advantages of the computer vision (CV) method at the construction site, the application of CV for different construction entities was reviewed and summarized to achieve a CV-based construction site sensing approach for construction process CPSs. The potential of CPS can be further stimulated by providing rich information from on-site sensing using CV methods. According to the review, this approach has unique advantages in the specific environment of the construction site. Based on the current knowledge gap identified in the literature review, this paper proposes a novel concept of visual-based construction site sensing method for CPS application, and an architecture for CV-based CPS is proposed as an implementation of this concept. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a CPS architecture using computer vision as the main information acquisition method based on the literature review. This architecture innovatively introduces computer vision as a sensing method of construction sites, and realizes low-cost and non-invasive information acquisition in complex construction scenarios. This method can be used as an important supplement to on-site sensing to further promote the automation and intelligence of the construction process.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology and provides connectivity among physical objects with the support of 5G communication. In recent decades, there have been a lot of applications based on IoT technology for the sustainability of smart cities, such as farming, e-healthcare, education, smart homes, weather monitoring, etc. These applications communicate in a collaborative manner between embedded IoT devices and systematize daily routine tasks. In the literature, many solutions facilitate remote users to gather the observed data by accessing the stored information on the cloud network and lead to smart systems. However, most of the solutions raise significant research challenges regarding information sharing in mobile IoT networks and must be able to stabilize the performance of smart operations in terms of security and intelligence. Many solutions are based on 5G communication to support high user mobility and increase the connectivity among a huge number of IoT devices. However, such approaches lack user and data privacy against anonymous threats and incur resource costs. In this paper, we present a mobility support 5G architecture with real-time routing for sustainable smart cities that aims to decrease the loss of data against network disconnectivity and increase the reliability for 5G-based public healthcare networks. The proposed architecture firstly establishes a mutual relationship among the nodes and mobile sink with shared secret information and lightweight processing. Secondly, multi-secured levels are proposed to protect the interaction with smart transmission systems by increasing the trust threshold over the insecure channels. The conducted experiments are analyzed, and it is concluded that their performance significantly increases the information sustainability for mobile networks in terms of security and routing.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Density-based clustering algorithms have been the most commonly used algorithms for discovering regions and points of interest in cities using global positioning system (GPS) information in geo-tagged photos. However, users sometimes find more specific areas of interest using real objects captured in pictures. Recent advances in deep learning technology make it possible to recognize these objects in photos. However, since deep learning detection is a very time-consuming task, simply combining deep learning detection with density-based clustering is very costly. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm supporting deep content and density-based clustering, called deep density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DeepDBSCAN). DeepDBSCAN incorporates object detection by deep learning into the density clustering algorithm using the nearest neighbor graph technique. Additionally, this supports a graph-based reduction algorithm that reduces the number of deep detections. We performed experiments with pictures shared by users on Flickr and compared the performance of multiple algorithms to demonstrate the excellence of the proposed algorithm.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The substantial advancements offered by the edge computing has indicated serious evolutionary improvements for the internet of things (IoT) technology. The rigid design philosophy of the traditional network architecture limits its scope to meet future demands. However, information centric networking (ICN) is envisioned as a promising architecture to bridge the huge gaps and maintain IoT networks, mostly referred as ICN-IoT. The edge-enabled ICN-IoT architecture always demands efficient in-network caching techniques for supporting better user’s quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we propose an enhanced ICN-IoT content caching strategy by enabling artificial intelligence (AI)-based collaborative filtering within the edge cloud to support heterogeneous IoT architecture. This collaborative filtering-based content caching strategy would intelligently cache content on edge nodes for traffic management at cloud databases. The evaluations has been conducted to check the performance of the proposed strategy over various benchmark strategies, such as LCE, LCD, CL4M, and ProbCache. The analytical results demonstrate the better performance of our proposed strategy with average gain of 15% for cache hit ratio, 12% reduction in content retrieval delay, and 28% reduced average hop count in comparison to best considered LCD. We believe that the proposed strategy will contribute an effective solution to the related studies in this domain.

AB  - With exponential growth in the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, many new innovative and real-life applications are being developed. IoT supports such applications with the help of resource-constrained fixed as well as mobile nodes. These nodes can be placed in anything from vehicles to the human body to smart homes to smart factories. Mobility of the nodes enhances the network coverage and connectivity. One of the crucial requirements in IoT systems is the accurate and fast localization of its nodes with high energy efficiency and low cost. The localization process has several challenges. These challenges keep changing depending on the location and movement of nodes such as outdoor, indoor, with or without obstacles and so on. The performance of localization techniques greatly depends on the scenarios and conditions from which the nodes are traversing. Precise localization of nodes is very much required in many unique applications. Although several localization techniques and algorithms are available, there are still many challenges for the precise and efficient localization of the nodes. This paper classifies and discusses various state-of-the-art techniques proposed for IoT node localization in detail. It includes the different approaches such as centralized, distributed, iterative, ranged based, range free, device-based, device-free and their subtypes. Furthermore, the different performance metrics that can be used for localization, comparison of the different techniques, some prominent applications in smart cities and future directions are also covered.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) workflow applications have been rapidly growing in practice. These internet-based applications can run on the distributed healthcare sensing system, which combines mobile computing, edge computing and cloud computing. Offloading and scheduling are the required methods in the distributed network. However, a security issue exists and it is hard to run different types of tasks (e.g., security, delay-sensitive, and delay-tolerant tasks) of IoMT applications on heterogeneous computing nodes. This work proposes a new healthcare architecture for workflow applications based on heterogeneous computing nodes layers: an application layer, management layer, and resource layer. The goal is to minimize the makespan of all applications. Based on these layers, the work proposes a secure offloading-efficient task scheduling (SEOS) algorithm framework, which includes the deadline division method, task sequencing rules, homomorphic security scheme, initial scheduling, and the variable neighbourhood searching method. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed plans outperform all existing baseline approaches for healthcare applications in terms of makespan.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - IoT technologies enable millions of devices to transmit their sensor data to the external world. The device–object pairing problem arises when a group of Internet of Things is concurrently tracked by cameras and sensors. While cameras view these things as visual “objects”, these things which are equipped with “sensing devices” also continuously report their status. The challenge is that when visualizing these things on videos, their status needs to be placed properly on the screen. This requires correctly pairing visual objects with their sensing devices. There are many real-life examples. Recognizing a vehicle in videos does not imply that we can read its pedometer and fuel meter inside. Recognizing a pet on screen does not mean that we can correctly read its necklace data. In more critical ICU environments, visualizing all patients and showing their physiological signals on screen would greatly relieve nurses’ burdens. The barrier behind this is that the camera may see an object but not be able to see its carried device, not to mention its sensor readings. This paper addresses the device–object pairing problem and presents a multi-camera, multi-IoT device system that enables visualizing a group of people together with their wearable devices’ data and demonstrating the ability to recover the missing bounding box.

AB  - Recently, many companies have adopted smart factories to increase productivity and efficiency. However, the fashion industry is one of the industries that have been relatively slow at embracing automation and switching to a smart factory. The purpose of the study is to suggest the future direction of the low-maturity smart factory in the fashion industry through newspaper analysis. In this study, semantic network analysis and convergence of iterated correlation (CONCOR) analysis were performed on 15,523 news articles. The analyses revealed that the smart fashion factory was developing to incorporate automated, unmanned, and intelligent operation. The problem of job loss owing to the smart factory was also heavily addressed in the news articles. In the newspaper articles, the view that the smart factory is efficient, fast, and innovative, and concerns regarding the possible damages that will result from hacking and machine malfunction were simultaneously expressed. Therefore, if news about security improvement emerges in the future, negative public opinion will be reduced, positively influencing the government’s support for smart factories and policy making.

AB  - Smart cities connect people and places using innovative technologies such as Data Mining (DM), Machine Learning (ML), big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper presents a bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of studies associated with DM technologies used in smart cities applications. The study aims to identify the main DM techniques used in the context of smart cities and how the research field of DM for smart cities evolves over time. We adopted both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the topic. We used the Scopus database to find relative articles published in scientific journals. This study covers 197 articles published over the period from 2013 to 2021. For the bibliometric analysis, we used the Biliometrix library, developed in R. Our findings show that there is a wide range of DM technologies used in every layer of a smart city project. Several ML algorithms, supervised or unsupervised, are adopted for operating the instrumentation, middleware, and application layer. The bibliometric analysis shows that DM for smart cities is a fast-growing scientific field. Scientists from all over the world show a great interest in researching and collaborating on this interdisciplinary scientific field.

TI  - Automating Visual Blockage Classification of Culverts with Deep Learning
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 16
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Blockage of culverts by transported debris materials is reported as the salient contributor in originating urban flash floods. Conventional hydraulic modeling approaches had no success in addressing the problem primarily because of the unavailability of peak floods hydraulic data and the highly non-linear behavior of debris at the culvert. This article explores a new dimension to investigate the issue by proposing the use of intelligent video analytics (IVA) algorithms for extracting blockage related information. The presented research aims to automate the process of manual visual blockage classification of culverts from a maintenance perspective by remotely applying deep learning models. The potential of using existing convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms (i.e., DarkNet53, DenseNet121, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MobileNet, ResNet50, VGG16, EfficientNetB3, NASNet) is investigated over a dataset from three different sources (i.e., images of culvert openings and blockage (ICOB), visual hydrology-lab dataset (VHD), synthetic images of culverts (SIC)) to predict the blockage in a given image. Models were evaluated based on their performance on the test dataset (i.e., accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1 score, Jaccard Index, region of convergence (ROC) curve), floating point operations per second (FLOPs) and response times to process a single test instance. Furthermore, the performance of deep learning models was benchmarked against conventional machine learning algorithms (i.e., SVM, RF, xgboost). In addition, the idea of classifying deep visual features extracted by CNN models (i.e., ResNet50, MobileNet) using conventional machine learning approaches was also implemented in this article. From the results, NASNet was reported most efficient in classifying the blockage images with the 5-fold accuracy of 85%; however, MobileNet was recommended for the hardware implementation because of its improved response time with 5-fold accuracy comparable to NASNet (i.e., 78%). Comparable performance to standard CNN models was achieved for the case where deep visual features were classified using conventional machine learning approaches. False negative (FN) instances, false positive (FP) instances and CNN layers activation suggested that background noise and oversimplified labelling criteria were two contributing factors in the degraded performance of existing CNN algorithms. A framework for partial automation of the visual blockage classification process was proposed, given that none of the existing models was able to achieve high enough accuracy to completely automate the manual process. In addition, a detection-classification pipeline with higher blockage classification accuracy (i.e., 94%) has been proposed as a potential future direction for practical implementation.

TI  - Big Data-Driven Pedestrian Analytics: Unsupervised Clustering and Relational Query Based on Tencent Street View Photographs

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Recent technological advancements in geomatics and mobile sensing have led to various urban big data, such as Tencent street view (TSV) photographs; yet, the urban objects in the big dataset have hitherto been inadequately exploited. This paper aims to propose a pedestrian analytics approach named vectors of uncountable and countable objects for clustering and analysis (VUCCA) for processing 530,000 TSV photographs of Hong Kong Island. First, VUCCA transductively adopts two pre-trained deep models to TSV photographs for extracting pedestrians and surrounding pixels into generalizable semantic vectors of features, including uncountable objects such as vegetation, sky, paved pedestrian path, and guardrail and countable objects such as cars, trucks, pedestrians, city animals, and traffic lights. Then, the extracted pedestrians are semantically clustered using the vectors, e.g., for understanding where they usually stand. Third, pedestrians are semantically indexed using relations and activities (e.g., walking behind a guardrail, road-crossing, carrying a backpack, or walking a pet) for queries of unstructured photographic instances or natural language clauses. The experiment results showed that the pedestrians detected in the TSV photographs were successfully clustered into meaningful groups and indexed by the semantic vectors. The presented VUCCA can enrich eye-level urban features into computational semantic vectors for pedestrians to enable smart city research in urban geography, urban planning, real estate, transportation, conservation, and other disciplines.

AB  - The provision of high data rate services to mobile users combined with improved quality of experience (i.e., zero latency multimedia content) drives technological evolution towards the design and implementation of fifth generation (5G) broadband wireless networks. To this end, a dynamic network design approach is adopted whereby network topology is configured according to service demands. In parallel, many private companies are interested in developing their own 5G networks, also referred to as non-public networks (NPNs), since this deployment is expected to leverage holistic production monitoring and support critical applications. In this context, this paper introduces a 5G NPN architectural approach, supporting among others various key enabling technologies, such as cell densification, disaggregated RAN with open interfaces, edge computing, and AI/ML-based network optimization. In the same framework, potential applications of our proposed approach in real world scenarios (e.g., support of mission critical services and computer vision analytics for emergencies) are described. Finally, scalability issues are also highlighted since a deployment framework of our architectural design in an additional real-world scenario related to Industry 4.0 (smart manufacturing) is also analyzed.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - Many smart city and society applications such as smart health (elderly care, medical applications), smart surveillance, sports, and robotics require the recognition of user activities, an important class of problems known as human activity recognition (HAR). Several issues have hindered progress in HAR research, particularly due to the emergence of fog and edge computing, which brings many new opportunities (a low latency, dynamic and real-time decision making, etc.) but comes with its challenges. This paper focuses on addressing two important research gaps in HAR research: (i) improving the HAR prediction accuracy and (ii) managing the frequent changes in the environment and data related to user activities. To address this, we propose an HAR method based on Soft-Voting and Self-Learning (SVSL). SVSL uses two strategies. First, to enhance accuracy, it combines the capabilities of Deep Learning (DL), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and AdaBoost classifiers using soft-voting. Second, to classify the most challenging data instances, the SVSL method is equipped with a self-training mechanism that generates training data and retrains itself. We investigate the performance of our proposed SVSL method using two publicly available datasets on six human activities related to lying, sitting, and walking positions. The first dataset consists of 562 features and the second dataset consists of five features. The data are collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope smartphone sensors. The results show that the proposed method provides 6.26%, 1.75%, 1.51%, and 4.40% better prediction accuracy (average over the two datasets) compared to GLM, DL, RF, and AdaBoost, respectively. We also analyze and compare the class-wise performance of the SVSL methods with that of DL, GLM, RF, and AdaBoost.

AB  - Address is a structured description used to identify a specific place or point of interest, and it provides an effective way to locate people or objects. The standardization of Chinese place name and address occupies an important position in the construction of a smart city. Traditional address specification technology often adopts methods based on text similarity or rule bases, which cannot handle complex, missing, and redundant address information well. This paper transforms the task of address standardization into calculating the similarity of address pairs, and proposes a contrast learning address matching model based on the attention-Bi-LSTM-CNN network (ABLC). First of all, ABLC use the Trie syntax tree algorithm to extract Chinese address elements. Next, based on the basic idea of contrast learning, a hybrid neural network is applied to learn the semantic information in the address. Finally, Manhattan distance is calculated as the similarity of the two addresses. Experiments on the self-constructed dataset with data augmentation demonstrate that the proposed model has better stability and performance compared with other baselines.

AB  - The increasing use of electric vehicles in road and air transportation, especially in last-mile delivery and city mobility, raises new operational challenges due to the limited capacity of electric batteries. These limitations impose additional driving range constraints when optimizing the distribution and mobility plans. During the last years, several researchers from the Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research communities have been developing optimization, simulation, and machine learning approaches that aim at generating efficient and sustainable routing plans for hybrid fleets, including both electric and internal combustion engine vehicles. After contextualizing the relevance of electric vehicles in promoting sustainable transportation practices, this paper reviews the existing work in the field of electric vehicle routing problems. In particular, we focus on articles related to the well-known vehicle routing, arc routing, and team orienteering problems. The review is followed by numerical examples that illustrate the gains that can be obtained by employing optimization methods in the aforementioned field. Finally, several research opportunities are highlighted.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The problem of structural imbalance in terms of supply and demand due to changes in traffic patterns by time zone has been continuously raised in the mobility market. In Korea, unlike large overseas cities, the waiting time tolerance increases during the daytime when supply far exceeds demand, resulting in a large loss of operating profit. The purpose of this study is to increase taxi demand and further improve driver’s profits through real-time fare discounts during off-peak daytime hours in Seoul, Korea. To this end, we propose a real-time fare bidding system among taxi drivers based on a dynamic pricing scheme and simulate the appropriate fare discount level for each regional time zone. The driver-to-driver fare competition system consists of simulating fare competition based on the multi-agent Deep Q-Network method after developing a fare discount index that reflects the supply and demand level of each region in 25 districts in Seoul. According to the optimal fare discount level analysis in the off-peak hours, the lower the OI Index, which means the level of demand relative to supply, the higher the fare discount rate. In addition, an analysis of drivers’ profits and matching rates according to the distance between the origin and destination of each region showed up to 89% and 65% of drivers who actively offered discounts on fares. The results of this study in the future can serve as the foundation of a fare adjustment system for varying demand and supply situations in the Korean mobility market.

AB  - The mobile communication networks sector has experienced a great evolution during the last few years. The emergence of new services as well as the growth in the number of subscribers have motivated the search for new ways to optimize mobile networks. In this way, the objective pursued by optimization techniques has been evolving, shifting from the traditional optimization of radio parameters to the improvement of the quality perceived by users, known as quality of experience (QoE). In mobile networks, the radio link control (RLC) layer provides a reliable link between both ends of the communication and has a great impact on the QoE. In this paper, the optimization of the QoE for users based on the adjustment of the RLC layer is proposed. For this purpose, two typical services demanded by the users of mobile networks have been selected: the real-time video streaming service and file transfer service. For a broader view of the behavior of the QoE in relation to RLC, optimization tests have been carried out in scenarios with different system bandwidths. In this way, the relationship between the QoE and the optimal configuration of RLC in different network load situations has been analyzed. A proof of concept has been carried out to show the capability of this optimization. To that end, both a cellular network simulator and a live cellular network devised for research purposes have been used.

AB  - The advantages of UAV video in flexibility, traceability, easy-operation, and abundant information make it a popular and powerful aerial tool applied in traffic monitoring in recent years. This paper proposed a systematic approach to detect and track vehicles based on the YOLO v3 model and the deep SORT algorithm for further extracting key traffic parameters. A field experiment was implemented to provide data for model training and validation to ensure the accuracy of the proposed approach. In the experiment, 5400 frame images and 1192 speed points were collected from two test vehicles equipped with high-precision GNSS-RTK and onboard OBD after completion of seven experimental groups with a different height (150 m to 500 m) and operating speed (40 km/h to 90 km/h). The results indicate that the proposed approach exhibits strong robustness and reliability, due to the 90.88% accuracy of object detection and 98.9% precision of tracking vehicle. Moreover, the absolute and relative error of extracted speed falls within ±3 km/h and 2%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the extracted parameters reaches up to 98%.

AB  - Artificial intelligence applications in fire safety of agricultural structures have practical economic and technological benefits on commercial agriculture. The FAO estimates that wildfires result in at least USD 1 billion in agriculture-related losses due to the destruction of livestock pasture, destruction of agricultural buildings, premature death of farm animals, and general disruption of agricultural activities. Even though artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and adaptive neurofuzzy inference systems (ANFISs), among others, have proven useful in fire prevention, their application is limited in real farm environments. Most farms rely on traditional/non-technology-based methods of fire prevention. The case for AI in agricultural fire prevention is grounded on the accuracy and reliability of computer simulations in smoke movement analysis, risk assessment, and postfire analysis. In addition, such technologies can be coupled with next-generation fire-retardant materials such as intumescent coatings with a polymer binder, blowing agent, carbon donor, and acid donor. Future prospects for AI in agriculture transcend basic fire safety to encompass Society 5.0, energy systems in smart cities, UAV monitoring, Agriculture 4.0, and decentralized energy. However, critical challenges must be overcome, including the health and safety aspects, cost, and reliability. In brief, AI offers unlimited potential in the prevention of fire hazards in farms, but the existing body of knowledge is inadequate.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can serve as an ideal mobile platform in various situations. Real-time object detection with on-board apparatus provides drones with increased flexibility as well as a higher intelligence level. In order to achieve good detection results in UAV images with complex ground scenes, small object size and high object density, most of the previous work introduced models with higher computational burdens, making deployment on mobile platforms more difficult.This paper puts forward a lightweight object detection framework. Besides being anchor-free, the framework is based on a lightweight backbone and a simultaneous up-sampling and detection module to form a more efficient detection architecture. Meanwhile, we add an objectness branch to assist the multi-class center point prediction, which notably improves the detection accuracy and only takes up very little computing resources. The results of the experiment indicate that the computational cost of this paper is 92.78% lower than the CenterNet with ResNet18 backbone, and the mAP is 2.8 points higher on the Visdrone-2018-VID dataset. A frame rate of about 220 FPS is achieved. Additionally, we perform ablation experiments to check on the validity of each part, and the method we propose is compared with other representative lightweight object detection methods on UAV image datasets.

AB  - Smart city is a collective term for technologies and concepts that are directed toward making cities efficient, technologically more advanced, greener and more socially inclusive. These concepts include technical, economic and social innovations. This term has been tossed around by various actors in politics, business, administration and urban planning since the 2000s to establish tech-based changes and innovations in urban areas. The idea of the smart city is used in conjunction with the utilization of digital technologies and at the same time represents a reaction to the economic, social and political challenges that post-industrial societies are confronted with at the start of the new millennium. The key focus is on dealing with challenges faced by urban society, such as environmental pollution, demographic change, population growth, healthcare, the financial crisis or scarcity of resources. In a broader sense, the term also includes non-technical innovations that make urban life more sustainable. So far, the idea of using IoT-based sensor networks for healthcare applications is a promising one with the potential of minimizing inefficiencies in the existing infrastructure. A machine learning approach is key to successful implementation of the IoT-powered wireless sensor networks for this purpose since there is large amount of data to be handled intelligently. Throughout this paper, it will be discussed in detail how AI-powered IoT and WSNs are applied in the healthcare sector. This research will be a baseline study for understanding the role of the IoT in smart cities, in particular in the healthcare sector, for future research works.

AB  - The epidemic disease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) called COVID-19 has become a more frequently active disease. Managing and monitoring COVID-19 patients is still a challenging issue for advanced technologies. The first and foremost critical issue in COVID-19 is to diagnose it timely and cut off the chain of transmission by isolating the susceptible and patients. COVID-19 spreads through close interaction and contact with an infected person. It has affected the entire world, and every country is facing the challenges of having adequate medical facilities along with the availability of medical staff in rural and urban areas that have a high number of patients due to the pandemic. Due to the invasive method of treatment, SARS-COVID is spreading swiftly. In this paper, we propose an intelligent health monitoring framework using wearable Internet of Things (IoT) and Geo-fencing for COVID-19 susceptible and patient monitoring, and isolation and quarantine management to control the pandemic. The proposed system consists of four layers, and each layer has different functionality: a wearable sensors layer, IoT gateway layer, cloud server layer, and client application layer for visualization and analysis. The wearable sensors layer consists of wearable biomedical and GPS sensors for physiological parameters, and GPS and Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator acquisition for health monitoring and user Geo-fencing. The IoT gateway layer provides a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi based wireless body area network and IoT environment for data transmission anytime and anywhere. Cloud servers use Raspberry Pi and ThingSpeak cloud for data analysis and web-based application layers for remote monitoring based on user consent. The susceptible and patient conditions, real-time sensor’s data, and Geo-fencing enables minimizing the spread through close interaction. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TI  - IoT Sensor Networks in Smart Buildings: A Performance Assessment Using Queuing Models
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 16
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Smart buildings in big cities are now equipped with an internet of things (IoT) infrastructure to constantly monitor different aspects of people’s daily lives via IoT devices and sensor networks. The malfunction and low quality of service (QoS) of such devices and networks can severely cause property damage and perhaps loss of life. Therefore, it is important to quantify different metrics related to the operational performance of the systems that make up such computational architecture even in advance of the building construction. Previous studies used analytical models considering different aspects to assess the performance of building monitoring systems. However, some critical points are still missing in the literature, such as (i) analyzing the capacity of computational resources adequate to the data demand, (ii) representing the number of cores per machine, and (iii) the clustering of sensors by location. This work proposes a queuing network based message exchange architecture to evaluate the performance of an intelligent building infrastructure associated with multiple processing layers: edge and fog. We consider an architecture of a building that has several floors and several rooms in each of them, where all rooms are equipped with sensors and an edge device. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the model was performed using the Design of Experiments (DoE) method to identify bottlenecks in the proposal. A series of case studies were conducted based on the DoE results. The DoE results allowed us to conclude, for example, that the number of cores can have more impact on the response time than the number of nodes. Simulations of scenarios defined through DoE allow observing the behavior of the following metrics: average response time, resource utilization rate, flow rate, discard rate, and the number of messages in the system. Three scenarios were explored: (i) scenario A (varying the number of cores), (ii) scenario B (varying the number of fog nodes), and (iii) scenario C (varying the nodes and cores simultaneously). Depending on the number of resources (nodes or cores), the system can become so overloaded that no new requests are supported. The queuing network based message exchange architecture and the analyses carried out can help system designers optimize their computational architectures before building construction.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 17
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In this paper, Computer Vision (CV) sensing technology based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is introduced to process topographic maps for predicting wireless signal propagation models, which are applied in the field of forestry security monitoring. In this way, the terrain-related radio propagation characteristic including diffraction loss and shadow fading correlation distance can be predicted or extracted accurately and efficiently. Two data sets are generated for the two prediction tasks, respectively, and are used to train the CNN. To enhance the efficiency for the CNN to predict diffraction losses, multiple output values for different locations on the map are obtained in parallel by the CNN to greatly boost the calculation speed. The proposed scheme achieved a good performance in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency. For the diffraction loss prediction task, 50% of the normalized prediction error was less than 0.518%, and 95% of the normalized prediction error was less than 8.238%. For the correlation distance extraction task, 50% of the normalized prediction error was less than 1.747%, and 95% of the normalized prediction error was less than 6.423%. Moreover, diffraction losses at 100 positions were predicted simultaneously in one run of CNN under the settings in this paper, for which the processing time of one map is about 6.28 ms, and the average processing time of one location point can be as low as 62.8 us. This paper shows that our proposed CV sensing technology is more efficient in processing geographic information in the target area. Combining a convolutional neural network to realize the close coupling of a prediction model and geographic information, it improves the efficiency and accuracy of prediction.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Nowadays, the internet of things (IoT) is used to generate data in several application domains. A logistic regression, which is a standard machine learning algorithm with a wide application range, is built on such data. Nevertheless, building a powerful and effective logistic regression model requires large amounts of data. Thus, collaboration between multiple IoT participants has often been the go-to approach. However, privacy concerns and poor data quality are two challenges that threaten the success of such a setting. Several studies have proposed different methods to address the privacy concern but to the best of our knowledge, little attention has been paid towards addressing the poor data quality problems in the multi-party logistic regression model. Thus, in this study, we propose a multi-party privacy-preserving logistic regression framework with poor quality data filtering for IoT data contributors to address both problems. Specifically, we propose a new metric gradient similarity in a distributed setting that we employ to filter out parameters from data contributors with poor quality data. To solve the privacy challenge, we employ homomorphic encryption. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations using real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework is privacy-preserving and robust against poor quality data.

AB  - The abundance of type and quantity of available data in the healthcare field has led many to utilize machine learning approaches to keep up with this influx of data. Data pertaining to COVID-19 is an area of recent interest. The widespread influence of the virus across the United States creates an obvious need to identify groups of individuals that are at an increased risk of mortality from the virus. We propose a so-called clustered random forest approach to predict COVID-19 patient mortality. We use this approach to examine the hidden heterogeneity of patient frailty by examining demographic information for COVID-19 patients. We find that our clustered random forest approach attains predictive performance comparable to other published methods. We also find that follow-up analysis with neural network modeling and k-means clustering provide insight into the type and magnitude of mortality risks associated with COVID-19.

Given the growing number of drones in low-altitude airspace, linking drones to form the Internet of drones (IoD) is a highly desirable trend to improve the safety as well as the quality of flight. However, there remain security, privacy, and communication issues related to IoD. In this paper, we discuss the key requirements of security, privacy, and communication and we present a taxonomy of IoD based on the most relevant considerations. Furthermore, we present the most commonly used commercial case studies and address the latest advancements and solutions proposed for the IoD environments. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future research directions of IoD.

VL  - 14

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This paper develops a novel hybrid feature learner and classifier for vibration-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) of industrial apartments. The trained model extracts high-level discriminative features from vibration signals and predicts equipment state. Against the limitations of traditional machine learning (ML)-based classifiers, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep neural network (DNN) are not only superior for real-time applications, but they also come with other benefits including ease-of-use, automated feature learning, and higher predictive accuracies. This study proposes a hybrid DNN and one-dimensional CNN diagnostics model (D-dCNN) which automatically extracts high-level discriminative features from vibration signals for FDI. Via Softmax averaging at the output layer, the model mitigates the limitations of the standalone classifiers. A diagnostic case study demonstrates the efficiency of the model with a significant accuracy of 92% (F1 score) and extensive comparative empirical validations.

AB  - Tourism is playing an important role in the economic development of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). To better develop tourism in this region, the spatial heterogeneity of influencing factors on tourism needs to be studied. Using the spatial distribution of tourism potential from social media data, this paper analyzes the influencing factors of tourism on the QTP from the perspective of spatial heterogeneity. We extract microblogs related to travel topics connected to the QTP in 2017 from Sina Weibo to capture tourism potential. Then, factors considered from six aspects (tourism resources, amenities, transportation, geography, population, and the economy) are selected, and a geographic detector (Geodetector) is employed to detect the explanatory power of these factors for tourism potential. The results indicate different influential tourism factors in Qinghai and Tibet. In Qinghai, the main factors are hotels, tourist attractions, and road network density, and the explanatory power of the factors mainly comes from eastern and western Qinghai. In Tibet, the main factors are road network density, regional GDP (Gross Domestic Product), and urban land. It is suggested that tourism in the central region of Qinghai can be improved by enhancing the publicity and utilization of tourism resources, and Tibet should enhance tourism resource utilization and improve tourism amenities and infrastructure.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc globally and still persists even after a year of its initial outbreak. Several reasons can be considered: people are in close contact with each other, i.e., at a short range (1 m), and the healthcare system is not sufficiently developed or does not have enough facilities to manage and fight the pandemic, even in developed countries such as the USA and the U.K. and countries in Europe. There is a great need in healthcare for remote monitoring of COVID-19 symptoms. In the past year, a number of IoT-based devices and wearables have been introduced by researchers, providing good results in terms of high accuracy in diagnosing patients in the prodromal phase and in monitoring the symptoms of patients, i.e., respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature, etc. In this systematic review, we analyzed these wearables and their need in the healthcare system. The research was conducted using three databases: IEEE Xplore®, Web of Science®, and PubMed Central®, between December 2019 and June 2021. This article was based on the PRISMA guidelines. Initially, 1100 articles were identified while searching the scientific literature regarding this topic. After screening, ultimately, 70 articles were fully evaluated and included in this review. These articles were divided into two categories. The first one belongs to the on-body sensors (wearables), their types and positions, and the use of AI technology with ehealth wearables in different scenarios from screening to contact tracing. In the second category, we discuss the problems and solutions with respect to utilizing these wearables globally. This systematic review provides an extensive overview of wearable systems for the remote management and automated assessment of COVID-19, taking into account the reliability and acceptability of the implemented technologies.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In the last few years, many examples of blood and medicine delivery drones have been demonstrated worldwide, which mainly rely on aeronautical experience that is not common in the medical world. Speaking about drone delivery, attention should focus on the most important thing: the transported lifesaving good. Traditional boxes that monitor temperature are not usually in real time, and are not suitable for drone transportation because they are heavy and bulky. This means that the biomedical characteristics of delivery are of primary importance. A Smart Capsule, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), is the first system ever proposed to provide a fully autonomous drone delivery service for perishable and high-value medical products, integrating real-time quality monitoring and control. It consists in a smart casing that is able to guide any autonomous aerial vehicle attached to it, specifically designed for transporting blood, organs, tissues, test samples and drugs, among others. The system monitors the conditions of the product (e.g., temperature, agitation and humidity) and adjusts them when needed by exploiting, for instance, vibrations to maintain the required agitation, ensuring that goods are ready to be used as soon as they are delivered. The Smart Capsule also leverages external temperature to reduce energy uptake from the drone, thus improving the drone’s battery life and flight range. The system replaces the need for specialized drivers and traditional road-bound transportation means, while guaranteeing compliance with all applicable safety regulations. A series of 16 experimental tests was performed to demonstrate the possibility of using the smart capsule to manage the flight and internal good delivery. Eighty-one missions were carried out for a total of 364 min of flight. The Smart Capsule greatly improves emergency response and efficiency of healthcare systems by reducing delivery times by up to 80% and costs by at least 28%. The Smart Capsule and its enabling technology based on AI for drone deliveries are discussed in this paper. The aim of this work is to show the possibility of managing drone delivery with an AI-based device.

AB  - Automatic acquisition of the canopy volume parameters of the Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju tree is of great significance to precision management of the orchard. This research combined the point cloud deep learning algorithm with the volume calculation algorithm to segment the canopy of the Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju trees. The 3D (Three-Dimensional) point cloud model of a Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju orchard was generated using UAV tilt photogrammetry images. The segmentation effects of three deep learning models, PointNet++, MinkowskiNet and FPConv, on Shatangju trees and the ground were compared. The following three volume algorithms: convex hull by slices, voxel-based method and 3D convex hull were applied to calculate the volume of Shatangju trees. Model accuracy was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results show that the overall accuracy of the MinkowskiNet model (94.57%) is higher than the other two models, which indicates the best segmentation effect. The 3D convex hull algorithm received the highest R2 (0.8215) and the lowest RMSE (0.3186 m3) for the canopy volume calculation, which best reflects the real volume of Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju trees. The proposed method is capable of rapid and automatic acquisition for the canopy volume of Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju trees.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks aim to deplete the network bandwidth and computing resources of targeted victims. Low-rate DDoS attacks exploit protocol features such as the transmission control protocol (TCP) three-way handshake mechanism for connection establishment and the TCP congestion-control induced backoffs to attack at a much lower rate and still effectively bring down the targeted network and computer systems. Most of the statistical and machine/deep learning-based detection methods proposed in the literature require keeping track of packets by flows and have high processing overheads for feature extraction. This paper presents a novel two-stage model that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest (RF) to detect the presence of attack flows in a group of flows. This model has a very low data processing overhead; it uses only two features and does not require keeping track of packets by flows, making it suitable for continuous monitoring of network traffic and on-the-fly detection. The paper also presents an LSTM Autoencoder to detect individual attack flows with high detection accuracy using only two features. Additionally, the paper presents an analysis of a support vector machine (SVM) model that detects attack flows in slices of network traffic collected for short durations. The low-rate attack dataset used in this study is made available to the research community through GitHub.

AB  - Sign language is designed to assist the deaf and hard of hearing community to convey messages and connect with society. Sign language recognition has been an important domain of research for a long time. Previously, sensor-based approaches have obtained higher accuracy than vision-based approaches. Due to the cost-effectiveness of vision-based approaches, researchers have been conducted here also despite the accuracy drop. The purpose of this research is to recognize American sign characters using hand images obtained from a web camera. In this work, the media-pipe hands algorithm was used for estimating hand joints from RGB images of hands obtained from a web camera and two types of features were generated from the estimated coordinates of the joints obtained for classification: one is the distances between the joint points and the other one is the angles between vectors and 3D axes. The classifiers utilized to classify the characters were support vector machine (SVM) and light gradient boosting machine (GBM). Three character datasets were used for recognition: the ASL Alphabet dataset, the Massey dataset, and the finger spelling A dataset. The results obtained were 99.39% for the Massey dataset, 87.60% for the ASL Alphabet dataset, and 98.45% for Finger Spelling A dataset. The proposed design for automatic American sign language recognition is cost-effective, computationally inexpensive, does not require any special sensors or devices, and has outperformed previous studies.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - With the progress of photogrammetry and computer vision technology, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction using aerial oblique images has been widely applied in urban modelling and smart city applications. However, state-of-the-art image-based automatic 3D reconstruction methods cannot effectively handle the unavoidable geometric deformation and incorrect texture mapping problems caused by moving cars in a city. This paper proposes a method to address this situation and prevent the influence of moving cars on 3D modelling by recognizing moving cars and combining the recognition results with a photogrammetric 3D modelling procedure. Through car detection using a deep learning method and multiview geometry constraints, we can analyse the state of a car’s movement and apply a proper preprocessing method to the geometrically model generation and texture mapping steps of 3D reconstruction pipelines. First, we apply the traditional Mask R-CNN object detection method to detect cars from oblique images. Then, a detected car and its corresponding image patch calculated by the geometry constraints in the other view images are used to identify the moving state of the car. Finally, the geometry and texture information corresponding to the moving car will be processed according to its moving state. Experiments on three different urban datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in recognizing and removing moving cars and can repair the geometric deformation and error texture mapping problems caused by moving cars. In addition, the methods proposed in this paper can be applied to eliminate other moving objects in 3D modelling applications.

AB  - We proposed an application and data variations-independent, generic social media Textual Variations Handler (TVH) to deal with a wide range of noise in textual data generated in various social media (SM) applications for enhanced text analysis. The aim is to build an effective hybrid normalization technique that ensures the use of useful information of the noisy text in its intended form instead of filtering them out to analyze SM text better. The proposed TVH performs context-aware text normalization based on intended meaning to avoid the wrong word substitution. We integrate the TVH with state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep-learning-based text analysis methods to enhance their performance for noisy SM text data. The proposed scheme shows promising improvement in the text analysis of informal SM text in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score in simulation.

AB  - With the advent of the information age, VR video streaming services have emerged in large numbers in scenarios such as immersive entertainment, smart education, and the Internet of Vehicles. People are also demanding an increasing number of virtual-reality (VR) services, and service providers must ensure a good user experience. Therefore, the quality of the VR user’s experience is receiving increasing attention from academia and industry. The review in this paper focuses on a comprehensive summary of the current state of quality-of-experience (QoE) technologies applied to VR video streaming. First, we review the main influencing factors of QoE and VR video streaming. Second, the user QoE for VR evaluation is discussed. Third, the modeling of QoE for VR video streaming, the QoE-oriented VR optimization problem, and enabling techniques of machine learning for VR video streaming improvement are summarized.

VL  - 2

SN  - 2624-6120

AB  - Most IoT networks implement one-way messages from the sensor nodes to the “application host server” via a gateway. Messages from any sensor node in the network are sent when its sensor is triggered or at regular intervals as dictated by the application, such as a Smart-City deployment of LoRaWAN traps/sensors for rat detection. However, these traps can, due to the nature of this application, be moved out of signal range from their original location, or obstructed by objects, resulting in under 69% of the messages reaching the gateway. Therefore, applications of this type would benefit from control messages from the “application host server” back to the sensor nodes for enhancing their performance/connectivity. This paper has implemented a cloud-based AI engine, as part of the “application host server”, that dynamically analyses all received messages from the sensor nodes and exchanges data/enhancement back and forth with them, when necessary. Hundreds of sensor nodes in various blocked/obstructed IoT network connectivity scenarios are used to test our DXN solution. We achieved 100% reporting success if access to any blocked sensor node was possible via a neighbouring node. DXN is based on DNN and Time Series models.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 9
IS  - 9
SN  - 2227-9040

AB  - Soil moisture control is crucial to assess irrigation efficiency in green areas and agriculture. In this paper, we propose the design and calibration of a sensor based on inductive coils and electromagnetic fields. The proposed prototypes should meet a series of requirements such as low power consumption, low relative error, and a high voltage difference between the minimum and maximum moisture. We tested different prototypes based on two copper coils divided into two different sets (P1–P15 and NP1–NP4). The prototypes have different characteristics: variations in the number and distribution of spires, existence or absence of casing, and copper wires with a diameter of 0.4 or 0.6 mm. In the first set of experiments carried out in commercial soil, the results showed that the best prototypes were P5, P8, and P9. These prototypes were used in different types of soils, and P8 was selected for the subsequent tests. We carried the second set of experiments using soil from an agricultural field. Based on the data gathered, mathematical models for the calibration of prototypes were obtained and verified. In some cases, two equations were used for different moisture intervals in a single prototype. According to the verification results, NP2 is the best prototype for monitoring the moisture in agricultural lands. It presented a difference in induced voltage of 1.8 V, at 500 kHz, between wet and dry soil with a maximum voltage of 5.12 V. The verification of the calibration determined that the calibration using two mathematical models offers better results, with an average absolute error of 2.1% of moisture.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - The evolution of IoT has come with the challenge of connecting not only a massive number of devices, but also providing an always wider variety of services. In the next few years, a big increase in the number of connected devices is expected, together with an important increase in the amount of traffic generated. Never before have wireless communications permeated so deeply in all industries and economic sectors. Therefore, it is crucial to correctly forecast the spectrum needs, which bands should be used for which services, and the economic potential of its utilization. This paper proposes a methodology for spectrum forecasting consisting of two phases: a market study and a spectrum forecasting model. The market study determines the main drivers of the IoT industry for any country: services, technologies, frequency bands, and the number of devices that will require IoT connectivity. The forecasting model takes the market study as the input and calculates the spectrum demand in 5 steps: Defining scenarios for spectrum contention, calculating the offered traffic load, calculating a capacity for some QoS requirements, finding the spectrum required, and adjusting according to key spectral efficiency determinants. This methodology is applied for Colombia’s IoT spectrum forecast. We provide a complete step-by-step implementation in fourteen independent spectrum contention scenarios, calculating offered traffic, required capacity, and spectrum for cellular licensed bands and non-cellular unlicensed bands in a 10-year period. Detailed results are presented specifying coverage area requirements per economic sector, frequency band, and service. The need for higher teledensity and higher spectral efficiency turns out to be a determining factor for spectrum savings.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 18
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Edge intelligence (EI) has received a lot of interest because it can reduce latency, increase efficiency, and preserve privacy. More significantly, as the Internet of Things (IoT) has proliferated, billions of portable and embedded devices have been interconnected, producing zillions of gigabytes on edge networks. Thus, there is an immediate need to push AI (artificial intelligence) breakthroughs within edge networks to achieve the full promise of edge data analytics. EI solutions have supported digital technology workloads and applications from the infrastructure level to edge networks; however, there are still many challenges with the heterogeneity of computational capabilities and the spread of information sources. We propose a novel event-driven deep-learning framework, called EDL-EI (event-driven deep learning for edge intelligence), via the design of a novel event model by defining events using correlation analysis with multiple sensors in real-world settings and incorporating multi-sensor fusion techniques, a transformation method for sensor streams into images, and lightweight 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) models. To demonstrate the feasibility of the EDL-EI framework, we presented an IoT-based prototype system that we developed with multiple sensors and edge devices. To verify the proposed framework, we have a case study of air-quality scenarios based on the benchmark data provided by the USA Environmental Protection Agency for the most polluted cities in South Korea and China. We have obtained outstanding predictive accuracy (97.65% and 97.19%) from two deep-learning models on the cities’ air-quality patterns. Furthermore, the air-quality changes from 2019 to 2020 have been analyzed to check the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.

VL  - 9

SN  - 2075-1702

AB  - Digital twins (DTs) is a promising technology in the revolution of the industry and essential for Industry 4.0. DTs play a vital role in improving distributed manufacturing, providing up-to-date operational data representation of physical assets, supporting decision-making, and avoiding the potential risks in distributed manufacturing systems. Furthermore, DTs need to collaborate within distributed manufacturing systems to predict the risks and reach consensus-based decision-making. However, DTs collaboration suffers from single failure due to attack and connection in a centralized manner, data interoperability, authentication, and scalability. To overcome the above challenges, we have discussed the major high-level requirements for the DTs collaboration. Then, we have proposed a conceptual framework to fulfill the DTs collaboration requirements by using the combination of blockchain, predictive analysis techniques, and DTs technologies. The proposed framework aims to empower more intelligence DTs based on blockchain technology. In particular, we propose a concrete ledger-based collaborative DTs framework that focuses on real-time operational data analytics and distributed consensus algorithms. Furthermore, we describe how the conceptual framework can be applied using smart transportation system use cases, i.e., smart logistics and railway predictive maintenance. Finally, we highlighted the future direction to guide interested researchers in this interesting area.

AB  - A literature review of the important trends in predictive crime modeling and the existing measures of accuracy was undertaken. It highlighted the need for a robust, comprehensive and independent evaluation and the need to include complementary measures for a more complete assessment. We develop a new measure called the penalized predictive accuracy index (PPAI), propose the use of the expected utility function to combine multiple measures and the use of the average logarithmic score, which measures accuracy differently than existing measures. The measures are illustrated using hypothetical examples. We illustrate how PPAI could identify the best model for a given problem, as well as how the expected utility measure can be used to combine different measures in a way that is the most appropriate for the problem at hand. It is important to develop measures that empower the practitioner with the ability to input the choices and preferences that are most appropriate for the problem at hand and to combine multiple measures. The measures proposed here go some way towards providing this ability. Further development along these lines is needed.

AB  - The close development of the economic relations between China and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) since 2012 has triggered the European Union’s criticism of China’s foreign policy towards Eastern European countries. The European Union believes that China’s investment growth has led to a governance crisis in CEE countries. Based on the global governance indicators of the World Bank and the outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) data of the Ministry of Commerce of China, this paper conducts a test using the panel data model and the regression discontinuity method. An imbalanced panel dataset is adopted, covering 16 CEE countries from 2000 to 2018. The empirical research results indicate that, representing a small proportion of the investment inflows to CEE countries, China is not yet able to exert a domination effect on the region, and China’s economic power is far less than the European Union’s regulatory influence. Furthermore, China’s share of the OFDI in CEE has a U-shaped effect on the regulatory quality of host countries, and the two have a mutually causal relationship. Specifically, the impact on the host country’s regulatory quality is first manifested in the Shanghai effect, and when China’s share reaches a certain level, it is manifested in the California effect. The U-shaped effect is associated with the strategic factors of CEE countries and China’s positive contribution to good global governance.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The collapse of overhead power line guyed towers is one of the leading causes of power grid failures, subjecting electricity companies to pay considerable, high-value fines. In this way, the current work proposes a novel and complete framework for the remote monitoring of mechanical stresses in guyed towers. The framework method comprises a mesh network for data forwarding and neural networks to improve the performance of Low-Power and Lossy Networks. The method also considers the use of multiple sensors in the sensor fusion technique. As a result, the risk of collapse of guyed cable towers reduces, due to the remote monitoring and preventive actions promoted by the framework. Furthermore, the proposed method uses multiple input variable fusions, such as accelerometers and tension sensors, to estimate the tower’s displacement. These estimations help address the structural health of the tower against failures (i.e., loosening of the stay cables, displacement, and vibrations) that can cause catastrophic events, such as tower collapse or even cable rupture.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 18
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Monitoring driving behaviour is important in controlling driving risk, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. Recent advances in machine learning, which include several variants of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks, could be valuable for the development of objective and efficient computational tools in this direction. The main idea in this work is to complement data-driven classification of driving behaviour with rules derived from domain knowledge. In this light, we present a hybrid representation approach, which employs NN-based time-series encoding and rule-guided event detection. Histograms derived from the output of these two components are concatenated, normalized, and used to train a standard support vector machine (SVM). For the NN-based component, CNN-based, LSTM-based, and GRU-based variants are investigated. The CNN-based variant uses image-like representations of sensor measurements, whereas the RNN-based variants (LSTM and GRU) directly process sensor measurements in the form of time-series. Experimental evaluation on three datasets leads to the conclusion that the proposed approach outperforms a state-of-the-art camera-based approaches in distinguishing between normal and aggressive driving behaviour without using data derived from a camera. Moreover, it is demonstrated that both NN-guided time-series encoding and rule-guided event detection contribute to overall classification accuracy.

AB  - The fourth industrial era, known as ‘Industry 4.0’ (I4.0), aided and abetted by the digital revolution, has attracted increasing attention among scholars and practitioners in the last decade. The adoption of I4.0 principles in Disaster Risk Management (DRM) research and associated industry practices is particularly notable, although its origins, impacts and potential are not well understood. In response to this knowledge gap, this paper conducts a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis of the application and contribution of I4.0 in DRM. The systematic literature review identified 144 relevant articles and then employed descriptive and content analysis of a focused set of 70 articles published between 2011 and 2021. The results of this review trace the growing trend for adoption of I4.0 tools and techniques in disaster management, and in parallel their influence in resilient infrastructure and digital construction fields. The results are used to identify six dominant clusters of research activity: big data analytics, Internet of Things, prefabrication and modularization, robotics and cyber-physical systems. The research in each cluster is then mapped to the priorities of the Sendai framework for DRR, highlighting the ways it can support this international agenda. Finally, this paper identifies gaps within the literature and discusses possible future research directions for the combination of I4.0 and DRM.

AB  - The expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) in public administration is generating numerous opportunities for governments. Current Spanish regulations have established electronic administration and support the expansion and implementation of this new technology, but they may not be adapted to the legal needs caused by AI. Consequently, this research aims to identify the risks associated with AI uses in Spanish public administration and if the legal mechanisms can solve them. We answer these questions by employing a qualitative research approach, conducting semi-structured interviews with several experts in the matter. Despite the benefits that this technology may involve, throughout this research we can confirm that the use of artificial intelligence can generate several problems such as opacity, legal uncertainty, biases, or breaches of personal data protection. The mechanisms already provided by Spanish law are not enough to avoid these risks as they have not been designed to face the use of artificial intelligence in public administration. In addition, a homogeneous legal definition of AI needs to be established.

AB  - With unlabeled music data widely available, it is necessary to build an unsupervised latent music representation extractor to improve the performance of classification models. This paper proposes an unsupervised latent music representation learning method based on a deep 3D convolutional denoising autoencoder (3D-DCDAE) for music genre classification, which aims to learn common representations from a large amount of unlabeled data to improve the performance of music genre classification. Specifically, unlabeled MIDI files are applied to 3D-DCDAE to extract latent representations by denoising and reconstructing input data. Next, a decoder is utilized to assist the 3D-DCDAE in training. After 3D-DCDAE training, the decoder is replaced by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for music genre classification. Through the unsupervised latent representations learning method, unlabeled data can be applied to classification tasks so that the problem of limiting classification performance due to insufficient labeled data can be solved. In addition, the unsupervised 3D-DCDAE can consider the musicological structure to expand the understanding of the music field and improve performance in music genre classification. In the experiments, which utilized the Lakh MIDI dataset, a large amount of unlabeled data was utilized to train the 3D-DCDAE, obtaining a denoising and reconstruction accuracy of approximately 98%. A small amount of labeled data was utilized for training a classification model consisting of the trained 3D-DCDAE and the MLP classifier, which achieved a classification accuracy of approximately 88%. The experimental results show that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms other methods for music genre classification with only a small amount of labeled data.
