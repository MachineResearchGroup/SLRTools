TI  - SSD vs. YOLO for Detection of Outdoor Urban Advertising Panels under Multiple Variabilities

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This work compares Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) deep neural networks for the outdoor advertisement panel detection problem by handling multiple and combined variabilities in the scenes. Publicity panel detection in images offers important advantages both in the real world as well as in the virtual one. For example, applications like Google Street View can be used for Internet publicity and when detecting these ads panels in images, it could be possible to replace the publicity appearing inside the panels by another from a funding company. In our experiments, both SSD and YOLO detectors have produced acceptable results under variable sizes of panels, illumination conditions, viewing perspectives, partial occlusion of panels, complex background and multiple panels in scenes. Due to the difficulty of finding annotated images for the considered problem, we created our own dataset for conducting the experiments. The major strength of the SSD model was the almost elimination of False Positive (FP) cases, situation that is preferable when the publicity contained inside the panel is analyzed after detecting them. On the other side, YOLO produced better panel localization results detecting a higher number of True Positive (TP) panels with a higher accuracy. Finally, a comparison of the two analyzed object detection models with different types of semantic segmentation networks and using the same evaluation metrics is also included.

TI  - NOVA Mobility Assistive System: Developed and Remotely Controlled with IOPT-Tools
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 8
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In this paper, a Mobility Assistive System (NOVA-MAS) and a model-driven development approach are proposed to support the acquisition and analysis of data, infrastructures control, and dissemination of information along public roads. A literature review showed that the work related to mobility assistance of pedestrians in wheelchairs has a gap in ensuring their safety on road. The problem is that pedestrians in wheelchairs and scooters often do not enjoy adequate and safe lanes for their circulation on public roads, having to travel sometimes side by side with vehicles and cars moving at high speed. With NOVA-MAS, city infrastructures can obtain information regarding the environment and provide it to their users/vehicles, increasing road safety in an inclusive way, contributing to the decrease of the accidents of pedestrians in wheelchairs. NOVA-MAS not only supports information dissemination, but also data acquisition from sensors and infrastructures control, such as traffic light signs. For that, it proposed a development approach that supports the acquisition of data from the environment and its control while using a tool framework, named IOPT-Tools (Input-Output Place-Transition Tools). IOPT-Tools support controllers&rsquo; specification, validation, and implementation, with remote operation capabilities. The infrastructures&rsquo; controllers are specified through IOPT Petri net models, which are then simulated using computational tools and verified using state-space-based model-checking tools. In addition, an automatic code generator tool generates the C code, which supports the controllers&rsquo; implementation, avoiding manual codification errors. A set of prototypes were developed and tested to validate and conclude on the feasibility of the proposals.

TI  - POI Mining for Land Use Classification: A Case Study

PY  - 2020

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The modern planning and management of urban spaces is an essential topic for smart cities and depends on up-to-date and reliable information on land use and the functional roles of the places that integrate urban areas. In the last few years, driven by the increased availability of geo-referenced data from social media, embedded sensors, and remote sensing images, various techniques have become popular for land use analysis. In this paper, we first highlight and discuss the different data types and methods usually adopted in this context, as well as their purposes. Then, based on a systematic state-of-the-art study, we focused on exploring the potential of points of interest (POIs) for land use classification, as one of the most common categories of crowdsourced data. We developed an application to automatically collect POIs for the study area, creating a dataset that was used to generate a large number of features. We used a ranking technique to select, among them, the most suitable features for classifying land use. As ground truth data, we used CORINE Land Cover (CLC), which is a solid and reliable dataset available for the whole European territory. It was used an artificial neural network (ANN) in different scenarios and our results reveal values of more than 90% for the accuracy and F-score in one experiment performed. Our analysis suggests that POI data have promising potential to characterize geographic spaces. The work described here aims to provide an alternative to the current methodologies for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, which are usually time-consuming and depend on expensive data types.

AB  - Traffic monitoring from closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras on embedded systems is the subject of the performed experiments. Solving this problem encounters difficulties related to the hardware limitations, and possible camera placement in various positions which affects the system performance. To satisfy the hardware requirements, vehicle detection is performed using a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), named SqueezeDet, while, for tracking, the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm is applied, allowing for real-time processing on an NVIDIA Jetson Tx2. To allow for adaptation of the system to the deployment environment, a procedure was implemented leading to generating labels in an unsupervised manner with the help of background modelling and the tracking algorithm. The acquired labels are further used for fine-tuning the model, resulting in a meaningful increase in the traffic estimation accuracy, and moreover, adding only minimal human effort to the process allows for further accuracy improvement. The proposed methods, and the results of experiments organised under real-world test conditions are presented in the paper.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - One of the models in the literature for modeling the behavior of the brain is the Bayesian attractor model, which is a kind of machine-learning algorithm. According to this model, the brain assigns stochastic variables to possible decisions (attractors) and chooses one of them when enough evidence is collected from sensory systems to achieve a confidence level high enough to make a decision. In this paper, we introduce a software defined networking (SDN) application based on a brain-inspired Bayesian attractor model for identification of the current traffic pattern for the supervision and automation of Internet of things (IoT) networks that exhibit a limited number of traffic patterns. In a real SDN testbed, we demonstrate that our SDN application can identify the traffic patterns using a limited set of fluctuating network statistics of edge link utilization. Moreover, we show that our application can improve core link utilization and the power efficiency of IoT networks by immediately applying a pre-calculated network configuration optimized by traffic engineering with network slicing for the identified pattern.

AB  - Smart building is the result of the penetration of information technology and control technology into traditional buildings, and is the future development direction of buildings. User-centric building smart design can achieve a sustainable life, and smart technology integration based on smart design can support sustainable development and improve user satisfaction, happiness, and overall quality of life. In intelligent design, researchers focus on the &ldquo;people-oriented&rdquo; approach, designed to bring users the ultimate interactive experience. Based on the interactive experience principle of smart design in the smart building system, this article classifies and summarizes intelligent design from the &ldquo;five senses&rdquo; interaction, including visual interaction, voice interaction, tactile interaction, cognitive interaction, and emotional interaction. We analyze the application of smart design in architecture and discuss how to embody the principles of user-centered interactive experience design in the process of smart design. This article provides a comprehensive and systematic literature review, clarifies the importance of the &ldquo;people-oriented&rdquo; approach in the smart design of buildings, and summarizes how to improve the sustainability of intelligent buildings from the perspective of a &ldquo;people-oriented&rdquo; approach. This paper proposes future research suggestions and directions and promotes the sustainable development of the smart building.

TI  - Design of an IoT-Based Fuzzy Approximation Prediction Model for Early Fire Detection to Aid Public Safety and Control in the Local Urban Markets
T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Fire monitoring in local urban markets within East Africa (EA) has been seriously neglected for a long time. This has culminated in a severe destruction of life and property worth millions. These rampant fires are attributed to electrical short circuits, fuel spillages, etc. Previous research proposes single smoke detectors. However, they are prone to false alarm rates and are inefficient. Also, satellite systems are expensive for developing countries. This paper presents a fuzzy model for early fire detection and control as symmetry&rsquo;s core contribution to fuzzy systems design and application in computer and engineering sciences. We utilize a fuzzy logic technique to simulate the performance of the model using MATLAB, using six parameters: temperature, humidity, flame, CO, CO2 and O2 vis-&agrave;-vis the Estimated Fire Intensity Prediction (EFIP). Results show that, using fuzzy logic, a significant improvement in fire detection is observed with an overall accuracy rate of 95.83%. The paper further proposes an IoT-based fuzzy prediction model for early fire detection with a goal of minimizing extensive damage and promote intermediate fire suppression and control through true fire incidences. This solution provides for future public safety monitoring, and control of fire-related situations among the market community. Hence, fire safety monitoring is significant in providing future fire safety planning, control and management by putting in place appropriate fire safety laws, policies, bills and related fire safety practices or guidelines to be applied in public buildings, market centers and other public places.

TI  - A Security Concept Based on Scaler Distribution of a Novel Intrusion Detection Device for Wireless Sensor Networks in a Smart Environment
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Following the significant improvement of technology in terms of data collection and treatment during the last decades, the notion of a smart environment has widely taken an important pedestal in the science industry. Built in order to better manage assets, smart environments provide a livable environment for users or citizens through the deployment of sensors responsible for data collection. Much research has been done to provide security to the involved data, which are extremely sensitive. However, due to the small size and the memory constraint of the sensors, many of these works are difficult to implement. In this paper, a different concept for wireless sensor security in smart environments is presented. The proposed security system, which is based on the scaler distribution of a novel electronic device, the intrusion detection system (IDS), reduces the computational functions of the sensors and therefore maximizes their efficiency. The IDS also introduces the concept of the feedback signal and &ldquo;trust table&rdquo; used to trigger the detection and isolation mechanism in case of attacks. Generally, it ensures the whole network security through cooperation with other IDSs and, therefore, eliminates the problem of security holes that may occur while adopting such a security technique.

TI  - WASN-Based Day–Night Characterization of Urban Anomalous Noise Events in Narrow and Wide Streets
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 17
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In addition to air pollution, environmental noise has become one of the major hazards for citizens, being Road Traffic Noise (RTN) as its main source in urban areas. Recently, low-cost Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASNs) have become an alternative to traditional strategic noise mapping in cities. In order to monitor RTN solely, WASN-based approaches should automatize the off-line removal of those events unrelated to regular road traffic (e.g., sirens, airplanes, trams, etc.). Within the LIFE DYNAMAP project, 15 urban Anomalous Noise Events (ANEs) were described through an expert-based recording campaign. However, that work only focused on the overall analysis of the events gathered during non-sequential diurnal periods. As a step forward to characterize the temporal and local particularities of urban ANEs in real acoustic environments, this work analyses their distribution between day (06:00&ndash;22:00) and night (22:00&ndash;06:00) in narrow (1 lane) and wide (more than 1 lane) streets. The study is developed on a manually-labelled 151-h acoustic database obtained from the 24-nodes WASN deployed across DYNAMAP&rsquo;s Milan pilot area during a weekday and a weekend day. Results confirm the unbalanced nature of the problem (RTN represents 83.5% of the data), while identifying 26 ANE subcategories mainly derived from pedestrians, animals, transports and industry. Their presence depends more significantly on the time period than on the street type, as most events have been observed in the day-time during the weekday, despite being especially present in narrow streets. Moreover, although ANEs show quite similar median durations regardless of time and location in general terms, they usually present higher median signal-to-noise ratios at night, mainly on the weekend, which becomes especially relevant for the WASN-based computation of equivalent RTN levels.

TI  - Identification of Roof Surfaces from LiDAR Cloud Points by GIS Tools: A Case Study of Lučenec, Slovakia
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The identification of roof surfaces is characterized by a sequence of several processing steps. The boundary detection of different types of roof is realized from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) cloud points and can confirm the real boundary of the roof. In the process of processing LiDAR data, shortcomings have been found regarding the inappropriate classification of points (class 6 &ldquo;buildings&rdquo;) concerning the roofs (the points of the building facade were marked as outliers and reclassified). In cases of insufficient point density, there is a problem with not being able to capture either the roof boundary or small roof objects, along with the possible occurrence of gaps inside the roof areas. This study proposes a processing procedure in a geographic information system (GIS) environment that advocates the identification of roof surfaces based on the LiDAR point cloud. We created the contours of a roof surface boundary with a simplified regular shape. From 824 roofs in the studied area, six different types of roof were selected, which this study presents in detail. The expected result of the study is the generation of segments inside the roof boundary. The study also includes the visualization of the outcomes of the spatial analyses of the identified roof surfaces, which forms the basis for determining the potential of solar systems with respect to green roofs for the development of smart city buildings.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - This last decade, the amount of data exchanged on the Internet increased by over a staggering factor of 100, and is expected to exceed well over the 500 exabytes by 2020. This phenomenon is mainly due to the evolution of high-speed broadband Internet and, more specifically, the popularization and wide spread use of smartphones and associated accessible data plans. Although 4G with its long-term evolution (LTE) technology is seen as a mature technology, there is continual improvement to its radio technology and architecture such as in the scope of the LTE Advanced standard, a major enhancement of LTE. However, for the long run, the next generation of telecommunication (5G) is considered and is gaining considerable momentum from both industry and researchers. In addition, with the deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, smart cities, vehicular networks, e-health systems, and Industry 4.0, a new plethora of 5G services has emerged with very diverging and technologically challenging design requirements. These include high mobile data volume per area, high number of devices connected per area, high data rates, longer battery life for low-power devices, and reduced end-to-end latency. Several technologies are being developed to meet these new requirements, and each of these technologies brings its own design issues and challenges. In this context, deep learning models could be seen as one of the main tools that can be used to process monitoring data and automate decisions. As these models are able to extract relevant features from raw data (images, texts, and other types of unstructured data), the integration between 5G and DL looks promising and one that requires exploring. As main contribution, this paper presents a systematic review about how DL is being applied to solve some 5G issues. Differently from the current literature, we examine data from the last decade and the works that address diverse 5G specific problems, such as physical medium state estimation, network traffic prediction, user device location prediction, self network management, among others. We also discuss the main research challenges when using deep learning models in 5G scenarios and identify several issues that deserve further consideration.

These IP-based surveillance systems now protect industrial facilities, railways, gas stations, and even one’s own home. Unfortunately, like other IoT systems, there are inherent security risks which can lead to significant violations of a user’s privacy. In this review, we explore the attack surface of modern surveillance systems and enumerate the various ways they can be compromised with real examples. We also identify the threat agents, their attack goals, attack vectors, and the resulting consequences of successful attacks. Finally, we present current countermeasures and best practices and discuss the threat horizon. The purpose of this review is to provide researchers and engineers with a better understanding of a modern surveillance systems’ security, to harden existing systems and develop improved security solutions.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - At present, the state-of-the-art approaches of Visual Question Answering (VQA) mainly use the co-attention model to relate each visual object with text objects, which can achieve the coarse interactions between multimodalities. However, they ignore the dense self-attention within question modality. In order to solve this problem and improve the accuracy of VQA tasks, in the present paper, an effective Dense Co-Attention Networks (DCAN) is proposed. First, to better capture the relationship between words that are relatively far apart and make the extracted semantics more robust, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network is introduced to encode questions and answers; second, to realize the fine-grained interactions between the question words and image regions, a dense multimodal co-attention model is proposed. The model&rsquo;s basic components include the self-attention unit and the guided-attention unit, which are cascaded in depth to form a hierarchical structure. The experimental results on the VQA-v2 dataset show that DCAN has obvious performance advantages, which makes VQA applicable to a wider range of AI scenarios.

In addition to a compliance rate in excess of 92% for geometry and topology, the generated model allows the handling of contextual information, such as metadata and refined levels of details (LoD), in a built-in manner. By breaking down the building-generation process, it creates consistent building objects from the unique source of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds.

AB  - With an extensive growth in user demand for high throughput, large capacity, and low latency, the ongoing deployment of Fifth-Generation (5G) systems is continuously exposing the inherent limitations of the system, as compared with its original premises. Such limitations are encouraging researchers worldwide to focus on next-generation 6G wireless systems, which are expected to address the constraints. To meet the above demands, future radio network architecture should be effectively designed to utilize its maximum radio spectrum capacity. It must simultaneously utilize various new techniques and technologies, such as Carrier Aggregation (CA), Cognitive Radio (CR), and small cell-based Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet), high-spectrum access (mmWave), and Massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (M-MIMO), to achieve the desired results. However, the concurrent operations of these techniques in current 5G cellular networks create several spectrum management issues; thus, a comprehensive overview of these emerging technologies is presented in detail in this study. Then, the problems involved in the concurrent operations of various technologies for the spectrum management of the current 5G network are highlighted. The study aims to provide a detailed review of cooperative communication among all the techniques and potential problems associated with the spectrum management that has been addressed with the possible solutions proposed by the latest researches. Future research challenges are also discussed to highlight the necessary steps that can help achieve the desired objectives for designing 6G wireless networks.

AB  - Many low-cost sensors (LCSs) are distributed for air monitoring without any rigorous calibrations. This work applies machine learning with PM2.5 from Taiwan monitoring stations to conduct in-field corrections on a network of 39 PM2.5 LCSs from July 2017 to December 2018. Three candidate models were evaluated: Multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). The model-corrected PM2.5 levels were compared with those of GRIMM-calibrated PM2.5. RFR was superior to MLR and SVR in its correction accuracy and computing efficiency. Compared to SVR, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of RFR were 35% and 85% lower for the training and validation sets, respectively, and the computational speed was 35 times faster. An RFR with 300 decision trees was chosen as the optimal setting considering both the correction performance and the modeling time. An RFR with a nighttime pattern was established as the optimal correction model, and the RMSEs were 5.9 &plusmn; 2.0 &mu;g/m3, reduced from 18.4 &plusmn; 6.5 &mu;g/m3 before correction. This is the first work to correct LCSs at locations without monitoring stations, validated using laboratory-calibrated data. Similar models could be established in other countries to greatly enhance the usefulness of their PM2.5 sensor networks.

In the last years, the integration of this kind of images has shown clear advantages for the complete and detailed 3D representation of large and complex scenarios. Nevertheless, their photogrammetric integration often raises several issues in the image orientation and dense 3D reconstruction processes. Noisy and erroneous 3D reconstructions are the typical result of inaccurate orientation results. In this work, we propose an automatic filtering procedure which works at the sparse point cloud level and takes advantage of photogrammetric quality features. The filtering step removes low-quality 3D tie points before refining the image orientation in a new adjustment and generating the final dense point cloud. Our method generalizes to many datasets, as it employs statistical analyses of quality feature distributions to identify suitable filtering thresholds. Reported results show the effectiveness and reliability of the method verified using both internal and external quality checks, as well as visual qualitative comparisons. We made the filtering tool publicly available on GitHub.

AB  - Real time crowd analysis represents an active area of research within the computer vision community in general and scene analysis in particular. Over the last 10 years, various methods for crowd management in real time scenario have received immense attention due to large scale applications in people counting, public events management, disaster management, safety monitoring an so on. Although many sophisticated algorithms have been developed to address the task; crowd management in real time conditions is still a challenging problem being completely solved, particularly in wild and unconstrained conditions. In the proposed paper, we present a detailed review of crowd analysis and management, focusing on state-of-the-art methods for both controlled and unconstrained conditions. The paper illustrates both the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art methods. The methods presented comprise the seminal research works on crowd management, and monitoring and then culminating state-of-the-art methods of the newly introduced deep learning methods. Comparison of the previous methods is presented, with a detailed discussion of the direction for future research work. We believe this review article will contribute to various application domains and will also augment the knowledge of the crowd analysis within the research community.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Monitoring what application or type of applications running on a computer or a cluster without violating the privacy of the users can be challenging, especially when we may not have operator access to these devices, or specialized software. Smart grids and Internet of things (IoT) devices can provide power consumption data of connected individual devices or groups. This research will attempt to provide insides on what applications are running based on the power consumption of the machines and clusters. It is therefore assumed that there is a correlation between electric power and what software application is running. Additionally, it is believed that it is possible to create power consumption profiles for various software applications and even normal and abnormal behavior (e.g., a virus). In order to achieve this, an experiment was organized for the purpose of collecting 48 h of continuous real power consumption data from two PCs that were part of a university computer lab. That included collecting data with a one-second sample period, during class as well as idle time from each machine and their cluster. During the second half of the recording period, one of the machines was infected with a custom-made virus, allowing comparison between power consumption data before and after infection. The data were analyzed using different approaches: descriptive analysis, F-Test of two samples of variance, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The results show that it is possible to detect what type of application is running and if an individual machine or its cluster are infected. Additionally, we can conclude if the lab is used or not, making this research an ideal management tool for administrators.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, increasing image data comes from various sensors, and object detection plays a vital role in image understanding. For object detection in complex scenes, more detailed information in the image should be obtained to improve the accuracy of detection task. In this paper, we propose an object detection algorithm by jointing semantic segmentation (SSOD) for images. First, we construct a feature extraction network that integrates the hourglass structure network with the attention mechanism layer to extract and fuse multi-scale features to generate high-level features with rich semantic information. Second, the semantic segmentation task is used as an auxiliary task to allow the algorithm to perform multi-task learning. Finally, multi-scale features are used to predict the location and category of the object. The experimental results show that our algorithm substantially enhances object detection performance and consistently outperforms other three comparison algorithms, and the detection speed can reach real-time, which can be used for real-time detection.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - With the increasing popularization and competition of electric vehicles (EVs), EV users often have anxiety on their trip to find better charging stations with less travel distance. An intelligent charging guidance strategy and two algorithms were proposed to alleviate this problem. First, based on the next destination of EV users&rsquo; trip, the strategy established a dynamic-area model to match charging stations with users&rsquo; travel demand intelligently. In the dynamic area, the Dijkstra algorithm is used to find the charging station with the shortest trip. Then, the area extension algorithm and the charging station attribution algorithm were developed to improve the robustness of the dynamic area. The two algorithms can automatically adjust the area size according to the number of charging stations in the dynamic area to reduce the number of nodes traversed by the Dijkstra algorithm. Finally, simulation examples were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms. The results showed that the proposed intelligent charging guidance strategy can meet the travel demand of users. It is a promising technique in smart cities to find better travel trips with less travel distance and less computed time.

AB  - The smart devices in Internet of Things (IoT) need more effective data storage opportunities, as well as support for Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods such as neural networks (NNs). This study presents a design of new associative memory in the form of impulsive Hopfield network based on leaky integrated-and-fire (LIF) RC oscillators with frequency control and hybrid analog&ndash;digital coding. Two variants of the network schemes have been developed, where spiking frequencies of oscillators are controlled either by supply currents or by variable resistances. The principle of operation of impulsive networks based on these schemes is presented and the recognition dynamics using simple two-dimensional images in gray gradation as an example is analyzed. A fast digital recognition method is proposed that uses the thresholds of zero crossing of output voltages of neurons. The time scale of this method is compared with the execution time of some network algorithms on IoT devices for moderate data amounts. The proposed Hopfield algorithm uses rate coding to expand the capabilities of neuromorphic engineering, including the design of new hardware circuits of IoT.

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) systems generate a large volume of data all the time. How to choose and transfer which data are essential for decision-making is a challenge. This is especially important for low-cost and low-power designs, for example Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWan)-based IoT systems, where data volume and frequency are constrained by the protocols. This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach using Laplacian scores to discover which types of sensors can be reduced, without compromising the decision-making. Here, a type of sensor is a feature. An IoT system is designed and implemented for a plant-monitoring scenario. We have collected data and carried out the Laplacian scores. The analytical results help choose the most important feature. A comparative study has shown that using fewer types of sensors, the accuracy of decision-making remains at a satisfactory level.

AB  - The unprompted patient&rsquo;s and inimitable physician&rsquo;s experience shared on online health communities (OHCs) contain a wealth of unexploited knowledge. Med Help and eHealth are some of the online health communities offering new insights and solutions to all health issues. Diabetes mellitus (DM), thyroid disorders and tuberculosis (TB) are chronic diseases increasing rapidly every year. As part of the project described in this article comments related to the diseases from Med Help were collected. The comments contain the patient and doctor discussions in an unstructured format. The sematic vision of the internet of things (IoT) plays a vital role in organizing the collected data. We pre-processed the data using standard natural language processing techniques and extracted the essential features of the words using the chi-squared test. After preprocessing the documents, we clustered them using the K-means++ algorithm, which is a popular centroid-based unsupervised iterative machine learning algorithm. A generative probabilistic model (LDA) was used to identify the essential topic in each cluster. This type of framework will empower the patients and doctors to identify the similarity and dissimilarity about the various diseases and important keywords among the diseases in the form of symptoms, medical tests and habits.

AB  - In modern surveillance systems, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been actively discussed in order to extend target monitoring areas, even for an extreme circumstances. This paper proposes an energy-efficient UAV-based surveillance system that operates from two different sequential methods. First, the proposed algorithm pursues energy-efficient operations by deactivating selected surveillance cameras on the UAVs located in overlapping areas. For this objective, a message-passing based algorithm is used because the overlapping situations can be formulated using a max-weight independent set. Next, the unscheduled UAVs based on the message-passing fly to the charging towers to be charged. This algorithm computes the optimal matching between the UAVs and charging towers and the amount of energy allocation for the scheduled UAV-tower pairs. This joint optimization is initially formulated as non-convex, and it is then reformulated to be convex, which can guarantee optimal solutions. The proposed framework achieves the desired performance, as presented in the performance evaluation.

TI  - Super-Resolution of Sentinel-2 Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Real Ground Truth Data
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 18
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Earth observation data is becoming more accessible and affordable thanks to the Copernicus programme and its Sentinel missions. Every location worldwide can be freely monitored approximately every 5 days using the multi-spectral images provided by Sentinel-2. The spatial resolution of these images for RGBN (RGB + Near-infrared) bands is 10 m, which is more than enough for many tasks but falls short for many others. For this reason, if their spatial resolution could be enhanced without additional costs, any posterior analyses based on these images would be benefited. Previous works have mainly focused on increasing the resolution of lower resolution bands of Sentinel-2 (20 m and 60 m) to 10 m resolution. In these cases, super-resolution is supported by bands captured at finer resolutions (RGBN at 10 m). On the contrary, this paper focuses on the problem of increasing the spatial resolution of 10 m bands to either 5 m or 2.5 m resolutions, without having additional information available. This problem is known as single-image super-resolution. For standard images, deep learning techniques have become the de facto standard to learn the mapping from lower to higher resolution images due to their learning capacity. However, super-resolution models learned for standard images do not work well with satellite images and hence, a specific model for this problem needs to be learned. The main challenge that this paper aims to solve is how to train a super-resolution model for Sentinel-2 images when no ground truth exists (Sentinel-2 images at 5 m or 2.5 m). Our proposal consists of using a reference satellite with a high similarity in terms of spectral bands with respect to Sentinel-2, but with higher spatial resolution, to create image pairs at both the source and target resolutions. This way, we can train a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network to recover details not present in the original RGBN bands. An exhaustive experimental study is carried out to validate our proposal, including a comparison with the most extended strategy for super-resolving Sentinel-2, which consists in learning a model to super-resolve from an under-sampled version at either 40 m or 20 m to the original 10 m resolution and then, applying this model to super-resolve from 10 m to 5 m or 2.5 m. Finally, we will also show that the spectral radiometry of the native bands is maintained when super-resolving images, in such a way that they can be used for any subsequent processing as if they were images acquired by Sentinel-2.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Electricity theft and fraud in energy consumption are two of the major issues for power distribution companies (PDCs) for many years. PDCs around the world are trying different methodologies for detecting electricity theft. The traditional methods for non-technical losses (NTLs) detection such as onsite inspection and reward and penalty policy have lost their place in the modern era because of their ineffective and time-consuming mechanism. With the advancement in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), newer and efficient NTL detection methods have been proposed by different researchers working in the field of data mining and AI. The AI-based NTL detection methods are superior to the conventional methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, time-consumption, precision, and labor required. The importance of such AI-based NTL detection methods can be judged by looking at the growing trend toward the increasing number of research articles on this important development. However, the authors felt the lack of a comprehensive study that can provide a one-stop source of information on these AI-based NTL methods and hence became the motivation for carrying out this comprehensive review on this significant field of science. This article systematically reviews and classifies the methods explored for NTL detection in recent literature, along with their benefits and limitations. For accomplishing the mentioned objective, the opted research articles for the review are classified based on algorithms used, features extracted, and metrics used for evaluation. Furthermore, a summary of different types of algorithms used for NTL detection is provided along with their applications in the studied field of research. Lastly, a comparison among the major NTL categories, i.e., data-based, network-based, and hybrid methods, is provided on the basis of their performance, expenses, and response time. It is expected that this comprehensive study will provide a one-stop source of information for all the new researchers and the experts working in the mentioned area of research.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The agent paradigm and multi-agent systems are a perfect match for the design of smart cities because of some of their essential features such as decentralization, openness, and heterogeneity. However, these major advantages also come at a great cost. Since agents&rsquo; mental states are hidden when the implementation is not known and available, intelligent services of smart cities cannot leverage information from them. We contribute with a proposal for the analysis and prediction of hidden agents&rsquo; mental states in a multi-agent system using machine learning methods that learn from past agents&rsquo; interactions. The approach employs agent communication languages, which is a core property of these multi-agent systems, to infer theories and models about agents&rsquo; mental states that are not accessible in an open system. These mental state models can be used on their own or combined to build protocol models, allowing agents (and their developers) to predict future agents&rsquo; behavior for various tasks such as testing and debugging them or making communications more efficient, which is essential in an ambient intelligence environment. This paper&rsquo;s main contribution is to explore the problem of building these agents&rsquo; mental state models not from one, but from several interaction protocols, even when the protocols could have different purposes and provide distinct ambient intelligence services.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Crowding in city public transportation systems is a primary issue that causes delay in the mobility of passengers. Moreover, scheduled and unscheduled events in a city lead to excess crowding situations at the metro or bus stations. The Internet of Things (IoT) devices could be used for data collection, which are related to crowding situations in a smart city. The fog computing data centers located in different zones of a smart city can process and analyze the collected data to assist the passengers how to commute smoothly with minimum waiting time in the crowded situation. In this paper, Q-learning based passengers assistance system is designed to assist the commuters in finding less crowded bus and metro stations to avoid long queues of waiting. The traffic congestion and crowded situation data are processed in the fog computing data centers. From our experimental results, it is found that our proposed method can achieve higher reward values, which can be used to minimize the passengers&rsquo; waiting time with minimum computational delay as compared to the cloud computing platform.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been very effective in collecting aerial images data for various Internet-of-Things (IoT)/smart cities applications such as search and rescue, surveillance, vehicle detection, counting, intelligent transportation systems, to name a few. However, the real-time processing of collected data on edge in the context of the Internet-of-Drones remains an open challenge because UAVs have limited energy capabilities, while computer vision techniquesconsume excessive energy and require abundant resources. This fact is even more critical when deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used for classification and detection. In this paper, we first propose a system architecture of computation offloading for Internet-connected drones. Then, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study to evaluate the performance in terms of energy, bandwidth, and delay of the cloud computation offloading approach versus the edge computing approach of deep learning applications in the context of UAVs. In particular, we investigate the tradeoff between the communication cost and the computation of the two candidate approaches experimentally. The main results demonstrate that the computation offloading approach allows us to provide much higher throughput (i.e., frames per second) as compared to the edge computing approach, despite the larger communication delays.

AB  - In recent years, people have witnessed numerous Internet of Things (IoT)-based attacks with the exponential increase in the number of IoT devices. Alongside this, the means to secure IoT-based applications are maturing slower than our budding dependence on them. Moreover, the vulnerabilities in an IoT system are exploited in chains to penetrate deep into the network and yield more adverse aftereffects. To mitigate these issues, this paper gives unique insights for handling the growing vulnerabilities in common IoT devices and proposes a threat architecture for IoT, addressing threats in the context of a three-layer IoT reference architecture. Furthermore, the vulnerabilities exploited at the several IoT attack surfaces and the challenges they exert are explored. Thereafter, the challenges in quantifying the IoT vulnerabilities with the existing framework are also analyzed. The study also covers a case study on the Intelligent Transportation System, covering road transport and traffic control specifically in terms of threats and vulnerabilities. Another case study on secure energy management in the Smart Grid is also presented. This case study covers the applications of Internet of Vulnerable Things (IoVT) in Smart energy Grid solutions, as there will be tremendous use of IoT in future Smart Grids to save energy and improve overall distribution. The analysis shows that the integration of the proposed architecture in existing applications alarms the developers about the embedded threats in the system.

AB  - In recent years, with the growing accessibility of abundant contextual emotion information, which is benefited by the numerous georeferenced user-generated content and the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI)-based emotional computing technics, the emotion layer of human&ndash;environment relationship is proposed for enriching traditional methods of various related disciplines such as urban planning. This paper proposes the geographic information system (GIS)-based emotional computing concept, which is a novel framework for applying GIS methods to collective human emotion. The methodology presented in this paper consists of three key steps: (1) collecting georeferenced data containing emotion and environment information such as social media and official sites, (2) detecting emotions using AI-based emotional computing technics such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), and (3) visualizing and analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns with GIS tools. This methodology is a great synergy of multidisciplinary cutting-edge techniques, such as GIScience, sociology, and computer science. Moreover, it can effectively and deeply explore the connection between people and their surroundings with the help of GIS methods. Generally, the framework provides a standard workflow to calculate and analyze the new information layer for researchers, in which a measured human-centric perspective onto the environment is possible.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The development of fast and robust brain&ndash;computer interface (BCI) systems requires non-complex and efficient computational tools. The modern procedures adopted for this purpose are complex which limits their use in practical applications. In this study, for the first time, and to the best of our knowledge, a successive decomposition index (SDI)-based feature extraction approach is utilized for the classification of motor and mental imagery electroencephalography (EEG) tasks. First of all, the public datasets IVa, IVb, and V from BCI competition III were denoised using multiscale principal analysis (MSPCA), and then a SDI feature was calculated corresponding to each trial of the data. Finally, six benchmark machine learning and neural network classifiers were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. All the experiments were performed for motor and mental imagery datasets in binary and multiclass applications using a 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, computerized automatic detection of motor and mental imagery using SDI (CADMMI-SDI) is developed to describe the proposed approach practically. The experimental results suggest that the highest classification accuracy of 97.46% (Dataset IVa), 99.52% (Dataset IVb), and 99.33% (Dataset V) was obtained using feedforward neural network classifier. Moreover, a series of experiments, namely, statistical analysis, channels variation, classifier parameters variation, processed and unprocessed data, and computational complexity, were performed and it was concluded that SDI is robust for noise, and a non-complex and efficient biomarker for the development of fast and accurate motor and mental imagery BCI systems.

AB  - The increasing demand for more sensors inside vehicles pursues the intention of making vehicles more &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo;. In this context, the vision of fully connected and autonomous cars is becoming more tangible and will turn into a reality in the coming years. The use of these intelligent transport systems will allow the integration of efficient performance in terms of route control, fuel consumption, and traffic administration, among others. Future vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication will require a wider bandwidth as well as lower latencies than current technologies can offer, to support high-constraint safety applications and data exhaustive information exchanges. To this end, recent investigations have proposed the adoption of the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands to achieve high throughput and low latencies. However, mmWave communications come with high constraints for implementation due to higher free-space losses, poor diffraction, poor signal penetration, among other channel impairments for these high-frequency bands. In this work, a V2X communication channel in the mmWave (28 GHz) band is analyzed by a combination of an empirical study and a deterministic simulation with an in-house 3D ray-launching algorithm. Multiple mmWave V2X links has been modeled for a complex heterogeneous urban scenario in order to capture and analyze different propagation phenomena, providing full volumetric estimation of frequency/power as well as time domain parameters. Large- and small-scale propagation parameters are obtained for a combination of different situations, taking into account the obstruction between the transceivers of vehicles of distinct sizes. These results can aid in the development of modeling techniques for the implementation of mmWave frequency bands in the vehicular context, with the capability of adapting to different scenario requirements in terms of network topology, user density, or transceiver location. The proposed methodology provides accurate wireless channel estimation within the complete volume of the scenario under analysis, considering detailed topological characteristics.

AB  - Cybersecurity issues constitute a key concern of today&rsquo;s technology-based economies. Cybersecurity has become a core need for providing a sustainable and safe society to online users in cyberspace. Considering the rapid increase of technological implementations, it has turned into a global necessity in the attempt to adapt security countermeasures, whether direct or indirect, and prevent systems from cyberthreats. Identifying, characterizing, and classifying such threats and their sources is required for a sustainable cyber-ecosystem. This paper focuses on the cybersecurity of smart grids and the emerging trends such as using blockchain in the Internet of Things (IoT). The cybersecurity of emerging technologies such as smart cities is also discussed. In addition, associated solutions based on artificial intelligence and machine learning frameworks to prevent cyber-risks are also discussed. Our review will serve as a reference for policy-makers from the industry, government, and the cybersecurity research community.

AB  - Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication enhances the capability of autonomous driving through better safety, efficiency, and comfort. In particular, sensor data sharing, known as cooperative perception, is a crucial technique to accommodate vulnerable road users in a cooperative intelligent transport system (ITS). In this paper, we describe a roadside perception unit (RSPU) that combines sensors and roadside units (RSUs) for infrastructure-based cooperative perception. We propose a software called AutoC2X that we designed to realize cooperative perception for RSPUs and vehicles. We also propose the concept of networked RSPUs, which is the inter-connection of RSPUs along a road over a wired network, and helps realize broader cooperative perception. We evaluated the RSPU system and the networked RSPUs through a field test, numerical analysis, and simulation experiments. Field evaluation showed that, even in the worst case, our RSPU system can deliver messages to an autonomous vehicle within 100 ms. The simulation result shows that the proposed priority algorithm achieves a wide perception range with a high delivery ratio and low latency, especially under heavy road traffic conditions.

AB  - The ongoing diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is opening new possibilities, and one of the most remarkable applications is associated with the smart city paradigm, which is continuously evolving. In general, it can be defined as the integration of IoT and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) into city management, with the aim of addressing the exponential growth of urbanization and population, thus significantly increasing people&rsquo;s quality of life. The smart city paradigm is also strictly connected to sustainability aspects, taking into account, for example, the reduction of environmental impact of urban activities, the optimized management of energy resources, and the design of innovative services and solution for citizens. Abiding by this new paradigm, several cities started a process of strong innovation in different fields (such as mobility and transportation, industry, health, tourism, and education), thanks to significant investments provided by stakeholders and the European Commission (EC). In this paper, we analyze key aspects of an IoT infrastructure for smart cities, outlining the innovations implemented in the city of Parma (Emilia Romagna region, Italy) as a successful example. Special attention is dedicated to the theme of smart urban mobility.

SN  - 2305-6304

AB  - Human exposure to air pollution is a major public health concern. Environmental policymakers have been implementing various strategies to reduce exposure, including the 10th-day-no-driving system. To assess exposure of an entire population of a community in a highly polluted area, pollutant concentrations in microenvironments and population time&ndash;activity patterns are required. To date, population exposure to air pollutants has been assessed using air monitoring data from fixed atmospheric monitoring stations, atmospheric dispersion modeling, or spatial interpolation techniques for pollutant concentrations. This is coupled with census data, administrative registers, and data on the patterns of the time-based activities at the individual scale. Recent technologies such as sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT), communications technology, and artificial intelligence enable the accurate evaluation of air pollution exposure for a population in an environmental health context. In this study, the latest trends in published papers on the assessment of population exposure to air pollution were reviewed. Subsequently, this study proposes a methodology that will enable policymakers to develop an environmental health surveillance system that evaluates the distribution of air pollution exposure for a population within a target area and establish countermeasures based on advanced exposure assessment.

AB  - Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) often suffer from error-prone links when deployed in resource-constrained industrial environments. Reliability is a critical performance requirement of loss-sensitive applications, and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is a key indicator of successful communications. In addition to the improvement of the physical layer through modulation and channel coding, machine learning offers adaptive solutions by configuring various communication parameters dynamically. In this paper, we apply a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict SNR and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). Analysis results based on a real dataset show that the DNN can predict SNR and PDR at the accuracy of up to 96% and 98%, respectively, even when trained with very small fraction (&le;10%) of data. Moreover, a common subset of features turns out to be useful in predicting both SNR and PDR so as to encourage considering both metrics jointly. We may control the transmission power in the dynamic and adaptive manner when we have predictable SNR and PDR, and thus fulfill the reliability requirements with energy conservation. This can help in achieving sustainable design for the communication system.

AB  - As the expenses of medical care administrations rise and medical services experts are becoming rare, it is up to medical services organizations and institutes to consider the implementation of medical Health Information Technology (HIT) innovation frameworks. HIT permits health associations to smooth out their considerable cycles and offer types of assistance in a more productive and financially savvy way. With the rise of Cloud Storage Computing (CSC), an enormous number of associations and undertakings have moved their healthcare data sources to distributed storage. As the information can be mentioned whenever universally, the accessibility of information becomes an urgent need. Nonetheless, outages in cloud storage essentially influence the accessibility level. Like the other basic variables of cloud storage (e.g., reliability quality, performance, security, and protection), availability also directly impacts the data in cloud storage for e-Healthcare systems. In this paper, we systematically review cloud storage mechanisms concerning the healthcare environment. Additionally, in this paper, the state-of-the-art cloud storage mechanisms are critically reviewed for e-Healthcare systems based on their characteristics. In short, this paper summarizes existing literature based on cloud storage and its impact on healthcare, and it likewise helps researchers, medical specialists, and organizations with a solid foundation for future studies in the healthcare environment.

AB  - Cloud Computing provides on-demand computing services like software, networking, storage, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (“the cloud”). But it is facing challenges because of the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the volume, variety, veracity and velocity of the data generated by these devices. There is a need for ultra-low latency, reliable service along with security and privacy. Fog Computing is a promising solution to overcome these challenges. The originality, scope and novelty of this paper is the definition and formulation of the problem of smart neighborhoods in context of smart grids. This is achieved through an extensive literature study, firstly on Fog Computing and its foundation technologies, its applications and the literature review of Fog Computing research in various application domains. Thereafter, we introduce smart grid and community MicroGrid concepts and, their challenges to give the in depth background of the problem and hence, formalize the problem. The smart grid, which ensures reliable, secure, and cost-effective power supply to the smart neighborhoods, effectively needs Fog Computing architecture to achieve its purpose. This paper also identifies, without rigorous analysis, potential solutions to address the problem of smart neighborhoods. The challenges in the integration of Fog Computing and smart grids are also discussed.

AB  - Accurately forecasting how crowds of people are distributed in urban areas during daily activities is of key importance for the smart city vision and related applications. In this work we forecast the crowd density and distribution in an urban area by analyzing an aggregated mobile phone dataset. By comparing the forecasting performance of statistical and deep learning methods on the aggregated mobile data we show that each class of methods has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the forecasting scenario. However, for our time-series forecasting problem, deep learning methods are preferable when it comes to simplicity and immediacy of use, since they do not require a time-consuming model selection for each different cell. Deep learning approaches are also appropriate when aiming to reduce the maximum forecasting error. Statistical methods instead show their superiority in providing more precise forecasting results, but they require data domain knowledge and computationally expensive techniques in order to select the best parameters.

T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Generally, simulation models are constructed to replicate and predict the behavior of real systems that currently exist or are expected to exist in the future. Once a simulation model is implemented, the model can be connected to a real system for which the model has been built through sensors or networks so that important activities in the real system can be monitored indirectly through the model. This article proposes a modeling formalism BM-DEVS (Behavior Monitor-DEVS) that defines simulation models capable of monitoring the desired behavior patterns within the models so that the target system&rsquo;s behavior can be monitored indirectly. In BM-DEVS, an extension of classic Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS), the behavior to be monitored is expressed as a set of temporal logic (TL) production rules within a multi-component model that consists of multiple component models to be monitored. An inference engine module for reasoning with the TL rules is designed based on the abstract simulator that carries out instructions in the BM-DEVS models to perform the simulation process. The major application of BM-DEVS is in the design and implementation of the context-aware architecture needed for various intelligent systems as a core constituent. Essentially all systems where some form of behavior monitoring is required are candidate applications of BM-DEVS. This research is motivated by the view that there exists symmetry between the real-world and the cyber world, in that the problems in both environments should be expressed with the same basic constituents of time and space; this naturally leads to adopting spatiotemporal variables composed of simulation models and developing a problem solver that exploits these variables.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, there is an increasing attention on air quality derived services for the final users. A dense grid of measures is needed to implement services such as conditional routing, alerting on data values for personal usage, data heatmaps for Dashboards in control room for the operators, and for web and mobile applications for the city users. Therefore, the challenge consists of providing high density data and services starting from scattered data and regardless of the number of sensors and their position to a large number of users. To this aim, this paper is focused on providing an integrated solution addressing at the same time multiple aspects: To create and optimize algorithms for data interpolation (creating regular data from scattered), making it possible to cope with the scalability and providing support for on demand services to provide air quality data in any point of the city with dense data. To this end, the accuracy of different interpolation algorithms has been evaluated comparing the results with respect to real values. In addition, the trends of heatmaps interpolation errors have been exploited to detected devices&rsquo; dysfunctions. Such anomalies may often be useful to request a maintenance action. The solution proposed has been integrated as a Micro Services providing data analytics in a data flow real time process based on Node.JS Node-RED, called in the paper IoT Applications. The specific case presented in this paper refers to the data and the solution of Snap4City for Helsinki. Snap4City, which has been developed as a part of Select4Cities PCP of the European Commission, and it is presently used in a number of cities and areas in Europe.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the big concerns for smart cities. The problem of applying big data analytics to sampling bias in the context of urban air quality is studied in this paper. A nonparametric estimator that incorporates kernel density estimation is used. When ignoring the biasing weight function, a small-sized simple random sample of the real population is assumed to be additionally observed. The general parameter considered is the mean of a transformation of the random variable of interest. A new bootstrap algorithm is used to approximate the mean squared error of the new estimator. Its minimization leads to an automatic bandwidth selector. The method is applied to a real data set concerning the levels of different pollutants in the urban air of the city of A Coru&ntilde;a (Galicia, NW Spain). Estimations for the mean and the cumulative distribution function of the level of ozone and nitrogen dioxide when the temperature is greater than or equal to 30 ∘C based on 15 years of biased data are obtained.

AB  - Air pollution has been a looming issue of the 21st century that has also significantly impacted the surrounding environment and societal health. Recently, previous studies have conducted extensive research on air pollution and air quality monitoring. Despite this, the fields of air pollution and air quality monitoring remain plagued with unsolved problems. In this study, the Pollution Weather Prediction System (PWP) is proposed to perform air pollution prediction for outdoor sites for various pollution parameters. In the presented research work, we introduced a PWP system configured with pollution-sensing units, such as SDS021, MQ07-CO, NO2-B43F, and Aeroqual Ozone (O3). These sensing units were utilized to collect and measure various pollutant levels, such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and O3, for 90 days at Symbiosis International University, Pune, Maharashtra, India. The data collection was carried out between the duration of December 2019 to February 2020 during the winter. The investigation results validate the success of the presented PWP system. In the conducted experiments, linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN)-based AQI (air quality index) predictions were performed. Furthermore, the presented study also found that the customized linear regression methodology outperformed other machine-learning methods, such as linear, ridge, Lasso, Bayes, Huber, Lars, Lasso-lars, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and ElasticNet regression methodologies, and the customized ANN regression methodology used in the conducted experiments. The overall AQI values of the air pollutants were calculated based on the summation of the AQI values of all the presented air pollutants. In the end, the web and mobile interfaces were developed to display air pollution prediction values of a variety of air pollutants.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Technological advancement is currently focused on the miniaturization of devices, and integrated circuits allow us to observe the increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Most IoT services and devices require an Internet connection, which needs to provide the minimum processing, storage and networking requirements to best serve a requested service. One of the main goals of 5G networks is to comply with the user&rsquo;s various Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in different application scenarios. Fifth-generation networks use Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) concepts to achieve these QoS requirements. However, the computational resource allocation mechanisms required by the services are considered very complex. Thus, in this paper, we propose an allocation and management resources mechanism for 5G networks that uses MEC and simple mathematical methods to reduce the model complexity. The mechanism decides to allocate the resource in MEC to meet the requirements requested by the user. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism provides a larger amount of services, leading to a reduction in the service lock number and as a reduction in the blocking ratio of services due to the accuracy of the approach and its load balancing in the process of resource allocation.

AB  - The random nature of traffic conditions on freeways can cause excessive congestion and irregularities in the traffic flow. Ramp metering is a proven effective method to maintain freeway efficiency under various traffic conditions. Creating a reliable and practical ramp metering algorithm that considers both critical traffic measures and historical data is still a challenging problem. In this study we use simple machine learning approaches to develop a novel real-time ramp metering algorithm. The proposed algorithm is computationally simple and has minimal data requirements, which makes it practical for real-world applications.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are widely used in critical infrastructures to support the essential services of society. Therefore, their protection against terrorist activities, natural disasters, and cyber threats is critical. Diverse cyber attack detection systems have been proposed over the years, in which each proposal has applied different steps and methods. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding methodologies to detect cyber attacks in ICS scenarios. The lack of such methodologies prevents researchers from being able to accurately compare proposals and results. In this work, we present a Methodology for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems (MADICS) to detect cyber attacks in ICS scenarios, which is intended to provide a guideline for future works in the field. MADICS is based on a semi-supervised anomaly detection paradigm and makes use of deep learning algorithms to model ICS behaviors. It consists of five main steps, focused on pre-processing the dataset to be used with the machine learning and deep learning algorithms; performing feature filtering to remove those features that do not meet the requirements; feature extraction processes to obtain higher order features; selecting, fine-tuning, and training the most appropriate model; and validating the model performance. In order to validate MADICS, we used the popular Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset, which was collected from a fully operational water treatment plant. The experiments demonstrate that, using MADICS, we can achieve a state-of-the-art precision of 0.984 (as well as a recall of 0.750 and F1-score of 0.851), which is above the average of other works, proving that the proposed methodology is suitable for use in real ICS scenarios.

AB  - The advancement in IoT has prompted its application in areas such as smart homes, smart cities, etc., and this has aided its exponential growth. However, alongside this development, IoT networks are experiencing a rise in security challenges such as botnet attacks, which often appear as network anomalies. Similarly, providing security solutions has been challenging due to the low resources that characterize the devices in IoT networks. To overcome these challenges, the fog computing paradigm has provided an enabling environment that offers additional resources for deploying security solutions such as anomaly mitigation schemes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid anomaly mitigation framework for IoT using fog computing to ensure faster and accurate anomaly detection. The framework employs signature- and anomaly-based detection methodologies for its two modules, respectively. The signature-based module utilizes a database of attack sources (blacklisted IP addresses) to ensure faster detection when attacks are executed from the blacklisted IP address, while the anomaly-based module uses an extreme gradient boosting algorithm for accurate classification of network traffic flow into normal or abnormal. We evaluated the performance of both modules using an IoT-based dataset in terms response time for the signature-based module and accuracy in binary and multiclass classification for the anomaly-based module. The results show that the signature-based module achieves a fast attack detection of at least six times faster than the anomaly-based module in each number of instances evaluated. The anomaly-based module using the XGBoost classifier detects attacks with an accuracy of 99% and at least 97% for average recall, average precision, and average F1 score for binary and multiclass classification. Additionally, it recorded 0.05 in terms of false-positive rates.

AB  - The urban environmental planning, a fundamental dynamic process for cities&rsquo; sustainability, could benefit from the soundscape approach, dealing with the perception of the acoustic environment in which sound is considered as a resource rather than a waste (noise). Noise and soundscape maps are useful tools for planning mitigation actions and for communication with citizens. Both mappings can benefit from crowdsourcing and participatory sound monitoring that has been made possible due to the large use of internet connections and mobile devices with dedicated apps. This paper is a &ldquo;scoping review&rdquo; to provide an overview of the potential, benefits, and drawbacks of participatory noise monitoring in noise and soundscape mapping applications, while also referring to metrological aspects. Gathering perceptual data on soundscapes by using digital questionnaires will likely be more commonly used than printed questionnaires; thus, the main differences between the experimental protocols concern the measurement of acoustic data. The authors propose to classify experimental protocols for in-field soundscape surveys into three types (GUIDE, MONITOR, and SMART) to be selected according to the survey&rsquo;s objectives and the territorial extension. The main future developments are expected to be related to progress in smartphone hardware and software, to the growth of social networks data analysis, as well as to the implementation of machine learning techniques.

AB  - In the near future, the fifth-generation wireless technology is expected to be rolled out, offering low latency, high bandwidth and multiple antennas deployed in a single access point. This ecosystem will help further enhance various location-based scenarios such as assets tracking in smart factories, precise smart management of hydroponic indoor vertical farms and indoor way-finding in smart hospitals. Such a system will also integrate existing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), WiFi and other network infrastructures. In this respect, 5G precise indoor localization using heterogeneous IoT technologies (Zigbee, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, BLE, etc.) is a challenging research area. In this work, an experimental 5G testbed has been designed integrating C-RAN and IoT networks. This testbed is used to improve both vertical and horizontal localization (3D Localization) in a 5G IoT environment. To achieve this, we propose the DEep Learning-based co-operaTive Architecture (DELTA) machine learning model implemented on a 3D multi-layered fingerprint radiomap. The DELTA begins by estimating the 2D location. Then, the output is recursively used to predict the 3D location of a mobile station. This approach is going to benefit use cases such as 3D indoor navigation in multi-floor smart factories or in large complex buildings. Finally, we have observed that the proposed model has outperformed traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

AB  - A smart home provides a facilitated environment for the detection of human activity with appropriate Deep Learning algorithms to manipulate data collected from numerous sensors attached to various smart things in a smart home environment. Human activities comprise expected and unexpected behavior events; therefore, detecting these events consisting of mutual dependent activities poses a key challenge in the activities detection paradigm. Besides, the battery-powered sensor ubiquitously and extensively monitors activities, disputes, and sensor energy depletion. Therefore, to address these challenges, we propose an Energy and Event Aware-Sensor Duty Cycling scheme. The proposed model predicts the future expected event using the Bi-Directional Long-Short Term Memory model and allocates Predictive Sensors to the predicted event. To detect the unexpected events, the proposed model localizes a Monitor Sensor within a cluster of Hibernate Sensors using the Jaccard Similarity Index. Finally, we optimize the performance of our proposed scheme by employing the Q-Learning algorithm to track the missed or undetected events. The simulation is executed against the conventional Machine Learning algorithms for the sensor duty cycle, scheduling to reduce the sensor energy consumption and improve the activity detection accuracy. The experimental evaluation of our proposed scheme shows significant improvement in activity detection accuracy from 94.12% to 96.12%. Besides, the effective rotation of the Monitor Sensor significantly improves the energy consumption of each sensor with the entire network lifetime.

AB  - Multi-access edge computing (MEC) has become an essential technology for collecting, analyzing, and processing data generated by widely distributed user equipment (UE), wireless end-hosts, Internet of things (IoT) sensors, etc., providing real-time and high-quality networking services with ultralow end-to-end latency guaranteed between various user devices and edge cloud computing nodes. However, the cloud resources at the MEC on-site (access point) and edge site are restricted and insufficient mainly because of the operation and management constraints (e.g., limited space and capacity), particularly in the case of on-demand and dynamic service resource deployment. In this regard, we propose a selective MEC resource allocation scheme adopting a multitier architecture over a wide-area software-defined network (SDN) on the basis of our recent research work on virtual network slicing and resource orchestration. The proposed scheme provides an optimized MEC selection model considering end-to-end latency and efficient service resource utilization on the basis of the hierarchical MEC service architecture.

AB  - Several studies in environmental engineering emphasize the importance of air quality forecasting for sustainable development around the world. In this paper, we studied a new approach for air quality forecasting in Busan metropolitan city. We proposed a convolutional Bi-Directional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) autoencoder model trained using a distributed architecture to predict the concentration of the air quality particles (PM2.5 and PM10). The proposed deep learning model can automatically learn the intrinsic correlation among the pollutants in different location. Also, the meteorological and the pollution gas information at each location are fully utilized, which is beneficial for the performance of the model. We used multiple one-dimension convolutional neural network (CNN) layers to extract the local spatial features and a stacked Bi-LSTM layer to learn the spatiotemporal correlation of air quality particles. In addition, we used a stacked deep autoencoder to encode the essential transformation patterns of the pollution gas and the meteorological data, since they are very important for providing useful information that can significantly improve the prediction of the air quality particles. Finally, in order to reduce the training time and the resource consumption, we used a distributed deep leaning approach called data parallelism, which has never been used to tackle the problem of air quality forecasting. We evaluated our approach with extensive experiments based on the data collected in Busan metropolitan city. The results reveal the superiority of our framework over ten baseline models and display how the distributed deep learning model can significantly improve the training time and even the prediction accuracy.

AB  - Audio-based event detection poses a number of different challenges that are not encountered in other fields, such as image detection. Challenges such as ambient noise, low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and microphone distance are not yet fully understood. If the multimodal approaches are to become better in a range of fields of interest, audio analysis will have to play an integral part. Event recognition in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is such a field at a nascent stage that can especially leverage solely on audio or can be part of the multimodal approach. In this manuscript, an extensive analysis focused on the comparison of different magnitude representations of the raw audio is presented. The data on which the analysis is carried out is part of the publicly available MIVIA Audio Events dataset. Single channel Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), mel-scale and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) spectrogram representations are used. Furthermore, aggregation methods of the aforementioned spectrogram representations are examined; the feature concatenation compared to the stacking of features as separate channels. The effect of the SNR on recognition accuracy and the generalization of the proposed methods on datasets that were both seen and not seen during training are studied and reported.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Urban noise is one of the most serious and underestimated environmental problems. According to the World Health Organization, noise pollution from traffic and other human activities, negatively impact the population health and life quality. Monitoring noise usually requires the use of professional and expensive instruments, called phonometers, able to accurately measure sound pressure levels. In many cases, phonometers are human-operated; therefore, periodic fine-granularity city-wide measurements are expensive. Recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) offer a window of opportunities for low-cost autonomous sound pressure meters. Such devices and platforms could enable fine time&ndash;space noise measurements throughout a city. Unfortunately, low-cost sound pressure sensors are inaccurate when compared with phonometers, experiencing a high variability in the measurements. In this paper, we present RaveGuard, an unmanned noise monitoring platform that exploits artificial intelligence strategies to improve the accuracy of low-cost devices. RaveGuard was initially deployed together with a professional phonometer for over two months in downtown Bologna, Italy, with the aim of collecting a large amount of precise noise pollution samples. The resulting datasets have been instrumental in designing InspectNoise, a library that can be exploited by IoT platforms, without the need of expensive phonometers, but obtaining a similar precision. In particular, we have applied supervised learning algorithms (adequately trained with our datasets) to reduce the accuracy gap between the professional phonometer and an IoT platform equipped with low-end devices and sensors. Results show that RaveGuard, combined with the InspectNoise library, achieves a 2.24% relative error compared to professional instruments, thus enabling low-cost unmanned city-wide noise monitoring.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging concept that has revolutionized the use of new technologies in everyday life. The economic impact of IoT becoming very important, and it began to be used in the industrial environment under the name of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) concept, which is a sub-domain of IoT. The IIoT changes the way industrial processes are controlled and monitored, increasing operating efficiency. This article proposes a software architecture for IIoT that has a low degree of abstraction compared to the reference architectures presented in the literature. The architecture is organized on four-layer and it integrates the latest concepts related to fog and edge computing. These concepts are activated through the use of fog/edge/gateway nodes, where the processing of data acquired from things is performed and it is the place where things interact with each other in the virtual environment. The main contributions of this paper are the proposal and description of a complete IIoT software architecture, the use of a unified address space, and the use of the computing platform based on SoC (System on Chip) with specialized co-processors in order to be able to execute in real-time certain time-critical operations specific to the industrial environment.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The proximity-based device-to-device (D2D) communication allows for internet of things, public safety, and data offloading services. Because of these advantages, D2D communication has been applied to wireless communication networks. In wireless networks using D2D communication, there are challenging problems of the data rate shortage and coverage limitation due to co-channel interference in the proximity communication. To resolve the problems, transmit power control schemes that are based on deep learning have been presented in network-assisted D2D communication systems. The power control schemes have focused on enhancing spectral efficiency and energy efficiency in the presence of interference. However, the data-rate fairness performance may be a key performance metric in D2D communications, because devices in proximity can expect fair quality of service in the system. Hence, in this paper, a transmit power control scheme using a deep-learning algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to consider the data-rate fairness performance in network-assisted D2D communication systems, where the wireless channels are modelled by path loss and Nakagami fading. In the proposed scheme, the batch normalization (BN) scheme is introduced in order to further enhance the spectral efficiency of the conventional deep-learning transmit power control scheme. In addition, a loss function for the deep-learning optimization is defined in order to consider both the data-rate fairness and spectral efficiency. Through simulation, we show that the proposed scheme can achieve extremely high fairness performance while improving the spectral efficiency of the conventional schemes. It is also shown that the improvement in the fairness and spectral efficiency is achieved for different Nakagami fading conditions and sizes of area containing the devices.

AB  - The sustainable development of mankind is a matter of concern to the whole world. Environmental pollution and haze diffusion have greatly affected the sustainable development of mankind. According to previous research, vehicle exhaust emissions are an important source of environmental pollution and haze diffusion. The sharp increase in the number of cars has also made the supply of energy increasingly tight. In this paper, we have explored the use of intelligent navigation technology based on data analysis to reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on road networks. We have implemented a traffic flow prediction method using a genetic algorithm and particle-swarm-optimization-enhanced support vector regression, constructed a model for predicting vehicle exhaust emissions based on predicted road conditions and vehicle fuel consumption, and built our low-carbon-emission-oriented navigation algorithm based on a spatially optimized dynamic path planning algorithm. The results show that our method could help to significantly reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on the road network, which means that our method could contribute to the construction of low-carbon-emission intelligent transportation systems and smart cities.

AB  - Acoustic pollution has been associated with adverse effects on the health and life expectancy of people, especially when noise exposure happens during the nighttime. With over half of the world population living in urban areas, acoustic pollution is an important concern for city administrators, especially those focused on transportation and leisure noise. Advances in sensor and network technologies made the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) possible in cities, which, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), can enable smart services for their citizens. However, the creation of such services often requires structured environmental audio databases to train AI algorithms. This paper reports on an environmental audio dataset of 363 min and 53 s created in a lively area of the Barcelona city center, which targeted traffic and leisure events. This dataset, which is free and publicly available, can provide researchers with real-world acoustic data to help the development and testing of sound monitoring solutions for urban environments.

AB  - Smart city strategies developed by cities around the world provide a useful resource for insights into the future of smart development. This study examines such strategies to identify plans for the explicit deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. A total of 12 case studies emerged from an online keyword search representing cities of various sizes globally. The search was based on the keywords of &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; (or &ldquo;AI&rdquo;), and &ldquo;robot,&rdquo; representing robotics and associated terminology. Based on the findings, it is evident that the more concentrated deployment of AI and robotics in smart city development is currently in the Global North, although countries in the Global South are also increasingly represented. Multiple cities in Australia and Canada actively seek to develop AI and robotics, and Moscow has one of the most in-depth elaborations for this deployment. The ramifications of these plans are discussed as part of cyber&ndash;physical systems alongside consideration given to the social and ethical implications.

VL  - 13

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Electrical load forecasting provides knowledge about future consumption and generation of electricity. There is a high level of fluctuation behavior between energy generation and consumption. Sometimes, the energy demand of the consumer becomes higher than the energy already generated, and vice versa. Electricity load forecasting provides a monitoring framework for future energy generation, consumption, and making a balance between them. In this paper, we propose a framework, in which deep learning and supervised machine learning techniques are implemented for electricity-load forecasting. A three-step model is proposed, which includes: feature selection, extraction, and classification. The hybrid of Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) is used to calculate features&rsquo; importance. The average feature importance of hybrid techniques selects the most relevant and high importance features in the feature selection method. The Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method is used to eliminate the irrelevant features in the feature extraction method. The load forecasting is performed with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a hybrid of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The meta-heuristic algorithms, i.e., Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Earth Worm Optimization (EWO) are applied to tune the hyper-parameters of SVM and CNN-GRU, respectively. The accuracy of our enhanced techniques CNN-GRU-EWO and SVM-GWO is 96.33% and 90.67%, respectively. Our proposed techniques CNN-GRU-EWO and SVM-GWO perform 7% and 3% better than the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA). In the end, a comparison with SOTA techniques is performed to show the improvement of the proposed techniques. This comparison showed that the proposed technique performs well and results in the lowest performance error rates and highest accuracy rates as compared to other techniques.

AB  - Fully autonomous vehicles (AV) would potentially be one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. The extent of the prospective benefits of AVs is strongly linked to how widely they will be accepted and adopted. Monitoring and tracking of individuals&rsquo; reactions and intentions to use AVs are critical. The current study aims to explore and classify individual predictors (i.e., influential factors or determinants) of public acceptance of, and intention to use AVs, by conducting a systematic literature review and developing a conceptual framework to map out the individual influential factors that shape public attitudes towards AVs, which influence user acceptance and adoption preferences. This framework contains the key factors identified in the systematic review&mdash;i.e., demographic, psychological, and mobility behavior characteristics. The findings of the review disclose that public perceptions and adoption intentions vary significantly among different socio-demographic cohorts. Commuters value different aspects concerning AVs, which shape their intentions on acceptance and adoption. Thus, direct experience with AVs along with education and communication would be helpful to change people&rsquo;s attitudes towards AVs in a positive way. The study informs urban and transport policymakers, managers, and planners, and helps in planning for a healthy AV adoption process with minimal societal disruption.

AB  - The concept of edge caching provision in emerging 5G and beyond mobile networks is a promising method to deal both with the traffic congestion problem in the core network, as well as reducing latency to access popular content. In that respect, end user demand for popular content can be satisfied by proactively caching it at the network edge, i.e., at close proximity to the users. In addition to model-based caching schemes, learning-based edge caching optimizations have recently attracted significant attention, and the aim hereafter is to capture these recent advances for both model-based and data-driven techniques in the area of proactive caching. This paper summarizes the utilization of deep learning for data caching in edge network. We first outline the typical research topics in content caching and formulate a taxonomy based on network hierarchical structure. Then, many key types of deep learning algorithms are presented, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning. Furthermore, a comparison of state-of-the-art literature is provided from the aspects of caching topics and deep learning methods. Finally, we discuss research challenges and future directions of applying deep learning for caching.

AB  - Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are emerging field characterized by complex data model, dynamics and strict time requirements. Ensuring cybersecurity in ITS is a complex task on which the safety and efficiency of transportation depends. The imposition of standards for a comprehensive architecture, as well as specific security standards, is one of the key steps in the evolution of ITS. The article examines the general outlines of the ITS architecture and security issues. The main focus of security approaches is: configuration and initialization of the devices during manufacturing at perception layer; anonymous authentication of nodes in VANET at network layer; defense of fog-based structures at support layer and description and standardization of the complex model of data and metadata and defense of systems, based on AI at application layer. The article oversees some conventional methods as network segmentation and cryptography that should be adapted in order to be applied in ITS cybersecurity. The focus is on innovative approaches that have recently been trying to find their place in ITS security strategies. These approaches includes blockchain, bloom filter, fog computing, artificial intelligence, game theory and ontologies. In conclusion, a correlation is made between the commented methods, the problems they solve and the architectural layers in which they are applied.

AB  - 5G networks and Internet of Things (IoT) offer a powerful platform for ubiquitous environments with their ubiquitous sensing, high speeds and other benefits. The data, analytics, and other computations need to be optimally moved and placed in these environments, dynamically, such that energy-efficiency and QoS demands are best satisfied. A particular challenge in this context is to preserve privacy and security while delivering quality of service (QoS) and energy-efficiency. Many works have tried to address these challenges but without a focus on optimizing all of them and assuming fixed models of environments and security threats. This paper proposes the UbiPriSEQ framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to adaptively, dynamically, and holistically optimize QoS, energy-efficiency, security, and privacy. UbiPriSEQ is built on a three-layered model and comprises two modules. UbiPriSEQ devises policies and makes decisions related to important parameters including local processing and offloading rates for data and computations, radio channel states, transmit power, task priority, and selection of fog nodes for offloading, data migration, and so forth. UbiPriSEQ is implemented in Python over the TensorFlow platform and is evaluated using a real-life application in terms of SINR, privacy metric, latency, and utility function, manifesting great promise.

T2  - Smart Cities

PY  - 2020
VL  - 3
IS  - 4
SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - During hazardous events, communities can use existing social media networks to share information in real time and initiate a local disaster response. This research conducted a web-based survey to explore two behaviors around the use of social media during hurricanes: seeking help and responding to help requests. Through the survey, we sampled 434 individuals across several counties affected by 2018 hurricanes Florence and Michael, which were both designated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as billion-dollar weather disasters. The survey questions collected data about demographics, social media use habits, perceptions towards social media, hurricane damages, and actions taken during a hurricane to seek and provide help. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used to conceptualize and frame parameters that affect intentions and behaviors regarding the use of social media during hurricanes to seek and provide help. Survey responses are analyzed using statistical regression to evaluate hypotheses about the influence of factors on seeking help and responding to help requests. Regression analyses indicate that attitude and perceived behavioral control predict intention to access social media during a hurricane, partially supporting the TPB. Intention and experiencing urgent damages predict help-seeking behaviors using social media. Posting frequency to social media under normal conditions and the number of help requests seen during the event predict help-responding behaviors. Linear regression equations governing intention and behavior were parameterized using survey results. The factors underlying social media behavior during hurricanes as identified in this research provide insight for understanding how smart information technologies, such as personal devices and social media networks, support community self-sufficiency and hazard resilience.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 10
SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Predicting dam inflow is necessary for effective water management. This study created machine learning algorithms to predict the amount of inflow into the Soyang River Dam in South Korea, using weather and dam inflow data for 40 years. A total of six algorithms were used, as follows: decision tree (DT), multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), recurrent neural network&ndash;long short-term memory (RNN&ndash;LSTM), and convolutional neural network&ndash;LSTM (CNN&ndash;LSTM). Among these models, the multilayer perceptron model showed the best results in predicting dam inflow, with the Nash&ndash;Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) value of 0.812, root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 77.218 m3/s, mean absolute error (MAE) of 29.034 m3/s, correlation coefficient (R) of 0.924, and determination coefficient (R2) of 0.817. However, when the amount of dam inflow is below 100 m3/s, the ensemble models (random forest and gradient boosting models) performed better than MLP for the prediction of dam inflow. Therefore, two combined machine learning (CombML) models (RF_MLP and GB_MLP) were developed for the prediction of the dam inflow using the ensemble methods (RF and GB) at precipitation below 16 mm, and the MLP at precipitation above 16 mm. The precipitation of 16 mm is the average daily precipitation at the inflow of 100 m3/s or more. The results show the accuracy verification results of NSE 0.857, RMSE 68.417 m3/s, MAE 18.063 m3/s, R 0.927, and R2 0.859 in RF_MLP, and NSE 0.829, RMSE 73.918 m3/s, MAE 18.093 m3/s, R 0.912, and R2 0.831 in GB_MLP, which infers that the combination of the models predicts the dam inflow the most accurately. CombML algorithms showed that it is possible to predict inflow through inflow learning, considering flow characteristics such as flow regimes, by combining several machine learning algorithms.

TI  - A Novel Hybrid Machine Learning Classification for the Detection of Bruxism Patients Using Physiological Signals
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Bruxism is a sleep disorder in which the patient clinches and gnashes their teeth. Bruxism detection using traditional methods is time-consuming, cumbersome, and expensive. Therefore, an automatic tool to detect this disorder will alleviate the doctor workload and give valuable help to patients. In this paper, we targeted this goal and designed an automatic method to detect bruxism from the physiological signals using a novel hybrid classifier. We began with data collection. Then, we performed the analysis of the physiological signals and the estimation of the power spectral density. After that, we designed the novel hybrid classifier to enable the detection of bruxism based on these data. The classification of the subjects into &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; or &ldquo;bruxism&rdquo; from the electroencephalogram channel (C4-A1) obtained a maximum specificity of 92% and an accuracy of 94%. Besides, the classification of the sleep stages such as the wake (w) stage and rapid eye movement (REM) stage from the electrocardiogram channel (ECG1-ECG2) obtained a maximum specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 95%. The combined bruxism classification and the sleep stages classification from the electroencephalogram channel (C4-P4) obtained a maximum specificity of 90% and an accuracy of 97%. The results show that more accurate bruxism detection is achieved by exploiting the electroencephalogram signal (C4-P4). The present work can be applied for home monitoring systems for bruxism detection.

AB  - Improving road safety through artificial intelligence-based systems is now crucial turning smart cities into a reality. Under this highly relevant and extensive heading, an approach is proposed to improve vehicle detection in smart crosswalks using machine learning models. Contrarily to classic fuzzy classifiers, machine learning models do not require the readjustment of labels that depend on the location of the system and the road conditions. Several machine learning models were trained and tested using real traffic data taken from urban scenarios in both Portugal and Spain. These include random forest, time-series forecasting, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine, and logistic regression models. A deep reinforcement learning agent, based on a state-of-the-art double-deep recurrent Q-network, is also designed and compared with the machine learning models just mentioned. Results show that the machine learning models can efficiently replace the classic fuzzy classifier.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Real-time automatic identification of audio distress signals in urban areas is a task that in a smart city can improve response times in emergency alert systems. The main challenge in this problem lies in finding a model that is able to accurately recognize these type of signals in the presence of background noise and allows for real-time processing. In this paper, we present the design of a portable and low-cost device for accurate audio distress signal recognition in real urban scenarios based on deep learning models. As real audio distress recordings in urban areas have not been collected and made publicly available so far, we first constructed a database where audios were recorded in urban areas using a low-cost microphone. Using this database, we trained a deep multi-headed 2D convolutional neural network that processed temporal and frequency features to accurately recognize audio distress signals in noisy environments with a significant performance improvement to other methods from the literature. Then, we deployed and assessed the trained convolutional neural network model on a Raspberry Pi that, along with the low-cost microphone, constituted a device for accurate real-time audio recognition. Source code and database are publicly available.

TI  - Tensor Decomposition for Spatial—Temporal Traffic Flow Prediction with Sparse Data
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 21
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Urban transport traffic surveillance is of great importance for public traffic control and personal travel path planning. Effective and efficient traffic flow prediction is helpful to optimize these real applications. The main challenge of traffic flow prediction is the data sparsity problem, meaning that traffic flow on some roads or of certain periods cannot be monitored. This paper presents a transport traffic prediction method that leverages the spatial and temporal correlation of transportation traffic to tackle this problem. We first propose to model the traffic flow using a fourth-order tensor, which incorporates the location, the time of day, the day of the week, and the week of the month. Based on the constructed traffic flow tensor, we either propose a model to estimate the correlation in each dimension of the tensor. Furthermore, we utilize the gradient descent strategy to design a traffic flow prediction algorithm that is capable of tackling the data sparsity problem from the spatial and temporal perspectives of the traffic pattern. To validate the proposed traffic prediction method, case studies using real-work datasets are constructed, and the results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of our proposed method outperforms the baselines. The accuracy decreases the least with the percentage of missing data increasing, including the situation of data being missing on neighboring roads in one or continuous multi-days. This certifies that the proposed prediction method can be utilized for sparse data-based transportation traffic surveillance.

SN  - 2673-3951

AB  - Current and future smart cities are moving towards the zero-net energy use concept. To this end, the built environment should also be designed for efficient energy use and play a significant role in the production of such energy. At present, this is achieved by focusing on energy demand in buildings and to the renewable trade-off related to smart power grids. However, urban water distribution systems constantly carry an excess of hydraulic energy that can potentially be recovered to produce electricity. This paper presents a comprehensive review of current strategies for energy production by reviewing the state-of-the-art of smart water systems. New technologies (such as cyber-physical systems, digital twins, blockchain) and new methodologies (network dynamics, geometric deep learning) associated with digital water are also discussed. The paper then focuses on modelling the installation of both micro-turbines and pumps as turbines, instead of/together with pressure reduction valves, to further demonstrate the energy-recovery methods which will enable water network partitioning into district metered areas. The associated benefits on leakage control, as a source of energy, and for contributing to overall network resilience are also highlighted. The paper concludes by presenting future research directions. Notably, digital water is proposed as the main research and operational direction for current and future Water Distribution Systems (WDS) and as a holistic, data-centred framework for the operation and management of water networks.

AB  - In the recent era of the Internet of Things, the dominant role of sensors and the Internet provides a solution to a wide variety of real-life problems. Such applications include smart city, smart healthcare systems, smart building, smart transport and smart environment. However, the real-time IoT sensor data include several challenges, such as a deluge of unclean sensor data and a high resource-consumption cost. As such, this paper addresses how to process IoT sensor data, fusion with other data sources, and analyses to produce knowledgeable insight into hidden data patterns for rapid decision-making. This paper addresses the data processing techniques such as data denoising, data outlier detection, missing data imputation and data aggregation. Further, it elaborates on the necessity of data fusion and various data fusion methods such as direct fusion, associated feature extraction, and identity declaration data fusion. This paper also aims to address data analysis integration with emerging technologies, such as cloud computing, fog computing and edge computing, towards various challenges in IoT sensor network and sensor data analysis. In summary, this paper is the first of its kind to present a complete overview of IoT sensor data processing, fusion and analysis techniques.

AB  - The role of agriculture in environmental degradation and climate change has been at the center of a long-lasting and controversial debate. This situation combined with the expected growth in crop demand and the increasing prices of fertilizers and pesticides has made the need for a more resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable agriculture more evident than ever. Precision agriculture (PA), as a relatively new farming management concept, aims to improve crop performance as well as to reduce the environmental footprint by utilizing information about the temporal and the spatial variability of crops. Information and communication technology (ICT) systems have influenced and shaped every part of modern life, and PA is no exception. The current paper conducts a literature review of prominent ICT solutions, focusing on their role in supporting different phases of the lifecycle of PA-related data. In addition to this, a data lifecycle model was developed as part of a novel categorization approach for the analyzed solutions.

AB  - The livelihood problem, especially the medical wisdom, has played an important role during the process of the building of smart cities. For the medical wisdom, the fall detection has attracted the considerable attention from the global researchers and medical institutions. It is very difficult for the traditional fall detection strategies to realize the intelligent detection with the following three reasons: (i) the data collection cannot reach the real-time level; (ii) the adopted detection methods cannot satisfy the enough stability; and (iii) the computation overhead of collection device is very high, which causes the barely satisfactory detection effect. Therefore, this paper proposes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fall detection strategy with edge computing consideration, where the global network view ability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is used to collect the generated data from smartphone. Meanwhile, on one hand, the edge computing is exploited to put some computation tasks at the edge server by the scheduling technique. On the other hand, CNN is equipped with both edge server and smartphone, and it is leveraged to train the related data and further give the guidance of fall detection. The experimental results show that the novel fall detection strategy has a more accurate rate, transmission delay, and stability than two cutting-edge strategies.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - Human errors are probably the main cause of car accidents, and this type of vehicle is one of the most dangerous forms of transport for people. The danger comes from the fact that on public roads there are simultaneously different types of actors (drivers, pedestrians or cyclists) and many objects that change their position over time, making difficult to predict their immediate movements. The intelligent transport system (ITS-G5) standard specifies the European communication technologies and protocols to assist public road users, providing them with relevant information. The scientific community is developing ITS-G5 applications for various purposes, among which is the increasing of pedestrian safety. This paper describes the developed work to implement an ITS-G5 prototype that aims at the increasing of pedestrian and driver safety in the vicinity of a pedestrian crosswalk by sending ITS-G5 decentralized environmental notification messages (DENM) to the vehicles. These messages are analyzed, and if they are relevant, they are presented to the driver through a car&rsquo;s onboard infotainment system. This alert allows the driver to take safety precautions to prevent accidents. The implemented prototype was tested in a controlled environment pedestrian crosswalk. The results showed the capacity of the prototype for detecting pedestrians, suitable message sending, the reception and processing on a vehicle onboard unit (OBU) module and its presentation on the car onboard infotainment system.

AB  - In the real Internet of Everything scenario, many large-scale information systems can be converted into interdependent sensor networks, such as smart grids, smart medical systems, and industrial Internet systems. These complex systems usually have multiple interdependent sensor networks. Small faults or failure behaviors between networks may cause serious cascading failure effects of the entire system. Therefore, in this paper, we will focus on the security of interdependent sensor networks. Firstly, by calculating the size of the largest functional component in the entire network, the impact of random attacks on the security of interdependent sensor networks is analyzed. Secondly, it compares and analyzes the impact of cascading failures between interdependent sensor networks under different switching edge strategies. Finally, the simulation results verify the effect of the security of the system under different strategies, and give a better exchange strategy to enhance the security of the system. In addition, the research work in this article can help design how to further optimize the topology of interdependent sensor networks by reducing the impact of cascading failures.

AB  - Advanced manufacturing solutions, augmented reality, and cloud and big data are technologies pertaining to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions, create new business models, and increase both productivity and firm quality production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. This new perspective, oriented toward social and global well-being, is called Society 5.0. As has happened for all past industrial revolutions, Industry 4.0 will support the transition to a different society, i.e., Society 5.0. In this transition, open innovation and value co-creation can play an important role. The aim of the study was twofold: to examine how Industry 4.0 features and enabling technologies can support the transition to Society 5.0 and to investigate the roles of both open innovation and value co-creation within this transition. A conceptual framework was developed to jointly consider for the first time Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, open innovation, and value co-creation, which are all challenging issues that firms must cope with nowadays. Managers could profit from these insights to design ad hoc strategies in order to benefit from the opportunities emerging from this transition and overcome the main related challenges.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) technology is increasingly pervasive in all aspects of our life and its usage is anticipated to significantly increase in future Smart Cities to support their myriad of revolutionary applications. This paper introduces a new architecture that can support several IoT-enabled smart home use cases, with a specified level of security and privacy preservation. The security threats that may target such an architecture are highlighted along with the cryptographic algorithms that can prevent them. An experimental study is performed to provide more insights about the suitability of several lightweight cryptographic algorithms for use in securing the constrained IoT devices used in the proposed architecture. The obtained results showed that many modern lightweight symmetric cryptography algorithms, as CLEFIA and TRIVIUM, are optimized for hardware implementations and can consume up to 10 times more energy than the legacy techniques when they are implemented in software. Moreover, the experiments results highlight that CLEFIA significantly outperforms TRIVIUM under all of the investigated test cases, and the latter performs 100 times worse than the legacy cryptographic algorithms tested.

TI  - Prediction for Overheating Risk Based on Deep Learning in a Zero Energy Building
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 21
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The Passive House standard has become the standard for many countries in the construction of the Zero Energy Building (ZEB). Korea also adopted the standard and has achieved great success in building energy savings. However, some issues remain with ZEBs in Korea. Among them, this study aims to discuss overheating issues. Field measurements were carried out to analyze the overheating risk for a library built as a ZEB. A data-driven overheating risk prediction model was developed to analyze the overheating risk, requiring only a small amount of data and extending the analysis throughout the year. The main factors causing overheating during both the cooling season and the intermediate seasons are also analyzed in detail. The overheating frequency exceeded 60% of days in July and August, the midsummer season in Korea. Overheating also occurred during the intermediate seasons when air conditioners were off, such as in May and October in Korea. Overheating during the cooling season was caused mainly by unexpected increases in occupancy rate, while overheating in the mid-term was mainly due to an increase in solar irradiation. This is because domestic ZEB standards define the reinforcement of insulation and airtight performance, but there are no standards for solar insolation through windows or for internal heat generation. The results of this study suggest that a fixed performance standard for ZEBs that does not reflect the climate or cultural characteristics of the region in which a ZEB is built may not result in energy savings at the operational stage and may not guarantee the thermal comfort of occupants.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have contributed to advances in Occupational Health and Safety, improving the security of workers. The use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) based on ICTs reduces the risk of accidents in the workplace, thanks to the capacity of the equipment to make decisions on the basis of environmental factors. Paradigms such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) make it possible to generate PPE models feasibly and create devices with more advanced characteristics such as monitoring, sensing the environment and risk detection between others. The working environment is monitored continuously by these models and they notify the employees and their supervisors of any anomalies and threats. This paper presents a smart helmet prototype that monitors the conditions in the workers’ environment and performs a near real-time evaluation of risks. The data collected by sensors is sent to an AI-driven platform for analysis. The training dataset consisted of 11,755 samples and 12 different scenarios. As part of this research, a comparative study of the state-of-the-art models of supervised learning is carried out. Moreover, the use of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is proposed for the detection of possible occupational risks. The data are processed to make them suitable for the CNN and the results are compared against a Static Neural Network (NN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), where the CNN had an accuracy of 92.05% in cross-validation.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 21
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have been used in many studies for ship detection because they can be captured without being affected by time and weather. In recent years, the development of deep learning techniques has facilitated studies on ship detection in SAR images using deep learning techniques. However, because the noise from SAR images can negatively affect the learning of the deep learning model, it is necessary to reduce the noise through preprocessing. In this study, deep learning vessel detection was performed using preprocessed SAR images, and the effects of the preprocessing of the images on deep learning vessel detection were compared and analyzed. Through the preprocessing of SAR images, (1) intensity images, (2) decibel images, and (3) intensity difference and texture images were generated. The M2Det object detection model was used for the deep learning process and preprocessed SAR images. After the object detection model was trained, ship detection was performed using test images. The test results are presented in terms of precision, recall, and average precision (AP), which were 93.18%, 91.11%, and 89.78% for the intensity images, respectively, 94.16%, 94.16%, and 92.34% for the decibel images, respectively, and 97.40%, 94.94%, and 95.55% for the intensity difference and texture images, respectively. From the results, it can be found that the preprocessing of the SAR images can facilitate the deep learning process and improve the ship detection performance. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the development of deep learning-based ship detection techniques in SAR images in the future.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The ability to precisely map urban land use types can significantly aid urban planning and urban system understanding. In recent years, remote sensing images and social sensing data have been frequently used for urban land use mapping. However, there still remains a problem: what is the best basic unit for fusing remote sensing images with social sensing data? The aim of this study is to explore the impact of spatial units on urban land use mapping, with remote sensing images and social sensing data of Shenzhen City, China. Three different basic units were first applied to delineate urban land use types, and for each unit, a word dictionary was built by fusing natural&ndash;physical features from high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images and the socioeconomic semantic features from point of interest (POI) data. The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm and random forest methods were then applied to map the land use of the Futian district&mdash;the core region of Shenzhen. The experiment demonstrates that: (1) No matter what kind of spatial unit, it is beneficial to fuse multisource data to improve the performance. However, when using different spatial units, the importances of features are different. (2) Using block-based spatial units results in the final map looking the best. However, a great challenge of this approach is that the scale is too coarse to handle mixed functional areas. (3) Using grid- and object-based units, the problem of mixed functional areas can be better solved. Additionally, the object-based land use map looks better from our visual interpretation. Accordingly, the results of this study could give other researchers references and advice for future studies.

T2  - ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 11
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Herein, we propose a novel indoor structure extraction (ISE) method that can reconstruct an indoor planar structure with a feature structure map (FSM) and enable indoor robot navigation using a navigation structure map (NSM). To construct the FSM, we first propose a two-staged region growing algorithm to segment the planar feature and to obtain the original planar point cloud. Subsequently, we simplify the planar feature using quadtree segmentation based on cluster fusion. Finally, we perform simple triangulation in the interior and vertex-assignment triangulation in the boundary to accomplish feature reconstruction for the planar structure. The FSM is organized in the form of a mesh model. To construct the NSM, we first propose a novel ground extraction method based on indoor structure analysis under the Manhattan world assumption. It can accurately capture the ground plane in an indoor scene. Subsequently, we establish a passable area map (PAM) within different heights. Finally, a novel-form NSM is established using the original planar point cloud and the PAM. Experiments are performed using three public datasets and one self-collected dataset. The proposed plane segmentation approach is evaluated on two simulation datasets and achieves a recall of approximately 99%, which is 5% higher than that of the traditional plane segmentation method. Furthermore, the triangulation performance of our method compared with the traditional greedy projection triangulation show that our method performs better in terms of feature representation. The experimental results reveal that our ISE method is robust and effective for extracting indoor structures.

AB  - In this study, a low-cost proposed platform for training dynamics (PPTD) is proposed based on operational amplifiers to understand the dynamics and variables of the agricultural tractor John Deere tractor model 4430 to gain autonomy and analyze the behavior of control algorithms proposed in real time by state feedback. The proposed platform uses commercial sensors and interacts with the Arduino Uno and/or Daq-6009 board from National Instruments. A mobile application (APP) was also developed for real-time monitoring of autonomous control signals, the local reference system, and physical and dynamic variables in the tractor; this platform can be used as a mobile alternative applied to a tractor in physically installed form. In the presented case, the PPTD was mounted on a John Deere tractor to test its behavior; moreover, it may be used on other tractor models similarly as established here. The established results of this platform were compared with models established in MATLAB, validating the proposal. All simulations and developments are shared through a web-link as open-source files so that anyone with basic knowledge of electronics and modeling of vehicles can reproduce the proposed platform.

TI  - The Deep 3D Convolutional Multi-Branching Spatial-Temporal-Based Unit Predicting Citywide Traffic Flow
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 21
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Recently, for public safety and traffic management, traffic flow prediction is a crucial task. The citywide traffic flow problem is still a big challenge in big cities because of many complex factors. However, to handle some complex factors, e.g., spatial-temporal and some external factors in the intelligent traffic flow forecasting problem, spatial-temporal data for urban applications (i.e., travel time estimation, trajectory planning, taxi demand, traffic congestion, and the regional rainfall) is inherently stochastic and unpredictable. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based novel model called &ldquo;multi-branching spatial-temporal attention-based long-short term memory residual unit (MBSTALRU)&rdquo; for the citywide traffic flow from lower-level layers to high-level layers, simultaneously. In our work, initially, we have modeled the traffic flow with spatial correlations multiple 3D volume layers and propose the novel multi-branching scheme to control the spatial-temporal features. Our approach is useful for exploring temporal dependencies through the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) multiple branches, which aim to merge the spatial-temporal characteristics of historical data with three-time intervals, namely closeness, daily, and weekly, and we have embedded features by attention-based long-short term memory (LSTM). Then, we capture the correlation between traffic inflow and outflow with residual layers units. In the end, we merge the external factors dynamically to predict citywide traffic flow simultaneously. The simulation results have been performed on two real-world datasets, BJTaxi and NYCBike, which show better performance and effectiveness of the proposed method than previous state-of-the-art models.

AB  - A systematic review of the literature is presented related to the usage of blockchain technology (BCT) for cyber-threats in the context of Industry 4.0. BCT plays a crucial role in creating smart factories and it is recognized as a core technology that triggers a disruptive revolution in Industry 4.0. Beyond security, authentication, asset tracking and the exchange of smart contracts, BCTs allow terminals to exchange information according to mutually agreed rules within a secured manner. Consequently, BCT can play a crucial role in industrial sustainability by preserving the assets and the environment and by enhancing the quality of life of citizens. In this work, a classification of the most important cyber-attacks that occurred in the last decade in Industry 4.0 is proposed based on four classes. The latter classes cover scanning, local to remote, power of root and denial of service (DoS). BCT is also defined and various types belong to BCT are introduced and highlighted. Likewise, BCT protocols and implementations are discussed as well. BCT implementation includes linear structure and directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology. Then, a comparative study of the most relevant works based on BCT in Industry 4.0 is conducted in terms of confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy and multifactor authentication features. Our review shows that the integration of BCT in industry can ensure data confidentiality and integrity and should be enforced to preserve data availability and privacy. Future research directions towards enforcing BCT in the industrial field by considering machine learning, 5G/6G mobile systems and new emergent technologies are presented.

AB  - Mental health is the foundation of health and happiness as well as the basis for an individual&rsquo;s meaningful life. The environmental and social health of a city can measure the mental state of people living in a certain areas, and exploring urban dwellers&rsquo; mental states is an important factor in understanding and better managing cities. New dynamic and granular urban data provide us with a way to determine the environmental factors that affect the mental states of urban dwellers. The characteristics of the maximal information coefficient can identify the linear and nonlinear relationships so that we can fully identify the physical and social environmental factors that affect urban dwellers&rsquo; mental states and further test these relationships through linear and nonlinear modeling. Taking the Greater London as an example, we used data from the London Datastore to discover the environmental factors that had the highest correlation with urban mental health from 2015 to 2017 and to prove that they had a high nonlinear correlation through neural network modeling. This paper aimed to use a data-driven approach to find environmental factors that had not yet received enough attention and to provide a starting point for research by establishing hypotheses for further exploration of the impact of environmental factors on mental health.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a new socioeconomic revolution in which data and immediacy are the main ingredients. IoT generates large datasets on a daily basis but it is currently considered as &ldquo;dark data&rdquo;, i.e., data generated but never analyzed. The efficient analysis of this data is mandatory to create intelligent applications for the next generation of IoT applications that benefits society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are very well suited to identifying hidden patterns and correlations in this data deluge. In particular, clustering algorithms are of the utmost importance for performing exploratory data analysis to identify a set (a.k.a., cluster) of similar objects. Clustering algorithms are computationally heavy workloads and require to be executed on high-performance computing clusters, especially to deal with large datasets. This execution on HPC infrastructures is an energy hungry procedure with additional issues, such as high-latency communications or privacy. Edge computing is a paradigm to enable light-weight computations at the edge of the network that has been proposed recently to solve these issues. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of emergent edge computing architectures that include low-power Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to speed-up these workloads. Our analysis includes performance and power consumption figures of the latest Nvidia&rsquo;s AGX Xavier to compare the energy-performance ratio of these low-cost platforms with a high-performance cloud-based counterpart version. Three different clustering algorithms (i.e., k-means, Fuzzy Minimals (FM), and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)) are designed to be optimally executed on edge and cloud platforms, showing a speed-up factor of up to 11&times; for the GPU code compared to sequential counterpart versions in the edge platforms and energy savings of up to 150% between the edge computing and HPC platforms.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has various network applications and has attracted the interest of many research and industrial communities. Particularly, the number of vulnerable or unprotected IoT devices has drastically increased, along with the amount of suspicious activity, such as IoT botnet and large-scale cyber-attacks. In order to address this security issue, researchers have deployed machine and deep learning methods to detect attacks targeting compromised IoT devices. Despite these efforts, developing an efficient and effective attack detection approach for resource-constrained IoT devices remains a challenging task for the security research community. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective IoT botnet attack detection approach. The proposed approach relies on a Fisher-score-based feature selection method along with a genetic-based extreme gradient boosting (GXGBoost) model in order to determine the most relevant features and to detect IoT botnet attacks. The Fisher score is a representative filter-based feature selection method used to determine significant features and discard irrelevant features through the minimization of intra-class distance and the maximization of inter-class distance. On the other hand, GXGBoost is an optimal and effective model, used to classify the IoT botnet attacks. Several experiments were conducted on a public botnet dataset of IoT devices. The evaluation results obtained using holdout and 10-fold cross-validation techniques showed that the proposed approach had a high detection rate using only three out of the 115 data traffic features and improved the overall performance of the IoT botnet attack detection process.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - With the arrival of the big data era, mobile phone data have attracted increasing attention due to their rich information and high sampling rate. Currently, researchers have conducted various studies using mobile phone data. However, most existing studies have focused on macroscopic analysis, such as urban hot spot detection and crowd behavior analysis over a short period. With the development of the smart city, personal service and management have become very important, so microscopic portraiture research and mobility pattern of an individual based on big data is necessary. Therefore, this paper first proposes a method to depict the individual mobility pattern, and based on the long-term mobile phone data (from 2007 to 2012) of volunteers from Beijing as part of project Geolife conducted by Microsoft Research Asia, more detailed individual portrait depiction analysis is performed. The conclusions are as follows: (1) Based on high-density cluster identification, the behavior trajectories of volunteers are generalized into three types, and among them, the two-point-one-line trajectory and evenly distributed behavior trajectory were more prevalent in Beijing. (2) By integrating with Google Maps data, five volunteers&rsquo; behavior trajectories and the activity patterns of individuals were analyzed in detail, and a portrait depiction method for individual characteristics comprehensively considering their attributes, such as occupation and hobbies, is proposed. (3) Based on analysis of the individual characteristics of some volunteers, it is discovered that two-point-one-line individuals are generally white-collar workers working in enterprises or institutions, and the situation of a single cluster mainly exists among college students and home freelancer. The findings of this study are important for individual classification and prediction in the big data era and can also provide useful guidance for targeted services and individualized management of smart cities.

AB  - Supply chain 4.0 denotes the fourth revolution of supply chain management systems, integrating manufacturing operations with telecommunication and Information Technology processes. Although the overarching aim of supply chain 4.0 is the enhancement of production systems within supply chains, making use of global reach, increasing agility and emerging technology, with the ultimate goal of increasing efficiency, timeliness and profitability, Supply chain 4.0 suffers from unique and emerging operational and cyber risks. Supply chain 4.0 has a lack of semantic standards, poor interoperability, and a dearth of security in the operation of its manufacturing and Information Technology processes. The technologies that underpin supply chain 4.0 include blockchain, smart contracts, applications of Artificial Intelligence, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things and Industrial Internet of Things. Each of these technologies, individually and combined, create cyber security issues that should be addressed. This paper explains the nature of the military supply chains 4.0 and how it uniquely differs from the commercial supply chain, revealing their strengths, weaknesses, dependencies and the fundamental technologies upon which they are built. This encompasses an assessment of the cyber risks and opportunities for research in the field, including consideration of connectivity, sensing and convergence of systems. Current and emerging semantic models related to the standardization, development and safety assurance considerations for implementing new technologies into military supply chains 4.0 are also discussed. This is examined from a holistic standpoint and through technology-specific lenses to determine current states and implications for future research directions.

We present a framework to deploy such services, in which a virtualization layer ensures means to efficiently deliver messages between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) and, on top of that, blockchain technology is used to enable features of data integrity, traceability, and reliability that cannot be furnished by existing consensus and reputation mechanisms. A simulation experiment is included to determine the optimal number of RSUs to be installed as supporting infrastructure in a city.

AB  - Automated vulnerability detection is one of the critical issues in the realm of software security. Existing solutions to this problem are mostly based on features that are defined by human experts and directly lead to missed potential vulnerability. Deep learning is an effective method for automating the extraction of vulnerability characteristics. Our paper proposes intelligent and automated vulnerability detection while using deep representation learning and heterogeneous ensemble learning. Firstly, we transform sample data from source code by removing segments that are unrelated to the vulnerability in order to reduce code analysis and improve detection efficiency in our experiments. Secondly, we represent the sample data as real vectors by pre-training on the corpus and maintaining its semantic information. Thirdly, the vectors are fed to a deep learning model to obtain the features of vulnerability. Lastly, we train a heterogeneous ensemble classifier. We analyze the effectiveness and resource consumption of different network models, pre-training methods, classifiers, and vulnerabilities separately in order to evaluate the detection method. We also compare our approach with some well-known vulnerability detection commercial tools and academic methods. The experimental results show that our proposed method provides improvements in false positive rate, false negative rate, precision, recall, and F1 score.

AB  - With the tremendous increase of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the different service requirements of these IoT applications, machine-type communication (MTC) has attracted considerable attention from both industry and academia. Owing to the prominent advantages of supporting pervasive connectivity and wide area coverage, the cellular network is advocated as the potential wireless solution to realize IoT deployment for MTC, and this creative network paradigm is called the cellular IoT (C-IoT). In this paper, we propose the three-layer structured C-IoT architecture for MTC and review the challenges for deploying green C-IoT. Then, effective strategies for realizing green C-IoT are presented, including the energy efficient and energy harvesting schemes. We put forward several strategies to make the C-IoT run in an energy-saving manner, such as efficient random access and barring mechanisms, self-adapting machine learning predictions, scheduling optimization, resource allocation, fog computing, and group-oriented transmission. As for the energy harvesting schemes, the ambient and dedicated energy harvesting strategies are investigated. Afterwards, we give a detailed case study, which shows the effectiveness of reducing power consumption for the proposed layered C-IoT architecture. Additionally, for real-time and non-real-time applications, the power consumption of different on-off states for MTC devices is discussed.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications and their interference with our daily life tasks have led to a large number of IoT devices and enormous sizes of IoT-generated data. The resources of IoT devices are limited; therefore, the processing and storing IoT data in these devices are inefficient. Traditional cloud-computing resources are used to partially handle some of the IoT resource-limitation issues; however, using the resources in cloud centers leads to other issues, such as latency in time-critical IoT applications. Therefore, edge-cloud-computing technology has recently evolved. This technology allows for data processing and storage at the edge of the network. This paper studies, in-depth, edge-computing architectures for IoT (ECAs-IoT), and then classifies them according to different factors such as data placement, orchestration services, security, and big data. Besides, the paper studies each architecture in depth and compares them according to various features. Additionally, ECAs-IoT is mapped according to two existing IoT layered models, which helps in identifying the capabilities, features, and gaps of every architecture. Moreover, the paper presents the most important limitations of existing ECAs-IoT and recommends solutions to them. Furthermore, this survey details the IoT applications in the edge-computing domain. Lastly, the paper recommends four different scenarios for using ECAs-IoT by IoT applications.

IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In many developed countries with a long history of urbanization, there is an increasing need for automated computer vision (CV)-based inspection to replace conventional labor-intensive visual inspection. This paper proposes a technique for the automated detection of multiple concrete damage based on a state-of-the-art deep learning framework, Mask R-CNN, developed for instance segmentation. The structure of Mask R-CNN, which consists of three stages (region proposal, classification, and segmentation) is optimized for multiple concrete damage detection. The optimized Mask R-CNN is trained with 765 concrete images including cracks, efflorescence, rebar exposure, and spalling. The performance of the trained Mask R-CNN is evaluated with 25 actual test images containing damage as well as environmental objects. Two types of metrics are proposed to measure localization and segmentation performance. On average, 90.41% precision and 90.81% recall are achieved for localization and 87.24% precision and 87.58% recall for segmentation, which indicates the excellent field applicability of the trained Mask R-CNN. This paper also qualitatively discusses the test results by explaining that the architecture of Mask R-CNN that is optimized for general object detection purposes, can be modified to detect long and slender shapes of cracks, rebar exposure, and efflorescence in further research.

AB  - The agriculture sector has held a major role in human societies across the planet throughout history. The rapid evolution in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) strongly affects the structure and the procedures of modern agriculture. Despite the advantages gained from this evolution, there are several existing as well as emerging security threats that can severely impact the agricultural domain. The present paper provides an overview of the main existing and potential threats for agriculture. Initially, the paper presents an overview of the evolution of ICT solutions and how these may be utilized and affect the agriculture sector. It then conducts an extensive literature review on the use of ICT in agriculture, as well as on the associated emerging threats and vulnerabilities. The authors highlight the main ICT innovations, techniques, benefits, threats and mitigation measures by studying the literature on them and by providing a concise discussion on the possible impacts these could have on the agri-sector.

AB  - In order to improve the traffic in large cities and to avoid congestion, advanced methods of detecting and predicting vehicle behaviour are needed. Such methods require complex information regarding the number of vehicles on the roads, their positions, directions, etc. One way to obtain this information is by analyzing overhead images collected by satellites or drones, and extracting information from them through intelligent machine learning models. Thus, in this paper we propose and present a one-stage object detection model for finding vehicles in satellite images using the RetinaNet architecture and the Cars Overhead With Context dataset. By analyzing the results obtained by the proposed model, we show that it has a very good vehicle detection accuracy and a very low detection time, which shows that it can be employed to successfully extract data from real-time satellite or drone data.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Big data applications are currently used in many application domains, ranging from statistical applications to prediction systems and smart cities. However, the quality of these applications is far from perfect, such as functional error, failure and low performance. Consequently, assuring the overall quality for big data applications plays an increasingly important role. This paper aims at summarizing and assessing existing quality assurance (QA) technologies addressing quality issues in big data applications. We have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) by searching major scientific databases, resulting in 83 primary and relevant studies on QA technologies for big data applications. The SLR results reveal the following main findings: (1) the quality attributes that are focused for the quality of big data applications, including correctness, performance, availability, scalability and reliability, and the factors influencing them; (2) the existing implementation-specific QA technologies, including specification, architectural choice and fault tolerance, and the process-specific QA technologies, including analysis, verification, testing, monitoring and fault and failure prediction; (3) existing strengths and limitations of each kind of QA technology; (4) the existing empirical evidence of each QA technology. This study provides a solid foundation for research on QA technologies of big data applications and can help developers of big data applications apply suitable QA technologies.

TI  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Developing Smart Cities Solutions
T2  - Smart Cities

PY  - 2020
VL  - 3
IS  - 4
SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies used in developing smart cities solutions, Machine Learning (ML) and recently Deep Learning (DL), rely more on utilising best representative training datasets and features engineering and less on the available domain expertise. We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of &lsquo;explainable deep learning&rsquo; as a subset of the &lsquo;explainable AI&rsquo; problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project. Monitoring of gullies and drainage in crucial geographical areas susceptible to flooding issues is an important aspect of any flood monitoring solution. Typical solutions for this problem involve the use of cameras to capture images showing the affected areas in real-time with different objects such as leaves, plastic bottles etc., and building a DL-based classifier to detect such objects and classify blockages based on the presence and coverage of these objects in the images. In this work, we uniquely propose an Explainable AI solution using DL and Semantic Web technologies to build a hybrid classifier. In this hybrid classifier, the DL component detects object presence and coverage level and semantic rules designed with close consultation with experts carry out the classification. By using the expert knowledge in the flooding context, our hybrid classifier provides the flexibility on categorising the image using objects and their coverage relationships. The experimental results demonstrated with a real-world use case showed that this hybrid approach of image classification has on average 11% improvement (F-Measure) in image classification performance compared to DL-only classifier. It also has the distinct advantage of integrating experts&rsquo; knowledge on defining the decision-making rules to represent the complex circumstances and using such knowledge to explain the results.

TI  - Economic Granularity Interval in Decision Tree Algorithm Standardization from an Open Innovation Perspective: Towards a Platform for Sustainable Matching
T2  - Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity

PY  - 2020
VL  - 6
IS  - 4
SN  - 2199-8531

AB  - In the context of the application of artificial intelligence in an intellectual property trading platform, the number of demanders and suppliers that exchange scarce resources is growing continuously. Improvement of computational power promotes matching efficiency significantly. It is necessary to greatly reduce energy consumption in order to realize the machine learning process in terminals and microprocessors in edge computing (smart phones, wearable devices, automobiles, IoT devices, etc.) and reduce the resource burden of data centers. Machine learning algorithms generated in an open community lack standardization in practice, and hence require open innovation participation to reduce computing cost, shorten algorithm running time, and improve human-machine collaborative competitiveness. The purpose of this study was to find an economic range of the granularity in a decision tree, a popular machine learning algorithm. This work addresses the research questions of what the economic tree depth interval is and what the corresponding time cost is with increasing granularity given the number of matches. This study also aimed to balance the efficiency and cost via simulation. Results show that the benefit of decreasing the tree search depth brought by the increased evaluation granularity is not linear, which means that, in a given number of candidate matches, the granularity has a definite and relatively economical range. The selection of specific evaluation granularity in this range can obtain a smaller tree depth and avoid the occurrence of low efficiency, which is the excessive increase in the time cost. Hence, the standardization of an AI algorithm is applicable to edge computing scenarios, such as an intellectual property trading platform. The economic granularity interval can not only save computing resource costs but also save AI decision-making time and avoid human decision-maker time cost.

TI  - An Energy Saving Road Sweeper Using Deep Vision for Garbage Detection
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Road sweepers are ubiquitous machines that help preserve our cities cleanliness and health by collecting road garbage and sweeping out dirt from our streets and sidewalks. They are often very mechanical instruments, needing to operate in harsh conditions dealing with all sorts of abandoned trash and natural garbage. They are usually composed of rotating brushes, collector belts and bins, and sometimes water or air streams. All of these mechanical tools are usually high in power demand and strongly subject to wear and tear. Moreover, due to the simple working logic often implied by these cleaning machines, these tools work in an &ldquo;always on&rdquo;/&ldquo;max power&rdquo; state, and any further regulation is left to the pilot. Therefore, adding artificial intelligence able to correctly operate these tools in a semi-automatic way would be greatly beneficial. In this paper, we propose an automatic road garbage detection system, able to locate with great precision most types of road waste, and to correctly instruct a road sweeper in order to handle them. With this simple addition to an existing sweeper, we will be able to save more than 80% electrical power currently absorbed by the cleaning systems and reduce by the same amount brush weariness (prolonging their lifetime). This is done by choosing when to use the brushes and when not to, with how much strength, and where. The only hardware components needed by the system will be a camera and a PC board able to read the camera output (and communicate via CanBus). The software of the system will be mainly composed of a deep neural network for semantic segmentation of images, and a real-time software program to control the sweeper actuators with the appropriate timings. To prove the claimed results, we run extensive tests onboard of such a truck, as well as benchmark tests for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and inference speed of the system.

TI  - Remote Pain Monitoring Using Fog Computing for e-Healthcare: An Efficient Architecture

PY  - 2020

IS  - 22
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The integration of medical signal processing capabilities and advanced sensors into Internet of Things (IoT) devices plays a key role in providing comfort and convenience to human lives. As the number of patients is increasing gradually, providing healthcare facilities to each patient, particularly to the patients located in remote regions, not only has become challenging but also results in several issues, such as: (i) increase in workload on paramedics, (ii) wastage of time, and (iii) accommodation of patients. Therefore, the design of smart healthcare systems has become an important area of research to overcome these above-mentioned issues. Several healthcare applications have been designed using wireless sensor networks (WSNs), cloud computing, and fog computing. Most of the e-healthcare applications are designed using the cloud computing paradigm. Cloud-based architecture introduces high latency while processing huge amounts of data, thus restricting the large-scale implementation of latency-sensitive e-healthcare applications. Fog computing architecture offers processing and storage resources near to the edge of the network, thus, designing e-healthcare applications using the fog computing paradigm is of interest to meet the low latency requirement of such applications. Patients that are minors or are in intensive care units (ICUs) are unable to self-report their pain conditions. The remote healthcare monitoring applications deploy IoT devices with bio-sensors capable of sensing surface electromyogram (sEMG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to monitor the pain condition of such patients. In this article, fog computing architecture is proposed for deploying a remote pain monitoring system. The key motivation for adopting the fog paradigm in our proposed approach is to reduce latency and network consumption. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in minimizing delay and network utilization, simulations were carried out in iFogSim and the results were compared with the cloud-based systems. The results of the simulations carried out in this research indicate that a reduction in both latency and network consumption can be achieved by adopting the proposed approach for implementing a remote pain monitoring system.

Due to the huge number of connected IoT devices, security of such networks and devices is therefore a critical issue. Detection systems assume a crucial role in the cyber-security field: based on innovative algorithms such as machine learning, they are able to identify or predict cyber-attacks, hence to protect the underlying system. Nevertheless, specific datasets are required to train detection models. In this work we present MQTTset, a dataset focused on the MQTT protocol, widely adopted in IoT networks. We present the creation of the dataset, also validating it through the definition of a hypothetical detection system, by combining the legitimate dataset with cyber-attacks against the MQTT network. Obtained results demonstrate how MQTTset can be used to train machine learning models to implement detection systems able to protect IoT contexts.

AB  - The understanding of occupancy patterns has been identified as a key contributor to achieve improvements in energy efficiency in buildings since occupancy information can benefit different systems, such as HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioners), lighting, security, and emergency. This has meant that in the past decade, researchers have focused on improving the precision of occupancy estimation in enclosed spaces. Although several works have been done, one of the less addressed issues, regarding occupancy research, has been the availability of data for contrasting experimental results. Therefore, the main contributions of this work are: (1) the generation of two robust datasets gathered in enclosed spaces (a fitness gym and a living room) labeled with occupancy levels, and (2) the evaluation of three Machine Learning algorithms using different temporal resolutions. The results show that the prediction of 3&ndash;4 occupancy levels using the temperature, humidity, and pressure values provides an accuracy of at least 97%.

AB  - Over the last decade, particular interest in using state-of-the-art emerging technologies for inspection, assessment, and management of civil infrastructures has remarkably increased. Advanced technologies, such as laser scanners, have become a suitable alternative for labor intensive, expensive, and unsafe traditional inspection and maintenance methods, which encourage the increasing use of this technology in construction industry, especially in bridges. This paper aims to provide a thorough mixed scientometric and state-of-the-art review on the application of terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) in bridge engineering and explore investigations and recommendations of researchers in this area. Following the review, more than 1500 research publications were collected, investigated and analyzed through a two-fold literature search published within the last decade from 2010 to 2020. Research trends, consisting of dominated sub-fields, co-occurrence of keywords, network of researchers and their institutions, along with the interaction of research networks, were quantitatively analyzed. Moreover, based on the collected papers, application of TLS in bridge engineering and asset management was reviewed according to four categories including (1) generation of 3D model, (2) quality inspection, (3) structural assessment, and (4) bridge information modeling (BrIM). Finally, the paper identifies the current research gaps, future directions obtained from the quantitative analysis, and in-depth discussions of the collected papers in this area.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The rapid development and spread of communication technologies is now becoming a global information revolution. Customers have a need for communication services, which could be flexibly configured in accordance with their Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements. Realizing the close connection between customer experience and profitability, the service provider has been placing more and more attention on customer experience and QoE. The traditional quality of service management method based on SLA (Service Level Agreement) is not sufficient as a means to provide QoE-related contracts between service providers and customers. The current SLA method is mostly limited and focused on technical aspects of QoS (Quality of Service). Furthermore, they do not follow on the network the principles and semantic approach to the QoS specification for a communication service using QoE parameters. In this paper, we propose a customer-oriented quality of service management method for future IBN (Intent-Based Networking). It is based on a new QoE metric on a scale from 1 to 5, which allows one to take into account the commercial value of e-services for customers. Based on this approach, the network configuration and functionality of network equipment automatically changes depending on customer requirements. To implement the new method of service quality management, an algorithm for routing data packets in the network was developed, taking into account the current load of the forecast path. The algorithm of billing system functioning in conditions of customer-oriented quality management in telecommunication networks has been created. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method of service quality management with the traditional SLA method, we developed a simulation network model with the implementation of two approaches. By conducting a simulation, it was determined that the proposed method gives an average gain of 2&ndash;5 times for the criterion of the number of customers who require high quality of experience of the service.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Recently, various environmental data, such as microdust pollution, temperature, humidity, etc., have been continuously collected by widely deployed Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. Although these data can provide great insight into developing sustainable application services, it is challenging to rapidly retrieve such data, due to their multidimensional properties and huge growth in volume over time. Existing indexing methods for efficiently locating those data expose several problems, such as high administrative cost, spatial overhead, and slow retrieval performance. To mitigate these problems, we propose a novel indexing scheme termed ST-Trie, for efficient retrieval over spatiotemporal IoT environment data. Given IoT sensor data with latitude, longitude, and time, the proposed scheme first converts the three-dimensional attributes to one-dimensional index keys. The scheme then builds a trie-based index, consisting of internal nodes inserted by the converted keys and leaf nodes containing the keys and pointers to actual IoT data. We leverage this index to process various types of queries. In our experiments with three real-world datasets, we show that the proposed ST-Trie index outperforms existing approaches by a substantial margin regarding response time. Furthermore, we show that the query processing performance via ST-Trie also scales very well with an increasing time interval. Finally, we demonstrate that when compressed, the ST-Trie index can significantly reduce its space overhead by approximately a factor of seven.

AB  - In the underwater environment, in order to preserve rare and endangered objects or to eliminate the exotic invasive species that can destroy the ecosystems, it is essential to classify objects and estimate their number. It is very difficult to classify objects and estimate their number. While YOLO shows excellent performance in object recognition, it recognizes objects by processing the images of each frame independently of each other. By accumulating the object classification results from the past frames to the current frame, we propose a method to accurately classify objects, and count their number in sequential video images. This has a high classification probability of 93.94% and 97.06% in the test videos of Bluegill and Largemouth bass, respectively. The proposed method shows very good classification performance in video images taken of the underwater environment.

AB  - The construction industry is experiencing changes in its processes and work methods, and the advancement of new technologies in recent decades has led to a new concept known as Construction 4.0, coined in 2016 in Germany. Since its definition is still diffuse, it was deemed necessary to conduct a review on the publications in this field to grasp how this concept is being understood. For that purpose, a bibliometric analysis was conducted among 260 research articles using seven keywords. The results reveal that the number of publications is growing exponentially, with the USA, the UK, and China being leaders in this field; besides, four technologies are essential to understand Construction 4.0 at present time: 3D printing, big data, virtual reality, and Internet of Things. The results of this review suggest that further reviews should be conducted every 3 years to grasp the rapid evolution of Construction 4.0.

AB  - An efficient and credible approach to road traffic management and prediction is a crucial aspect in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It can strongly influence the development of road structures and projects. It is also essential for route planning and traffic regulations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that combines extreme learning machine (ELM) and ensemble-based techniques to predict the future hourly traffic of a road section in Tangier, a city in the north of Morocco. The model was applied to a real-world historical data set extracted from fixed sensors over a 5-years period. Our approach is based on a type of Single hidden Layer Feed-forward Neural Network (SLFN) known for being a high-speed machine learning algorithm. The model was, then, compared to other well-known algorithms in the prediction literature. Experimental results demonstrated that, according to the most commonly used criteria of error measurements (RMSE, MAE, and MAPE), our model is performing better in terms of prediction accuracy. The use of Akaike&rsquo;s Information Criterion technique (AIC) has also shown that the proposed model has a higher performance.

TI  - Projection of SDGs in Codes of Ethics—Case Study about Lost in Translation

IS  - 4
SN  - 2076-3387

AB  - The United Nations&rsquo; (UN) drive for sustainability culminates in a recent milestone document, Agenda 2030, which sets forth 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Arguably, these SDGs inspire governments more than they do individual businesses and their embracement and measurement at the business level faces a myriad of shortcomings. A case study of internal declaratory documents about sustainability and other ethical commitments, such as codes of ethics, represents a feasible platform to collect fresh and inside primary data about the projection of SDGs in these codes of ethics, and ultimately in the strategy and daily operations of involved businesses. The representativeness of the sample of 30 businesses is ensured by the size of these businesses, their inter-related nature, and significance in the EU. A holistic approach, along with meta-analysis, comparison, and a combination of automatic keyword-based content analysis and of a manual simplified Delphi-method, allows for the addressing of both underlying burning questions&mdash;(i) how SDGs are projected in these codes of ethics and (ii) why not in a perfect manner. The main five findings point out the deep conceptual misunderstandings and shortcomings by businesses, which do not properly work with their codes of ethics, and which could take at least partially the SDG&rsquo;s guidance. These rather pioneering propositions are not conclusive, due to the inherent and inevitable limitations of the performed case study, and need to be verified over time (longitudinally), while expanding the pool of studied codes of ethics.

TI  - Multi-Modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks for Visual Question Answering
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 23
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Visual question answering (VQA) is a multi-modal task involving natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), which requires models to understand of both visual information and textual information simultaneously to predict the correct answer for the input visual image and textual question, and has been widely used in smart and intelligent transport systems, smart city, and other fields. Today, advanced VQA approaches model dense interactions between image regions and question words by designing co-attention mechanisms to achieve better accuracy. However, modeling interactions between each image region and each question word will force the model to calculate irrelevant information, thus causing the model&rsquo;s attention to be distracted. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a novel model called Multi-modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks (MESAN), which concentrates the model&rsquo;s attention by explicitly selecting the parts of the input features that are the most relevant to answering the input question. We consider that this method based on top-k selection can reduce the interference caused by irrelevant information and ultimately help the model to achieve better performance. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset VQA v2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our best single model delivers 70.71% and 71.08% overall accuracy on the test-dev and test-std sets, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can obtain better attended features than other advanced models through attention visualization. Our work proves that the models with sparse attention mechanisms can also achieve competitive results on VQA datasets. We hope that it can promote the development of VQA models and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology related to VQA in various aspects.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the Internet of Things (IoT) + Fog + Cloud architecture, with the unprecedented growth of IoT devices, one of the challenging issues that needs to be tackled is to allocate Fog service providers (FSPs) to IoT devices, especially in a game-theoretic environment. Here, the issue of allocation of FSPs to the IoT devices is sifted with game-theoretic idea so that utility maximizing agents may be benign. In this scenario, we have multiple IoT devices and multiple FSPs, and the IoT devices give preference ordering over the subset of FSPs. Given such a scenario, the goal is to allocate at most one FSP to each of the IoT devices. We propose mechanisms based on the theory of mechanism design without money to allocate FSPs to the IoT devices. The proposed mechanisms have been designed in a flexible manner to address the long and short duration access of the FSPs to the IoT devices. For analytical results, we have proved the economic robustness, and probabilistic analyses have been carried out for allocation of IoT devices to the FSPs. In simulation, mechanism efficiency is laid out under different scenarios with an implementation in Python.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The evolution of intelligent manufacturing has had a profound and lasting effect on the future of global manufacturing. Industry 4.0 based smart factories merge physical and cyber technologies, making the involved technologies more intricate and accurate; improving the performance, quality, controllability, management, and transparency of manufacturing processes in the era of the internet-of-things (IoT). Advanced low-cost sensor technologies are essential for gathering data and utilizing it for effective performance by manufacturing companies and supply chains. Different types of low power/low cost sensors allow for greatly expanded data collection on different devices across the manufacturing processes. While a lot of research has been carried out with a focus on analyzing the performance, processes, and implementation of smart factories, most firms still lack in-depth insight into the difference between traditional and smart factory systems, as well as the wide set of different sensor technologies associated with Industry 4.0. This paper identifies the different available sensor technologies of Industry 4.0, and identifies the differences between traditional and smart factories. In addition, this paper reviews existing research that has been done on the smart factory; and therefore provides a broad overview of the extant literature on smart factories, summarizes the variations between traditional and smart factories, outlines different types of sensors used in a smart factory, and creates an agenda for future research that encompasses the vigorous evolution of Industry 4.0 based smart factories.

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - This research was to conduct a pilot study for two consecutive days in order to assess fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure of an entire population in a community. We aimed to construct a surveillance system by analyzing the observed spatio-temporal variation of exposure. Guro-gu in Seoul, South Korea, was divided into 2,204 scale grids of 100 m each. Hourly exposure concentrations of PM2.5 were modeled by the inverse distance weighted method, using 24 sensor-based air monitoring instruments and the indoor-to-outdoor concentration ratio. Population distribution was assessed using mobile phone network data and indoor residential rates, according to sex and age over time. Exposure concentration, population distribution, and population exposure were visualized to present spatio-temporal variation. The PM2.5 exposure of the entire population of Guro-gu was calculated by population-weighted average exposure concentration. The average concentration of outdoor PM2.5 was 42.1 &micro;g/m3, which was lower than the value of the beta attenuation monitor measured by fixed monitoring station. Indoor concentration was estimated using an indoor-to-outdoor PM2.5 concentration ratio of 0.747. The population-weighted average exposure concentration of PM2.5 was 32.4 &micro;g/m3. Thirty-one percent of the population exceeded the Korean Atmospheric Environmental Standard for PM2.5 over a 24 h average period. The results of this study can be used in a long-term aggregate and cumulative PM2.5 exposure assessment, and as a basis for policy decisions on public health management among policymakers and stakeholders.

TI  - Intelligent Fog-Enabled Smart Healthcare System for Wearable Physiological Parameter Detection
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 12
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Wearable technology plays a key role in smart healthcare applications. Detection and analysis of the physiological data from wearable devices is an essential process in smart healthcare. Physiological data analysis is performed in fog computing to abridge the excess latency introduced by cloud computing. However, the latency for the emergency health status and overloading in fog environment becomes key challenges for smart healthcare. This paper resolves these problems by presenting a novel tri-fog health architecture for physiological parameter detection. The overall system is built upon three layers as wearable layer, intelligent fog layer, and cloud layer. In the first layer, data from the wearable of patients are subjected to fault detection at personal data assistant (PDA). To eliminate fault data, we present the rapid kernel principal component analysis (RK-PCA) algorithm. Then, the faultless data is validated, whether it is duplicate or not, by the data on-looker node in the second layer. To remove data redundancy, we propose a new fuzzy assisted objective optimization by ratio analysis (FaMOORA) algorithm. To timely predict the user&rsquo;s health status, we enable the two-level health hidden Markov model (2L-2HMM) that finds the user&rsquo;s health status from temporal variations in data collected from wearable devices. Finally, the user&rsquo;s health status is detected in the fog layer with the assist of a hybrid machine learning algorithm, namely SpikQ-Net, based on the three major categories of attributes such as behavioral, biomedical, and environment. Upon the user&rsquo;s health status, the immediate action is taken by both cloud and fog layers. To ensure lower response time and timely service, we also present an optimal health off procedure with the aid of the multi-objective spotted hyena optimization (MoSHO) algorithm. The health off method allows offloading between overloaded and underloaded fog nodes. The proposed tri-fog health model is validated by a thorough simulation performed in the iFogSim tool. It shows better achievements in latency (reduced up to 3 ms), execution time (reduced up to 1.7 ms), detection accuracy (improved up to 97%), and system stability (improved up to 96%).

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the advent of the Internet of Everything, more and more devices are connected to the Internet every year. In major cities, in order to maintain normal social order, the demand for deployed cameras is also increasing. In terms of public safety, person Re-Identification (ReID) can play a big role. However, the current methods of ReID are to transfer the collected pedestrian images to the cloud for processing, which will bring huge communication costs. In order to solve this problem, we combine the recently emerging edge computing and use the edge to combine the end devices and the cloud to implement our proposed binarized segmented ResNet. Our method is mainly to divide a complete ResNet into three parts, corresponding to the end devices, the edge, and the cloud. After joint training, the corresponding segmented sub-network is deployed to the corresponding side, and inference is performed to realize ReID. In our experiments, we compared some traditional ReID methods in terms of accuracy and communication overhead. It can be found that our method can greatly reduce the communication cost on the basis of basically not reducing the recognition accuracy of ReID. In general, the communication cost can be reduced by four to eight times.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2020

IS  - 23
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Air pollution is one of the world&rsquo;s most significant challenges. Predicting air pollution is critical for air quality research, as it affects public health. The Air Pollution Index (API) is a convenient tool to describe air quality. Air pollution predictions can provide accurate information on the future pollution situation, effectively controlling air pollution. Governments have expressed growing concern about air pollution due to its global effect on human health and sustainable growth. This paper proposes a novel forecasting model using One-Dimensional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and Exponential Adaptive Gradients (EAG) optimization to predict API for a selected location, Klang, a city in Malaysia. The proposed 1D-CNN&ndash;EAG exponentially accumulates past model gradients to adaptively tune the learning rate and converge in both convex and non-convex areas. We use hourly air pollution data over three years (January 2012 to December 2014) for training. Parameter optimization and model evaluation was accomplished by a grid-search with k-folds cross-validation. Results have confirmed that the proposed approach achieves better prediction accuracy than the benchmark models in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Correlation Coefficient (R-Squared) with values of 2.036, 2.354, 4.214 and 0.966, respectively, and time complexity.

AB  - Nowadays, we are witnessing a shift in the way emergencies are being managed. On the one hand, the availability of big data and the evolution of geographical information systems make it possible to manage and process large quantities of information that can hugely improve the decision-making process. On the other hand, digital humanitarianism has shown to be very beneficial for providing support during emergencies. Despite this, the full potential of combining automatic big data processing and digital humanitarianism approaches has not been fully realized, though there is an initial body of research. This paper aims to provide a reference architecture for emergency management that instantiates the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture to provide a common language and enable the comparison of solutions for solving similar problems.

AB  - With reference to the MeSmart project, the Municipality of Messina is making a great investments to deploy several types of cameras and digital devices across the city for carrying out different tasks related to mobility management, such as traffic flow monitoring, number plate recognition, video surveillance etc. To this aim, exploiting specific devices for each task increases infrastructure and management costs, reducing flexibility. On the contrary, using general-purpose devices customized to accomplish multiple tasks at the same time can be a more efficient solution. Another important approach that can improve the efficiency of mobility services is moving computation tasks at the Edge of the managed system instead of in remote centralized serves, so reducing delays in event detection and processing and making the system more scalable. In this paper, we investigate the adoption of Edge devices connected to high-resolution cameras to create a general-purpose solution for performing different tasks. In particular, we use the Function as a Service (FaaS) paradigm to easily configure the Edge device and set up new services. The key results of our work is deploying versatile, scalable and adaptable systems able to respond to smart city&rsquo;s needs, even if such needs change over time. We tested the proposed solution setting up a vehicle counting solution based on OpenCV, and automatically deploying necessary functions into an Edge device. From experimental results, it results that computing performance at the Edge overtakes the performance of a device specifically designed for vehicle counting under certain conditions and thanks to our reconfigurable functions.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 12
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Existing research recognizes the critical role of quality data in the current big-data and Internet of Things (IoT) era. Quality data has a direct impact on model results and hence business decisions. The growth in the number of IoT-connected devices makes it hard to access data quality using traditional assessments methods. This is exacerbated by the need to share data across different IoT domains as it increases the heterogeneity of the data. Data-shared IoT defines a new perspective of IoT applications which benefit from sharing data among different domains of IoT to create new use-case applications. For example, sharing data between smart transport and smart industry can lead to other use-case applications such as intelligent logistics management and warehouse management. The benefits of such applications, however, can only be achieved if the shared data is of acceptable quality. There are three main practices in data quality (DQ) determination approaches that are restricting their effective use in data-shared platforms: (1) most DQ techniques validate test data against a known quantity considered to be a reference; a gold reference. (2) narrow sets of static metrics are used to describe the quality. Each consumer uses these metrics in similar ways. (3) data quality is evaluated in isolated stages throughout the processing pipeline. Data-shared IoT presents unique challenges; (1) each application and use-case in shared IoT has a unique description of data quality and requires a different set of metrics. This leads to an extensive list of DQ dimensions which are difficult to implement in real-world applications. (2) most data in IoT scenarios does not have a gold reference. (3) factors endangering DQ in shared IoT exist throughout the entire big-data model from data collection to data visualization, and data use. This paper aims to describe data-shared IoT and shared data pools while highlighting the importance of sharing quality data across various domains. The article examines how we can use trust as a measure of quality in data-shared IoT. We conclude that researchers can combine such trust-based techniques with blockchain for secure end-to-end data quality assessment.

AB  - Sustainable socio-economic development can be looked upon from multiple perspectives, but no longer without considering the roles of urban planning, smart cities and eco-innovative entrepreneurial initiatives. In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, ensuring sustainable socio-economic development is definitely challenging, but not impossible if adopting appropriate measures. This research aimed at analyzing the multidimensional facets of entrepreneurial resilience during times of crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania, while focusing on the effects experienced in the wealthiest areas, specific to urban agglomerations. The research method consisted of constructing a composite indicator comprising appropriate components for assessing the level of wealth and &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; of all the Romanian counties. Through the lens of this composite indicator, entrepreneurial resilience was approached in multiple manners according to its diverse forms. Research findings highlight that entrepreneurial resilience tends to be stronger qualitatively and quantitatively in less developed areas than in those that are well developed, mainly due to the lack of entrepreneurial initiatives. Despite being less entrepreneurially resilient, qualitatively, the wealthiest Romanian counties can economically reinvent themselves quicker.

AB  - Since ancient times, agriculture has been one of the most important resources of national development. At a national level, clean energy is a strategic objective of Romania, in accordance with the EC directive 2016/30.11.2016 (&ldquo;Clean Energy for All&rdquo;). At a European level, the European Commission published in January 2019 the &ldquo;Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030&rdquo; strategy, highlighting the strategic importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies. In this context, the synergy between the energy management of a hybrid energy system and blockchain technology, applied to farmers&rsquo; associations, represents a priority research direction in the field of information and communication technology, blockchain, and security. This paper presents the integration of the management of the energy produced by photovoltaic panels owned by farmers&rsquo; association, to support the variable energy demand (necessary for water pumps, charging stations of the electric agricultural machines, the animal farms, and the auxiliary equipment) based on the IoT, DLT, blockchain technologies and smart contracts applied to farmers associations registered as users of the SmartFarm platform.

VL  - 9

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Numerous works focus on the data privacy issue of the Internet of Things (IoT) when training a supervised Machine Learning (ML) classifier. Most of the existing solutions assume that the classifier&rsquo;s training data can be obtained securely from different IoT data providers. The primary concern is data privacy when training a K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) classifier with IoT data from various entities. This paper proposes secure K-NN, which provides a privacy-preserving K-NN training over IoT data. It employs Blockchain technology with a partial homomorphic cryptosystem (PHC) known as Paillier in order to protect all participants (i.e., IoT data analyst C and IoT data provider P) data privacy. When C analyzes the IoT data of P, both participants&rsquo; privacy issue arises and requires a trusted third party. To protect each candidate&rsquo;s privacy and remove the dependency on a third-party, we assemble secure building blocks in secure K-NN based on Blockchain technology. Firstly, a protected data-sharing platform is developed among various P, where encrypted IoT data is registered on a shared ledger. Secondly, the secure polynomial operation (SPO), secure biasing operations (SBO), and secure comparison (SC) are designed using the homomorphic property of Paillier. It shows that secure K-NN does not need any trusted third-party at the time of interaction, and rigorous security analysis demonstrates that secure K-NN protects sensitive data privacy for each P and C. The secure K-NN achieved 97.84%, 82.33%, and 76.33% precisions on BCWD, HDD, and DD datasets. The performance of secure K-NN is precisely similar to the general K-NN and outperforms all the previous state of art methods.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a big data revolution in smart cities dues to multiple disciplines such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, and smart community. However, most services in these areas of smart cities have become data-driven, thus generating big data that require sharing, storing, processing, and analysis, which ultimately consumes massive amounts of energy. The accumulation process of these data from different areas of a smart city is a challenging issue. Therefore, researchers have started aiming at the Internet of vehicles (IoV), in which smart vehicles are equipped with computing and storage capabilities to communicate with surrounding infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a subcategory of IoV as the Internet of buses (IoB), where public buses enable a service as a data carrier in a smart city by introducing a neural network-based sustainable data dissemination system (NESUDA), where opportunistic sensing comprises delay-tolerant data collection, processing and disseminating from one place to another place around the city. The objective was to use public transport to carry data from one place to another and to reduce the traffic from traditional networks and energy consumption. An advanced neural network (NN) algorithm was applied to locate the realistic arrival time of public buses for data allocation. We used the Auckland transport (AT) buses data set from the transport agency to validate our model for the level of accuracy in predicted bus arrival time and scheduled arrival time to disseminate data using bus services. Data were uploaded onto buses as per their dwelling time at each stop and terminals within the coverage area of deployed RSU. The offloading capacity of our proposed data dissemination system showed that it could be utilized to effectively complement traditional data networks. Moreover, the maximum offloading capacity at each parent stop could reach up to 360 GB with a huge saving of energy consumption.

AB  - Continuous exposure to urban noise has been found to be one of the major threats to citizens&rsquo; health. In this regard, several organizations are devoting huge efforts to designing new in-field systems to identify the acoustic sources of these threats to protect those citizens at risk. Typically, these prototype systems are composed of expensive components that limit their large-scale deployment and thus reduce the scope of their measurements. This paper aims to present a highly scalable low-cost distributed infrastructure that features a ubiquitous acoustic sensor network to monitor urban sounds. It takes advantage of (1) low-cost microphones deployed in a redundant topology to improve their individual performance when identifying the sound source, (2) a deep-learning algorithm for sound recognition, (3) a distributed data-processing middleware to reach consensus on the sound identification, and (4) a custom planar antenna with an almost isotropic radiation pattern for the proper node communication. This enables practitioners to acoustically populate urban spaces and provide a reliable view of noises occurring in real time. The city of Barcelona (Spain) and the UrbanSound8K dataset have been selected to analytically validate the proposed approach. Results obtained in laboratory tests endorse the feasibility of this proposal.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with an increasing popularity and applications in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. Although many of these areas closely relate to the urban context, there is limited understanding of the trending AI technologies and their application areas&mdash;or concepts&mdash;in the urban planning and development fields. Similarly, there is a knowledge gap in how the public perceives AI technologies, their application areas, and the AI-related policies and practices of our cities. This study aims to advance our understanding of the relationship between the key AI technologies (n = 15) and their key application areas (n = 16) in urban planning and development. To this end, this study examines public perceptions of how AI technologies and their application areas in urban planning and development are perceived and utilized in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories. The methodological approach of this study employs the social media analytics method, and conducts sentiment and content analyses of location-based Twitter messages (n = 11,236) from Australia. The results disclose that: (a) digital transformation, innovation, and sustainability are the most popular AI application areas in urban planning and development; (b) drones, automation, robotics, and big data are the most popular AI technologies utilized in urban planning and development, and; (c) achieving the digital transformation and sustainability of cities through the use of AI technologies&mdash;such as big data, automation and robotics&mdash;is the central community discussion topic.

AB  - Human activities generate diverse and sophisticated functional areas and may impact the existing planning of functional areas. Understanding the relationship between human activities and functional areas is key to identifying the real-time urban functional areas based on trajectories. Few previous studies have analyzed the interactive information on humans and regions for functional area identification. The relationship between human activities and residential areas is the most representative for urban functional areas because residential areas cover a wide range and are closely connected with human life. The aim of this paper is to propose the CARA (Commuting Activity and Residential Area) model to quantify the correlation between human activities and urban residential areas. In this model, human activities are represented by hot spots extracted by the Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm while residential areas are represented by POI (point of interest) data. The model shows that human activities and residential areas present a logarithmic relationship. The CARA model is further assessed by retrieving urban residential areas in Tengzhou City from shared e-bike trajectories. Compared with the actual map, the accuracy reaches 83.3%, thus demonstrating the model&rsquo;s reliability and feasibility. This study provides a new method for functional areas identification based on trajectory data, which is helpful for formulating the urban people-oriented policies.

AB  - The interactive development of economic globalization, informatization, marketization, and urbanization has reshaped the urban commercial landscape and society, and poses new requirements for the business environment. New commerce forms that are based on information technology and electronic payment and integrate online and offline forms are growing rapidly in China. However, the relationship between new commerce forms and the business environment has not received sufficient academic attention. Using 29 major cities in China, this paper constructs a new business index system consisting of the following six sub-indexes: the characteristic hotels index, the Starbucks index, the Freshhema index, the concept bookstores index, the smart convenience stores index, and the healthcare and medical examination index. The entropy coupled with the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method was used for quantitative evaluation of urban new business vitality. We found that the Freshhema index and smart convenient store index are the two most important evaluation factors. The relationship between the new business index and the business environment was examined through multiple linear regression (MLR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) analysis. We found that the MLR is not a valid model, and instead, the nonlinear GPR model has good explanatory power for this relationship. The results show that human capital has a more important effect than the economic development level on business vitality. The rise and development of new commercial forms depend on the innovation and optimization of the business environment.

AB  - The reliability in data collection is essential in Smart Farming supported by the Internet of Things (IoT). Several IoT and Fog-based works consider the reliability concept, but they fall short in providing a network&rsquo;s edge mechanisms for detecting and replacing outliers. Making decisions based on inaccurate data can diminish the quality of crops and, consequently, lose money. This paper proposes an approach for providing reliable data collection, which focuses on outlier detection and treatment in IoT-based Smart Farming. Our proposal includes an architecture based on the continuum IoT-Fog-Cloud, which incorporates a mechanism based on Machine Learning to detect outliers and another based on interpolation for inferring data intended to replace outliers. We located the data cleaning at the Fog to Smart Farming applications functioning in the farm operate with reliable data. We evaluate our approach by carrying out a case study in a network based on the proposed architecture and deployed at a Colombian Coffee Smart Farm. Results show our mechanisms achieve high Accuracy, Precision, and Recall as well as low False Alarm Rate and Root Mean Squared Error when detecting and replacing outliers with inferred data. Considering the obtained results, we conclude that our approach provides reliable data collection in Smart Farming.

AB  - The large-scale deployment of pervasive sensors and decentralized computing in modern smart grids is expected to exponentially increase the volume of data exchanged by power system applications. In this context, the research for scalable and flexible methodologies aimed at supporting rapid decisions in a data rich, but information limited environment represents a relevant issue to address. To this aim, this paper investigates the role of Knowledge Discovery from massive Datasets in smart grid computing, exploring its various application fields by considering the power system stakeholder available data and knowledge extraction needs.

In the first part, the authors summarize the most recent activities developed in this field by the Task Force on &ldquo;Enabling Paradigms for High-Performance Computing in Wide Area Monitoring Protective and Control Systems&rdquo; of the IEEE PSOPE Technologies and Innovation Subcommittee. Differently, in the second part, the authors propose the development of a data-driven forecasting methodology, which is modeled by considering the fundamental principles of Knowledge Discovery Process data workflow. Furthermore, the described methodology is applied to solve the load forecasting problem for a complex user case, in order to emphasize the potential role of knowledge discovery in supporting post processing analysis in data-rich environments, as feedback for the improvement of the forecasting performances.

AB  - In recent years, the widespread deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications has contributed to the development of smart cities. A smart city utilizes IoT-enabled technologies, communications and applications to maximize operational efficiency and enhance both the service providers&rsquo; quality of services and people&rsquo;s wellbeing and quality of life. With the growth of smart city networks, however, comes the increased risk of cybersecurity threats and attacks. IoT devices within a smart city network are connected to sensors linked to large cloud servers and are exposed to malicious attacks and threats. Thus, it is important to devise approaches to prevent such attacks and protect IoT devices from failure. In this paper, we explore an attack and anomaly detection technique based on machine learning algorithms (LR, SVM, DT, RF, ANN and KNN) to defend against and mitigate IoT cybersecurity threats in a smart city. Contrary to existing works that have focused on single classifiers, we also explore ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting and stacking to enhance the performance of the detection system. Additionally, we consider an integration of feature selection, cross-validation and multi-class classification for the discussed domain, which has not been well considered in the existing literature. Experimental results with the recent attack dataset demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively identify cyberattacks and the stacking ensemble model outperforms comparable models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score, implying the promise of stacking in this domain.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Human activities embedded in crowdsourced data, such as social media trajectory, represent individual daily styles and patterns, which are valuable in many applications. However, the accurate identification of human activity types (HATs) from social media is challenging, possibly because interactions between posts and users at different time are overlooked. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model that introduces the interactions hidden in social media and synthesizes Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying HAT. The model first characterizes interactions among words, posts, dates, and users, and then derives a Time Gated Human Activity Graph Convolutional Network (TG-HAGCN) to predict the HATs of social media trajectory. To examine the proposed model performance, we built a new dataset including interactions between post content, post time, and users from the open Yelp dataset. Experimental results show that exploiting interactions hidden in social media to recognize HATs achieves state-of-the-art performance with high accuracy. The study indicates that interactions among social media promotes ability of machine learning on social media data mining and intelligent applications, and offers a reference solution for how to fuse multi-type heterogeneous data in social media.

AB  - This study presents a method to estimate the solar energy potential based on 3D data taken from unmanned aerial devices. The solar energy potential on the roof of a building was estimated before the placement of solar panels using photogrammetric data analyzed in a geographic information system, and the predictions were compared with the data recorded after installation. The areas of the roofs were chosen using digital surface models and the hemispherical viewshed algorithm, considering how the solar radiation on the roof surface would be affected by the orientation of the surface with respect to the sun, the shade of trees, surrounding objects, topography, and the atmospheric conditions. The results show that the efficiency percentages of the panels and the data modeled by the proposed method from surface models are very similar to the theoretical efficiency of the panels. Radiation potential can be estimated from photogrammetric data and a 3D model in great detail and at low cost. This method allows the estimation of solar potential as well as the optimization of the location and orientation of solar panels.

Effective diagnosis and feedbacks of remote health data pose significant challenges due to streaming data, high noise, network latency and user privacy. Therefore, we explore efficient edge and cloud design to maintain electrocardiogram classification performance while reducing the communication cost. These contributions include: (1) We introduce a hybrid smart medical architecture named edge convolutional neural networks (EdgeCNN) that balances the capability of edge and cloud computing to address the issue for agile learning of healthcare data from IoT devices. (2) We present an effective deep learning model for electrocardiogram (ECG) inference, which can be deployed to run on edge smart devices for low-latency diagnosis. (3) We design a data enhancement method for ECG based on deep convolutional generative adversarial network to expand ECG data volume. (4) We carried out experiments on two representative datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the deep learning model of ECG classification based on EdgeCNN. EdgeCNN shows superior to traditional cloud medical systems in terms of network Input/Output (I/O) pressure, architecture cost and system high availability. The deep learning model not only ensures high diagnostic accuracy, but also has advantages in aspect of inference time, storage, running memory and power consumption.

AB  - Urban systems involve a multitude of closely intertwined components, which are more measurable than before due to new sensors, data collection, and spatio-temporal analysis methods. Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the &lsquo;forest&rsquo; of data, and to miss the &lsquo;trees&rsquo; of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole &lsquo;forest&rsquo; of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Home Automation Systems (HAS) attracted much attention during the last decade due to the developments in new wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth 4.0, 5G, WiFi 6, etc. In order to enable automation as a service in smart homes, a number of challenges must be addressed, such as fulfilling the electrical energy demands, scheduling the operational time of appliances, applying machine learning models in real-time, optimal human appliances interaction, etc. In order to address the aforementioned challenges and control the wastage of energy due to the lifestyle of the home users, we propose a system for automatically controlling the energy consumption by employing machine and deep learning techniques to smart home networks. The proposed system works in three phases, (1) feature extraction and classification based on 1-dimensional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (1D-DCNN) which extract important energy patterns from the historic energy data, (2) a load forecasting system based on Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to forecast the load based on the extracted features in phase 1 and (3) a scheduling algorithm based on the forecasted data obtained from phase 2 is designed to schedule the operational time of smart home appliances. The proposed scheme efficiently automates the smart home appliances to consume less energy while adapting to the lifestyle of smart home users. The validation of the proposed scheme is tested with a number of simulation scenarios incorporating datasets from authentic data sources. The simulation results show that the proposed smart home automation system can be a game-changer in fulfilling the energy demands of the home users without installing renewable and other energy sources in the future.

AB  - Activity recognition can provide useful information about an older individual&rsquo;s activity level and encourage older people to become more active to live longer in good health. This study aimed to develop an activity recognition algorithm for smartphone accelerometry data of older people. Deep learning algorithms, including convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), were evaluated in this study. Smartphone accelerometry data of free-living activities, performed by 53 older people (83.8 &plusmn; 3.8 years; 38 male) under standardized circumstances, were classified into lying, sitting, standing, transition, walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. A 1D CNN, a multichannel CNN, a CNN-LSTM, and a multichannel CNN-LSTM model were tested. The models were compared on accuracy and computational efficiency. Results show that the multichannel CNN-LSTM model achieved the best classification results, with an 81.1% accuracy and an acceptable model and time complexity. Specifically, the accuracy was 67.0% for lying, 70.7% for sitting, 88.4% for standing, 78.2% for transitions, 88.7% for walking, 65.7% for walking downstairs, and 68.7% for walking upstairs. The findings indicated that the multichannel CNN-LSTM model was feasible for smartphone-based activity recognition in older people.

AB  - Recently, developing countries have steadily been pushing for the construction of stream-oriented smart cities, breaking away from the existing old-town-centered development in the past. Due to the accelerating effects of climate change along with such urbanization, it is imperative for urban rivers to establish a flood warning system that can predict the amount of high flow rates of accuracy in engineering, compared to using the existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models for disaster prevention. In this study, in the case of streams where missing data existed or only small observations were obtained, the variation in flow rates could be predicted with only the appropriate deep learning models, using only limited time series flow data. In addition, the selected deep learning model allowed the minimum number of input learning data to be determined. In this study, the time series flow rates were predicted by applying the deep learning models to the Han River, which is a highly urbanized stream that flows through the capital of Korea, Seoul and has a large seasonal variation in the flow rate. The deep learning models used are Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Sequence lengths for time series runoff data were determined first to assess the accuracy and applicability of the deep learning models. By analyzing the forecast results of the outflow data of the Han River, sequence length for 14 days was appropriate in terms of the predicted accuracy of the model. In addition, the GRU model is effective for deep learning models that use time series data of the region with large fluctuations in flow rates, such as the Han River. Furthermore, through this study, it was possible to propose the minimum number of training data that could provide flood warning system with an effective flood forecasting system although the number of input data such as flow rates secured in new towns developed around rivers was insufficient.

AB  - Advancement of accurate models for predicting real estate price is of utmost importance for urban development and several critical economic functions. Due to the significant uncertainties and dynamic variables, modeling real estate has been studied as complex systems. In this study, a novel machine learning method is proposed to tackle real estate modeling complexity. Call detail records (CDR) provides excellent opportunities for in-depth investigation of the mobility characterization. This study explores the CDR potential for predicting the real estate price with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). Several essential mobility entropy factors, including dweller entropy, dweller gyration, workers’ entropy, worker gyration, dwellers’ work distance, and workers’ home distance, are used as input variables. The prediction model is developed using the machine learning method of multi-layered perceptron (MLP) trained with the evolutionary algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO). Model performance is evaluated using mean square error (MSE), sustainability index (SI), and Willmott’s index (WI). The proposed model showed promising results revealing that the workers’ entropy and the dwellers’ work distances directly influence the real estate price. However, the dweller gyration, dweller entropy, workers’ gyration, and the workers’ home had a minimum effect on the price. Furthermore, it is shown that the flow of activities and entropy of mobility are often associated with the regions with lower real estate prices.

AB  - Monitoring the distribution of vehicles across the city is of great importance for urban traffic control. In particular, information on the number of vehicles entering and leaving a city, or moving between urban areas, gives a valuable estimate on potential bottlenecks and congestions. The possibility of predicting such flows in advance is even more beneficial, allowing for timely traffic management strategies and targeted congestion warnings. Our work is inserted in the context of short-term forecasting, aiming to predict rapid changes and sudden variations in the traffic volume, beyond the general trend. Moreover, it concurrently targets multiple locations in the city, providing an instant prediction outcome comprising the future distribution of vehicles across several urban locations. Specifically, we propose a multi-target deep learning regressor for simultaneous predictions of traffic volumes, in multiple entry and exit points among city neighborhoods. The experiment focuses on an hourly forecasting of the amount of vehicles accessing and moving between New York City neighborhoods through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) bridges and tunnels. By leveraging a single training process for all location points, and an instant one-step volume inference for every location at each time update, our sequential modeling approach is able to grasp rapid variations in the time series and process the collective information of all entry and exit points, whose distinct predicted values are outputted at once. The multi-target model, based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network layers, was tested on a real-world dataset, achieving an average prediction error of 7% and demonstrating its feasibility for short-term spatially-distributed urban traffic forecasting.

AB  - In the last few years, with the exponential diffusion of smartphones, services for turn-by-turn navigation have seen a surge in popularity. Current solutions available in the market allow the user to select via an interface the desired transportation mode, for which an optimal route is then computed. Automatically recognizing the transportation system that the user is travelling by allows to dynamically control, and consequently update, the route proposed to the user. Such a dynamic approach is an enabling technology for multi-modal transportation planners, in which the optimal path and its associated transportation solutions are updated in real-time based on data coming from (i) distributed sensors (e.g., smart traffic lights, road congestion sensors, etc.); (ii) service providers (e.g., car-sharing availability, bus waiting time, etc.); and (iii) the user&rsquo;s own device, in compliance with the development of smart cities envisaged by the 5G architecture. In this paper, we present a series of Machine Learning approaches for real-time Transportation Mode Recognition and we report their performance difference in our field tests. Several Machine Learning-based classifiers, including Deep Neural Networks, built on both statistical feature extraction and raw data analysis are presented and compared in this paper; the result analysis also highlights which features are proven to be the most informative ones for the classification.

TI  - Robust Building Extraction for High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images with Self-Attention Network

VL  - 20
IS  - 24
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Building extraction from high spatial resolution remote sensing images is a hot spot in the field of remote sensing applications and computer vision. This paper presents a semantic segmentation model, which is a supervised method, named Pyramid Self-Attention Network (PISANet). Its structure is simple, because it contains only two parts: one is the backbone of the network, which is used to learn the local features (short distance context information around the pixel) of buildings from the image; the other part is the pyramid self-attention module, which is used to obtain the global features (long distance context information with other pixels in the image) and the comprehensive features (includes color, texture, geometric and high-level semantic feature) of the building. The network is an end-to-end approach. In the training stage, the input is the remote sensing image and corresponding label, and the output is probability map (the probability that each pixel is or is not building). In the prediction stage, the input is the remote sensing image, and the output is the extraction result of the building. The complexity of the network structure was reduced so that it is easy to implement. The proposed PISANet was tested on two datasets. The result shows that the overall accuracy reached 94.50 and 96.15%, the intersection-over-union reached 77.45 and 87.97%, and F1 index reached 87.27 and 93.55%, respectively. In experiments on different datasets, PISANet obtained high overall accuracy, low error rate and improved integrity of individual buildings.

AB  - In this work, an exhaustive revision is given of the literature associated with advanced information and communication technologies in agriculture within a window of 25 years using bibliometric tools enabled to detect of the main actors, structure, and dynamics in the scientific papers. The main findings are a trend of growth in the dynamics of publications associated with advanced information and communication technologies in agriculture productivity. Another assertion is that countries, like the USA, China, and Brazil, stand out in many publications due to allocating more resources to research, development, and agricultural productivity. In addition, the collaboration networks between countries are frequently in regions with closer cultural and idiomatic ties; additionally, terms&rsquo; occurrence are obtained with Louvain algorithm predominating four clusters: precision agriculture, smart agriculture, remote sensing, and climate smart agriculture. Finally, the thematic-map characterization with Callon&rsquo;s density and centrality is applied in three periods. The first period of thematic analysis shows a transition in detecting the variability of a nutrient, such as nitrogen, through the help of immature georeferenced techniques, towards greater remote sensing involvement. In the transition from the second to the third stage, the maturation of technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, wireless sensor networks, and the machine learning area, is observed.

AB  - Air pollution is becoming a rising and serious environmental problem, especially in urban areas affected by an increasing migration rate. The large availability of sensor data enables the adoption of analytical tools to provide decision support capabilities. Employing sensors facilitates air pollution monitoring, but the lack of predictive capability limits such systems&rsquo; potential in practical scenarios. On the other hand, forecasting methods offer the opportunity to predict the future pollution in specific areas, potentially suggesting useful preventive measures. To date, many works tackled the problem of air pollution forecasting, most of which are based on sequence models. These models are trained with raw pollution data and are subsequently utilized to make predictions. This paper proposes a novel approach evaluating four different architectures that utilize camera images to estimate the air pollution in those areas. These images are further enhanced with weather data to boost the classification accuracy. The proposed approach exploits generative adversarial networks combined with data augmentation techniques to mitigate the class imbalance problem. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves robust accuracy of up to 0.88, which is comparable to sequence models and conventional models that utilize air pollution data. This is a remarkable result considering that the historic air pollution data is directly related to the output&mdash;future air pollution data, whereas the proposed architecture uses camera images to recognize the air pollution&mdash;which is an inherently much more difficult problem.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - During the last decade, the Internet of Things acted as catalyst for the big data phenomenon. As result, modern edge devices can access a huge amount of data that can be exploited to build useful services. In such a context, artificial intelligence has a key role to develop intelligent systems (e.g., intelligent cyber physical systems) that create a connecting bridge with the physical world. However, as time goes by, machine and deep learning applications are becoming more complex, requiring increasing amounts of data and training time, which makes the use of centralized approaches unsuitable. Federated learning is an emerging paradigm which enables the cooperation of edge devices to learn a shared model (while keeping private their training data), thereby abating the training time. Although federated learning is a promising technique, its implementation is difficult and brings a lot of challenges. In this paper, we present an extension of Stack4Things, a cloud platform developed in our department; leveraging its functionalities, we enabled the deployment of federated learning on edge devices without caring their heterogeneity. Experimental results show a comparison with a centralized approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of both training time and model accuracy.

AB  - With the Industry 4.0 paradigm comes the convergence of the Internet Technologies and Operational Technologies, and concepts, such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), cloud manufacturing, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and so on. These concepts bring industries into the big data era and allow for them to have access to potentially useful information in order to optimise the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE); however, most European industries still rely on the Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) model, where the production systems run as independent systems (i.e., without any communication with the upper levels). Those production systems are controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller, in which a static and rigid program is implemented. This program is static and rigid in a sense that the programmed routines cannot evolve over the time unless a human modifies it. However, to go further in terms of flexibility, we are convinced that it requires moving away from the aforementioned old-fashioned and rigid automation to a ML-based automation, i.e., where the control itself is based on the decisions that were taken by ML algorithms. In order to verify this, we applied a time series classification method on a scale model of a factory using real industrial controllers, and widened the variety of parts the production line has to treat. This study shows that satisfactory results can be obtained only at the expense of the human expertise (i.e., in the industrial process and in the ML process).

AB  - The significant advances in wireless networks in the past decade have made a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) use cases possible, greatly facilitating many operations in our daily lives. IoT is only expected to grow with 5G and beyond networks, which will primarily rely on software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization for achieving the promised quality of service. The prevalence of IoT and the large attack surface that it has created calls for SDN-based intelligent security solutions that achieve real-time, automated intrusion detection and mitigation. In this paper, we propose a real-time intrusion detection and mitigation solution for SDN, which aims to provide autonomous security in the high-traffic IoT networks of the 5G and beyond era, while achieving a high degree of interpretability by human experts. The proposed approach is built upon automated flow feature extraction and classification of flows while using random forest classifiers at the SDN application layer. We present an SDN-specific dataset that we generated for IoT and provide results on the accuracy of intrusion detection in addition to performance results in the presence and absence of our proposed security mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed security approach is promising for achieving real-time, highly accurate detection and mitigation of attacks in SDN-managed IoT networks.

AB  - Urban mobility plays a key role in the ecosystems of complex smart cities. It is considered a key factor in enabling cities to become more intelligent, which highlights the importance of identifying the drivers that improve the intelligence of cities. In this study, we investigate the main drivers with the potential to increase urban mobility intelligence and assign them a priority. Following on from a systematic review of the literature, we conducted broad and detailed bibliographic research based on the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). We also surveyed 181 professionals working in the field concerned to confirm the importance of different drivers and assign them a level of priority. The results show that 27 drivers identified in the literature were considered important, of which seven, related to city governance and technical solutions, were considered the most important to increase urban mobility intelligence.

AB  - The semantic segmentation of a brain tumor is of paramount importance for its treatment and prevention. Recently, researches have proposed various neural network-based architectures to improve the performance of segmentation of brain tumor sub-regions. Brain tumor segmentation, being a challenging area of research, requires improvement in its performance. This paper proposes a 2D image segmentation method, BU-Net, to contribute to brain tumor segmentation research. Residual extended skip (RES) and wide context (WC) are used along with the customized loss function in the baseline U-Net architecture. The modifications contribute by finding more diverse features, by increasing the valid receptive field. The contextual information is extracted with the aggregating features to get better segmentation performance. The proposed BU-Net was evaluated on the high-grade glioma (HGG) datasets of the BraTS2017 Challenge&mdash;the test datasets of the BraTS 2017 and 2018 Challenge datasets. Three major labels to segmented were tumor core (TC), whole tumor (WT), and enhancing core (EC). To compare the performance quantitatively, the dice score was utilized. The proposed BU-Net outperformed the existing state-of-the-art techniques. The high performing BU-Net can have a great contribution to researchers from the field of bioinformatics and medicine.

AB  - Enhancement of Cultural Heritage such as historical images is very crucial to safeguard the diversity of cultures. Automated colorization of black and white images has been subject to extensive research through computer vision and machine learning techniques. Our research addresses the problem of generating a plausible colored photograph of ancient, historically black, and white images of Nepal using deep learning techniques without direct human intervention. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques in image processing, a feed-forward, deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in combination with Inception- ResnetV2 is being trained by sets of sample images using back-propagation to recognize the pattern in RGB and grayscale values. The trained neural network is then used to predict two a* and b* chroma channels given grayscale, L channel of test images. CNN vividly colorizes images with the help of the fusion layer accounting for local features as well as global features. Two objective functions, namely, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), are employed for objective quality assessment between the estimated color image and its ground truth. The model is trained on the dataset created by ourselves with 1.2 K historical images comprised of old and ancient photographs of Nepal, each having 256 &times; 256 resolution. The loss i.e., MSE, PSNR, and accuracy of the model are found to be 6.08%, 34.65 dB, and 75.23%, respectively. Other than presenting the training results, the public acceptance or subjective validation of the generated images is assessed by means of a user study where the model shows 41.71% of naturalness while evaluating colorization results.

TI  - Sensing Occupancy through Software: Smart Parking Proof of Concept
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 12
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In order to detect the vehicle presence in parking slots, different approaches have been utilized, which range from image recognition to sensing via detection nodes. The last one is usually based on getting the presence data from one or more sensors (commonly magnetic or IR-based), controlled and processed by a micro-controller that sends the data through radio interface. Consequently, given nodes have multiple components, adequate software is required for its control and state-machine to communicate its status to the receiver. This paper presents an alternative, cost-effective beacon-based mechanism for sensing the vehicle presence. It is based on the well-known effect that, once the metallic obstacle (i.e., vehicle) is on top of the sensing node, the signal strength will be attenuated, while the same shall be recognized at the receiver side. Therefore, the signal strength change conveys the information regarding the presence. Algorithms processing signal strength change at the receiver side to estimate the presence are required due to the stochastic nature of signal strength parameters. In order to prove the concept, experimental setup based on LoRa-based parking sensors was used to gather occupancy/signal strength data. In order to extract the information of presence, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was employed with accuracy of up to 96%, while the Neural Network (NN) approach reaches an accuracy of up to 97%. The given approach reduces the costs of the sensor production by at least 50%.

TI  - Hybrid Deep Learning Model Based Indoor Positioning Using Wi-Fi RSSI Heat Maps for Autonomous Applications
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Positioning using Wi-Fi received signal strength indication (RSSI) signals is an effective method for identifying the user positions in an indoor scenario. Wi-Fi RSSI signals in an autonomous system can be easily used for vehicle tracking in underground parking. In Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning, the positioning system estimates the signal strength of the access points (APs) to the receiver and identifies the user&rsquo;s indoor positions. The existing Wi-Fi RSSI based positioning systems use raw RSSI signals obtained from APs and estimate the user positions. These raw RSSI signals can easily fluctuate and be interfered with by the indoor channel conditions. This signal interference in the indoor channel condition reduces localization performance of these existing Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning systems. To enhance their performance and reduce the positioning error, we propose a hybrid deep learning model (HDLM) based indoor positioning system. The proposed HDLM based positioning system uses RSSI heat maps instead of raw RSSI signals from APs. This results in better localization performance for Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning systems. When compared to the existing Wi-Fi RSSI based positioning technologies such as fingerprint, trilateration, and Wi-Fi fusion approaches, the proposed approach achieves reasonably better positioning results for indoor localization. The experiment results show that a combination of convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM) used in the proposed HDLM outperforms other deep learning models and gives a smaller localization error than conventional Wi-Fi RSSI signal based localization approaches. From the experiment result analysis, the proposed system can be easily implemented for autonomous applications.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - This paper uses a neural network approach transformer of taxi driver behavior to predict the next destination with geographical factors. The problem of predicting the next destination is a well-studied application of human mobility, for reducing traffic congestion and optimizing the electronic dispatching system&rsquo;s performance. According to the Intelligent Transport System (ITS), this kind of task is usually modeled as a multi-class problem. We propose the novel model Deep Wide Spatial-Temporal-Based Transformer Networks (DWSTTNs). In our approach, the encoder and decoder are the transformer&rsquo;s primary units; with the help of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN), we encode the geographical information based on visited semantic locations. In particular, we trained our model for the exact longitude and latitude coordinates to predict the next destination. The benefit in the real world of this kind of research is to reduce the customer waiting time for a ride and driver waiting time to pick up a customer. Taxi companies can also optimize their management to improve their company&rsquo;s service, while urban transport planner can use this information to better plan the urban traffic. We conducted extensive experiments on two real-word datasets, Porto and Manhattan, and the performance was improved compared to the previous models.

AB  - During the past few decades, the need to intervene in underwater scenarios has grown due to the increasing necessity to perform tasks like underwater infrastructure inspection and maintenance or archaeology and geology exploration. In the last few years, the usage of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) has eased the workload and risks of such interventions. To automate these tasks, the AUVs have to gather the information of their surroundings, interpret it and make decisions based on it. The two main perception modalities used at close range are laser and video. In this paper, we propose the usage of a deep neural network to recognise pipes and valves in multiple underwater scenarios, using 3D RGB point cloud information provided by a stereo camera. We generate a diverse and rich dataset for the network training and testing, assessing the effect of a broad selection of hyperparameters and values. Results show F1-scores of up to 97.2% for a test set containing images with similar characteristics to the training set and up to 89.3% for a secondary test set containing images taken at different environments and with distinct characteristics from the training set. This work demonstrates the validity and robust training of the PointNet neural in underwater scenarios and its applicability for AUV intervention tasks.

AB  - Interpersonal trust mediates multiple socio-technical systems and has implications for personal and societal well-being. Consequently, it is crucial to devise novel machine learning methods to infer interpersonal trust automatically using mobile sensor-based behavioral data. Considering that social relationships are often affected by neighboring relationships within the same network, this work proposes using a novel neighbor-aware deep learning architecture (NADAL) to enhance the inference of interpersonal trust scores. Based on analysis of call, SMS, and Bluetooth interaction data from a one-year field study involving 130 participants, we report that: (1) adding information about neighboring relationships improves trust score prediction in both shallow and deep learning approaches; and (2) a custom-designed neighbor-aware deep learning architecture outperforms a baseline feature concatenation based deep learning approach. The results obtained at interpersonal trust prediction are promising and have multiple implications for trust-aware applications in the emerging social internet of things.

AB  - To safely protect workplaces and the workforce during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, a scalable integrated sensing solution is required in order to offer real-time situational awareness and early warnings for decision-makers. However, an information-based solution for industry reopening is ineffective when the necessary operational information is locked up in disparate real-time data silos. There is a lot of ongoing effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic using different combinations of low-cost, location-based contact tracing, and sensing technologies. These ad hoc Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for COVID-19 were developed using different data models and protocols without an interoperable way to interconnect these heterogeneous systems and exchange data on people and place interactions. This research aims to design and develop an interoperable Internet of COVID-19 Things (IoCT) architecture that is able to exchange, aggregate, and reuse disparate IoT sensor data sources in order for informed decisions to be made after understanding the real-time risks in workplaces based on person-to-place interactions. The IoCT architecture is based on the Sensor Web paradigm that connects various Things, Sensors, and Datastreams with an indoor geospatial data model. This paper presents a study of what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first real-world integrated implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) and IndoorGML standards to calculate the risk of COVID-19 online using a workplace reopening case study. The proposed IoCT offers a new open standard-based information model, architecture, methodologies, and software tools that enable the interoperability of disparate COVID-19 monitoring systems with finer spatial-temporal granularity. A workplace cleaning use case was developed in order to demonstrate the capabilities of this proposed IoCT architecture.

AB  - The colossal increase in environmental pollution and degradation, resulting in ecological imbalance, is an eye-catching concern in the contemporary era. Moreover, the proliferation in the development of smart cities across the globe necessitates the emergence of a robust smart waste management system for proper waste segregation based on its biodegradability. The present work investigates a novel approach for waste segregation for its effective recycling and disposal by utilizing a deep learning strategy. The YOLOv3 algorithm has been utilized in the Darknet neural network framework to train a self-made dataset. The network has been trained for 6 object classes (namely: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic and organic waste). Moreover, for comparative assessment, the detection task has also been performed using YOLOv3-tiny to validate the competence of the YOLOv3 algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed YOLOv3 methodology yields satisfactory generalization capability for all the classes with a variety of waste items.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The accurate forecasting of the hourly month-ahead electricity consumption represents a very important aspect for non-household electricity consumers and system operators, and at the same time represents a key factor in what regards energy efficiency and achieving sustainable economic, business, and management operations. In this context, we have devised, developed, and validated within the paper an hourly month ahead electricity consumption forecasting method. This method is based on a bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) artificial neural network (ANN) enhanced with a multiple simultaneously decreasing delays approach coupled with function fitting neural networks (FITNETs). The developed method targets the hourly month-ahead total electricity consumption at the level of a commercial center-type consumer and for the hourly month ahead consumption of its refrigerator storage room. The developed approach offers excellent forecasting results, highlighted by the validation stage&rsquo;s results along with the registered performance metrics, namely 0.0495 for the root mean square error (RMSE) performance metric for the total hourly month-ahead electricity consumption and 0.0284 for the refrigerator storage room. We aimed for and managed to attain an hourly month-ahead consumed electricity prediction without experiencing a significant drop in the forecasting accuracy that usually tends to occur after the first two weeks, therefore achieving a reliable method that satisfies the contractor&rsquo;s needs, being able to enhance his/her activity from the economic, business, and management perspectives. Even if the devised, developed, and validated forecasting solution for the hourly consumption targets a commercial center-type consumer, based on its accuracy, this solution can also represent a useful tool for other non-household electricity consumers due to its generalization capability.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) cloud-based applications deliver advanced solutions for smart cities to decrease traffic accidents caused by driver fatigue while driving on the road. Environmental conditions or driver behavior can ultimately lead to serious roadside accidents. In recent years, the authors have developed many low-cost, computerized, driver fatigue detection systems (DFDs) to help drivers, by using multi-sensors, and mobile and cloud-based computing architecture. To promote safe driving, these are the most current emerging platforms that were introduced in the past. In this paper, we reviewed state-of-the-art approaches for predicting unsafe driving styles using three common IoT-based architectures. The novelty of this article is to show major differences among multi-sensors, smartphone-based, and cloud-based architectures in multimodal feature processing. We discussed all of the problems that machine learning techniques faced in recent years, particularly the deep learning (DL) model, to predict driver hypovigilance, especially in terms of these three IoT-based architectures. Moreover, we performed state-of-the-art comparisons by using driving simulators to incorporate multimodal features of the driver. We also mention online data sources in this article to test and train network architecture in the field of DFDs on public available multimodal datasets. These comparisons assist other authors to continue future research in this domain. To evaluate the performance, we mention the major problems in these three architectures to help researchers use the best IoT-based architecture for detecting DFDs in a real-time environment. Moreover, the important factors of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) and 5th generation (5G) networks are analyzed in the context of deep learning architecture to improve the response time of DFD systems. Lastly, it is concluded that there is a research gap when it comes to implementing the DFD systems on MEC and 5G technologies by using multimodal features and DL architecture.

AB  - Ensuring the confidentiality of private data stored in our technological devices is a fundamental aspect for protecting our personal and professional information. Authentication procedures are among the main methods used to achieve this protection and, typically, are implemented only when accessing the device. Nevertheless, in many occasions it is necessary to carry out user authentication in a continuous manner to guarantee an allowed use of the device while protecting authentication data. In this work, we first review the state of the art of Continuous Authentication (CA), User Profiling (UP), and related biometric databases. Secondly, we summarize the privacy-preserving methods employed to protect the security of sensor-based data used to conduct user authentication, and some practical examples of their utilization. The analysis of the literature of these topics reveals the importance of sensor-based data to protect personal and professional information, as well as the need for exploring a combination of more biometric features with privacy-preserving approaches.

AB  - Providing citizens with the ability to move around in an accessible way is a requirement for all cities today. However, modeling city infrastructures so that accessible routes can be computed is a challenge because it involves collecting information from multiple, large-scale and heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we propose and validate the architecture of an information system that creates an accessibility data model for cities by ingesting data from different types of sources and provides an application that can be used by people with different abilities to compute accessible routes. The article describes the processes that allow building a network of pedestrian infrastructures from the OpenStreetMap information (i.e., sidewalks and pedestrian crossings), improving the network with information extracted obtained from mobile-sensed LiDAR data (i.e., ramps, steps, and pedestrian crossings), detecting obstacles using volunteered information collected from the hardware sensors of the mobile devices of the citizens (i.e., ramps and steps), and detecting accessibility problems with software sensors in social networks (i.e., Twitter). The information system is validated through its application in a case study in the city of Vigo (Spain).

PY  - 2021

IS  - 1
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has seen rapid growth in the development of real-time applications due to its ease of management and cost-effective attributes. However, the balance between optimization of network lifetime and load distribution between sensor nodes is a critical matter for the development of energy-efficient routing solutions. Recently, many solutions have been proposed for constraint-based networks using the cloud paradigm. However, they achieve network scalability with the additional cost of routing overheads and network latency. Moreover, the sensors&rsquo; data is transmitted towards application users over the uncertain medium, which leads to compromised data security and its integrity. Therefore, this work proposes a light-weight secure and energy-efficient fog-based routing (SEFR) protocol to minimize data latency and increase energy management. It exploits the Quality of Service (QoS) factors and facilitates time-sensitive applications with network edges. Moreover, the proposed protocol protects real-time data based on two levels of cryptographic security primitives. In the first level, a lightweight data confidentiality scheme is proposed between the cluster heads and fog nodes, and in the second level, a high-performance asymmetric encryption scheme is proposed among fog and cloud layers. The analysis of simulation-based experiments has proven the significant outcomes of the proposed protocol compared to existing solutions in terms of routing, security, and network management.

AB  - Robotics technology has become increasingly common both for businesses and for private citizens. Primary and secondary schools, as a mirror of societal evolution, have increasingly integrated science, technology, engineering and math concepts into their curricula. Our research questions are: &ldquo;In teaching robotics to primary and secondary school students, which pedagogical-methodological interventions result in better understanding and knowledge in the use of sensors in educational robotics?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;In teaching robotics to primary and secondary school students, which analytical methods related to Learning Analytics processes are proposed to analyze and reflect on students&rsquo; behavior in their learning of concepts and skills of sensors in educational robotics?&rdquo;. To answer these questions, we have carried out a systematic review of the literature in the Web of Science and Scopus databases regarding robotics sensors in primary and secondary education, and Learning Analytics processes. We applied PRISMA methodology and reviewed a total of 24 articles. The results show a consensus about the use of the Learning by Doing and Project-Based Learning methodologies, including their different variations, as the most common methodology for achieving optimal engagement, motivation and performance in students&rsquo; learning. Finally, future lines of research are identified from this study.

TI  - A Computer Vision-Based Occupancy and Equipment Usage Detection Approach for Reducing Building Energy Demand
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Because of extensive variations in occupancy patterns around office space environments and their use of electrical equipment, accurate occupants&rsquo; behaviour detection is valuable for reducing the building energy demand and carbon emissions. Using the collected occupancy information, building energy management system can automatically adjust the operation of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to meet the actual demands in different conditioned spaces in real-time. Existing and commonly used &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; schedules for HVAC systems are not sufficient and cannot adjust based on the dynamic changes in building environments. This study proposes a vision-based occupancy and equipment usage detection method based on deep learning for demand-driven control systems. A model based on region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) was developed, trained and deployed to a camera for real-time detection of occupancy activities and equipment usage. Experiments tests within a case study office room suggested an overall accuracy of 97.32% and 80.80%. In order to predict the energy savings that can be attained using the proposed approach, the case study building was simulated. The simulation results revealed that the heat gains could be over or under predicted when using static or fixed profiles. Based on the set conditions, the equipment and occupancy gains were 65.75% and 32.74% lower when using the deep learning approach. Overall, the study showed the capabilities of the proposed approach in detecting and recognising multiple occupants&rsquo; activities and equipment usage and providing an alternative to estimate the internal heat emissions.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Detection of weeds and crops is the key step for precision spraying using the spraying herbicide robot and precise fertilization for the agriculture machine in the field. On the basis of k-mean clustering image segmentation using color information and connected region analysis, a method combining multi feature fusion and support vector machine (SVM) was proposed to identify and detect the position of corn seedlings and weeds, to reduce the harm of weeds on corn growth, and to achieve accurate fertilization, thereby realizing precise weeding or fertilizing. First, the image dataset for weed and corn seedling classification in the corn seedling stage was established. Second, many different features of corn seedlings and weeds were extracted, and dimensionality was reduced by principal component analysis, including the histogram of oriented gradient feature, rotation invariant local binary pattern (LBP) feature, Hu invariant moment feature, Gabor feature, gray level co-occurrence matrix, and gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix. Then, the classifier training based on SVM was conducted to obtain the recognition model for corn seedlings and weeds. The comprehensive recognition performance of single feature or different fusion strategies for six features is compared and analyzed, and the optimal feature fusion strategy is obtained. Finally, by utilizing the actual corn seedling field images, the proposed weed and corn seedling detection method effect was tested. LAB color space and K-means clustering were used to achieve image segmentation. Connected component analysis was adopted to remove small objects. The previously trained recognition model was utilized to identify and label each connected region to identify and detect weeds and corn seedlings. The experimental results showed that the fusion feature combination of rotation invariant LBP feature and gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix based on SVM classifier obtained the highest classification accuracy and accurately detected all kinds of weeds and corn seedlings. It provided information on weed and crop positions to the spraying herbicide robot for accurate spraying or to the precise fertilization machine for accurate fertilizing.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - In smart city scenarios, the huge proliferation of monitoring cameras scattered in public spaces has posed many challenges to network and processing infrastructure. A few dozen cameras are enough to saturate the city&rsquo;s backbone. In addition, most smart city applications require a real-time response from the system in charge of processing such large-scale video streams. Finding a missing person using facial recognition technology is one of these applications that require immediate action on the place where that person is. In this paper, we tackle these challenges presenting a distributed system for video analytics designed to leverage edge computing capabilities. Our approach encompasses architecture, methods, and algorithms for: (i) dividing the burdensome processing of large-scale video streams into various machine learning tasks; and (ii) deploying these tasks as a workflow of data processing in edge devices equipped with hardware accelerators for neural networks. We also propose the reuse of nodes running tasks shared by multiple applications, e.g., facial recognition, thus improving the system&rsquo;s processing throughput. Simulations showed that, with our algorithm to distribute the workload, the time to process a workflow is about 33% faster than a naive approach.

AB  - In 2016, the Japanese Government publicized an initiative and a call to action for the implementation of a &ldquo;Super Smart Society&rdquo; announced as Society 5.0. The stated goal of Society 5.0 is to meet the various needs of the members of society through the provisioning of goods and services to those who require them, when they are required and in the amount required, thus enabling the citizens to live an active and comfortable life. In spite of its genuine appeal, details of a feasible path to Society 5.0 are conspicuously missing. The first main goal of this survey is to suggest such an implementation path. Specifically, we define a Smart Community as a human-centric entity where technology is used to equip the citizenry with information and services that they can use to inform their decisions. The arbiter of this ecosystem of services is a Marketplace of Services that will reward services aligned with the wants and needs of the citizens, while discouraging the proliferation of those that are not. In the limit, the Smart Community we defined will morph into Society 5.0. At that point, the Marketplace of Services will become a platform for the co-creation of services by a close cooperation between the citizens and their government. The second objective and contribution of this survey paper is to review known technologies that, in our opinion, will play a significant role in the transition to Society 5.0. These technologies will be surveyed in chronological order, as newer technologies often extend old technologies while avoiding their limitations.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) helps several applications that require power control and low cost to achieve long life. The progress of IIoT communications, mainly based on cognitive radio (CR), has been guided to the robust network connectivity. The low power communication is achieved for IIoT sensors applying the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) with the Sigfox, NBIoT, and LoRaWAN technologies. This paper aims to review the various technologies and protocols for industrial IoT applications. A depth of assessment has been achieved by comparing various technologies considering the key terms such as frequency, data rate, power, coverage, mobility, costing, and QoS. This paper provides an assessment of 64 articles published on electricity control problems of IIoT between 2007 and 2020. That prepares a qualitative technique of answering the research questions (RQ): RQ1: &ldquo;How cognitive radio engage with the industrial IoT?&rdquo;, RQ2: &ldquo;What are the Proposed architectures that Support Cognitive Radio LPWAN based IIOT?&rdquo;, and RQ3: What key success factors need to comply for reliable CIIoT support in the industry?&rdquo;. With the systematic literature assessment approach, the effects displayed on the cognitive radio in LPWAN can significantly revolute the commercial IIoT. Thus, researchers are more focused in this regard. The study suggests that the essential factors of design need to be considered to conquer the critical research gaps of the existing LPWAN cognitive-enabled IIoT. A cognitive low energy architecture is brought to ensure efficient and stable communications in a heterogeneous IIoT. It will protect the network layer from offering the customers an efficient platform to rent AI, and various LPWAN technology were explored and investigated.

Magnetoresistive sensing or LR oscillation circuitry are technologies providing the sensors with the competitive advantage which lies in the energy efficiency and low price. There are several chip suppliers on the market who specialize in the development of these sensors. The aim of this paper is to compare available sensors from the viewpoint of their suitability for traffic measurements. A summary of the achieved results is given in the form of the score for each sensor. The introduced sensor chart should provide the audience with knowledge about pros and cons of sensors, especially if intended for the purposes of road traffic surveillance.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper compares the operation of a decentralized Nash bargaining traffic signal controller (DNB) to the operation of state-of-the-art adaptive and gating traffic signal control. Perimeter control (gating), based on the network fundamental diagram (NFD), was applied on the borders of a protected urban network (PN) to prevent and/or disperse traffic congestion. The operation of gating control and local adaptive controllers was compared to the operation of the developed DNB traffic signal controller. The controllers were implemented and their performance assessed on a grid network in the INTEGRATION microscopic simulation software. The results show that the DNB controller, although not designed to solve perimeter control problems, successfully prevents congestion from building inside the PN and improves the performance of the entire network. Specifically, the DNB controller outperforms both gating and non-gating controllers, with reductions in the average travel time ranging between 21% and 41%, total delay ranging between 40% and 55%, and emission levels/fuel consumption ranging between 12% and 20%. The results demonstrate statistically significant benefits of using the developed DNB controller over other state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized gating/adaptive traffic signal controllers.

AB  - Predictive maintenance is a field of research that has emerged from the need to improve the systems in place. This research focuses on controlling the degradation of photovoltaic (PV) modules in outdoor solar panels, which are exposed to a variety of climatic loads. Improved reliability, operation, and performance can be achieved through monitoring. In this study, a system capable of predicting the output power of a solar module was implemented. It monitors different parameters and uses automatic learning techniques for prediction. Its use improved reliability, operation, and performance. On the other hand, automatic learning algorithms were evaluated with different metrics in order to optimize and find the best configuration that provides an optimal solution to the problem. With the aim of increasing the share of renewable energy penetration, an architectural proposal based on Edge Computing was included to implement the proposed model into a system. The proposed model is designated for outdoor predictions and offers many advantages, such as monitoring of individual panels, optimization of system response, and speed of communication with the Cloud. The final objective of the work was to contribute to the smart Energy system concept, providing solutions for planning the entire energy system together with the identification of suitable energy infrastructure designs and operational strategies.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Health 4.0 is an extension of the Industry standard 4.0 which is aimed at the virtualization of health-care services. It employs core technologies and services for integrated management of electronic health records (EHRs), captured through various sensors. The EHR is processed and transmitted to distant experts for better diagnosis and improved healthcare delivery. However, for the successful implementation of Heath 4.0 many challenges do exist. One of the critical issues that needs attention is the security of EHRs in smart health systems. In this work, we have developed a new interpolation scheme capable of providing better quality cover media and supporting reversible EHR embedding. The scheme provides a double layer of security to the EHR by firstly using hyperchaos to encrypt the EHR. The encrypted EHR is reversibly embedded in the cover images produced by the proposed interpolation scheme. The proposed interpolation module has been found to provide better quality interpolated images. The proposed system provides an average peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of 52.38 dB for a high payload of 0.75 bits per pixel. In addition to embedding EHR, a fragile watermark (WM) is also encrypted using the hyperchaos embedded into the cover image for tamper detection and authentication of the received EHR. Experimental investigations reveal that our scheme provides improved performance for high contrast medical images (MI) when compared to various techniques for evaluation parameters like imperceptibility, reversibility, payload, and computational complexity. Given the attributes of the scheme, it can be used for enhancing the security of EHR in health 4.0.

Smart manufacturing&rsquo;s practical and meaningful design follows data, information, and operational technology through the blockchain, edge computing, and machine learning to develop and facilitate the smart manufacturing system. This process&rsquo;s proposed smart manufacturing system considers the integration of blockchain, edge computing, and machine learning approaches. Edge computing makes the computational workload balanced and similarly provides a timely response for the devices. Blockchain technology utilizes the data transmission and the manufacturing system&rsquo;s transactions, and the machine learning approach provides advanced data analysis for a huge manufacturing dataset. Regarding smart manufacturing systems&rsquo; computational environments, the model solves the problems using a swarm intelligence-based approach. The experimental results present the edge computing mechanism and similarly improve the processing time of a large number of tasks in the manufacturing system.

AB  - While low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies have been studied extensively for a broad spectrum of smart city applications, their potential for water distribution system monitoring in high temporal resolution has not been studied in detail. However, due to their low power demand, these technologies offer new possibilities for operating pressure-monitoring devices for near real-time leak detection in water distribution systems (WDS). By combining long-distance wireless communication with low power consumption, LPWAN technologies promise long periods of maintenance-free device operation without having to rely on an external power source. This is of particular importance for pressure-based leak detection where optimal sensor positions are often located in the periphery of WDS without a suitable power source. To assess the potential of these technologies for replacing widely-used wireless communication technologies for leak detection, GPRS is compared with the LPWAN standards Narrowband IoT, long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) and Sigfox. Based on sampling and transmission rates commonly applied in leak detection, the ability of these three technologies to replace GPRS is analyzed based on a self-developed low-power pressure-monitoring device and a simplified, linear energy-consumption model. The results indicate that even though some of the analyzed LPWAN technologies may suffer from contractual and technical limitations, all of them offer viable alternatives, meeting the requirements of leak detection in WDS. In accordance with existing research on data transmission with these technologies, the findings of this work show that even while retaining a compact design, which entails a limited battery capacity, pressure-monitoring devices can exceed runtimes of 5 years, as required for installation at water meters in Austria. Thus, LPWAN technologies have the potential to advance the wide application of near real-time, pressure-based leak detection in WDS, while simultaneously reducing the cost of device operation significantly.

AB  - Providing security and privacy to the Internet of Things (IoT) networks while achieving it with minimum performance requirements is an open research challenge. Blockchain technology, as a distributed and decentralized ledger, is a potential solution to tackle the limitations of the current peer-to-peer IoT networks. This paper presents the development of an integrated IoT system implementing the permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) to secure the edge computing devices by employing a local authentication process. In addition, the proposed model provides traceability for the data generated by the IoT devices. The presented solution also addresses the IoT systems&rsquo; scalability challenges, the processing power and storage issues of the IoT edge devices in the blockchain network. A set of built-in queries is leveraged by smart-contracts technology to define the rules and conditions. The paper validates the performance of the proposed model with practical implementation by measuring performance metrics such as transaction throughput and latency, resource consumption, and network use. The results show that the proposed platform with the HLF implementation is promising for the security of resource-constrained IoT devices and is scalable for deployment in various IoT scenarios.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Currently, it is becoming increasingly common to find numerous electronic devices installed in office and residential spaces as part of building automation solutions. These devices provide a rich set of data related to the inside and outside environment, such as indoor and outdoor temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. However, commercial of-the-shelf climatic control systems continue to rely on simple controllers like proportional-integral-derivative or even on-off, which do not take into account such variables. This work evaluates the potential performance gains of adopting more advanced controllers, in this case based on pole-placement, enhanced with additional variables, namely solar radiation and external temperature, obtained with dedicated low-cost sensors. This approach is evaluated both in simulated and real-world environments. The obtained results show that pole-placement controllers clearly outperform on-off controllers and that the use of the additional variables in pole-placement controllers allows relevant performance gains in key parameters such as error signal MSE (17%) and control signal variance (40%), when compared with simple PP controllers. The observed energy consumption savings obtained by using the additional variables are marginal (&asymp;1%, but the reduction of the error signal MSE and control signal variance have a significant impact on energy consumption peaks and on equipment lifetime, thus largely compensating the increase in the system complexity.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and fifth-generation mobile network technologies, automatic instrument reading has become an increasingly important topic for intelligent sensors in smart cities. We propose a full pipeline to automatically read watermeters based on a single image, using deep learning methods to provide new technical support for an intelligent water meter reading. To handle the various challenging environments where watermeters reside, our pipeline disentangled the task into individual subtasks based on the structures of typical watermeters. These subtasks include component localization, orientation alignment, spatial layout guidance reading, and regression-based pointer reading. The devised algorithms for orientation alignment and spatial layout guidance are tailored to improve the robustness of our neural network. We also collect images of watermeters in real scenes and build a dataset for training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method even under challenging environments with varying lighting, occlusions, and different orientations. Thanks to the lightweight algorithms adopted in our pipeline, the system can be easily deployed and fully automated.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, there has been a massive increase in the amount of Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as the data generated by such devices. The participating devices in IoT networks can be problematic due to their resource-constrained nature, and integrating security on these devices is often overlooked. This has resulted in attackers having an increased incentive to target IoT devices. As the number of attacks possible on a network increases, it becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to cope with these attacks efficiently. In this paper, we highlight several machine learning (ML) methods such as k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and logistic regression (LR) that can be used in IDS. In this work, ML algorithms are compared for both binary and multi-class classification on Bot-IoT dataset. Based on several parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss, we experimentally compared the aforementioned ML algorithms. In the case of HTTP distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the accuracy of RF is 99%. Furthermore, other simulation results-based precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss metric reveal that RF outperforms on all types of attacks in binary classification. However, in multi-class classification, KNN outperforms other ML algorithms with an accuracy of 99%, which is 4% higher than RF.

AB  - The modern control infrastructure that manages and monitors the communication between the smart machines represents the most effective way to increase the efficiency of the industrial environment, such as smart grids. The cyber-physical systems utilize the embedded software and internet to connect and control the smart machines that are addressed by the internet of things (IoT). These cyber-physical systems are the basis of the fourth industrial revolution which is indexed by industry 4.0. In particular, industry 4.0 relies heavily on the IoT and smart sensors such as smart energy meters. The reliability and security represent the main challenges that face the industry 4.0 implementation. This paper introduces a new infrastructure based on machine learning to analyze and monitor the output data of the smart meters to investigate if this data is real data or fake. The fake data are due to the hacking and the inefficient meters. The industrial environment affects the efficiency of the meters by temperature, humidity, and noise signals. Furthermore, the proposed infrastructure validates the amount of data loss via communication channels and the internet connection. The decision tree is utilized as an effective machine learning algorithm to carry out both regression and classification for the meters&rsquo; data. The data monitoring is carried based on the industrial digital twins&rsquo; platform. The proposed infrastructure results provide a reliable and effective industrial decision that enhances the investments in industry 4.0.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Improving road safety through artificial intelligence is now crucial to achieving more secure smart cities. With this objective, a mobile app based on the integration of the smartphone sensors and a fuzzy logic strategy to determine the pedestrian&rsquo;s crossing intention around crosswalks is presented. The app developed also allows the calculation, tracing and guidance of safe routes thanks to an optimization algorithm that includes pedestrian areas on the paths generated over the whole city through a cloud database (i.e., zebra crossings, pedestrian streets and walkways). The experimentation carried out consisted in testing the fuzzy logic strategy with a total of 31 volunteers crossing and walking around a crosswalk. For that, the fuzzy logic approach was subjected to a total of 3120 samples generated by the volunteers. It has been proven that a smartphone can be successfully used as a crossing intention detector system with an accuracy of 98.63%, obtaining a true positive rate of 98.27% and a specificity of 99.39% according to a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Finally, a total of 30 routes were calculated by the proposed algorithm and compared with Google Maps considering the values of time, distance and safety along the routes. As a result, the routes generated by the proposed algorithm were safer than the routes obtained with Google Maps, achieving an increase in the use of safe pedestrian areas of at least 183%.

AB  - In this article, we cumulate previous research findings indicating that cyber-physical production systems bring about operations shaping social sustainability performance technologically. We contribute to the literature on sustainable cyber-physical production systems by showing that the technological and operations management features of cyber-physical systems constitute the components of data-driven sustainable smart manufacturing. Throughout September 2020, we performed a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases, with search terms including &ldquo;sustainable industrial value creation&rdquo;, &ldquo;cyber-physical production systems&rdquo;, &ldquo;sustainable smart manufacturing&rdquo;, &ldquo;smart economy&rdquo;, &ldquo;industrial big data analytics&rdquo;, &ldquo;sustainable Internet of Things&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sustainable Industry 4.0&rdquo;. As we inspected research published only in 2019 and 2020, only 323 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. By eliminating controversial findings, outcomes unsubstantiated by replication, too imprecise material, or having similar titles, we decided upon 119, generally empirical, sources. Future research should investigate whether Industry 4.0-based manufacturing technologies can ensure the sustainability of big data-driven production systems by use of Internet of Things sensing networks and deep learning-assisted smart process planning.

AB  - The paradigm of the Internet of everything (IoE) is advancing toward enriching people&rsquo;s lives by adding value to the Internet of things (IoT), with connections among people, processes, data, and things. This paper provides a survey of the literature on IoE research, highlighting concerns in terms of intelligence services and knowledge creation. The significant contributions of this study are as follows: (1) a systematic literature review of IoE taxonomies (including IoT); (2) development of a taxonomy to guide the identification of critical knowledge in IoE applications, an in-depth classification of IoE enablers (sensors and actuators); (3) validation of the defined taxonomy with 50 IoE applications; and (4) identification of issues and challenges in existing IoE applications (using the defined taxonomy) with regard to insights about knowledge processes. To the best of our knowledge, and taking into consideration the 76 other taxonomies compared, this present work represents the most comprehensive taxonomy that provides the orchestration of intelligence in network connections concerning knowledge processes, type of IoE enablers, observation characteristics, and technological capabilities in IoE applications.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Assuring the safety of automated vehicles is essential for their timely introduction and acceptance by policymakers and the public. To assess their safe design and robust decision making in response to all possible scenarios, new methods that use a scenario-based testing approach are needed, as testing on public roads in normal traffic would require driving millions of kilometres. We make use of the scenario-based testing approach and propose a method to model simulated scenarios using Gaussian Process based models to predict untested scenario outcomes. This enables us to efficiently determine the performance boundary, where the safe and unsafe scenarios can be evidently distinguished from each other. We present an iterative method that optimises the parameter space of a logical scenario towards the most critical scenarios on this performance boundary. Additionally, we conduct a novel probabilistic sensitivity analysis by efficiently computing several variance-based sensitivity indices using the Gaussian Process models and evaluate the relative importance of the scenario input parameters on the scenario outcome. We critically evaluate and investigate the usefulness of the proposed Gaussian Process based approach as a very efficient surrogate model, which can model the logical scenarios effectively in the presence of uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied on an exemplary logical scenario and shows viability in finding concrete critical scenarios. The reported results, derived from the proposed approach, could pave the way to more efficient testing of automated vehicles and instruct further physical tests on the determined critical scenarios.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Herein, we proposed a multi-scale multi-band dilated time-frequency densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) with long short-term memory (LSTM) for audio source separation. Because the spectrogram of the acoustic signal can be thought of as images as well as time series data, it is suitable for convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture. We improved the audio source separation performance by applying the dilated block with a dilated convolution to CRNN architecture. The dilated block has the role of effectively increasing the receptive field in the spectrogram. In addition, it was designed in consideration of the acoustic characteristics that the frequency axis and the time axis in the spectrogram are changed by independent influences such as speech rate and pitch. In speech enhancement experiments, we estimated the speech signal using various deep learning architectures from a signal in which the music, noise, and speech were mixed. We conducted the subjective evaluation on the estimated speech signal. In addition, speech quality, intelligibility, separation, and speech recognition performance were also measured. In music signal separation, we estimated the music signal using several deep learning architectures from the mixture of the music and speech signal. After that, the separation performance and music identification accuracy were measured using the estimated music signal. Overall, the proposed architecture shows the best performance compared to other deep learning architectures not only in speech experiments but also in music experiments.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The development of the smart city concept and inhabitants&rsquo; need to reduce travel time, in addition to society&rsquo;s awareness of the importance of reducing fuel consumption and respecting the environment, have led to a new approach to the classic travelling salesman problem (TSP) applied to urban environments. This problem can be formulated as &ldquo;Given a list of geographic points and the distances between each pair of points, what is the shortest possible route that visits each point and returns to the departure point?&rdquo;. At present, with the development of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and increased capabilities of sensors, a large amount of data and measurements are available, allowing researchers to model accurately the routes to choose. In this work, the aim is to provide a solution to the TSP in smart city environments using a modified version of the metaheuristic optimization algorithm Teacher Learner Based Optimization (TLBO). In addition, to improve performance, the solution is implemented by means of a parallel graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture, specifically a Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) implementation.
