TI  - A Novel Accurate and Fast Converging Deep Learning-Based Model for Electrical Energy Consumption Forecasting in a Smart Grid
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Energy consumption forecasting is of prime importance for the restructured environment of energy management in the electricity market. Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient energy management in the smart grid (SG); however, the energy consumption pattern is non-linear with a high level of uncertainty and volatility. Forecasting such complex patterns requires accurate and fast forecasting models. In this paper, a novel hybrid electrical energy consumption forecasting model is proposed based on a deep learning model known as factored conditional restricted Boltzmann machine (FCRBM). The deep learning-based FCRBM model uses a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and a multivariate autoregressive technique for the network training. The proposed model predicts future electrical energy consumption for efficient energy management in the SG. The proposed model is a novel hybrid model comprising four modules: (i) data processing and features selection module, (ii) deep learning-based FCRBM forecasting module, (iii) genetic wind driven optimization (GWDO) algorithm-based optimization module, and (iv) utilization module. The proposed hybrid model, called FS-FCRBM-GWDO, is tested and evaluated on real power grid data of USA in terms of four performance metrics: mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD), variance, correlation coefficient, and convergence rate. Simulation results validate that the proposed hybrid FS-FCRBM-GWDO model has superior performance than existing models such as accurate fast converging short-term load forecasting (AFC-STLF) model, mutual information-modified enhanced differential evolution algorithm-artificial neural network (MI-mEDE-ANN)-based model, features selection-ANN (FS-ANN)-based model, and Bi-level model, in terms of forecast accuracy and convergence rate.

AB  - In this study, the factors that affect the implementation of intelligent systems in motor production lines are analyzed. A motor production line located in Vietnam is used as the research object. The research methods include secondary data collection, field study, and interviews. This study demonstrates the following: firstly, the implementation of intelligent systems in motor production lines is heading toward Industry 4.0. Secondly, it is proposed that three functional systems&mdash;robot arm, image recognition, and big data analysis&mdash;can be introduced in the motor production line. This study analyzes the process involved in coil and motor production lines and attempts to combine intelligent system functions. It is expected that in the future, manpower will be reduced, production line productivity will increase, and intelligent production lines will be proposed. The factors that affect the introduction of intelligent systems in motor production lines are improved, and the importance of intelligent systems, which has been rarely considered in previous studies, is highlighted. In the implementation criteria of the intelligent system in the process management of the motor production line, this study provides some suggestions (to coil and motor assembly line) for the production process management.

AB  - The challenge of keeping the development and implementation of real-time control systems reliable and efficient and at the same time, low-cost and low-energy, is getting harder. This is because system designers and developers are faced with the dependability, inflexibility and often high-cost of specialized or custom-built hardware and software components. This research attempts to tackle issues such as the reliability and efficiency of real-time control systems and advance further the current state-of-the-art. For this purpose, a strong emphasis is placed on finding novel efficient solutions based on standardized and commercially available off-the-shelf hardware/software components. In this direction, this research applies credible and feasible methodologies (e.g., model-based design, component-based design, formal verification, real-time scheduling, prototyping, and validation) in an innovative enhanced way. As an important outcome, a versatile integrative design approach and architectural framework (VIDAF) is proposed, which supports the development and implementation of reliable real-time control systems and applications using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed system&rsquo;s architecture are evaluated and validated through a system application in embedded real-time control in manufacturing. The research outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on emerging areas such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Over the years, the flourish of crowd computing has enabled enterprises to accomplish computing tasks through crowdsourcing in a large-scale and high-quality manner, and therefore how to efficiently and securely implement crowd computing becomes a hotspot. Some recent work innovatively adopted a P2P (peer-to-peer) network as the communication environment of crowdsourcing. Based on its decentralized control, issues like single-point-of-failure or DDoS attack can be overcome to some extent, but the huge computing capacity and storage costs required by this scheme is always unbearable. Federated learning is a distributed machine learning that supports local storage of data, and clients implement training through interactive gradient values. In our work, we combine blockchain with federated learning and propose a crowdsourcing framework named CrowdSFL, that users can implement crowdsourcing with less overhead and higher security. In addition, to protect the privacy of participants, we design a new re-encryption algorithm based on Elgamal to ensure that interactive values and other information will not be exposed to other participants outside the workflow. Finally, we have proved through experiments that our framework is superior to some similar work in accuracy, efficiency, and overhead.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - A heavy workload is required for sample collection for urban land use classification, and researchers are in urgent need of sampling strategies as a guide to achieve more effective work. In this paper, we make use of an urban land use survey to obtain a complete sample set of a city, test the impact of different training and validation sample sizes on the accuracy, and summarize the sampling strategy. The following conclusions are drawn based on our systematic analysis in Shenzhen. (1) For the best classification accuracy, the number of training samples should be no less than 40% of the total number of parcels or no less than 5500 parcels. For the best labor cost performance, the number should be no less than 7% or no less than 900. (2) The accuracy evaluation is stable and reliable and requires validation sample numbers of no less than 10% of the total or no less than 1200. (3) Samples with a purity of 60&ndash;90% are preferred, and the classification effectiveness is better in samples with a purity greater than 90% under the same number. (4) If spatial equilibrium sampling cannot be carried out, sampling areas with complex land use patterns should be preferred.

AB  - In recent years, a new business paradigm has emerged which revolves around effectively extracting value from data. In this scope, providing a secure ecosystem for data sharing that ensures data governance and traceability is of paramount importance as it holds the potential to create new applications and services. Protecting data goes beyond restricting who can access what resource (covered by identity and Access Control): it becomes necessary to control how data are treated once accessed, which is known as data Usage Control. Data Usage Control provides a common and trustful security framework to guarantee the compliance with data governance rules and responsible use of organizations&rsquo; data by third-party entities, easing and ensuring secure data sharing in ecosystems such as Smart Cities and Industry 4.0. In this article, we present an implementation of a previously published architecture for enabling access and Usage Control in data-sharing ecosystems among multiple organizations using the FIWARE European open source platform. Additionally, we validate this implementation through a real use case in the food industry. We conclude that the proposed model, implemented using FIWARE components, provides a flexible and powerful architecture to manage Usage Control in data-sharing ecosystems.

AB  - Smart cities follow different strategies to face public health challenges associated with socio-economic objectives. Buildings play a crucial role in smart cities and are closely related to people&rsquo;s health. Moreover, they are equally essential to meet sustainable objectives. People spend most of their time indoors. Therefore, indoor air quality has a critical impact on health and well-being. With the increasing population of elders, ambient-assisted living systems are required to promote occupational health and well-being. Furthermore, living environments must incorporate monitoring systems to detect unfavorable indoor quality scenarios in useful time. This paper reviews the current state of the art on indoor air quality monitoring systems based on Internet of Things and wireless sensor networks in the last five years (2014&ndash;2019). This document focuses on the architecture, microcontrollers, connectivity, and sensors used by these systems. The main contribution is to synthesize the existing body of knowledge and identify common threads and gaps that open up new significant and challenging future research directions. The results show that 57% of the indoor air quality monitoring systems are based on Arduino, 53% of the systems use Internet of Things, and WSN architectures represent 33%. The CO2 and PM monitoring sensors are the most monitored parameters in the analyzed literature, corresponding to 67% and 29%, respectively.

The safety stock is conceived to fill up the demand variability, providing continuous stock availability. Logistic 4.0 and the smart factory topics are considered. It focuses on vertical integration to implement flexible and reconfigurable smart production systems using the information system integration in order to optimize material flow in a 4.0 full-service approach. The proposed methodology aims to reduce the occurring stock-out events through a link among the wear-out items rate and the downstream logistic demand. The failure rate items trend is obtained through life-cycle state detection by a curve fitting technique. Therefore, the optimal safety stock size is calculated and then validated by an auto-tuning iterative modified algorithm. In this study, the reorder time has been optimized. The case study refers to the material management of a very high-speed train.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Nowadays, communication engineering technology is merging with the Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of numerous connected devices (referred to as things) around the world. Many researchers have shown significant growth of sensor deployments for multiple smart engineering technologies, such as smart-healthcare, smart-industries, smart-cities, and smart-transportation, etc. In such intelligent engineering technologies, sensors continuously generate a bunch of messages in the network. To enhance the value of the data in the messages, we must know the actuality of the data embedded inside the messages. For this purpose, the contextual information of the data creates a vital challenge. Recently, context-aware computing has emerged to be fruitful in dealing with sensor information. In the ubiquitous computing domain, location is commonly considered one of the most essential sources of context. However, whenever users or applications are concerned with objects, and their site or spatial relationships, location models or spatial models are necessary to form a model of the environment. This paper investigates the area of context-aware messaging and addressing services in diverse IoT applications. The paper examines the notion of context and the use of context within the data exchanged by the sensors in an IoT application for messaging and addressing purposes. Based on the importance and need for context of the information, we identify three critical categories of new IoT applications for context-aware messaging and addressing services: emergency applications, applications for guiding and reminding, and social networking applications. For this purpose, a representative range of systems is reviewed according to the application type, the technology being used, their architecture, the context information, and the services they provide. This survey assists the work of defining an approach for context-aware messaging services domain by discovering the area of context-aware messaging.

TI  - Moving towards IoT Based Digital Communication: An Efficient Utilization of Power Spectrum Density for Smart Cities
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The future of the Internet of Things (IoT) is interlinked with digital communication in smart cities. The digital signal power spectrum of smart IoT devices is greatly needed to provide communication support. The line codes play a significant role in data bit transmission in digital communication. The existing line-coding techniques are designed for traditional computing network technology and power spectrum density to translate data bits into a signal using various line code waveforms. The existing line-code techniques have multiple kinds of issues, such as the utilization of bandwidth, connection synchronization (CS), the direct current (DC) component, and power spectrum density (PSD). These highlighted issues are not adequate in IoT devices in smart cities due to their small size. However, there is a need to design an effective line-code method to deal with these issues in digital IoT-based communication for smart technologies, which enables smart services for smart cities. In this paper, the Shadow Encoding Scheme (SES) is proposed to transmit data bits efficiently by using a physical waveform in the smart cities&rsquo; ecosystem. SES provides a reliable transmission over the physical medium without using extra bandwidth and with ideal PSD. In it, the shadow copy of the repeating bitstream is forwarded, rather than repeating the actual stream again and again. The PSD is calculated with the help of mathematical equations to validate SES. MATLAB simulator is used to simulate SES and compared with other well-known digital line-code techniques. The bit error rate is also compared between SES and the chirp spread spectrum (CSS) for the specific data frames. The coordinates of the PSD graph are also shown in tabular form, which shows a vivid picture of the working conditions of various line codes.

AB  - In healthcare, interoperability is widely adopted in the case of cross-departmental or specialization cases. As the human body demands multiple specialized and cross-disciplined medical experiments, interoperability of business entities like different departments, different specializations, the involvement of legal and government monitoring issues etc. are not sufficient to reduce the active medical cases. A patient-centric system with high capability to collect, retrieve, store or exchange data is the demand for present and future times. Such data-centric health processes would bring automated patient medication, or patient self-driven trusted and high satisfaction capabilities. However, data-centric processes are having a huge set of challenges such as security, technology, governance, adoption, deployment, integration etc. This work has explored the feasibility to integrate resource-constrained devices-based wearable kidney systems in the Industry 4.0 network and facilitates data collection, liquidity, storage, retrieval and exchange systems. Thereafter, a Healthcare 4.0 processes-based wearable kidney system is proposed that is having the blockchain technology advantages. Further, game theory-based consensus algorithms are proposed for resource-constrained devices in the kidney system. The overall system design would bring an example for the transition from the specialization or departmental-centric approach to data and patient-centric approach that would bring more transparency, trust and healthy practices in the healthcare sector. Results show a variation of 0.10 million GH/s to 0.18 million GH/s hash rate for the proposed approach. The chances of a majority attack in the proposed scheme are statistically proved to be minimum. Further Average Packet Delivery Rate (ADPR) lies between 95% to 97%, approximately, without the presence of outliers. In the presence of outliers, network performance decreases below 80% APDR (to a minimum of 41.3%) and this indicates that there are outliers present in the network. Simulation results show that the Average Throughput (AT) value lies between 120 Kbps to 250 Kbps.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis for Predicting Sub-Micron Aerosol Concentrations Based on Meteorological Parameters

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Sub-micron aerosols are a vital air pollutant to be measured because they pose health effects. These particles are quantified as particle number concentration (PN). However, PN measurements are not always available in air quality measurement stations, leading to data scarcity. In order to compensate this, PN modeling needs to be developed. This paper presents a PN modeling framework using sensitivity analysis tested on a one year aerosol measurement campaign conducted in Amman, Jordan. The method prepares a set of different combinations of all measured meteorological parameters to be descriptors of PN concentration. In this case, we resort to artificial neural networks in the forms of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and a time-delay neural network (TDNN) as modeling tools, and then, we attempt to find the best descriptors using all these combinations as model inputs. The best modeling tools are FFNN for daily averaged data (with R      2  = 0.77    ) and TDNN for hourly averaged data (with R      2  = 0.66    ) where the best combinations of meteorological parameters are found to be temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and wind speed. As the models follow the patterns of diurnal cycles well, the results are considered to be satisfactory. When PN measurements are not directly available or there are massive missing PN concentration data, PN models can be used to estimate PN concentration using available measured meteorological parameters.

T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 5
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - From the last decade, pharmaceutical companies are facing difficulties in tracking their products during the supply chain process, allowing the counterfeiters to add their fake medicines into the market. Counterfeit drugs are analyzed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss of around $200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting problem. The blockchain has the full potential to handle and track the supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented a novel blockchain and machine learning-based drug supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR). Our proposed system consists of two main modules: blockchain-based drug supply chain management and machine learning-based drug recommendation system for consumers. In the first module, the drug supply chain management system is deployed using Hyperledger fabrics which is capable of continuously monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, the N-gram, LightGBM models are used in the machine learning module to recommend the top-rated or best medicines to the customers of the pharmaceutical industry. These models have trained on well known publicly available drug reviews dataset provided by the UCI: an open-source machine learning repository. Moreover, the machine learning module is integrated with this blockchain system with the help of the REST API. Finally, we also perform several tests to check the efficiency and usability of our proposed system.

AB  - Sensor networks are essential for the development of the Internet of Things and the smart city. A general sensor, especially a mobile sensor, has to be driven by a power unit. When considering the high mobility, wide distribution and wireless operation of the sensors, their sustainable operation remains a critical challenge owing to the limited lifetime of an energy storage unit. In 2006, Wang proposed the concept of self-powered sensors/system, which harvests ambient energy to continuously drive a sensor without the use of an external power source. Based on the piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), extensive studies have focused on self-powered sensors. TENG and PENG, as effective mechanical-to-electricity energy conversion technologies, have been used not only as power sources but also as active sensing devices in many application fields, including physical sensors, wearable devices, biomedical and health care, human&ndash;machine interface, chemical and environmental monitoring, smart traffic, smart cities, robotics, and fiber and fabric sensors. In this review, we systematically summarize the progress made by TENG and PENG in those application fields. A perspective will be given about the future of self-powered sensors.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the analysis of the personal learning environments (PLE) used individually and in groups by fifth grade primary education students. The main objective was to determine if the use of mobile technologies in the students&rsquo; PLEs encouraged their school integration and learning in intercultural communities. For this, a content analysis of the students&rsquo; responses to an ad hoc interview was carried out, with a content validity index of 0.89. The students represented their answers using 41 concept maps in the individual tasks and 5 in the group tasks, which were analyzed with the Nvivo software in its latest version. The results show the categorization of the students&rsquo; responses in three dimensions: read, make/reflection and relationship. Among the main conclusions, it was obtained that, in both types of tasks, the strategies and tools that fostered intercultural relationships, intercultural education and communication between the students, and therefore school integration, are mostly linked to the use of mobile technologies applications, such as Wikipedia, the internet, Word, PowerPoint, social networks and YouTube, although it is essential to develop more studies to have more data to understand the phenomenon in depth.

Hence, the main aim of this study is to prioritize and analyze the role of certain environmental parameters. For this purpose, four cities in Italy were selected as a case study and some notable climate parameters&mdash;such as daily average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed&mdash;and an urban parameter, population density, were considered as input data set, with confirmed cases of COVID-19 being the output dataset. In this paper, two artificial intelligence techniques, including an artificial neural network (ANN) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and differential evolution (DE) algorithm, were used for prioritizing climate and urban parameters. The analysis is based on the feature selection process and then the obtained results from the proposed models compared to select the best one. Finally, the difference in cost function was about 0.0001 between the performances of the two models, hence, the two methods were not different in cost function, however, ANN-PSO was found to be better, because it reached to the desired precision level in lesser iterations than ANN-DE. In addition, the priority of two variables, urban parameter, and relative humidity, were the highest to predict the confirmed cases of COVID-19.

AB  - Data integrity in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is very important because incorrect or missing values could result in the system making suboptimal or catastrophic decisions. Data imputation allows for a system to counteract the effect of data loss by substituting faulty or missing sensor values with system-defined virtual values. This paper proposes a virtual sensor system that uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to impute sensor values in a WSN. The MLP was trained using a genetic algorithm which efficiently reached an optimal solution for each sensor node. The system was able to successfully identify and replace physical sensor nodes that were disconnected from the network with corresponding virtual sensors. The virtual sensors imputed values with very high accuracies when compared to the physical sensor values.

TI  - Blended Multi-Modal Deep ConvNet Features for Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Prediction
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 6
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of visual impairment and blindness across the world. It is usually found in patients who suffer from diabetes for a long period. The major focus of this work is to derive optimal representation of retinal images that further helps to improve the performance of DR recognition models. To extract optimal representation, features extracted from multiple pre-trained ConvNet models are blended using proposed multi-modal fusion module. These final representations are used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) used for DR identification and severity level prediction. As each ConvNet extracts different features, fusing them using 1D pooling and cross pooling leads to better representation than using features extracted from a single ConvNet. Experimental studies on benchmark Kaggle APTOS 2019 contest dataset reveals that the model trained on proposed blended feature representations is superior to the existing methods. In addition, we notice that cross average pooling based fusion of features from Xception and VGG16 is the most appropriate for DR recognition. With the proposed model, we achieve an accuracy of 97.41%, and a kappa statistic of 94.82 for DR identification and an accuracy of 81.7% and a kappa statistic of 71.1% for severity level prediction. Another interesting observation is that DNN with dropout at input layer converges more quickly when trained using blended features, compared to the same model trained using uni-modal deep features.

SN  - 2624-8921

AB  - With the increase of vehicles in large urban centers, there is also an increase in the number of traffic jams and accidents on public roads. The development of a proper Intelligent Transport System (ITS) could help to alleviate these problems by assisting the drivers on route selections to avoid the most congested road sections. Therefore, to improve on this issue, this work proposes an architecture to aid an ITS to detect, analyze, and classify the traffic flow conditions in real time. This architecture also provides a control room dashboard to visualize the information and notify the users about the live traffic conditions. To this end, the proposed solution takes advantage of computer vision concepts to extract the maximum information about the roads to better assess and keep the drivers posted about the traffic conditions on selected highways. The main contribution of the proposed architecture is to perform the detection and classification of the flow of vehicles regardless of the luminosity conditions. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solution, a testbed was designed. The obtained results show that the accuracy of the traffic classification rate is up to 90% in daylight environments and up to 70% in low light environments when compared with the related literature.

SN  - 2227-7390

AB  - Several epidemiological models are being used around the world to project the number of infected individuals and the mortality rates of the COVID-19 outbreak. Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to the lack of essential data and uncertainty, the epidemiological models have been challenged regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19, and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are proposed to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for 9 days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs. This paper provides an initial benchmarking to demonstrate the potential of machine learning for future research.

TI  - Autonomous Shuttle Bus for Public Transportation: A Review
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 11
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The rapid evolution of autonomous technology in the field of automotive and information technology (IT) has made it possible to implement autonomous vehicles (AVs) for public passenger transport. Although the shuttle bus transport capacities currently in use are low (maximum 15 people), the use of these transport units in large urban agglomerations is beneficial for society. The current paper is written to review the current AV implementation with respect to shuttle buses with its direct implications in their scientific evolution, with direct links to the legal and social aspects of public transportation all over the world. A critical aspect that is presented in the paper is the legal framework of autonomous driving, which is extremely uneven around the globe, with the direct impact of autonomous shuttle bus exploitation. As the legislation on AVs presents some shortcomings in the approval, registration, and public road implementation of these vehicles, many of the world&rsquo;s major cities have found ways to integrate them into testing programs, establishing the basis for future comprehensive legislative measures in this highly dynamic scientific domain. The current technological solutions adopted by several autonomous shuttle bus producers will be presented with an exhaustive overview of each major component. The aspects of the control algorithm, with its complicated layers of security and perturbance factors, will be explained in detail. Thus, in some countries/cities, autonomous shuttle buses have been implemented on less-traveled routes where they can travel at speeds up to 25 km/h without hindering the public&rsquo;s circulation, such as university campuses, industrial areas, airports, and sports bases. Some countries/cities use autonomous shuttle buses for pilot programs related to passenger transport, while others use them in postal transport and others for scientific purposes. In all of these situations, the first step in autonomous driving has been taken. The paper also makes an evaluation of the social factors that are a consequence of the mass introduction of autonomous driving as a means of public transportation. Autonomous shuttle buses are becoming a part of everyday life in big cities. Their acceptance as a strategic means of transport depends on their efficiency in daily services; through its efficiency, this means of transport will become a game-changer once its benefits become not only known but experienced by a large number of users.

AB  - With the continuous development of tourism, the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into tourism projects is considered a very promising technology. Smart tourism aims to use the IoT to maximize information communication; that is, the IoT technology will become an important element to meet the needs of a new generation of tourists. Therefore, in this study, we propose a human-guided machine learning classification method based on tourist selection behavior. This classification method can effectively help tourists make a decision in choosing a certain tourist destination. The results obtained from the cross-validation experiments and performance evaluation prove the effectiveness of this method.

AB  - There are a number of significant changes taking place in modern city development and most of them are based on the number of recent technological progress. This paper provides a review and analysis of recent approaches of biotechnology that can find a place in today&rsquo;s cities and discusses how those technologies can be integrated into a city&rsquo;s Internet of Things (IoT). Firstly, several biotechnologies that focus on rain gardens, urban vertical farming systems, and city photobioreactors are discussed in the context of their integration in a city&rsquo;s IoT. The next possible application of biofuel cells to the sensor network&rsquo;s energy supply is discussed. It is shown that such devices can influence the low-power sensor network structure as an additional energy source for transmitters. This paper shows the possibility of bioelectrochemical biosensor applications, discusses self-powered biosensors, and shows that such a system can be widely applied to rainwater monitoring in rain gardens and green streets. Significant attention is paid to recent approaches in synthetic biology. Both cell-based biosensors and bioactuators with synthetic genetic circuits are discussed. The development of cell-based biosensors can significantly enhance the sensing possibilities of a city&rsquo;s IoT. We show the possible ways to develop cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with the systems mentioned above. Aspects of data handling for the discussed biotechnologies and the methods of intelligent systems, including those that are machine learning-based, applied to the IoT in a city are presented.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are internationally agreed goals that allow us to determine what humanity, as represented by 193 member states, finds acceptable and desirable. The paper explores how technology can be used to address the SDGs and in particular Smart Information Systems (SIS). SIS, the technologies that build on big data analytics, typically facilitated by AI techniques such as machine learning, are expected to grow in importance and impact. Some of these impacts are likely to be beneficial, notably the growth in efficiency and profits, which will contribute to societal wellbeing. At the same time, there are significant ethical concerns about the consequences of algorithmic biases, job loss, power asymmetries and surveillance, as a result of SIS use. SIS have the potential to exacerbate inequality and further entrench the market dominance of big tech companies, if left uncontrolled. Measuring the impact of SIS on SDGs thus provides a way of assessing whether an SIS or an application of such a technology is acceptable in terms of balancing foreseeable benefits and harms. One possible approach is to use the SDGs as guidelines to determine the ethical nature of SIS implementation. While the idea of using SDGs as a yardstick to measure the acceptability of emerging technologies is conceptually strong, there should be empirical evidence to support such approaches. The paper describes the findings of a set of 6 case studies of SIS across a broad range of application areas, such as smart cities, agriculture, finance, insurance and logistics, explicitly focusing on ethical issues that SIS commonly raise and empirical insights from organisations using these technologies.

TI  - Hybrid Positioning for Smart Spaces: Proposal and Evaluation

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Positioning capabilities have become essential in context-aware user services, which make easier daily activities and let the emergence of new business models in the trendy area of smart cities. Thanks to wireless connection capabilities of smart mobile devices and the proliferation of wireless attachment points in buildings, several positioning systems have appeared in the last years to provide indoor positioning and complement GPS for outdoors. Wi-Fi fingerprinting is one of the most remarkable approaches, although ongoing smart deployments in the area of smart cities can offer extra possibilities to exploit hybrid schemes, in which the final location takes into account different positioning sources. In this paper we propose a positioning system that leverages common infrastructure and services already present in smart spaces to enhance indoor positioning. Thus, GPS and WiFi are complemented with access control services (i.e., ID card) or Bluetooth Low Energy beaconing, to determine the user location within a smart space. Better position estimations can be calculated by hybridizing the positioning information coming from different technologies, and a handover mechanism between technologies or algorithms is used exploiting semantic information saved in fingerprints. The solution implemented is highly optimized by reducing tedious computation, by means of opportunistic selection of fingerprints and floor change detection, and a battery saving subsystem reduces power consumption by disabling non-needed technologies. The proposal has been showcased over a smart campus deployment to check its real operation and assess the positioning accuracy, experiencing the noticeable advantage of integrating technologies usually available in smart spaces and reaching an average real error of 4.62 m.

AB  - Congestion extends the time of the journey for both people and goods. Therefore, transport solutions should be optimized. Management scientists and technical scientists worked together in order to develop a proprietary solution to increase efficiency in terms of productivity improvements for intelligent transport systems. The most fundamental functions of management have been paired with a detailed analysis of city traffic. The authors developed a method for determining the order of vehicles at traffic lights and connected it with vehicle-to-vehicle communication and GPS signals. As a result, a novel method to increase the throughput of intersections is presented. This solution generates a sound signal in order to inform the driver that the preceding car has started moving forward. The proposed solution leads to the shortening of the reaction time of the drivers waiting in a queue. This situation is most common at red lights. Consequently, the traffic simulation shows that the discharge of queues at traffic lights may be quicker by up to 13.5%. Notably, that proposed solution does not require any modification of the infrastructure as well as any additional devices for vehicle-to-infrastructure communication at the road intersections. To conclude, proper implementation of the proposed solution will certainly contribute to efficiency improvements within intelligent transport systems, with the potential to reduce traffic jams.

AB  - Early fault detection and diagnosis in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems may reduce the damage of equipment, improving the reliability and safety of smart buildings, generating social and economic benefits. Data models for fault detection and diagnosis are increasingly used for extracting knowledge in the supervisory tasks. This article proposes an autonomic cycle of data analysis tasks (ACODAT) for the supervision of the building&rsquo;s HVAC systems. Data analysis tasks incorporate data mining models for extracting knowledge from the system monitoring, analyzing abnormal situations and automatically identifying and taking corrective actions. This article shows a case study of a real building&rsquo;s HVAC system, for the supervision with our ACODAT, where the HVAC subsystems have been installed over the years, providing a good example of a heterogeneous facility. The proposed supervisory functionality of the HVAC system is capable of detecting deviations, such as faults or gradual increment of energy consumption in similar working conditions. The case study shows this capability of the supervisory autonomic cycle, usually a key objective for smart buildings.

AB  - Data collection in an industrial environment enables several benefits: processes and machinery can be monitored; the performance can be optimized; and the machinery can be proactively maintained. To collect data from machines or production lines, numerous sensors are required, which necessitates a management system. The management of constrained IoT devices such as sensor nodes is extensively studied. However, the previous studies focused only on the remote software updating or configuration of sensor nodes. This paper presents a holistic Open Sensor Manager (OSEMA), which addresses also generating software for different sensor models based on the configuration. In addition, it offers a user-friendly web interface, as well as a REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) for the management. The manager is built with the Django web framework, and sensor nodes rely on ESP32-based microcontrollers. OSEMA enables secure remote software updates of sensor nodes via encryption and hash-based message authentication code. The collected data can be transmitted using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). The use of OSEMA is demonstrated in an industrial domain with applications estimating the usage roughness of an overhead crane and tracking its location. OSEMA enables retrofitting different sensors to existing machinery and processes, allowing additional data collection.

AB  - Urban green spaces promote outdoor activities and social interaction, which make a significant contribution to the health and well-being of residents. This study presents an approach that focuses on the real spatial and temporal behavior of park visitors in different categories of green parks. We used the large dataset available from the Chinese micro-blog Sina Weibo (often simply referred to as &ldquo;Weibo&rdquo;) to analyze data samples, in order to describe the behavioral patterns of millions of people with access to green spaces. We select Shanghai as a case study because urban residential segregation has already taken place, which was expected to be followed by concerns of environmental sustainability. In this research, we utilized social media check-in data to measure and compare the number of visitations to different kinds of green parks. Furthermore, we divided the green spaces into different categories according to their characteristics, and our main findings were: (1) the most popular category based upon the check-in data; (2) changes in the number of visitors according to the time of day; (3) seasonal impacts on behavior in public in relation to the different categories of parks; and (4) gender-based differences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study carried out in Shanghai utilizing Weibo data to focus upon the categorization of green space. It is also the first to offer recommendations for planners regarding the type of facilities they should provide to residents in green spaces, and regarding the sustainability of urban environments and smart city architecture.

AB  - In recent times, smart cities and sustainable development have drawn significant research attention. Among developed and developing countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been at the forefront in becoming an incubator for smart cities; in particular, it has placed some efforts in the education sector by transforming the traditional campus into a Smart Campus. As the term Smart Campus attracts professionals and academics from multiple disciplines, and the technology keeps intervening in every aspect of life, it becomes inevitable for the Smart Campus to take place and deploy the future vision of smart cities. As a first step to achieve this vision, it is very important to develop a clear understanding of what is a Smart Campus. To date, there is still no clear perception of what a Smart Campus would look like, or what are the main components that can form a Smart Campus. Therefore, the objective of this research is to use the set of comprehensive criteria to identify what it is perceived to be a Smart Campus and evaluate these criteria from the stakeholders&rsquo; perception. The main criteria are defined from the literature review, and a case study is conducted on the American University of Sharjah campus stakeholders (faculty, students, management, and Information Technology (IT)) to assess the designated criteria. This exploratory research relies on both qualitative and quantitative methods to perform the analysis, taking into consideration the perceptions of students, faculty, and IT service providers. Finally, having defined and evaluated the criteria that underpin the Smart Campus framework, a set of recommendations are drawn to guide the utilization of a Smart Campus within higher education settings. This research opens the doors for future studies to gain a deeper insight into the type of decisions that need to be made to transform a traditional campus to a Smart Campus.

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have caught people&rsquo;s attention in recent years, not only from an academic or developmental viewpoint but also because of the wide range of applications that these vehicles may entail, such as intelligent mobility and logistics, as well as for industrial purposes, among others. The open literature contains a variety of works related to the subject. They employ a diversity of techniques ranging from probabilistic to ones based on Artificial Intelligence. The increase in computing capacity, well known to many, has opened plentiful opportunities for the algorithmic processing needed by these applications, making way for the development of autonomous navigation, in many cases with astounding results. The following paper presents a low-cost but high-performance minimal sensor open architecture implemented in a modular vehicle. It was developed in a short period of time, surpassing many of the currently available solutions found in the literature. Diverse experiments were carried out in the controlled and circumscribed environment of an autonomous circuit that demonstrates the efficiency of the applicability of the developed solution.

AB  - Studies on room monitoring have only focused on objects in a singular and uniform posture or low-density groups. Considering the wide use of convolutional neural networks for object detection, especially person detection, we use deep learning and perspective correction techniques to propose a room monitoring system that can detect persons with different motion states, high-density groups, and small-sized persons owing to the distance from the camera. This system uses consecutive frames from the monitoring camera as input images. Two approaches are used: perspective correction and person detection. First, perspective correction is used to transform an input image into a 2D top-view image. This allows users to observe the system more easily with different views (2D and 3D views). Second, the proposed person detection scheme combines the Mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) scheme and the tile technique for person detection, especially for detecting small-sized persons. All results are stored in a cloud database. Moreover, new person coordinates in 2D images are generated from the final bounding boxes and heat maps are created according to the 2D images; these enable users to examine the system quickly in different views. Additionally, a system prototype is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system. Experimental results prove that our proposed system outperforms existing schemes in terms of accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

AB  - To tackle the challenge of the data accuracy issues of low-cost sensors (LCSs), the objective of this work was to obtain robust correction equations to convert LCS signals into data comparable to that of research-grade instruments using side-by-side comparisons. Limited sets of seed LCS devices, after laboratory evaluations, can be installed strategically in areas of interest without official monitoring stations to enable reading adjustments of other uncalibrated LCS devices to enhance the data quality of sensor networks. The robustness of these equations for LCS devices (AS-LUNG with PMS3003 sensor) under a hood and a chamber with two different burnt materials and before and after 1.5 years of field campaigns were evaluated. Correction equations with incense or mosquito coils burning inside a chamber with segmented regressions had a high R2 of 0.999, less than 6.0% variability in the slopes, and a mean RMSE of 1.18 &micro;g/m3 for 0.1&ndash;200 &micro;g/m3 of PM2.5, with a slightly higher RMSE for 0.1&ndash;400 &micro;g/m3 compared to EDM-180. Similar results were obtained for PM1, with an upper limit of 200 &micro;g/m3. Sensor signals drifted 19&ndash;24% after 1.5 years in the field. Practical recommendations are given to obtain equations for Federal-Equivalent-Method-comparable measurements considering variability and cost.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Massive traffic jam is the top concern of multiple disciplines (Civil Engineering, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and Government Policy) presently. Although literature constitutes several IoT-based congestion detection schemes, the existing schemes are costly (money and time) and, as well as challenging to deploy due to its complex structure. In the same context, this paper proposes a smart route Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV)-based congestion detection and avoidance (IoV-based CDA) scheme for a particular area of interest (AOI), i.e., road intersection point. The proposed scheme has two broad parts: (1) IoV-based congestion detection (IoV-based CD); and (2) IoV-based congestion avoidance (IoV-based CA). In the given area of interest, the congestion detection phase sets a parametric approach to calculate the capacity of each entry point for real-time traffic congestion detection. On each road segment, the installed roadside unit (RSU) assesses the traffic status concerning two factors: (a) occupancy rate and (b) occupancy time. If the values of these factors (either a or b) exceed the threshold limits, then congestion will be detected in real time. Next, IoV-based congestion avoidance triggers rerouting using modified Evolving Graph (EG)-Dijkstra, if the number of arriving vehicles or the occupancy time of an individual vehicle exceeds the thresholds. Moreover, the rerouting scheme in IoV-based congestion avoidance also considers the capacity of the alternate routes to avoid the possibility of moving congestion from one place to another. From the experimental results, we determine that proposed IoV-based congestion detection and avoidance significantly improves (i.e., 80%) the performance metrics (i.e., path cost, travel time, travelling speed) in low segment size scenarios than the previous microscopic congestion detection protocol (MCDP). Although in the case of simulation time, the performance increase depends on traffic congestion status (low, medium, high, massive), the performance increase varies from 0 to 100%.

AB  - The growing trend in electrical vehicle (EV) deployment has transformed independent power network and transportation network studies into highly congested interdependent network performance evaluations assessing their impact on power and transportation systems. Electrified transportation is highly capable of intensifying the interdependent correlations across charging service, transportation, and power networks. However, the evaluation of the complex coupled relationship across charging services, transportation, and power networks poses several challenges, including an impact on charging scheduling, traffic congestion, charging loads on the power grid, and high costs. Therefore, this article presents comparative survey analytics of large-scale EV integration&rsquo;s impact on charging service network scheduling, transportation networks, and power networks. Moreover, price mechanism strategies to determine the charging fares, minimize investment profits, diminish traffic congestion, and reduce power distribution constraints under the influence of various factors were carried out. Additionally, the survey analysis stipulates the interdependent network performance index, ascertaining travel distance, route selection, long-term and short-term planning, and different infrastructure strategies. Finally, the limitations of the proposed study, potential research trends, and critical technologies are demonstrated for future inquiries.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - The proper management of a municipal water system is essential to sustain cities and support the water security of societies. Urban water estimating has always been a challenging task for managers of water utilities and policymakers. This paper applies a novel methodology that includes data pre-processing and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) optimized with the Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA-ANN) to estimate monthly water demand in relation to previous water consumption. Historical data of monthly water consumption in the Gauteng Province, South Africa, for the period 2007&ndash;2016, were selected for the creation and evaluation of the methodology. Data pre-processing techniques played a crucial role in the enhancing of the quality of the data before creating the prediction model. The BSA-ANN model yielded the best result with a root mean square error and a coefficient of efficiency of 0.0099 mega liters and 0.979, respectively. Moreover, it proved more efficient and reliable than the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA-ANN), based on the scale of error. Overall, this paper presents a new application for the hybrid model BSA-ANN that can be successfully used to predict water demand with high accuracy, in a city that heavily suffers from the impact of climate change and population growth.

AB  - Air pollution in urban regions remains a crucial subject of study, given its implications on health and environment, where much effort is often put into monitoring pollutants and producing accurate trend estimates over time, employing expensive tools and sensors. In this work, we study the problem of air quality estimation in the urban area of Milan (IT), proposing different machine learning approaches that combine meteorological and transit-related features to produce affordable estimates without introducing sensor measurements into the computation. We investigated different configurations employing machine and deep learning models, namely a linear regressor, an Artificial Neural Network using Bayesian regularization, a Random Forest regressor and a Long Short Term Memory network. Our experiments show that affordable estimation results over the pollutants can be achieved even with simpler linear models, therefore suggesting that reasonably accurate Air Quality Index (AQI) measurements can be obtained without the need for expensive equipment.

VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is one of the most important use cases related to smart cities. In addition to assisting traffic management authorities, traffic forecasting can help drivers to choose the best path to their destinations. Accurate traffic forecasting is a basic requirement for traffic management. We propose a traffic forecasting approach that utilizes air pollution and atmospheric parameters. Air pollution levels are often associated with traffic intensity, and much work is already available in which air pollution has been predicted using road traffic. However, to the best of our knowledge, an attempt to improve forecasting road traffic using air pollution and atmospheric parameters is not yet available in the literature. In our preliminary experiments, we found out the relation between traffic intensity, air pollution, and atmospheric parameters. Therefore, we believe that addition of air pollutants and atmospheric parameters can improve the traffic forecasting. Our method uses air pollution gases, including     C O , N O , N  O 2  , N  O x  ,     and     O 3    . We chose these gases because they are associated with road traffic. Some atmospheric parameters, including pressure, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed have also been considered, as these parameters can play an important role in the dispersion of the above-mentioned gases. Data related to traffic flow, air pollution, and the atmosphere were collected from the open data portal of Madrid, Spain. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) was used in this paper to perform traffic forecasting.

AB  - Currently, there is great interest in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels (and other non-renewable energy sources) in order to preserve the environment; smart buildings are commonly proposed for this purpose as they are capable of producing their own energy and using it optimally. However, at times, solar energy is not able to supply the energy demand fully; it is mandatory to know the quantity of energy needed to optimize the system. This research focuses on the prediction of output temperature from a solar thermal collector. The aim is to measure solar thermal energy and optimize the energy system of a house (or building). The dataset used in this research has been taken from a real installation in a bio-climate house located on the Sotavento Experimental Wind Farm, in north-west Spain. A hybrid intelligent model has been developed by combining clustering and regression methods such as neural networks, polynomial regression, and support vector machines. The main findings show that, by dividing the dataset into small clusters on the basis of similarity in behavior, it is possible to create more accurate models. Moreover, combining different regression methods for each cluster provides better results than when a global model of the whole dataset is used. In temperature prediction, mean absolute error was lower than 4      ∘    C.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) learning involves the acquisition of transversal skills ranging from the development based on IoT devices and sensors (edge computing) to the connection of the devices themselves to management environments that allow the storage and processing (cloud computing) of data generated by sensors. The usual development cycle for IoT applications consists of the following three stages: stage 1 corresponds to the description of the devices and basic interaction with sensors. In stage 2, data acquired by the devices/sensors are employed by communication models from the origin edge to the management middleware in the cloud. Finally, stage 3 focuses on processing and presentation models. These models present the most relevant indicators for IoT devices and sensors. Students must acquire all the necessary skills and abilities to understand and develop these types of applications, so lecturers need an infrastructure to enable the learning of development of full IoT applications. A Web of Things (WoT) platform named Labs of Things at UNED (LoT@UNED) has been used for this goal. This paper shows the fundamentals and features of this infrastructure, and how the different phases of the full development cycle of solutions in IoT environments are implemented using LoT@UNED. The proposed system has been tested in several computer science subjects. Students can perform remote experimentation with a collaborative WoT learning environment in the cloud, including the possibility to analyze the generated data by IoT sensors.

AB  - The detection of activities of daily living (ADL) and the detection of falls is of utmost importance for addressing the issue of serious injuries and death as a consequence of elderly people falling. Wearable sensors can provide a viable solution for monitoring people in danger of falls with minimal external involvement from health or care home workers. In this work, we recorded accelerometer data from 35 healthy individuals performing various ADLs, as well as falls. Spatial and frequency domain features were extracted and used for the training of machine learning models with the aim of distinguishing between fall and no fall events, as well as between falls and other ADLs. Supervised classification experiments demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed approach, achieving an F1-score of 98.41% for distinguishing between fall and no fall events, and an F1-score of 88.11% for distinguishing between various ADLs, including falls. Furthermore, the created dataset, named &ldquo;ShimFall&amp;ADL&rdquo; will be publicly released to facilitate further research on the field.

AB  - Energy efficiency is a major concern to achieve sustainability in modern society. Smart cities sustainability depends on the availability of energy-efficient infrastructures and services. Buildings compose most of the city, and they are responsible for most of the energy consumption and emissions to the atmosphere (40%). Smart cities need smart buildings to achieve sustainability goals. Building&rsquo;s thermal modeling is essential to face the energy efficiency race. In this paper, we show how ICT and data science technologies and techniques can be applied to evaluate the energy efficiency of buildings. In concrete, we apply machine learning techniques to classify buildings based on their energy efficiency. Particularly, our focus is on single-family buildings in residential areas. Along this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of machine learning techniques to classify buildings depending on their energy efficiency. Moreover, we analyze and compare the performance of different classifiers. Furthermore, we introduce new parameters which have some impact on the buildings thermal modeling, especially those concerning the environment where the building is located. We also make an insight on ICT and remark the growing relevance in data acquisition and monitoring of relevant parameters by using wireless sensor networks. It is worthy to remark the need for an appropriate and reliable dataset to achieve the best results. Moreover, we demonstrate that reliable classification is feasible with a few featured parameters.

Their aim is to enable Australian communities to benefit from &ldquo;smart city&rdquo; initiatives by providing greater efficiencies in their operations and strategic planning. Increasing numbers of datasets are being made freely available to the public. These so-called big data are amenable to data science analysis techniques including machine learning. While there are many cases of data use at the federal and state level, local councils are not taking full advantage of their data for a variety of reasons.

The increased speeds and reduced delay enable novel applications such as connected vehicles, large-scale IoT, video streaming, and industry robotics. Machine Learning (ML) is leveraged within mobile edge computing to predict changes in demand based on cultural events, natural disasters, or daily commute patterns, and it prepares the network by automatically scaling up network resources as needed. Together, mobile edge computing and ML enable seamless automation of network management to reduce operational costs and enhance user experience.

AB  - Under the vigorous development of global anticipatory computing in recent years, there have been numerous applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in people&rsquo;s daily lives. Learning analytics of big data can assist students, teachers, and school administrators to gain new knowledge and estimate learning information; in turn, the enhanced education contributes to the rapid development of science and technology. Education is sustainable life learning, as well as the most important promoter of science and technology worldwide. In recent years, a large number of anticipatory computing applications based on AI have promoted the training professional AI talent. As a result, this study aims to design a set of interactive robot-assisted teaching for classroom setting to help students overcoming academic difficulties. Teachers, students, and robots in the classroom can interact with each other through the ARCS motivation model in programming. The proposed method can help students to develop the motivation, relevance, and confidence in learning, thus enhancing their learning effectiveness. The robot, like a teaching assistant, can help students solving problems in the classroom by answering questions and evaluating students&rsquo; answers in natural and responsive interactions. The natural interactive responses of the robot are achieved through the use of a database of emotional big data (Google facial expression comparison dataset). The robot is loaded with an emotion recognition system to assess the moods of the students through their expressions and sounds, and then offer corresponding emotional responses. The robot is able to communicate naturally with the students, thereby attracting their attention, triggering their learning motivation, and improving their learning effectiveness.

AB  - A probabilistic prediction interval (PI) model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and a kernel extreme learning machine using the firefly algorithm (FA-KELM) is presented to tackle the problem of photovoltaic (PV) power for intra-day-ahead prediction. Firstly, considering the non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of a PV power output sequence, the decomposition of the original PV power output series is carried out using VMD. Secondly, to further improve the prediction accuracy, KELM is established for each decomposed component and the firefly algorithm is introduced to optimize the penalty factor and kernel parameter. Finally, the point predicted value is obtained through the summation of predicted results of each component and then using the nonlinear kernel density estimation to fit it. The cubic spline interpolation algorithm is applied to obtain the shortest confidence interval. Results from practical cases show that this probabilistic prediction interval could achieve higher accuracy as compared with other prediction models.

AB  - Based on the rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), all industries are preparing for a paradigm shift as a result of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Therefore, it is necessary to study the importance and diffusion of technology and, through this, the development and direction of core technologies. Leading countries such as the United States and China are focusing on artificial intelligence (AI)&rsquo;s great potential and are working to establish a strategy to preempt the continued superiority of national competitiveness through AI technology. This is because artificial intelligence technology can be applied to all industries, and it is expected to change the industrial structure and create various business models. This study analyzed the leading artificial intelligence technology to strengthen the market&rsquo;s environment and industry competitiveness. We then analyzed the lifecycle of the technology and evaluated the direction of sustainable development in industry. This study collected and studied patents in the field of artificial intelligence from the US Patent Office, where technology-related patents are concentrated. All patents registered as artificial intelligence technology were analyzed by text mining, using the abstracts of each patent. The topic was extracted through topic modeling and defined as a detailed technique. Promising/mature skills were analyzed through a regression analysis of the extracted topics. In addition, the Bass model was applied to the promising technologies, and each technology was studied in terms of the technology lifecycle. Eleven topics were extracted via topic modeling. A regression analysis was conducted to identify the most promising/mature technology, and the results were analyzed with three promising technologies and five mature technologies. Promising technologies include Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR), Image Recognition and Identification Technology. Mature technologies include pattern recognition, machine learning platforms, natural language processing, knowledge representation, optimization, and solving. This study conducts a quantitative analysis using patent data to derive promising technologies and then presents the objective results. In addition, this work then applies the Bass model to the promising artificial intelligence technology to evaluate the development potential and technology diffusion of each technology in terms of its growth cycle. Through this, the growth cycle of AI technology is analyzed in a complex manner, and this study then predicts the replacement timing between competing technologies.

The paper sets out the historical precedents for economic transitions after collapses that unleash new technologically based innovation waves. These are shown to be associated with different energy and infrastructure priorities and their transport and resulting urban forms. The new technologies in the past were emerging but mainstreamed as the new economy was built on new investments. The paper suggests that the new economy, for the next 30 years, is likely to be driven by the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agendas (summarised as zero carbon–zero poverty) and will have a strong base in a cluster of innovative technologies: renewable energy, electromobility, smart cities, hydrogen-based industry, circular economy technologies, and biophilic urbanism. The first three are well underway, and the other three will need interventions if not cultural changes and may miss being mainstreamed in this recovery but could still play a minor role in the new economy. The resulting urban transformations are likely to build on Covid-19 through “global localism” and could lead to five new features: (1) relocalised centres with distributed infrastructure, (2) tailored innovations in each urban fabric, (3) less car dependence, (4) symbiotic partnerships for funding, and (5) rewritten manuals for urban professionals. This period needs human creativity to play a role in revitalising the human dimension of cities. The next wave following this may be more about regenerative development.

AB  - This study explores ways to improve the security systems of emerging smart cities by conducting a case study of the smart crime prevention service of the Incheon Free Economic Zone (IFEZ) in South Korea. Data from the IFEZ were collected between January 2017 and December 2018 across the smart system&rsquo;s four functional areas (intelligent video surveillance, suspicious vehicle surveillance, emergency alerts, and abnormal sound sources) and 10 types of situations (emergency, violence, civil complaints, intrusion, kidnapping, loitering, throwing, suspicious vehicle, collision explosion, and sudden event). Descriptive statistics were analyzed to show the limitation of the smart crime prevention service. The results revealed three significant insights into the best practices for smart crime prevention services in smart cities: first, smart crime prevention services are required to verify the accuracy and consistency of collected data; second, the government must establish a consistent process to link all crime prevention services and to secure data linkages; and third, the government must urgently foster and secure experts in specialized institutions to carry out these advised functions. Ultimately, these findings suggest that in-depth discussions of data collection and sharing are required to ensure the optimal development of smart city security services.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular in surveillance, security, and remote monitoring. However, they also pose serious security threats to public privacy. The timely detection of a malicious drone is currently an open research issue for security provisioning companies. Recently, the problem has been addressed by a plethora of schemes. However, each plan has a limitation, such as extreme weather conditions and huge dataset requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework consisting of the hybrid handcrafted and deep feature to detect and localize malicious drones from their sound and image information. The respective datasets include sounds and occluded images of birds, airplanes, and thunderstorms, with variations in resolution and illumination. Various kernels of the support vector machine (SVM) are applied to classify the features. Experimental results validate the improved performance of the proposed scheme compared to other related methods.

VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The ever-growing and widespread use of touch, face, full-body, and 3D mid-air gesture recognition sensors in domestic and industrial settings is serving to highlight whether interactive gestures are sufficiently inclusive, and whether or not they can be executed by all users. The purpose of this study was to analyze full-body gestures from the point of view of user experience using the Microsoft Kinect sensor, to identify which gestures are easy for individuals living with Down syndrome. With this information, app developers can satisfy Design for All (DfA) requirements by selecting suitable gestures from existing lists of gesture sets. A set of twenty full-body gestures were analyzed in this study; to do so, the research team developed an application to measure the success/failure rates and execution times of each gesture. The results show that the failure rate for gesture execution is greater than the success rate, and that there is no difference between male and female participants in terms of execution times or the successful execution of gestures. Through this study, we conclude that, in general, people living with Down syndrome are not able to perform certain full-body gestures correctly. This is a direct consequence of limitations resulting from characteristic physical and motor impairments. As a consequence, the Microsoft Kinect sensor cannot identify the gestures. It is important to remember this fact when developing gesture-based on Human Computer Interaction (HCI) applications that use the Kinect sensor as an input device when the apps are going to be used by people who have such disabilities.

AB  - This manuscript identifies and documents unsolved problems and research challenges in the extended reality (XR) domain (i.e., virtual (VR), augmented (AR), and mixed reality (MR)). The manuscript is structured to include technology, design, and human factor perspectives. The text is visualization/display-focused, that is, other modalities such as audio, haptic, smell, and touch, while important for XR, are beyond the scope of this paper. We further narrow our focus to mainly geospatial research, with necessary deviations to other domains where these technologies are widely researched. The main objective of the study is to provide an overview of broader research challenges and directions in XR, especially in spatial sciences. Aside from the research challenges identified based on a comprehensive literature review, we provide case studies with original results from our own studies in each section as examples to demonstrate the relevance of the challenges in the current research. We believe that this paper will be of relevance to anyone who has scientific interest in extended reality, and/or uses these systems in their research.

TI  - Quantum Diffie–Hellman Extended to Dynamic Quantum Group Key Agreement for e-Healthcare Multi-Agent Systems in Smart Cities
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 14
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Multi-Agent Systems can support e-Healthcare applications for improving quality of life of citizens. In this direction, we propose a healthcare system architecture named smart healthcare city. First, we divide a given city into various zones and then we propose a zonal level three-layered system architecture. Further, for effectiveness we introduce a Multi-Agent System (MAS) in this three-layered architecture. Protecting sensitive health information of citizens is a major security concern. Group key agreement (GKA) is the corner stone for securely sharing the healthcare data among the healthcare stakeholders of the city. For establishing GKA, many efficient cryptosystems are available in the classical field. However, they are yet dependent on the supposition that some computational problems are infeasible. In light of quantum mechanics, a new field emerges to share a secret key among two or more members. The unbreakable and highly secure features of key agreement based on fundamental laws of physics allow us to propose a Quantum GKA (QGKA) technique based on renowned Quantum Diffie&ndash;Hellman (QDH). In this, a node acts as a Group Controller (GC) and forms 2-party groups with remaining nodes, establishing a QDH-style shared key per each two-party. It then joins these keys into a single group key by means of a XOR-operation, acting as a usual group node. Furthermore, we extend the QGKA to Dynamic QGKA (DQGKA) by adding join and leave protocol. Our protocol performance was compared with existing QGKA protocols in terms of Qubit efficiency (QE), unitary operation (UO), unitary operation efficiency (UOE), key consistency check (KCC), security against participants attack (SAP) and satisfactory results were obtained. The security analysis of the proposed technique is based on unconditional security of QDH. Moreover, it is secured against internal and external attack. In this way, e-healthcare Multi-Agent System can be robust against future quantum-based attacks.

AB  - Since the 20th century, the deterioration of the ecological environment around the world has challenged urban space construction. With the development of urbanization, the consumption of resources and energy has increased, the level of biodiversity has decreased, environmental pollution is approaching the critical level, and the contradiction between human habitat activity and ecological environment has become increasingly prominent. The sustainable development of urban space along with its economic and social benefits, taking into account the quality of life and ecological environment, has become a new and important subject that needs to be explored. In this study, the indices of the evaluation system for sustainable urban spatial development in regions with underdeveloped economies but rich in ecological resources are arranged in sequence through the systematic coupling analysis of collaborative evaluation information and a quantitative analysis. The influences of urban space elements on sustainable urban development are disclosed. On the basis of the generated data, an evaluation system for sustainable urban spatial development with a complete set of information is proposed. The proposed system is applicable to urban spatial development evaluation in regions in China with underdeveloped economies but rich in ecological capital. First, the basic concept of system coupling is introduced, and a coupling relationship between urban sustainable development and urban space is proposed. Second, the elements of urban space and the sustainable development in the Qin-Ba mountain area are extracted, and the precedence diagram method is used to construct a sustainable evaluation system for urban space development in the Qin-Ba mountain area. Third, the sustainable evaluation process of urban spatial development is proposed. Finally, the sustainable evaluation system for urban spatial development in the Qin-Ba mountain area is applied to evaluate the urban spatial development in Shangluo, Qin-Ling Mountains, China. The results show that, among the investigated 14 indicators, the proportion of industrial land use mainly influences sustainable urban spatial development. As for the rest of the index factors, per capita green land area and green coverage ratio of built-up areas, per capita urban construction land area, proportion of forestry area, greening rate of built-up areas, total industrial dust emission density, proportion of cultivated area, and average volume fraction of residential areas are the secondary influencing factors of sustainable urban spatial development. The evaluation system in this research is constructed with the three aspects of &ldquo;green coordination&rdquo;, &ldquo;green development&rdquo;, and &ldquo;green sustainability&rdquo; of sustainable urban spatial development, and it complements the evaluation contents of urban&ndash;rural ecological space coordination, land resource protection, and green development community, and so on. The conclusion of this study not only can provide a useful reference for urban spatial development planning for underdeveloped ecological capital areas of China but also can provide a theoretical basis for the management and control policy of sustainable urban spatial development.

TI  - Non-Contact Sensing Testbed for Post-Surgery Monitoring by Exploiting Artificial-Intelligence
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Non-contact health care monitoring is a unique feature in the emerging 5G networks that is achieved by exploiting artificial intelligence (AI). The ratio of the number of health care problems and patients is increasing exponentially and creating burgeoning data. The integration of AI and Internet of things (IoT) systems enables us to increase the huge volume of data to be generated. The approach by which AI is applied to the IoT systems enhances the intelligence of the health care system. In post-surgery monitoring of the patient, timely consultation is essential before further loss. Unfortunately, even after the advice of the doctor to the patient, he/she may forget to perform the activity in the correct way, which may lead to complications in recovery. In this research, the idea is to design a non-contact sensing testbed using AI for the classification of post-surgery activities. Universal software-defined radio peripheral (USRP) is utilized to collect the data of spinal cord operated patients during weight lifting activity. The wireless channel state information (WCSI) is extracted by using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique. AI applies machine learning to classify the correct and wrong way of weight lifting activity that was considered for experimental analysis. The accuracy achieved by the proposed testbed by using a fine K-nearest neighbor (FKNN) algorithm is 99.6%.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to apply the novel bivariate weights-of-evidence-based SysFor (SF) for landslide susceptibility mapping, and two machine learning techniques, namely the na&iuml;ve Bayes (NB) and Radial basis function networks (RBFNetwork), as benchmark models. Firstly, by using aerial photos and geological field surveys, the 263 landslide locations in the study area were obtained. Next, the identified landslides were randomly classified according to the ratio of 70/30 to construct training data and validation models, respectively. Secondly, based on the landslide inventory map, combined with the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the study area, 14 affecting factors of the landslide were determined. The predictive ability of the selected factors was evaluated using the LSVM model. Using the WoE model, the relationship between landslides and affecting factors was analyzed by positive and negative correlation methods. The above three hybrid models were then used to map landslide susceptibility. Thirdly, the ROC curve and various statistical data (SE, 95% CI and MAE) were used to verify and compare the predictive power of the model. Compared with the other two models, the Sysfor model had a larger area under the curve (AUC) of 0.876 (training dataset) and 0.783 (validation dataset). Finally, by quantitatively comparing the susceptibility values of each pixel, the differences in spatial morphology of landslide susceptibility maps were compared, and the model was found to have limitations and effectiveness. The landslide susceptibility maps obtained by the three models are reasonable, and the landslide susceptibility maps generated by the SysFor model have the highest comprehensive performance. The results obtained in this paper can help local governments in land use planning, disaster reduction and environmental protection.

AB  - Concerned about the noise pollution in urban environments, the European Commission (EC) has created an Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC (END) requiring Member states to publish noise maps and noise management plans every five years for cities with a high density of inhabitants, major roads, railways and airports. The END also requires the noise pressure levels for these sources to be presented independently. Currently, data measurements and the representations of the noise pressure levels in such maps are performed semi-manually by experts. This process is time and cost consuming, as well as limited to presenting only a static picture of the noise levels. To overcome these issues, we propose the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks with several nodes in urban environments that can enable the generation of real-time noise level maps, as well as detect the source of the sound thanks to machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we briefly review the state of the art of the hardware used in wireless acoustic applications and propose a low-cost sensor based on an ARM cortex-A microprocessor. This node is able to process machine learning algorithms for sound source detection in-situ, allowing the deployment of highly scalable sound identification systems.

AB  - Smart health-care is undergoing rapid transformation from the conventional specialist and hospital-focused style to a distributed patient-focused manner. Several technological developments have encouraged this rapid revolution of health-care vertical. Currently, 4G and other communication standards are used in health-care for smart health-care services and applications. These technologies are crucial for the evolution of future smart health-care services. With the growth in the health-care industry, several applications are expected to produce a massive amount of data in different format and size. Such immense and diverse data needs special treatment concerning the end-to-end delay, bandwidth, latency and other attributes. It is difficult for current communication technologies to fulfil the requirements of highly dynamic and time-sensitive health care applications of the future. Therefore, the 5G networks are being designed and developed to tackle the diverse communication needs of health-care applications in Internet of Things (IoT). 5G assisted smart health-care networks are an amalgamation of IoT devices that require improved network performance and enhanced cellular coverage. Current connectivity solutions for IoT face challenges, such as the support for a massive number of devices, standardisation, energy-efficiency, device density, and security. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of 5G assisted smart health-care solutions in IoT. We present a structure for smart health-care in 5G by categorizing and classifying existing literature. We also present key requirements for successful deployment of smart health-care systems for certain scenarios in 5G. Finally, we discuss several open issues and research challenges in 5G smart health-care solutions in IoT.

AB  - Over the last years, existing technologies have been applied to agricultural environments, resulting in new precision agriculture systems. Some of the multiple profits of developing new agricultural technologies and applications include the cost reduction around the building and deployment of them, together with more energy-efficient consumption. Therefore, agricultural precision systems focus on developing better, easier, cheaper, and overall more efficient ways of handling agricultural monitoring and actuation. To achieve this vision, we use a set of technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks, Sensors devices, Internet of Things, or data analysis. More specifically, in this study, we proposed a combination of all these technologies to design and develop a prototype of a precision agriculture system for medium and small agriculture plantations that highlights two major advantages: efficient energy management with self-charging capabilities and a low-cost policy. For the development of the project, several prototype nodes were built and deployed within a sensor network connected to the cloud as a self-powered system. The final target of this system is, therefore, to gather environment data, analyze it, and actuate by activating the watering installation. An analysis of the exposed agriculture monitoring system, in addition to results, is exposed in the paper.

AB  - Considering the increasing use of emerging technologies in industrialized construction in recent years, the primary objective of this article is to develop and validate predictive models to predict the emerging technology utilization level of industrialized construction industry practitioners. Our preliminary research results indicate that the company background and personal career profiles can significantly affect practitioners&rsquo; technology utilization level. Thus, our prediction model is based on four variables: company size, company type, working experience, and working position. The United States and China are selected as the case studies to validate the prediction model. First, a well-designed questionnaire survey is distributed to the industrialized construction industry practitioners from the two countries, which leads to 81 and 99 valid responses separately. Then, ordinal logistic regression is used to develop a set of models to predict the practitioners&rsquo; utilization level of the four main technology types. Finally, the external test dataset consisting of 16 cases indicates the prediction models have a high accuracy. The results also reflect some differences of the technology utilization status in the industrialized construction industry between the United States and China. The major contribution of this research is offering an efficient and accurate method to predict practitioners&rsquo; technology utilization level in industrialized construction. Significantly, the models are believed to have a wide application in promoting the emerging technologies in the actual industrialized construction.

AB  - The emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) which was declared a pandemic has spread to 210 countries worldwide. It has had a significant impact on health systems and economic, educational and social facets of contemporary society. As the rate of transmission increases, various collaborative approaches among stakeholders to develop innovative means of screening, detecting and diagnosing COVID-19&rsquo;s cases among human beings at a commensurate rate have evolved. Further, the utility of computing models associated with the fourth industrial revolution technologies in achieving the desired feat has been highlighted. However, there is a gap in terms of the accuracy of detection and prediction of COVID-19 cases and tracing contacts of infected persons. This paper presents a review of computing models that can be adopted to enhance the performance of detecting and predicting the COVID-19 pandemic cases. We focus on big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that can be adopted in the current pandemic. The review suggested that artificial intelligence models have been used for the case detection of COVID-19. Similarly, big data platforms have also been applied for tracing contacts. However, the nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that have demonstrated good performance in feature selection of medical issues are yet to be explored for case detection and tracing of contacts in the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study holds salient implications for practitioners and researchers alike as it elucidates the potentials of NIC in the accurate detection of pandemic cases and optimized contact tracing.

AB  - The rising availability of digital traces provides a fertile ground for data-driven solutions to problems in cities. However, even though a massive data set analyzed with data science methods may provide a powerful and cost-effective solution to a problem, its adoption by relevant stakeholders is not guaranteed due to adoption barriers such as lack of interpretability and interoperability. In this context, this paper proposes a methodology toward bridging two disciplines, data science and transportation, to identify, understand, and solve transportation planning problems with data-driven solutions that are suitable for adoption by urban planners and policy makers. The methodology is defined by four steps where people from both disciplines go from algorithm and model definition to the development of a potentially adoptable solution with evaluated outputs. We describe how this methodology was applied to define a model to infer commuting trips with mode of transportation from mobile phone data, and we report the lessons learned during the process.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Sensor networks in real-world environments, such as smart cities or ambient intelligent platforms, provide applications with large and heterogeneous sets of data streams. Outliers—observations that do not conform to an expected behavior—has then turned into a crucial task to establish and maintain secure and reliable databases in this kind of platforms. However, the procedures to obtain accurate models for erratic observations have to operate with low complexity in terms of storage and computational time, in order to attend the limited processing and storage capabilities of the sensor nodes in these environments. In this work, we analyze three binary classifiers based on three statistical prediction models—ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average), GAM (Generalized Additive Model), and LOESS (LOcal RegrESSion)—for outlier detection with low memory consumption and computational time rates. As a result, we provide (1) the best classifier and settings to detect outliers, based on the ARIMA model, and (2) two real-world classified datasets as ground truths for future research.

AB  - Managerial and Business Economics (ME/BE) aims at using quantitative and computational methods to make an efficient (ideally optimal) assignment of the scarce resources owned by firms and organizations. In the current global market, characterized by a fierce competition, an optimal use of the available resources is more important than ever for guaranteeing the economical sustainability of organizations and enterprises of any size. Heuristic optimization algorithms and simulation methods have been successfully employed to analyze and enhance complex systems and processes in a myriad of ME/BE-related fields. This paper reviews recent works on the use of these methodologies in competitive markets, as well as in imperfect markets considering externalities. The paper also discusses open challenges and how state-of-the art methods combining optimization, simulation, and machine learning can contribute to properly address them.

TI  - Enhancing City Sustainability through Smart Technologies: A Framework for Automatic Pre-Emptive Action to Promote Safety and Security Using Lighting and ICT-Based Surveillance
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 15
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The scope of the present paper is to promote social, cultural and environmental sustainability in cities by establishing a conceptual framework and the relationship amongst safety in urban public space (UPS), lighting and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-based surveillance. This framework uses available technologies and tools, as these can be found in urban equipment such as lighting posts, to enhance security and safety in UPS, ensuring protection against attempted criminal activity. Through detailed literary research, publications on security and safety concerning crime and lighting can be divided into two periods, the first one pre-1994, and the second one from 2004&ndash;2008. Since then, a significant reduction in the number of publications dealing with lighting and crime is observed, while at the same time, the urban nightscape has been reshaped with the immersion of light-emitting diode (LED) technologies. Especially in the last decade, where most municipalities in the EU28 (European Union of all the member states from the accession of Croatia in 2013 to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020) are refurbishing their road lighting with LED technology and the consideration of smart networks and surveillance is under development, the use of lighting to deter possible attempted felonies in UPS is not addressed. To capitalize on the potential of lighting as a deterrent, this paper proposes a framework that uses existing technology, namely, dimmable LED light sources, presence sensors, security cameras, as well as emerging techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled image recognition algorithms and big data analytics and presents a possible system that could be developed as a stand-alone product to alert possible dangerous situations, deter criminal activity and promote the perception of safety thus linking lighting and ICT-based surveillance towards safety and security in UPS.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This paper addresses the voltage control problem in medium-voltage distribution networks. The objective is to cost-efficiently maintain the voltage profile within a safe range, in presence of uncertainties in both the future working conditions, as well as the physical parameters of the system. Indeed, the voltage profile depends not only on the fluctuating renewable-based power generation and load demand, but also on the physical parameters of the system components. In reality, the characteristics of loads, lines and transformers are subject to complex and dynamic dependencies, which are difficult to model. In such a context, the quality of the control strategy depends on the accuracy of the power flow representation, which requires to capture the non-linear behavior of the power network. Relying on the detailed analytical models (which are still subject to uncertainties) introduces a high computational power that does not comply with the real-time constraint of the voltage control task. To address this issue, while avoiding arbitrary modeling approximations, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning model to ensure an autonomous grid operational control. Outcomes show that the proposed model-free approach offers a promising alternative to find a compromise between calculation time, conservativeness and economic performance.

T2  - Energies

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 15
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Increasing waste generation has become a significant issue over the globe due to the rapid increase in urbanization and industrialization. In the literature, many issues that have a direct impact on the increase of waste and the improper disposal of waste have been investigated. Most of the existing work in the literature has focused on providing a cost-efficient solution for the monitoring of garbage collection system using the Internet of Things (IoT). Though an IoT-based solution provides the real-time monitoring of a garbage collection system, it is limited to control the spreading of overspill and bad odor blowout gasses. The poor and inadequate disposal of waste produces toxic gases, and radiation in the environment has adverse effects on human health, the greenhouse system, and global warming. While considering the importance of air pollutants, it is imperative to monitor and forecast the concentration of air pollutants in addition to the management of the waste. In this paper, we present and IoT-based smart bin using a machine and deep learning model to manage the disposal of garbage and to forecast the air pollutant present in the surrounding bin environment. The smart bin is connected to an IoT-based server, the Google Cloud Server (GCP), which performs the computation necessary for predicting the status of the bin and for forecasting air quality based on real-time data. We experimented with a traditional model (k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) and logistic reg) and a non-traditional (long short term memory (LSTM) network-based deep learning) algorithm for the creation of alert messages regarding bin status and forecasting the amount of air pollutant carbon monoxide (CO) present in the air at a specific instance. The recalls of logistic regression and k-NN algorithm is 79% and 83%, respectively, in a real-time testing environment for predicting the status of the bin. The accuracy of modified LSTM and simple LSTM models is 90% and 88%, respectively, to predict the future concentration of gases present in the air. The system resulted in a delay of 4 s in the creation and transmission of the alert message to a sanitary worker. The system provided the real-time monitoring of garbage levels along with notifications from the alert mechanism. The proposed works provide improved accuracy by utilizing machine learning as compared to existing solutions based on simple approaches.

T2  - Energies

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) have proven to be a crucial factor to decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere. However, there are various hurdles that impede people from purchasing EVs. For example, long charging time, short driving range, cost and insufficient charging infrastructures available, etc. This article reports the public perception of EV-adoption using statistical analyses and proposes some recommendations for improving EV-adoption in Qatar. User perspectives on EV-adoption barriers in Qatar were investigated based on survey questionnaires. The survey questionnaires were based on similar studies done in other regions of the world. The study attempted to look at different perspectives of the adoption of EV, when asked to a person who is aware of EVs (technical respondents&mdash;people studying/working at universities/research centers and policy makers) or a person who may or may not be aware of EVs (non-technical respondents&mdash;people working in banks, governments and private non-academic organizations, etc.). Cumulative survey responses from the two groups were compared and analyzed using two-sample t-test statistical analysis. Detailed analyses showed that&mdash;among various major hindrances&mdash;raising of public awareness of such greener modes of transportation, the availability of charging options in more places and policy incentives towards EVs would play a major role in EV-adoption. The authors provide recommendations that&mdash;along with government incentives&mdash;could help make a gradual shift to a greater number of EVs convenient for people of Qatar. The proposed systematic approach for such a study and analysis may help in streamlining research on policies, infrastructures and technologies for efficient penetration of EVs in Qatar.

This has been shown by a pandemic like Coronavirus disease 2019; this global emergency has changed the way people interact, communicate, study, or work. In short, the way in which society carries out all activities has changed. This includes education, which has bet on the use of information and communication technologies to reach students. An example of the aforementioned is the use of learning management systems, which have become ideal environments for resource management and the development of activities. This work proposes the integration of technologies, such as artificial intelligence and data analysis, with learning management systems in order to improve learning. This objective is outlined in a new normality that seeks robust educational models, where certain activities are carried out in an online mode, surrounded by technologies that allow students to have virtual assistants to guide them in their learning.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In recent years, technological advances and the ever-increasing power of embedded systems have seen the emergence of so-called smart cities. In these cities, application needs are increasingly calling for Large-Scale Wireless Sensor Networks (LS-WSN). However, the design and implementation of such networks pose several important and interesting challenges. These low-cost, low-power devices are characterized by limited computing, memory storage, communication, and battery power capabilities. Moreover, sensors are often required to cooperate in order to route the collected data to a single central node (or sink). The many-to-one communication model that governs dense and widely deployed Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) most often leads to problems of network overload and congestion. Indeed, it is easy to show that the closer a node is geographical to the sink, the more data sources it has to relay. This leads to several problems including overloading of nodes close to the sink, high loss rate in the area close to the sink, and poor distribution of power consumption that directly affects the lives of these networks. In this context, we propose a contribution to the problem of LS-WSN energy consumption. We designed a hierarchical 3-tier architecture of LS-WSNs coupled with a modeling of the activities of the different sensors in the network. This architecture that is based on clustering also includes a redeployment function to maintain the topology in case of coverage gaps. The results of the performed simulations show that our architecture maximizes the lifetime than compared solutions.

AB  - Cyber&ndash;Physical Systems (CPS) connect the physical world (systems, environments, and humans) with the cyber world (software, data, etc.) to intelligently enhance the operational environment they serve. CPS are distributed software and hardware components embedded in the physical world and possibly attached to humans. They offer smart features, such as enhancing and optimizing the reliability, quality, safety, health, security, efficiency, operational costs, sustainability, and maintainability of physical systems. CPS are also very vulnerable to security attacks and criminal activities. In addition, they are very complex and have a direct impact on their environment. Therefore, it is hard to detect and investigate security attacks, while such attacks may have a catastrophic impact on the physical world. As a result, CPS must incorporate security measures in addition to suitable and effective forensics capabilities. When the security measures fail and an attack occurs, it becomes imperative to perform thorough forensics analysis. Adding effective forensics tools and capabilities will support the investigations of incidents. This paper defines the field of CPS forensics and its dimensions: Technical, Organizational, and Legal. Then, it reviews examples of current research efforts in the field and the types of tools and methods they propose for CPS forensics. In addition, it discusses the issues and challenges in the field that need to be addressed by researchers and developers of CPS. The paper then uses the review outcomes to discuss future research directions to address challenges and create a more effective, efficient, and safe forensics tools and for CPS. This discussion aims to create a starting point for researchers where they can identify the gaps and challenges and create suitable solutions through their research in CPS forensics.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Monthly electric load forecasting is essential to efficiently operate urban power grids. Although diverse forecasting models based on artificial intelligence techniques have been proposed with good performance, they require sufficient datasets for training. In the case of monthly forecasting, because just one data point is generated per month, it is not easy to collect sufficient data to construct models. This lack of data can be alleviated using transfer learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel monthly electric load forecasting scheme for a city or district based on transfer learning using similar data from other cities or districts. To do this, we collected the monthly electric load data from 25 districts in Seoul for five categories and various external data, such as calendar, population, and weather data. Then, based on the available data of the target city or district, we selected similar data from the collected datasets by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient and constructed a forecasting model using the selected data. Lastly, we fine-tuned the model using the target data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conducted an extensive comparison with other popular machine-learning techniques through various experiments. We report some of the results.

AB  - The term &ldquo;Smart City&rdquo; denotes a comprehensive concept to alleviate pending problems of modern urban areas which have developed into an important work field for practitioners and scholars alike. However, the question remains as to how cities can become &ldquo;smart&rdquo;. The application of information technology is generally considered a key driver in the &ldquo;smartization&rdquo; of cities. Detailed frameworks and procedures are therefore needed to guide, operationalize, and measure the implementation process as well as the impact of the respective technologies. In this paper, we discuss blockchain technology, a novel driver of technological transformation that comprises a multitude of underlying technologies and protocols, and its potential impact on smart cities. We specifically address the question of how blockchain technology may benefit the development of urban areas. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we present a framework and research propositions. We identify nine application fields of blockchain technology in the smartization of cities: (1) healthcare, (2) logistics and supply chains, (3) mobility, (4) energy, (5) administration and services, (6) e-voting, (7) factory, (8) home and (9) education. We discuss current developments in these fields, illustrate how they are affected by blockchain technology and derive propositions to guide future research endeavors.

AB  - The electric energy production would be much more efficient if accurate estimations of the future demand were available, since these would allow allocating only the resources needed for the production of the right amount of energy required. With this motivation in mind, we propose a strategy, based on neuroevolution, that can be used to this aim. Our proposal uses a genetic algorithm in order to find a sub-optimal set of hyper-parameters for configuring a deep neural network, which can then be used for obtaining the forecasting. Such a strategy is justified by the observation that the performances achieved by deep neural networks are strongly dependent on the right setting of the hyper-parameters, and genetic algorithms have shown excellent search capabilities in huge search spaces. Moreover, we base our proposal on a distributed computing platform, which allows its use on a large time-series. In order to assess the performances of our approach, we have applied it to a large dataset, related to the electric energy consumption registered in Spain over almost 10 years. Experimental results confirm the validity of our proposal since it outperforms all other forecasting techniques to which it has been compared.

IS  - 16
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The African continent has a long history of rainfall fluctuations of varying duration and intensities. This has led to varying degrees of drought conditions, triggering research interest across the continent. The research presented here is a bibliometric analysis of scientific articles on drought monitoring and prediction published in Africa. Scientific data analysis was carried out based on bibliometric mapping techniques applied to 332 scientific publications (1980 to 2020) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. In addition, time series of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index for the previous 6 months (SPEI-6) over six regions in the continent was analysed giving the relative comparison of drought occurrences to the annual distribution of the scientific publications. The results revealed that agricultural and hydrological drought studies contributed about 75% of the total publications, while the remaining 25% was shared among socioeconomic and meteorological studies. Countries in the southern, western, and eastern regions of Africa led in terms of scientific publications during the period under review. The results further indicated that the continent experienced drought conditions in the years 1984, 1989, 1992, and 1997, thereby inducing an increase in the number of scientific publications on drought studies. The results show that the tools of analysis have also changed from simple statistics to the use of geospatial tools such as Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) models, and recently Machine Learning (ML). The ML, particularly, contributed about 11% of the total scientific publications, while RS and GIS models, and basic statistical analysis account for about 44%, 20%, and 25% respectively. The integration of spatial technologies and ML are pivotal to the development of robust drought monitoring and drought prediction systems, especially in Africa, which is considered as a drought-prone continent. The research gaps presented in this study can help prospective researchers to respond to the continental and regional drought research needs.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - The world is experiencing a rapid growth of smart cities accelerated by Industry 4.0, including the Internet of Things (IoT), and enhanced by the application of emerging innovative technologies which in turn create highly fragile and complex cyber&ndash;physical&ndash;natural ecosystems. This paper systematically identifies peer-reviewed literature and explicitly investigates empirical primary studies that address cyber resilience and digital forensic incident response (DFIR) aspects of cyber&ndash;physical systems (CPSs) in smart cities. Our findings show that CPSs addressing cyber resilience and support for modern DFIR are a recent paradigm. Most of the primary studies are focused on a subset of the incident response process, the &ldquo;detection and analysis&rdquo; phase whilst attempts to address other parts of the DFIR process remain limited. Further analysis shows that research focused on smart healthcare and smart citizen were addressed only by a small number of primary studies. Additionally, our findings identify a lack of available real CPS-generated datasets limiting the experiments to mostly testbed type environments or in some cases authors relied on simulation software. Therefore, contributing this systematic literature review (SLR), we used a search protocol providing an evidence-based summary of the key themes and main focus domains investigating cyber resilience and DFIR addressed by CPS frameworks and systems. This SLR also provides scientific evidence of the gaps in the literature for possible future directions for research within the CPS cybersecurity realm. In total, 600 papers were surveyed from which 52 primary studies were included and analysed.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Phishing is one of the most common threats that users face while browsing the web. In the current threat landscape, a targeted phishing attack (i.e., spear phishing) often constitutes the first action of a threat actor during an intrusion campaign. To tackle this threat, many data-driven approaches have been proposed, which mostly rely on the use of supervised machine learning under a single-layer approach. However, such approaches are resource-demanding and, thus, their deployment in production environments is infeasible. Moreover, most previous works utilise a feature set that can be easily tampered with by adversaries. In this paper, we investigate the use of a multi-layered detection framework in which a potential phishing domain is classified multiple times by models using different feature sets. In our work, an additional classification takes place only when the initial one scores below a predefined confidence level, which is set by the system owner. We demonstrate our approach by implementing a two-layered detection system, which uses supervised machine learning to identify phishing attacks. We evaluate our system with a dataset consisting of active phishing attacks and find that its performance is comparable to the state of the art.

AB  - Improving sustainability is a key concern for industrial development. Industry has recently been benefiting from the rise of IoT technologies, leading to improvements in the monitoring and breakdown prevention of industrial equipment. In order to properly achieve this monitoring and prevention, visualization techniques are of paramount importance. However, the visualization of real-time IoT sensor data has always been challenging, especially when such data are originated by sensors of different natures. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a methodology that aims to help users to visually locate and understand the failures that could arise in a production process.This methodology collects, in a guided manner, user goals and the requirements of the production process, analyzes the incoming data from IoT sensors and automatically derives the most suitable visualization type for each context. This approach will help users to identify if the production process is running as well as expected; thus, it will enable them to make the most sustainable decision in each situation. Finally, in order to assess the suitability of our proposal, a case study based on gas turbines for electricity generation is presented.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This work compares Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) deep neural networks for the outdoor advertisement panel detection problem by handling multiple and combined variabilities in the scenes. Publicity panel detection in images offers important advantages both in the real world as well as in the virtual one. For example, applications like Google Street View can be used for Internet publicity and when detecting these ads panels in images, it could be possible to replace the publicity appearing inside the panels by another from a funding company. In our experiments, both SSD and YOLO detectors have produced acceptable results under variable sizes of panels, illumination conditions, viewing perspectives, partial occlusion of panels, complex background and multiple panels in scenes. Due to the difficulty of finding annotated images for the considered problem, we created our own dataset for conducting the experiments. The major strength of the SSD model was the almost elimination of False Positive (FP) cases, situation that is preferable when the publicity contained inside the panel is analyzed after detecting them. On the other side, YOLO produced better panel localization results detecting a higher number of True Positive (TP) panels with a higher accuracy. Finally, a comparison of the two analyzed object detection models with different types of semantic segmentation networks and using the same evaluation metrics is also included.

AB  - Smart cities employ technology and data to increase efficiencies, economic development, sustainability, and life quality for citizens in urban areas. Inevitably, clean technologies promote smart cities development including for energy, transportation and health. The smart city concept is ambitious and is being refined with standards. Standards are used to help with regulating how smart cities function and contributing to define a smart city. Smart cities must be officially recognized by national and international authorities and organizations in order to promote societal advancement. There are many research and review articles on smart cities. However, technical standards are seldom discussed in the current literature. This review firstly presents the study of smart city definitions and domain. The well-known smart city standards will be presented to better recognize the smart city concept. Well-defined standards allow meaningful comparisons among smart cities implementation. How smart city initiatives make a city smarter and improve the quality of life will be discussed for various countries. This review highlights that technical standards are important for smart cities implementation. This paper serves as a guide to the most recent developments of smart cities standards.

AB  - The world is experiencing the new development of smart cities. Smart cities&rsquo; infrastructure in its core is based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the internet of things (IoT). WSNs consist of tiny smart devices (Motes) that are restricted in terms of memory, storage, processing capabilities, and sensing and communication ranges. Those limitations pose many security issues where regular cryptography algorithms are not suitable to be used. Besides, such capabilities might be degraded in case cheap sensors are deployed with very large numbers in applications, such as smart cities. One of the major security issues in WSNs that affect the overall operation, up to network interruption, in smart cities is the sinkhole routing attack. The paper has three-fold contributions: (1) it utilizes the concept of clustering for energy saving in WSNs, (2) proposing two light and simple algorithms for intrusion detection and prevention in smart cities&mdash;threshold-based intrusion detection system (TBIDS) and multipath-based intrusion detection system (MBIDS), and (3) utilizing the cross-layer technique between the application layer and network layer for the purpose of intrusion detection. The proposed methods are evaluated against recent algorithms&mdash;S-LEACH, MS-LEACH, and ABC algorithms.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A rapidly growing number of vehicles in recent years cause long traffic jams and difficulty in the management of traffic in cities. One of the most significant reasons for increased traffic jams on the road is random parking in unauthorized and non-permitted places. In addition, managing of available parking places cannot achieve the expected reduction in traffic congestion related problems due to mismanagement, lack of real-time parking guidance to the drivers, and general ignorance. As the number of roads, highways and related resources has not increased significantly, a rising need for a smart, dynamic and effective parking solution is observed. Accordingly, with the use of multiple sensors, appropriate communication network and advanced processing capabilities of edge and cloud computing, a smart parking system can help manage parking effectively and make it easier for the vehicle owners. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer architecture for smart parking system consisting of multi-parametric parking slot sensor nodes, latest long-range low-power wireless communication technology and Edge-Cloud computation. The proposed system enables dynamic management of parking for large areas while providing useful information to the drivers about available parking locations and related services through near real-time monitoring of vehicles. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic pricing algorithm to yield maximum possible revenue for the parking authority and optimum parking slot availability for the drivers.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The modern planning and management of urban spaces is an essential topic for smart cities and depends on up-to-date and reliable information on land use and the functional roles of the places that integrate urban areas. In the last few years, driven by the increased availability of geo-referenced data from social media, embedded sensors, and remote sensing images, various techniques have become popular for land use analysis. In this paper, we first highlight and discuss the different data types and methods usually adopted in this context, as well as their purposes. Then, based on a systematic state-of-the-art study, we focused on exploring the potential of points of interest (POIs) for land use classification, as one of the most common categories of crowdsourced data. We developed an application to automatically collect POIs for the study area, creating a dataset that was used to generate a large number of features. We used a ranking technique to select, among them, the most suitable features for classifying land use. As ground truth data, we used CORINE Land Cover (CLC), which is a solid and reliable dataset available for the whole European territory. It was used an artificial neural network (ANN) in different scenarios and our results reveal values of more than 90% for the accuracy and F-score in one experiment performed. Our analysis suggests that POI data have promising potential to characterize geographic spaces. The work described here aims to provide an alternative to the current methodologies for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, which are usually time-consuming and depend on expensive data types.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled physical objects and devices, often referred to as things, to connect and communicate. This has opened up for the development of novel types of services that improve the quality of our daily lives. The dynamicity and uncertainty of IoT environments, including the mobility of users and devices, make it hard to foresee at design time available things and services. Further, users should be able to achieve their goals seamlessly in arbitrary environments. To address these challenges, we exploit Artificial Intelligence (AI) to engineer smart IoT systems that can achieve user goals and cope with the dynamicity and uncertainty of their environments. More specifically, the main contribution of this paper is an approach that leverages the notion of Belief-Desire-Intention agents and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to realize Emergent Configurations (ECs) in the IoT. An EC is an IoT system composed of a dynamic set of things that connect and cooperate temporarily to achieve a user goal. The approach enables the distributed formation, enactment, adaptation of ECs, and conflict resolution among them. We present a conceptual model of the entities of the approach, its underlying processes, and the guidelines for using it. Moreover, we report about the simulations conducted to validate the feasibility of the approach and evaluate its scalability.

AB  - Traffic monitoring from closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras on embedded systems is the subject of the performed experiments. Solving this problem encounters difficulties related to the hardware limitations, and possible camera placement in various positions which affects the system performance. To satisfy the hardware requirements, vehicle detection is performed using a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), named SqueezeDet, while, for tracking, the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm is applied, allowing for real-time processing on an NVIDIA Jetson Tx2. To allow for adaptation of the system to the deployment environment, a procedure was implemented leading to generating labels in an unsupervised manner with the help of background modelling and the tracking algorithm. The acquired labels are further used for fine-tuning the model, resulting in a meaningful increase in the traffic estimation accuracy, and moreover, adding only minimal human effort to the process allows for further accuracy improvement. The proposed methods, and the results of experiments organised under real-world test conditions are presented in the paper.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - One of the models in the literature for modeling the behavior of the brain is the Bayesian attractor model, which is a kind of machine-learning algorithm. According to this model, the brain assigns stochastic variables to possible decisions (attractors) and chooses one of them when enough evidence is collected from sensory systems to achieve a confidence level high enough to make a decision. In this paper, we introduce a software defined networking (SDN) application based on a brain-inspired Bayesian attractor model for identification of the current traffic pattern for the supervision and automation of Internet of things (IoT) networks that exhibit a limited number of traffic patterns. In a real SDN testbed, we demonstrate that our SDN application can identify the traffic patterns using a limited set of fluctuating network statistics of edge link utilization. Moreover, we show that our application can improve core link utilization and the power efficiency of IoT networks by immediately applying a pre-calculated network configuration optimized by traffic engineering with network slicing for the identified pattern.

AB  - The deep integration of information technology (IT) and the real economy contributes to China&rsquo;s high-quality economic sustainable development. From the perspective of efficiency, this paper aims to build an evaluation index system, with 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2017 being taken as the research objects, conduct static and dynamic analysis by using the super-efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA)-Malmquist index, and draw a spatial distribution diagram to reflect its changes. This study reveals that the integrated development of information technology and the real economy is unbalanced in China. The eastern region performs better with a development slowdown, while the central and western regions lag behind with a lot of room for improvement. The effect of regional agglomeration is obvious, which can be evidenced by the fact that those provinces with a high-efficiency value produce a radiation effect on their neighboring provinces. On the whole, the total factor productivity is increasing annually, with the technical progress being the main factor that affects the total efficiency. According to the results, the countermeasures and suggestions are put forward in this paper to provide reference for a better sustainability development of information technology and the real economy.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Fire monitoring in local urban markets within East Africa (EA) has been seriously neglected for a long time. This has culminated in a severe destruction of life and property worth millions. These rampant fires are attributed to electrical short circuits, fuel spillages, etc. Previous research proposes single smoke detectors. However, they are prone to false alarm rates and are inefficient. Also, satellite systems are expensive for developing countries. This paper presents a fuzzy model for early fire detection and control as symmetry&rsquo;s core contribution to fuzzy systems design and application in computer and engineering sciences. We utilize a fuzzy logic technique to simulate the performance of the model using MATLAB, using six parameters: temperature, humidity, flame, CO, CO2 and O2 vis-&agrave;-vis the Estimated Fire Intensity Prediction (EFIP). Results show that, using fuzzy logic, a significant improvement in fire detection is observed with an overall accuracy rate of 95.83%. The paper further proposes an IoT-based fuzzy prediction model for early fire detection with a goal of minimizing extensive damage and promote intermediate fire suppression and control through true fire incidences. This solution provides for future public safety monitoring, and control of fire-related situations among the market community. Hence, fire safety monitoring is significant in providing future fire safety planning, control and management by putting in place appropriate fire safety laws, policies, bills and related fire safety practices or guidelines to be applied in public buildings, market centers and other public places.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Following the significant improvement of technology in terms of data collection and treatment during the last decades, the notion of a smart environment has widely taken an important pedestal in the science industry. Built in order to better manage assets, smart environments provide a livable environment for users or citizens through the deployment of sensors responsible for data collection. Much research has been done to provide security to the involved data, which are extremely sensitive. However, due to the small size and the memory constraint of the sensors, many of these works are difficult to implement. In this paper, a different concept for wireless sensor security in smart environments is presented. The proposed security system, which is based on the scaler distribution of a novel electronic device, the intrusion detection system (IDS), reduces the computational functions of the sensors and therefore maximizes their efficiency. The IDS also introduces the concept of the feedback signal and &ldquo;trust table&rdquo; used to trigger the detection and isolation mechanism in case of attacks. Generally, it ensures the whole network security through cooperation with other IDSs and, therefore, eliminates the problem of security holes that may occur while adopting such a security technique.

AB  - IoT systems based on collaborative sensor networks are becoming increasingly common in various industries owing to the increased availability of low-cost sensors. The quality of the data provided by these sensors may be unknown. For these reasons, advanced data processing and sensor network self-calibration methods have become popular research topics. In terms of metrology, the self-calibration methods lack the traceability to the established measurement standards of National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) through an unbroken chain-link of calibration. This problem can be solved by the ongoing digitalization of the metrology infrastructure. We propose a conceptual solution based on Digital Calibration Certificates (DCCs), Digital SI (D-SI), and cryptographic digital identifiers, for validation of data quality and trustworthiness. The data that enable validation and traceability can be used to improve analytics, decision-making, and security in industrial applications. We discuss the applicability and benefits of our solutions in a selection of industrial use cases, where collaborative sensing has already been introduced. We present the remaining challenges in the digitization and standardization processes regarding digital metrology and the future work required to address them.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The identification of roof surfaces is characterized by a sequence of several processing steps. The boundary detection of different types of roof is realized from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) cloud points and can confirm the real boundary of the roof. In the process of processing LiDAR data, shortcomings have been found regarding the inappropriate classification of points (class 6 &ldquo;buildings&rdquo;) concerning the roofs (the points of the building facade were marked as outliers and reclassified). In cases of insufficient point density, there is a problem with not being able to capture either the roof boundary or small roof objects, along with the possible occurrence of gaps inside the roof areas. This study proposes a processing procedure in a geographic information system (GIS) environment that advocates the identification of roof surfaces based on the LiDAR point cloud. We created the contours of a roof surface boundary with a simplified regular shape. From 824 roofs in the studied area, six different types of roof were selected, which this study presents in detail. The expected result of the study is the generation of segments inside the roof boundary. The study also includes the visualization of the outcomes of the spatial analyses of the identified roof surfaces, which forms the basis for determining the potential of solar systems with respect to green roofs for the development of smart city buildings.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - This last decade, the amount of data exchanged on the Internet increased by over a staggering factor of 100, and is expected to exceed well over the 500 exabytes by 2020. This phenomenon is mainly due to the evolution of high-speed broadband Internet and, more specifically, the popularization and wide spread use of smartphones and associated accessible data plans. Although 4G with its long-term evolution (LTE) technology is seen as a mature technology, there is continual improvement to its radio technology and architecture such as in the scope of the LTE Advanced standard, a major enhancement of LTE. However, for the long run, the next generation of telecommunication (5G) is considered and is gaining considerable momentum from both industry and researchers. In addition, with the deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, smart cities, vehicular networks, e-health systems, and Industry 4.0, a new plethora of 5G services has emerged with very diverging and technologically challenging design requirements. These include high mobile data volume per area, high number of devices connected per area, high data rates, longer battery life for low-power devices, and reduced end-to-end latency. Several technologies are being developed to meet these new requirements, and each of these technologies brings its own design issues and challenges. In this context, deep learning models could be seen as one of the main tools that can be used to process monitoring data and automate decisions. As these models are able to extract relevant features from raw data (images, texts, and other types of unstructured data), the integration between 5G and DL looks promising and one that requires exploring. As main contribution, this paper presents a systematic review about how DL is being applied to solve some 5G issues. Differently from the current literature, we examine data from the last decade and the works that address diverse 5G specific problems, such as physical medium state estimation, network traffic prediction, user device location prediction, self network management, among others. We also discuss the main research challenges when using deep learning models in 5G scenarios and identify several issues that deserve further consideration.

VL  - 13

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The energy efficiency of Data Center (DC) operations heavily relies on a DC ambient temperature as well as its IT and cooling systems performance. A reliable and efficient cooling system is necessary to produce a persistent flow of cold air to cool servers that are subjected to constantly increasing computational load due to the advent of smart cloud-based applications. Consequently, the increased demand for computing power will inadvertently increase server waste heat creation in data centers. To improve a DC thermal profile which could undeniably influence energy efficiency and reliability of IT equipment, it is imperative to explore the thermal characteristics analysis of an IT room. This work encompasses the employment of an unsupervised machine learning technique for uncovering weaknesses of a DC cooling system based on real DC monitoring thermal data. The findings of the analysis result in the identification of areas for thermal management and cooling improvement that further feeds into DC recommendations. With the aim to identify overheated zones in a DC IT room and corresponding servers, we applied analyzed thermal characteristics of the IT room. Experimental dataset includes measurements of ambient air temperature in the hot aisle of the IT room in ENEA Portici research center hosting the CRESCO6 computing cluster. We use machine learning clustering techniques to identify overheated locations and categorize computing nodes based on surrounding air temperature ranges abstracted from the data. This work employs the principles and approaches replicable for the analysis of thermal characteristics of any DC, thereby fostering transferability. This paper demonstrates how best practices and guidelines could be applied for thermal analysis and profiling of a commercial DC based on real thermal monitoring data.

Unfortunately, like other IoT systems, there are inherent security risks which can lead to significant violations of a user’s privacy. In this review, we explore the attack surface of modern surveillance systems and enumerate the various ways they can be compromised with real examples. We also identify the threat agents, their attack goals, attack vectors, and the resulting consequences of successful attacks. Finally, we present current countermeasures and best practices and discuss the threat horizon. The purpose of this review is to provide researchers and engineers with a better understanding of a modern surveillance systems’ security, to harden existing systems and develop improved security solutions.

AB  - The information of building types is highly needed for urban planning and management, especially in high resolution building modeling in which buildings are the basic spatial unit. However, in many parts of the world, this information is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a framework to derive the information of building type using geospatial data, including point-of-interest (POI) data, building footprints, land use polygons, and roads, from Gaode and Baidu Maps. First, we used natural language processing (NLP)-based approaches (i.e., text similarity measurement and topic modeling) to automatically reclassify POI categories into which can be used to directly infer building types. Second, based on the relationship between building footprints and POIs, we identified building types using two indicators of type ratio and area ratio. The proposed framework was tested using over 440,000 building footprints in Beijing, China. Our NLP-based approaches and building type identification methods show overall accuracies of 89.0% and 78.2%, and kappa coefficient of 0.83 and 0.71, respectively. The proposed framework is transferrable to other China cities for deriving the information of building types from web mapping platforms. The data products generated from this study are of great use for quantitative urban studies at the building level.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - At present, the state-of-the-art approaches of Visual Question Answering (VQA) mainly use the co-attention model to relate each visual object with text objects, which can achieve the coarse interactions between multimodalities. However, they ignore the dense self-attention within question modality. In order to solve this problem and improve the accuracy of VQA tasks, in the present paper, an effective Dense Co-Attention Networks (DCAN) is proposed. First, to better capture the relationship between words that are relatively far apart and make the extracted semantics more robust, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network is introduced to encode questions and answers; second, to realize the fine-grained interactions between the question words and image regions, a dense multimodal co-attention model is proposed. The model&rsquo;s basic components include the self-attention unit and the guided-attention unit, which are cascaded in depth to form a hierarchical structure. The experimental results on the VQA-v2 dataset show that DCAN has obvious performance advantages, which makes VQA applicable to a wider range of AI scenarios.

TI  - Structural Health Monitoring: An IoT Sensor System for Structural Damage Indicator Evaluation
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 17
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the last decades, the applications of structural monitoring are moving toward the field of civil engineering and infrastructures. Nevertheless, if the structures have damages, it does not mean that they have a complete loss of functionality, but rather that the system is no longer in an optimal condition so that, if the damage increases, the structure can collapse. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), a process for the identification of damage, periodically collects data from suitable sensors that allow to characterize the damage and establishes the health status of the structure. Therefore, this monitoring will provide information on the structure condition, mostly about its integrity, in a short time, and, for infrastructures and civil structures, it is necessary to assess performance and health status. The aim of this work is to design an Internet of Things (IoT) system for Structural Health Monitoring to find possible damages and to see how the structure behaves over time. For this purpose, a customized datalogger and nodes have been designed. The datalogger is able to acquire the data coming from the nodes through RS485 communication and synchronize acquisitions. Furthermore, it has an internal memory to allow for the post-processing of the collected data. The nodes are composed of a digital triaxial accelerometer, a general-purpose microcontroller, and an external memory for storage measures. The microcontroller communicates with an accelerometer, acquires values, and then saves them in the memory. The system has been characterized and the damage indicator has been evaluated on a testing structure. Experimental results show that the estimated damage indicator increases when the structure is perturbed. In the present work, the damage indicator increased by a maximum value of 24.65 when the structure is perturbed by a 2.5 mm engraving.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Due to the recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge-Fog-Cloud Computing technologies, the Smart Public Safety (SPS) system has become a more realistic solution for seamless public safety services that are enabled by integrating machine learning (ML) into heterogeneous edge computing networks. While SPS facilitates convenient exchanges of surveillance data streams among device owners and third-party applications, the existing monolithic service-oriented architecture (SOA) is unable to provide scalable and extensible services in a large-scale heterogeneous network environment. Moreover, traditional security solutions rely on a centralized trusted third-party authority, which not only can be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure, but it also incurs privacy concerns on improperly use of private information. Inspired by blockchain and microservices technologies, this paper proposed a BLockchain-ENabled Decentralized Smart Public Safety (BlendSPS) system. Leveraging the hybrid blockchain fabric, a microservices based security mechanism is implemented to enable decentralized security architecture, and it supports immutability, auditability, and traceability for secure data sharing and operations among participants of the SPS system. An extensive experimental study verified the feasibility of the proposed BlendSPS that possesses security and privacy proprieties with limited overhead on IoT based edge networks.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - With an extensive growth in user demand for high throughput, large capacity, and low latency, the ongoing deployment of Fifth-Generation (5G) systems is continuously exposing the inherent limitations of the system, as compared with its original premises. Such limitations are encouraging researchers worldwide to focus on next-generation 6G wireless systems, which are expected to address the constraints. To meet the above demands, future radio network architecture should be effectively designed to utilize its maximum radio spectrum capacity. It must simultaneously utilize various new techniques and technologies, such as Carrier Aggregation (CA), Cognitive Radio (CR), and small cell-based Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet), high-spectrum access (mmWave), and Massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (M-MIMO), to achieve the desired results. However, the concurrent operations of these techniques in current 5G cellular networks create several spectrum management issues; thus, a comprehensive overview of these emerging technologies is presented in detail in this study. Then, the problems involved in the concurrent operations of various technologies for the spectrum management of the current 5G network are highlighted. The study aims to provide a detailed review of cooperative communication among all the techniques and potential problems associated with the spectrum management that has been addressed with the possible solutions proposed by the latest researches. Future research challenges are also discussed to highlight the necessary steps that can help achieve the desired objectives for designing 6G wireless networks.

TI  - Using the SWOT Methodology to Know the Scope of the Digitalization of the Spanish Ports
T2  - Logistics

PY  - 2020
VL  - 4
IS  - 3
SN  - 2305-6290

AB  - In the specific case of maritime transport, one of the most notable examples of digitalization is smart ports. Their positive impact on the supply chain is enabling processes to be optimized through smarter production. In the case of Spain, the Spanish public entity Puertos del Estado (Puertos del Estado is a public business entity dependent on the Spanish Ministry of Transport, Mobility and the Urban Agenda, with overall responsibility for the entire state-owned port system.) has launched Ports 4.0, the largest open innovation fund for the logistics-port ecosystem. It is therefore necessary to know the point of digitalization in which the Spanish ports are and the present scenario in which they develop their activity. For this purpose, a SWOT analysis (Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats analysis) is proposed, which is an ideal tool to make a reliable diagnosis of the port system in relation to a certain project before which we wish to make a strategic decision, in this case digitalization, in order to establish a concrete action plan in this regard. This should be the first step towards developing the Ports 4.0 project. The main conclusion of the analysis is that Spanish ports are currently at a medium high level of digitalization, and that they continue to update and innovate in order to be increasingly competitive in this market, despite the fact that there is still a long way to go in digitalization. The main challenge for Spanish ports is that technology alone is not useful enough to reach Ports 4.0 status; the technology also needs to be used in an integrated, open and joint way by all the agents of the port community, which is one of the main handicaps at present.

TI  - Time-Pattern Profiling from Smart Meter Data to Detect Outliers in Energy Consumption
T2  - IoT

PY  - 2020
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
SN  - 2624-831X

AB  - Smart meters have become a core part of the Internet of Things, and its sensory network is increasing globally. For example, in the UK there are over 15 million smart meters operating across homes and businesses. One of the main advantages of the smart meter installation is the link to a reduction in carbon emissions. Research shows that, when provided with accurate and real-time energy usage readings, consumers are more likely to turn off unneeded appliances and change other behavioural patterns around the home (e.g., lighting, thermostat adjustments). In addition, the smart meter rollout results in a lessening in the number of vehicle callouts for the collection of consumption readings from analogue meters and a general promotion of renewable sources of energy supply. Capturing and mining the data from this fully maintained (and highly accurate) sensing network, provides a wealth of information for utility companies and data scientists to promote applications that can further support a reduction in energy usage. This research focuses on modelling trends in domestic energy consumption using density-based classifiers. The technique estimates the volume of outliers (e.g., high periods of anomalous energy consumption) within a social class grouping. To achieve this, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) demonstrate the detection of unusual energy consumption within naturally occurring groups with similar characteristics. Using DBSCAN and OPTICS, 53 and 208 outliers were detected respectively; with 218 using LOF, on a dataset comprised of 1,058,534 readings from 1026 homes.

VL  - 20
IS  - 17
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Many low-cost sensors (LCSs) are distributed for air monitoring without any rigorous calibrations. This work applies machine learning with PM2.5 from Taiwan monitoring stations to conduct in-field corrections on a network of 39 PM2.5 LCSs from July 2017 to December 2018. Three candidate models were evaluated: Multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). The model-corrected PM2.5 levels were compared with those of GRIMM-calibrated PM2.5. RFR was superior to MLR and SVR in its correction accuracy and computing efficiency. Compared to SVR, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of RFR were 35% and 85% lower for the training and validation sets, respectively, and the computational speed was 35 times faster. An RFR with 300 decision trees was chosen as the optimal setting considering both the correction performance and the modeling time. An RFR with a nighttime pattern was established as the optimal correction model, and the RMSEs were 5.9 &plusmn; 2.0 &mu;g/m3, reduced from 18.4 &plusmn; 6.5 &mu;g/m3 before correction. This is the first work to correct LCSs at locations without monitoring stations, validated using laboratory-calibrated data. Similar models could be established in other countries to greatly enhance the usefulness of their PM2.5 sensor networks.

AB  - Adoption of the Internet of Things for the realization of smart cities in various domains has been pushed by the advancements in Information Communication and Technology. Transportation, power delivery, environmental monitoring, and medical applications are among the front runners when it comes to leveraging the benefits of IoT for improving services through modern decision support systems. Though with the enormous usage of the Internet of Medical Things, security and privacy become intrinsic issues, thus adversaries can exploit these devices or information on these devices for malicious intents. These devices generate and log large and complex raw data which are used by decision support systems to provide better care to patients. Investigation of these enormous and complicated data from a victim&rsquo;s device is a daunting and time-consuming task for an investigator. Different feature-based frameworks have been proposed to resolve this problem to detect early and effectively the access logs to better assess the event. But the problem with the existing approaches is that it forces the investigator to manually comb through collected data which can contain a huge amount of irrelevant data. These data are provided normally in textual form to the investigators which are too time-consuming for the investigations even if they can utilize machine learning or natural language processing techniques. In this paper, we proposed a visualization-based approach to tackle the problem of investigating large and complex raw data sets from the Internet of Medical Things. Our contribution in this work is twofold. Firstly, we create a data set through a dynamic behavioral analysis of 400 malware samples. Secondly, the resultant and reduced data set were then visualized most feasibly. This is to investigate an incident easily. The experimental results show that an investigator can investigate large amounts of data in an easy and time-efficient manner through the effective use of visualization techniques.

AB  - The concept of circular economy (CE) is becoming progressively popular with academia, industry, and policymakers, as a potential path towards a more sustainable economic system. Information and communication technology (ICT) systems have influenced every aspect of modern life and the CE is no exception. Cutting-edge technologies, such as big data, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, internet of things, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain, can play an integral role in the embracing of CE concepts and the rollout of CE programs by governments, organizations, and society as a whole. The current paper conducts an extensive academic literature review on prominent ICT solutions paving the way towards a CE. For the categorization of the solutions, a novel two-fold approach is introduced, focusing on both the technological aspect of the solutions (e.g., communications, computing, data analysis, etc.), and the main CE concept(s) employed (i.e., reduce, reuse, recycle and restore) that each solution is the most relevant to. The role of each solution in the transition to CE is highlighted. Results suggest that ICT solutions related to data collection and data analysis, and in particular to the internet of things, blockchain, digital platforms, artificial intelligence algorithms, and software tools, are amongst the most popular solutions proposed by academic researchers. Results also suggest that greater emphasis is placed on the &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; component of the CE, although ICT solutions for the other &ldquo;R&rdquo; components, as well as holistic ICT-based solutions, do exist as well. Specific important challenges impeding the adoption of ICT solutions for the CE are also identified and reviewed, with consumer and business attitude, economic costs, possible environmental impacts, lack of education around the CE, and lack of familiarization with modern technologies being found among the most prominent ones.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a fast-growing communication system for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) in the Internet of Things (IoTs) deployments. LoRaWAN is built to optimize LPWANs for battery lifetime, capacity, range, and cost. LoRaWAN employs an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) scheme that dynamically optimizes data rate, airtime, and energy consumption. The major challenge in LoRaWAN is that the LoRa specification does not state how the network server must command end nodes pertaining rate adaptation. As a result, numerous ADR schemes have been proposed to cater for the many applications of IoT technology, the quality of service requirements, different metrics, and radio frequency (RF) conditions. This offers a challenge for the reliability and suitability of these schemes. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the research on ADR algorithms for LoRaWAN technology. First, we provide an overview of LoRaWAN network performance that has been explored and documented in the literature and then focus on recent solutions for ADR as an optimization approach to improve throughput, energy efficiency and scalability. We then distinguish the approaches used, highlight their strengths and drawbacks, and provide a comparison of these approaches. Finally, we identify some research gaps and future directions.

In the modern world, such systems enable the detection of potentially dangerous situations on the road, reducing accident probability. However, at the same time, such systems increase vulnerabilities in vehicles and can be sources of different threats. In this paper, we consider the primary information flows between the driver, vehicle, and infrastructure in modern ITS, and identify possible threats related to these entities. We define threat classes related to vehicle control and discuss which of them can be detected by smartphone sensors. We present a case study that supports our findings and shows the main use cases for threat identification using smartphone sensors: Drowsiness, distraction, unfastened belt, eating, drinking, and smartphone use.

AB  - Asphalt materials modified with different types and dosages of magnetically responsive materials can emit patterns of magnetic signals easily detectable by magnetic field sensors. These patterns could be used to encode roads and improve infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V)/road-to-vehicle (R2V) communications. In this sense, this paper presents a laboratory study addressed to analyze the magnetic field signals emitted by encoded asphalt specimens manufactured with various dosages of steel fibers. The analysis consisted in the evaluation of the influence of three parameters: (1) the height of placement of the magnetic field sensors, (2) the approach speed of the encoded specimen/vehicle and (3) the distance from signal detection. Results show that, for each one of the parameters evaluated, there is a limit value below which it is possible to work with the magnetic signal emitted by the encoded samples. A proof of concept was used to validate the results obtained.

Over the last 10 years, various methods for crowd management in real time scenario have received immense attention due to large scale applications in people counting, public events management, disaster management, safety monitoring an so on. Although many sophisticated algorithms have been developed to address the task; crowd management in real time conditions is still a challenging problem being completely solved, particularly in wild and unconstrained conditions. In the proposed paper, we present a detailed review of crowd analysis and management, focusing on state-of-the-art methods for both controlled and unconstrained conditions. The paper illustrates both the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art methods. The methods presented comprise the seminal research works on crowd management, and monitoring and then culminating state-of-the-art methods of the newly introduced deep learning methods. Comparison of the previous methods is presented, with a detailed discussion of the direction for future research work. We believe this review article will contribute to various application domains and will also augment the knowledge of the crowd analysis within the research community.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Monitoring what application or type of applications running on a computer or a cluster without violating the privacy of the users can be challenging, especially when we may not have operator access to these devices, or specialized software. Smart grids and Internet of things (IoT) devices can provide power consumption data of connected individual devices or groups. This research will attempt to provide insides on what applications are running based on the power consumption of the machines and clusters. It is therefore assumed that there is a correlation between electric power and what software application is running. Additionally, it is believed that it is possible to create power consumption profiles for various software applications and even normal and abnormal behavior (e.g., a virus). In order to achieve this, an experiment was organized for the purpose of collecting 48 h of continuous real power consumption data from two PCs that were part of a university computer lab. That included collecting data with a one-second sample period, during class as well as idle time from each machine and their cluster. During the second half of the recording period, one of the machines was infected with a custom-made virus, allowing comparison between power consumption data before and after infection. The data were analyzed using different approaches: descriptive analysis, F-Test of two samples of variance, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The results show that it is possible to detect what type of application is running and if an individual machine or its cluster are infected. Additionally, we can conclude if the lab is used or not, making this research an ideal management tool for administrators.

This paper also makes the case that by enabling participation for a wide variety of stakeholders, this NLP crowdsourcing platform might ultimately prove useful in the decision- and policy-making processes at city, community, and country levels. Against the backdrop of the debates on artificial intelligence (AI) and NLP research, and considering substantial differentiation specific to the Arab language, this paper introduces and evaluates an Arab language-sensitive NLP crowdsourcing platform. The value of the platform and its accuracy are measured via the System Usability Scale (SUS), where it scores 72.5, i.e., above the accepted usability average. These findings are crucial for NLP research and the research community in general. They are equally promising in view of the practical application of the research findings.

This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach using Laplacian scores to discover which types of sensors can be reduced, without compromising the decision-making. Here, a type of sensor is a feature. An IoT system is designed and implemented for a plant-monitoring scenario. We have collected data and carried out the Laplacian scores. The analytical results help choose the most important feature. A comparative study has shown that using fewer types of sensors, the accuracy of decision-making remains at a satisfactory level.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - This article addresses the problem of replication among smart cities in the European Commission&rsquo;s Horizon 2020: Smart Cities and Communities (EC-H2020-SCC) framework programme. This article initially sets the general policy context by conducting a benchmarking about the explicit replication strategies followed by each of the 17 ongoing EC-H2020-SCC lighthouse projects. This article aims to shed light on the following research question: Why might replication not be happening among smart cities as a unidirectional, hierarchical, mechanistic, solutionist, and technocratic process? Particularly, in asking so, it focuses on the EC-H2020-SCC Replicate project by examining in depth the fieldwork action research process implemented during 2019 through a knowledge exchange webinar series with participant stakeholders from six European cities&mdash;three lighthouse cities (St. Sebastian, Florence, and Bristol) and three follower-fellow cities (Essen, Lausanne, and Nil&uuml;fer). This process resulted in a City-to-City Learning Programme that reformulated the issue of replication by experimenting an alternative and an enhanced policy approach. Thus, stemming from the evidence-based policy outcomes of the City-to-City Learning Programme, this article reveals that a replication policy approach from the social innovation lenses might be enabled as a multidirectional, radial, dynamic, iterative, and democratic learning process, overcoming the given unidirectional, hierarchical, mechanistic, solutionist, and technocratic approach.

AB  - The unprompted patient&rsquo;s and inimitable physician&rsquo;s experience shared on online health communities (OHCs) contain a wealth of unexploited knowledge. Med Help and eHealth are some of the online health communities offering new insights and solutions to all health issues. Diabetes mellitus (DM), thyroid disorders and tuberculosis (TB) are chronic diseases increasing rapidly every year. As part of the project described in this article comments related to the diseases from Med Help were collected. The comments contain the patient and doctor discussions in an unstructured format. The sematic vision of the internet of things (IoT) plays a vital role in organizing the collected data. We pre-processed the data using standard natural language processing techniques and extracted the essential features of the words using the chi-squared test. After preprocessing the documents, we clustered them using the K-means++ algorithm, which is a popular centroid-based unsupervised iterative machine learning algorithm. A generative probabilistic model (LDA) was used to identify the essential topic in each cluster. This type of framework will empower the patients and doctors to identify the similarity and dissimilarity about the various diseases and important keywords among the diseases in the form of symptoms, medical tests and habits.

AB  - &lsquo;El Diario de Ju&aacute;rez&rsquo; is a local newspaper in a city of 1.5 million Spanish-speaking inhabitants that publishes texts of which citizens read them on both a website and an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) service. This research applies natural-language-processing and machine-learning algorithms to the news provided by the RSS service in order to classify them based on whether they are about a traffic incident or not, with the final intention of notifying citizens where such accidents occur. The classification process explores the bag-of-words technique with five learners (Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Na&iuml;ve Bayes, kNN, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) on a class-imbalanced benchmark; this challenging issue is dealt with via five sampling algorithms: synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), borderline SMOTE, adaptive synthetic sampling, random oversampling, and random undersampling. Consequently, our final classifier reaches a sensitivity of 0.86 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.86, which is an acceptable performance when considering the complexity of analyzing unstructured texts in Spanish.

TI  - Long-Term Temporal Analysis of Psychoacoustic Parameters of the Acoustic Environment in a University Campus Using a Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 18
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Higher education institution campuses have been growing in size to become small cities that encompass all the infrastructures and offer many services to the university community. In order to achieve sustainable growth, it is necessary to take into account different environmental aspects, including the acoustic environment. In this paper, the application of a wireless acoustic sensor network is proposed for the long-term analysis of psychoacoustic parameters of the acoustic environment in a university campus. A network of acoustic nodes is designed and four nodes are deployed at both indoor and outdoor locations of the campus for environmental noise monitoring. A measurement campaign has been running continuously for nine months, including three months in which the state of emergency due to COVID-19 pandemic was established and the university switched to online classes. Acquired and stored data include not only the basic sound level parameters, e.g., equivalent or percentile sound pressure levels, but also psychoacoustic parameters, that are more related with noise assessment of the environment, e.g., loudness or sharpness sound levels. After analysing the acoustic environment of the campus through the complete set of nodes, results show two zones with higher noise indicators where some action plan should be developed. A detailed analysis of the temporal evolution of noise levels in these acoustically saturated zones is done, comparing values between a period of regular activity and the period of state of emergency. Different frequency distributions of sound levels are detected between day and evening periods providing a better insight into the noise sources. The results also show that binaural psychoacoustic annoyance values are correlated with loudness values in these locations, however sharpness values have minor effects.

AB  - Recently, the commercial potentials and practical values of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) have been witnessed for sustainable development of smart cities in the field of intelligent transportation. Driven by the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), vehicles gradually become mobile living spaces to satisfy diverse demands of occupants, where the media functionalities, scenario scopes, and user engagements can be all expended dramatically. In the era of 5G/B5G, the intelligent connected vehicles are considered as super media because of the improved In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI). In this paper, relying on the advanced communication and intelligent techniques, we investigate the IoV-based vehicle-mounted media scenarios and construct IVI solutions for the MaaS. Firstly, we propose the characteristics of vehicle-mounted media scenarios and present the IVI evolution from the aspects of hearing, vision and multi-sensory media services. Secondly, we point out the main features and limitations of IoV-based IVI in 3G/4G. Finally, exploring the potential of super media, both the linkage display and IVI collaborative modes in vehicle-centric media scenarios are introduced as IVI solutions for the MaaS in 5G-V2X and beyond, which intend to further improve the audio-visual experiences of occupants and observers in urban environments.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Electricity theft and fraud in energy consumption are two of the major issues for power distribution companies (PDCs) for many years. PDCs around the world are trying different methodologies for detecting electricity theft. The traditional methods for non-technical losses (NTLs) detection such as onsite inspection and reward and penalty policy have lost their place in the modern era because of their ineffective and time-consuming mechanism. With the advancement in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), newer and efficient NTL detection methods have been proposed by different researchers working in the field of data mining and AI. The AI-based NTL detection methods are superior to the conventional methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, time-consumption, precision, and labor required. The importance of such AI-based NTL detection methods can be judged by looking at the growing trend toward the increasing number of research articles on this important development. However, the authors felt the lack of a comprehensive study that can provide a one-stop source of information on these AI-based NTL methods and hence became the motivation for carrying out this comprehensive review on this significant field of science. This article systematically reviews and classifies the methods explored for NTL detection in recent literature, along with their benefits and limitations. For accomplishing the mentioned objective, the opted research articles for the review are classified based on algorithms used, features extracted, and metrics used for evaluation. Furthermore, a summary of different types of algorithms used for NTL detection is provided along with their applications in the studied field of research. Lastly, a comparison among the major NTL categories, i.e., data-based, network-based, and hybrid methods, is provided on the basis of their performance, expenses, and response time. It is expected that this comprehensive study will provide a one-stop source of information for all the new researchers and the experts working in the mentioned area of research.

T2  - World Electric Vehicle Journal

VL  - 11

SN  - 2032-6653

AB  - As the automotive industry steers towards electromobility and electric vehicle adoption surges, Brazil and other Latin-American countries remain laggards. The Brazilian scenario exhibits unique features, such as a powerful automotive sector with large investments in internal combustion engine technology and a well-established biofuels market based on flex-fuel technology. Although energy security, urban air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, and technological advantage have been common drivers for the adoption of electric vehicles worldwide, the Brazilian immediate motivations are different, and the biofuels business ecosystem is likely to transform the path for electromobility. High tag price and public charging infrastructure absence have deeply discouraged electric vehicles adoption. A lack of regulation and a national consensus about the role of electric vehicles have been notorious. In fact, only in 2018 did the electricity regulatory agency (ANEEL) issue a resolution permitting the sale of electricity for recharging. The objective of this review was to create an outlook of the Brazilian transportation landscape. We identified relevant players, public charging infrastructure initiatives, market and other barriers, and regulation actions by consulting academic literature, media sources, and reports. We do not claim to predict the evolution of electrification. Instead, we aim to consolidate the information which can be used for decision support or strategy definition among entrepreneurs or policymakers. The main findings here are the necessity of a model for electrification able to create a synergy with biofuels and the urgency of having well-defined policies on what Brazil wants from electromobility.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The aim of the paper is to develop a model for the real-time estimation of local level income data by combining machine learning, Earth Observation, and Geographic Information System. More exactly, we estimated the income per capita by help of a machine learning model for 46 cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, based on the National Polar-orbiting Partnership&ndash;Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) nighttime satellite images from 2012&ndash;2018. For the automation of calculation, a new ModelBuilder type tool was developed within the ArcGIS software called EO-Incity (Earth Observation&ndash;Income city). The sum of light (SOL) data extracted by means of the EO-Incity tool and the observed income data were integrated in an algorithm within the MATLAB software in order to calculate a transfer equation and the average error. The results achieved were subsequently reintegrated in EO-Incity and used for the estimation of the income value at local level. The regression analyses highlighted a stable and strong relationship between SOL and income for the analyzed cities. The EO-Incity tool and the machine learning model proved to be efficient in the real-time estimation of the income at local level. When integrated in the information systems specific for smart cities, they can serve as a support for decision-making in order to fight poverty and reduce social inequalities.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The agent paradigm and multi-agent systems are a perfect match for the design of smart cities because of some of their essential features such as decentralization, openness, and heterogeneity. However, these major advantages also come at a great cost. Since agents&rsquo; mental states are hidden when the implementation is not known and available, intelligent services of smart cities cannot leverage information from them. We contribute with a proposal for the analysis and prediction of hidden agents&rsquo; mental states in a multi-agent system using machine learning methods that learn from past agents&rsquo; interactions. The approach employs agent communication languages, which is a core property of these multi-agent systems, to infer theories and models about agents&rsquo; mental states that are not accessible in an open system. These mental state models can be used on their own or combined to build protocol models, allowing agents (and their developers) to predict future agents&rsquo; behavior for various tasks such as testing and debugging them or making communications more efficient, which is essential in an ambient intelligence environment. This paper&rsquo;s main contribution is to explore the problem of building these agents&rsquo; mental state models not from one, but from several interaction protocols, even when the protocols could have different purposes and provide distinct ambient intelligence services.

AB  - Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications that favor more local computations and less communication can contribute to solving the problem of high power consumption and performance issues plaguing most centralized WSN applications. In this study, we present a fully distributed solution, where leaks are detected in a water distribution network via only local collaborations between a sensor node and its close neighbors, without the need for long-distance transmissions via several hops to a centralized fusion center. A complete approach that includes the design, simulation, and physical measurements, showing how distributed computing implemented via a distributed Kalman filter improves the accuracy of leak detection and the power consumption is presented. The results from the physical implementation show that distributed data fusion increases the accuracy of leak detection while preserving WSN lifetime.

AB  - This paper discusses the integration of emergent ICTs, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), the Arrowhead Framework, and the best practices from the area of condition monitoring and maintenance. These technologies are applied, for instance, for roller element bearing fault diagnostics and analysis by simulating faults. The authors first undertook the leading industry standards for condition-based maintenance (CBM), i.e., open system architecture&ndash;condition-based maintenance (OSA&ndash;CBM) and Machinery Information Management Open System Alliance (MIMOSA), which has been working towards standardizing the integration and interchangeability between systems. In addition, this paper highlights the predictive health monitoring methods that are needed for an effective CBM approach. The monitoring of industrial machines is discussed as well as the necessary details are provided regarding a demonstrator built on a metal sheet bending machine of the Greenbender family. Lastly, the authors discuss the benefits of the integration of the developed prototypes into a service-oriented platform, namely the Arrowhead Framework, which can be instrumental for the remotization of maintenance activities, such as the analysis of various equipment that are geographically distributed, to push forward the grand vision of the servitization of predictive health monitoring methods for large-scale interoperability.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - There is no definite conclusion about what the main variables that play a fundamental role in road safety are. Therefore, the identification of significant factors in road accidents has been a primary concern of the transportation safety research community for many years. Every accident is influenced by multiple variables that, in a given time interval, concur to cause a crash scenario. Information coming from crash reports is very useful in traffic safety research, and several reported crash variables can be analyzed with modern statistical methods to establish whether a classification or clustering of different crash variables is possible. Hence, this study aims to use stochastic techniques for evaluating the role of some variables in accidents with a clustering analysis. The variables that are considered in this paper are light conditions, weekday, average speed, annual average daily traffic, number of vehicles, and type of accident. For this purpose, a combination of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the genetic algorithm (GA) with the k-means algorithm was used as the machine-learning technique to cluster and evaluate road safety data. According to a multiscale approach, based on a set of data from two years of crash records collected from rural and urban roads in the province of Cosenza, 154 accident cases were accurately investigated and selected for three categories of accident places, including straight, intersection, and other, in each urban and rural network. PSO had a superior performance, with 0.87% accuracy on urban and rural roads in comparison with GA, although the results of GA had an acceptable degree of accuracy. In addition, the results show that, on urban roads, social cost and type of accident had the most and least influence for all accident places, while, on rural roads, although the social cost was the most notable factor for all accident places, the type of accident had the least effect on the straight sections and curves, and the number of vehicles had the least influence at intersections.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Crowding in city public transportation systems is a primary issue that causes delay in the mobility of passengers. Moreover, scheduled and unscheduled events in a city lead to excess crowding situations at the metro or bus stations. The Internet of Things (IoT) devices could be used for data collection, which are related to crowding situations in a smart city. The fog computing data centers located in different zones of a smart city can process and analyze the collected data to assist the passengers how to commute smoothly with minimum waiting time in the crowded situation. In this paper, Q-learning based passengers assistance system is designed to assist the commuters in finding less crowded bus and metro stations to avoid long queues of waiting. The traffic congestion and crowded situation data are processed in the fog computing data centers. From our experimental results, it is found that our proposed method can achieve higher reward values, which can be used to minimize the passengers&rsquo; waiting time with minimum computational delay as compared to the cloud computing platform.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The principle behind sustainable city movements is represented by the idea of &ldquo;good living&rdquo;, which is the possibility of having solutions and services that allow citizens to live in an easy, simple, and enjoyable way. Policies for urban quality play a central role in the slow cities manifesto, often suggesting the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) in the development of interactive services for citizens. Among these, an interesting possibility is to offer citizens digital real estate consultancy services through the implementation of automated evaluation methods. An automated appraisal action&mdash;which is already complex in itself owing to the need to collect data in a consistent, standardized, but also differentiated way so as to require the adoption of real estate due diligence&mdash;collides on the operational level with the concrete difficulty of acquiring necessary data, much more so since the reference market is dark, atypical, and viscous. These operational difficulties are deepened by the epistemological nature of the appraisal discipline itself, which bases its methodology on the forecast postulate, recalling the need to objectify as much as possible the evaluation from the perspective of an intersubjective sharing argument. These circumstances have led, on the one hand, to the definition of internationally accepted uniform evaluation rules (IVS, 2017) and, on the other, to the testing of automated valuation methods aimed at returning computer-based appraisals (AVM). Starting from the awareness that real estate valuation refers essentially to information and georeferences, this paper aims to demonstrate how real estate appraisal analysis can be further improved through information technology (IT), directing real estate valuation towards objectivity in compliance with international valuation standards. Particularly, the paper intends to show the potential of combining geographic information systems (GISs) and building information models (BIMs) in automated valuation methods through the depreciated reproduction cost. The paper also proposes a BIM-GIS semi-automatic prototype based on the depreciated reconstruction cost through an experimentation in Rende (Italy).

AB  - In recent years, people have witnessed numerous Internet of Things (IoT)-based attacks with the exponential increase in the number of IoT devices. Alongside this, the means to secure IoT-based applications are maturing slower than our budding dependence on them. Moreover, the vulnerabilities in an IoT system are exploited in chains to penetrate deep into the network and yield more adverse aftereffects. To mitigate these issues, this paper gives unique insights for handling the growing vulnerabilities in common IoT devices and proposes a threat architecture for IoT, addressing threats in the context of a three-layer IoT reference architecture. Furthermore, the vulnerabilities exploited at the several IoT attack surfaces and the challenges they exert are explored. Thereafter, the challenges in quantifying the IoT vulnerabilities with the existing framework are also analyzed. The study also covers a case study on the Intelligent Transportation System, covering road transport and traffic control specifically in terms of threats and vulnerabilities. Another case study on secure energy management in the Smart Grid is also presented. This case study covers the applications of Internet of Vulnerable Things (IoVT) in Smart energy Grid solutions, as there will be tremendous use of IoT in future Smart Grids to save energy and improve overall distribution. The analysis shows that the integration of the proposed architecture in existing applications alarms the developers about the embedded threats in the system.

AB  - In recent years, with the growing accessibility of abundant contextual emotion information, which is benefited by the numerous georeferenced user-generated content and the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI)-based emotional computing technics, the emotion layer of human&ndash;environment relationship is proposed for enriching traditional methods of various related disciplines such as urban planning. This paper proposes the geographic information system (GIS)-based emotional computing concept, which is a novel framework for applying GIS methods to collective human emotion. The methodology presented in this paper consists of three key steps: (1) collecting georeferenced data containing emotion and environment information such as social media and official sites, (2) detecting emotions using AI-based emotional computing technics such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), and (3) visualizing and analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns with GIS tools. This methodology is a great synergy of multidisciplinary cutting-edge techniques, such as GIScience, sociology, and computer science. Moreover, it can effectively and deeply explore the connection between people and their surroundings with the help of GIS methods. Generally, the framework provides a standard workflow to calculate and analyze the new information layer for researchers, in which a measured human-centric perspective onto the environment is possible.

VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The development of fast and robust brain&ndash;computer interface (BCI) systems requires non-complex and efficient computational tools. The modern procedures adopted for this purpose are complex which limits their use in practical applications. In this study, for the first time, and to the best of our knowledge, a successive decomposition index (SDI)-based feature extraction approach is utilized for the classification of motor and mental imagery electroencephalography (EEG) tasks. First of all, the public datasets IVa, IVb, and V from BCI competition III were denoised using multiscale principal analysis (MSPCA), and then a SDI feature was calculated corresponding to each trial of the data. Finally, six benchmark machine learning and neural network classifiers were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. All the experiments were performed for motor and mental imagery datasets in binary and multiclass applications using a 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, computerized automatic detection of motor and mental imagery using SDI (CADMMI-SDI) is developed to describe the proposed approach practically. The experimental results suggest that the highest classification accuracy of 97.46% (Dataset IVa), 99.52% (Dataset IVb), and 99.33% (Dataset V) was obtained using feedforward neural network classifier. Moreover, a series of experiments, namely, statistical analysis, channels variation, classifier parameters variation, processed and unprocessed data, and computational complexity, were performed and it was concluded that SDI is robust for noise, and a non-complex and efficient biomarker for the development of fast and accurate motor and mental imagery BCI systems.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Smart devices along with sensors are gaining in popularity with the promise of making life easier for the owner. As the number of sensors in an Internet of Things (IoT) system grows, a question arises as to whether the transmission between the sensors and the IoT devices is reliable and whether the user receives alerts correctly and in a timely manner. Increased deployment of IoT devices with sensors increases possible safety risks. It is IoT devices that are often misused to create Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which is due to the weak security of IoT devices against misuse. The article looks at the issue from the opposite point of view, when the target of a DDoS attack are IoT devices in a smart home environment. The article examines how IoT devices and the entire smart home will behave if they become victims of a DDoS attack aimed at the smart home from the outside. The question of security was asked in terms of whether a legitimate user can continue to control and receive information from IoT sensors, which is available during normal operation of the smart home. The case study was done both from the point of view of the attack on the central units managing the IoT sensors directly, as well as on the smart-home personal assistant systems, with which the user can control the IoT sensors. The article presents experimental results for individual attacks performed in the case study and demonstrates the resistance of real IoT sensors against DDoS attack. The main novelty of the article is that the implementation of a personal assistant into the smart home environment increases the resistance of the user&rsquo;s communication with the sensors. This study is a pilot testing the selected sensor sample to show behavior of smart home under DDoS attack.

AB  - Cybersecurity issues constitute a key concern of today&rsquo;s technology-based economies. Cybersecurity has become a core need for providing a sustainable and safe society to online users in cyberspace. Considering the rapid increase of technological implementations, it has turned into a global necessity in the attempt to adapt security countermeasures, whether direct or indirect, and prevent systems from cyberthreats. Identifying, characterizing, and classifying such threats and their sources is required for a sustainable cyber-ecosystem. This paper focuses on the cybersecurity of smart grids and the emerging trends such as using blockchain in the Internet of Things (IoT). The cybersecurity of emerging technologies such as smart cities is also discussed. In addition, associated solutions based on artificial intelligence and machine learning frameworks to prevent cyber-risks are also discussed. Our review will serve as a reference for policy-makers from the industry, government, and the cybersecurity research community.

AB  - The security of Internet of Things environments is a critical and trending topic, due to the nature of the networks and the sensitivity of the exchanged information. In this paper, we investigate the security of the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, widely adopted in IoT infrastructures. We exploit two specific weaknesses of MQTT, identified during our research activities, allowing the client to configure the KeepAlive parameter and MQTT packets to execute an innovative cyber threat against the MQTT broker. In order to validate the exploitation of such vulnerabilities, we propose SlowTT, a novel &ldquo;Slow&rdquo; denial of service attack aimed at targeting MQTT through low-rate techniques, characterized by minimum attack bandwidth and computational power requirements. We validate SlowTT against real MQTT services, by considering both plaintext and encrypted communications and by comparing the effects of the attack when targeting different application daemons and protocol versions. Results show that SlowTT is extremely successful, and it can exploit the identified vulnerability to execute a denial of service against the IoT network by keeping the connection alive for a long time.

AB  - The ongoing diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is opening new possibilities, and one of the most remarkable applications is associated with the smart city paradigm, which is continuously evolving. In general, it can be defined as the integration of IoT and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) into city management, with the aim of addressing the exponential growth of urbanization and population, thus significantly increasing people&rsquo;s quality of life. The smart city paradigm is also strictly connected to sustainability aspects, taking into account, for example, the reduction of environmental impact of urban activities, the optimized management of energy resources, and the design of innovative services and solution for citizens. Abiding by this new paradigm, several cities started a process of strong innovation in different fields (such as mobility and transportation, industry, health, tourism, and education), thanks to significant investments provided by stakeholders and the European Commission (EC). In this paper, we analyze key aspects of an IoT infrastructure for smart cities, outlining the innovations implemented in the city of Parma (Emilia Romagna region, Italy) as a successful example. Special attention is dedicated to the theme of smart urban mobility.

SN  - 2305-6304

AB  - Human exposure to air pollution is a major public health concern. Environmental policymakers have been implementing various strategies to reduce exposure, including the 10th-day-no-driving system. To assess exposure of an entire population of a community in a highly polluted area, pollutant concentrations in microenvironments and population time&ndash;activity patterns are required. To date, population exposure to air pollutants has been assessed using air monitoring data from fixed atmospheric monitoring stations, atmospheric dispersion modeling, or spatial interpolation techniques for pollutant concentrations. This is coupled with census data, administrative registers, and data on the patterns of the time-based activities at the individual scale. Recent technologies such as sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT), communications technology, and artificial intelligence enable the accurate evaluation of air pollution exposure for a population in an environmental health context. In this study, the latest trends in published papers on the assessment of population exposure to air pollution were reviewed. Subsequently, this study proposes a methodology that will enable policymakers to develop an environmental health surveillance system that evaluates the distribution of air pollution exposure for a population within a target area and establish countermeasures based on advanced exposure assessment.

AB  - Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) often suffer from error-prone links when deployed in resource-constrained industrial environments. Reliability is a critical performance requirement of loss-sensitive applications, and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is a key indicator of successful communications. In addition to the improvement of the physical layer through modulation and channel coding, machine learning offers adaptive solutions by configuring various communication parameters dynamically. In this paper, we apply a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict SNR and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). Analysis results based on a real dataset show that the DNN can predict SNR and PDR at the accuracy of up to 96% and 98%, respectively, even when trained with very small fraction (&le;10%) of data. Moreover, a common subset of features turns out to be useful in predicting both SNR and PDR so as to encourage considering both metrics jointly. We may control the transmission power in the dynamic and adaptive manner when we have predictable SNR and PDR, and thus fulfill the reliability requirements with energy conservation. This can help in achieving sustainable design for the communication system.

AB  - As the expenses of medical care administrations rise and medical services experts are becoming rare, it is up to medical services organizations and institutes to consider the implementation of medical Health Information Technology (HIT) innovation frameworks. HIT permits health associations to smooth out their considerable cycles and offer types of assistance in a more productive and financially savvy way. With the rise of Cloud Storage Computing (CSC), an enormous number of associations and undertakings have moved their healthcare data sources to distributed storage. As the information can be mentioned whenever universally, the accessibility of information becomes an urgent need. Nonetheless, outages in cloud storage essentially influence the accessibility level. Like the other basic variables of cloud storage (e.g., reliability quality, performance, security, and protection), availability also directly impacts the data in cloud storage for e-Healthcare systems. In this paper, we systematically review cloud storage mechanisms concerning the healthcare environment. Additionally, in this paper, the state-of-the-art cloud storage mechanisms are critically reviewed for e-Healthcare systems based on their characteristics. In short, this paper summarizes existing literature based on cloud storage and its impact on healthcare, and it likewise helps researchers, medical specialists, and organizations with a solid foundation for future studies in the healthcare environment.

AB  - Cloud Computing provides on-demand computing services like software, networking, storage, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (“the cloud”). But it is facing challenges because of the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the volume, variety, veracity and velocity of the data generated by these devices. There is a need for ultra-low latency, reliable service along with security and privacy. Fog Computing is a promising solution to overcome these challenges. The originality, scope and novelty of this paper is the definition and formulation of the problem of smart neighborhoods in context of smart grids. This is achieved through an extensive literature study, firstly on Fog Computing and its foundation technologies, its applications and the literature review of Fog Computing research in various application domains. Thereafter, we introduce smart grid and community MicroGrid concepts and, their challenges to give the in depth background of the problem and hence, formalize the problem. The smart grid, which ensures reliable, secure, and cost-effective power supply to the smart neighborhoods, effectively needs Fog Computing architecture to achieve its purpose. This paper also identifies, without rigorous analysis, potential solutions to address the problem of smart neighborhoods. The challenges in the integration of Fog Computing and smart grids are also discussed.

AB  - Accurately forecasting how crowds of people are distributed in urban areas during daily activities is of key importance for the smart city vision and related applications. In this work we forecast the crowd density and distribution in an urban area by analyzing an aggregated mobile phone dataset. By comparing the forecasting performance of statistical and deep learning methods on the aggregated mobile data we show that each class of methods has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the forecasting scenario. However, for our time-series forecasting problem, deep learning methods are preferable when it comes to simplicity and immediacy of use, since they do not require a time-consuming model selection for each different cell. Deep learning approaches are also appropriate when aiming to reduce the maximum forecasting error. Statistical methods instead show their superiority in providing more precise forecasting results, but they require data domain knowledge and computationally expensive techniques in order to select the best parameters.

TI  - Measuring Quality of Service in a Robotized Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Scenario
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 18
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is an integrated clinical process to evaluate frail elderly people in order to create therapy plans that improve their quality and quantity of life. The whole process includes the completion of standardized questionnaires or specific movements, which are performed by the patient and do not necessarily require the presence of a medical expert. With the aim of automatizing these parts of the CGA, we have designed and developed CLARC (smart CLinic Assistant Robot for CGA), a mobile robot able to help the physician to capture and manage data during the CGA procedures, mainly by autonomously conducting a set of predefined evaluation tests. Using CLARC to conduct geriatric tests will reduce the time medical professionals have to spend on purely mechanical tasks, giving them more time to develop individualised care plans for their patients. In fact, ideally, CLARC will perform these tests on its own. In parallel with the effort to correctly address the functional aspects, i.e., the development of the robot tasks, the design of CLARC must also deal with non-functional properties such as the degree of interaction or the performance. We argue that satisfying user preferences can be a good way to improve the acceptance of the robot by the patients. This paper describes the integration into the software architecture of the CLARC robot of the modules that allow these properties to be monitored at run-time, providing information on the quality of its service. Experimental evaluation illustrates that the defined quality of service metrics correctly capture the evolution of the aspects of the robot&rsquo;s activity and its interaction with the patient covered by the non-functional properties that have been considered.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the big concerns for smart cities. The problem of applying big data analytics to sampling bias in the context of urban air quality is studied in this paper. A nonparametric estimator that incorporates kernel density estimation is used. When ignoring the biasing weight function, a small-sized simple random sample of the real population is assumed to be additionally observed. The general parameter considered is the mean of a transformation of the random variable of interest. A new bootstrap algorithm is used to approximate the mean squared error of the new estimator. Its minimization leads to an automatic bandwidth selector. The method is applied to a real data set concerning the levels of different pollutants in the urban air of the city of A Coru&ntilde;a (Galicia, NW Spain). Estimations for the mean and the cumulative distribution function of the level of ozone and nitrogen dioxide when the temperature is greater than or equal to 30 ∘C based on 15 years of biased data are obtained.

AB  - Air pollution has been a looming issue of the 21st century that has also significantly impacted the surrounding environment and societal health. Recently, previous studies have conducted extensive research on air pollution and air quality monitoring. Despite this, the fields of air pollution and air quality monitoring remain plagued with unsolved problems. In this study, the Pollution Weather Prediction System (PWP) is proposed to perform air pollution prediction for outdoor sites for various pollution parameters. In the presented research work, we introduced a PWP system configured with pollution-sensing units, such as SDS021, MQ07-CO, NO2-B43F, and Aeroqual Ozone (O3). These sensing units were utilized to collect and measure various pollutant levels, such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and O3, for 90 days at Symbiosis International University, Pune, Maharashtra, India. The data collection was carried out between the duration of December 2019 to February 2020 during the winter. The investigation results validate the success of the presented PWP system. In the conducted experiments, linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN)-based AQI (air quality index) predictions were performed. Furthermore, the presented study also found that the customized linear regression methodology outperformed other machine-learning methods, such as linear, ridge, Lasso, Bayes, Huber, Lars, Lasso-lars, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and ElasticNet regression methodologies, and the customized ANN regression methodology used in the conducted experiments. The overall AQI values of the air pollutants were calculated based on the summation of the AQI values of all the presented air pollutants. In the end, the web and mobile interfaces were developed to display air pollution prediction values of a variety of air pollutants.

AB  - The random nature of traffic conditions on freeways can cause excessive congestion and irregularities in the traffic flow. Ramp metering is a proven effective method to maintain freeway efficiency under various traffic conditions. Creating a reliable and practical ramp metering algorithm that considers both critical traffic measures and historical data is still a challenging problem. In this study we use simple machine learning approaches to develop a novel real-time ramp metering algorithm. The proposed algorithm is computationally simple and has minimal data requirements, which makes it practical for real-world applications. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate and compare the proposed approach with an existing traffic-responsive ramp metering algorithm.

TI  - MADICS: A Methodology for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are widely used in critical infrastructures to support the essential services of society. Therefore, their protection against terrorist activities, natural disasters, and cyber threats is critical. Diverse cyber attack detection systems have been proposed over the years, in which each proposal has applied different steps and methods. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding methodologies to detect cyber attacks in ICS scenarios. The lack of such methodologies prevents researchers from being able to accurately compare proposals and results. In this work, we present a Methodology for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems (MADICS) to detect cyber attacks in ICS scenarios, which is intended to provide a guideline for future works in the field. MADICS is based on a semi-supervised anomaly detection paradigm and makes use of deep learning algorithms to model ICS behaviors. It consists of five main steps, focused on pre-processing the dataset to be used with the machine learning and deep learning algorithms; performing feature filtering to remove those features that do not meet the requirements; feature extraction processes to obtain higher order features; selecting, fine-tuning, and training the most appropriate model; and validating the model performance. In order to validate MADICS, we used the popular Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset, which was collected from a fully operational water treatment plant. The experiments demonstrate that, using MADICS, we can achieve a state-of-the-art precision of 0.984 (as well as a recall of 0.750 and F1-score of 0.851), which is above the average of other works, proving that the proposed methodology is suitable for use in real ICS scenarios.

TI  - An Anomaly Mitigation Framework for IoT Using Fog Computing

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 10
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The advancement in IoT has prompted its application in areas such as smart homes, smart cities, etc., and this has aided its exponential growth. However, alongside this development, IoT networks are experiencing a rise in security challenges such as botnet attacks, which often appear as network anomalies. Similarly, providing security solutions has been challenging due to the low resources that characterize the devices in IoT networks. To overcome these challenges, the fog computing paradigm has provided an enabling environment that offers additional resources for deploying security solutions such as anomaly mitigation schemes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid anomaly mitigation framework for IoT using fog computing to ensure faster and accurate anomaly detection. The framework employs signature- and anomaly-based detection methodologies for its two modules, respectively. The signature-based module utilizes a database of attack sources (blacklisted IP addresses) to ensure faster detection when attacks are executed from the blacklisted IP address, while the anomaly-based module uses an extreme gradient boosting algorithm for accurate classification of network traffic flow into normal or abnormal. We evaluated the performance of both modules using an IoT-based dataset in terms response time for the signature-based module and accuracy in binary and multiclass classification for the anomaly-based module. The results show that the signature-based module achieves a fast attack detection of at least six times faster than the anomaly-based module in each number of instances evaluated. The anomaly-based module using the XGBoost classifier detects attacks with an accuracy of 99% and at least 97% for average recall, average precision, and average F1 score for binary and multiclass classification. Additionally, it recorded 0.05 in terms of false-positive rates.

VL  - 12
IS  - 19
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The urban environmental planning, a fundamental dynamic process for cities&rsquo; sustainability, could benefit from the soundscape approach, dealing with the perception of the acoustic environment in which sound is considered as a resource rather than a waste (noise). Noise and soundscape maps are useful tools for planning mitigation actions and for communication with citizens. Both mappings can benefit from crowdsourcing and participatory sound monitoring that has been made possible due to the large use of internet connections and mobile devices with dedicated apps. This paper is a &ldquo;scoping review&rdquo; to provide an overview of the potential, benefits, and drawbacks of participatory noise monitoring in noise and soundscape mapping applications, while also referring to metrological aspects. Gathering perceptual data on soundscapes by using digital questionnaires will likely be more commonly used than printed questionnaires; thus, the main differences between the experimental protocols concern the measurement of acoustic data. The authors propose to classify experimental protocols for in-field soundscape surveys into three types (GUIDE, MONITOR, and SMART) to be selected according to the survey&rsquo;s objectives and the territorial extension. The main future developments are expected to be related to progress in smartphone hardware and software, to the growth of social networks data analysis, as well as to the implementation of machine learning techniques.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the near future, the fifth-generation wireless technology is expected to be rolled out, offering low latency, high bandwidth and multiple antennas deployed in a single access point. This ecosystem will help further enhance various location-based scenarios such as assets tracking in smart factories, precise smart management of hydroponic indoor vertical farms and indoor way-finding in smart hospitals. Such a system will also integrate existing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), WiFi and other network infrastructures. In this respect, 5G precise indoor localization using heterogeneous IoT technologies (Zigbee, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, BLE, etc.) is a challenging research area. In this work, an experimental 5G testbed has been designed integrating C-RAN and IoT networks. This testbed is used to improve both vertical and horizontal localization (3D Localization) in a 5G IoT environment. To achieve this, we propose the DEep Learning-based co-operaTive Architecture (DELTA) machine learning model implemented on a 3D multi-layered fingerprint radiomap. The DELTA begins by estimating the 2D location. Then, the output is recursively used to predict the 3D location of a mobile station. This approach is going to benefit use cases such as 3D indoor navigation in multi-floor smart factories or in large complex buildings. Finally, we have observed that the proposed model has outperformed traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A smart home provides a facilitated environment for the detection of human activity with appropriate Deep Learning algorithms to manipulate data collected from numerous sensors attached to various smart things in a smart home environment. Human activities comprise expected and unexpected behavior events; therefore, detecting these events consisting of mutual dependent activities poses a key challenge in the activities detection paradigm. Besides, the battery-powered sensor ubiquitously and extensively monitors activities, disputes, and sensor energy depletion. Therefore, to address these challenges, we propose an Energy and Event Aware-Sensor Duty Cycling scheme. The proposed model predicts the future expected event using the Bi-Directional Long-Short Term Memory model and allocates Predictive Sensors to the predicted event. To detect the unexpected events, the proposed model localizes a Monitor Sensor within a cluster of Hibernate Sensors using the Jaccard Similarity Index. Finally, we optimize the performance of our proposed scheme by employing the Q-Learning algorithm to track the missed or undetected events. The simulation is executed against the conventional Machine Learning algorithms for the sensor duty cycle, scheduling to reduce the sensor energy consumption and improve the activity detection accuracy. The experimental evaluation of our proposed scheme shows significant improvement in activity detection accuracy from 94.12% to 96.12%. Besides, the effective rotation of the Monitor Sensor significantly improves the energy consumption of each sensor with the entire network lifetime.

AB  - Currently, there are several emerging technologies that seek to improve quality of life. To achieve this, it is important to establish the various technologies&rsquo; fields of action and to determine which technology meets the conditions established by the environment in which it is designed to operate in order to satisfy the needs of society. One type of environment is the university campus. This particular environment is conducive to the development and testing of technological innovations that might later be replicated in larger environments such as smart cities. The technology that has experienced the greatest development and introduction of applications is the Internet of Things. The wide variety of available devices and the wide reach of the Internet have become ideal parameters for the application of the Internet of Things in areas that previously required the work of people. The Internet of Things is seen as an assistant to, or a substitute for, processes that are generally routine and which require the effort of one or more people. This work focuses specifically on processes to improve administrative management in a university through the use of the Internet of Things.

TI  - Hybridised Artificial Neural Network Model with Slime Mould Algorithm: A Novel Methodology for Prediction of Urban Stochastic Water Demand

VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Urban water demand prediction based on climate change is always challenging for water utilities because of the uncertainty that results from a sudden rise in water demand due to stochastic patterns of climatic factors. For this purpose, a novel combined methodology including, firstly, data pre-processing techniques were employed to decompose the time series of water and climatic factors by using empirical mode decomposition and identifying the best model input via tolerance to avoid multi-collinearity. Second, the artificial neural network (ANN) model was optimised by an up-to-date slime mould algorithm (SMA-ANN) to predict the medium term of the stochastic signal of monthly urban water demand. Ten climatic factors over 16 years were used to simulate the stochastic signal of water demand. The results reveal that SMA outperforms a multi-verse optimiser and backtracking search algorithm based on error scale. The performance of the hybrid model SMA-ANN is better than ANN (stand-alone) based on the range of statistical criteria. Generally, this methodology yields accurate results with a coefficient of determination of 0.9 and a mean absolute relative error of 0.001. This study can assist local water managers to efficiently manage the present water system and plan extensions to accommodate the increasing water demand.

AB  - Multi-access edge computing (MEC) has become an essential technology for collecting, analyzing, and processing data generated by widely distributed user equipment (UE), wireless end-hosts, Internet of things (IoT) sensors, etc., providing real-time and high-quality networking services with ultralow end-to-end latency guaranteed between various user devices and edge cloud computing nodes. However, the cloud resources at the MEC on-site (access point) and edge site are restricted and insufficient mainly because of the operation and management constraints (e.g., limited space and capacity), particularly in the case of on-demand and dynamic service resource deployment. In this regard, we propose a selective MEC resource allocation scheme adopting a multitier architecture over a wide-area software-defined network (SDN) on the basis of our recent research work on virtual network slicing and resource orchestration. The proposed scheme provides an optimized MEC selection model considering end-to-end latency and efficient service resource utilization on the basis of the hierarchical MEC service architecture.

AB  - Several studies in environmental engineering emphasize the importance of air quality forecasting for sustainable development around the world. In this paper, we studied a new approach for air quality forecasting in Busan metropolitan city. We proposed a convolutional Bi-Directional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) autoencoder model trained using a distributed architecture to predict the concentration of the air quality particles (PM2.5 and PM10). The proposed deep learning model can automatically learn the intrinsic correlation among the pollutants in different location. Also, the meteorological and the pollution gas information at each location are fully utilized, which is beneficial for the performance of the model. We used multiple one-dimension convolutional neural network (CNN) layers to extract the local spatial features and a stacked Bi-LSTM layer to learn the spatiotemporal correlation of air quality particles. In addition, we used a stacked deep autoencoder to encode the essential transformation patterns of the pollution gas and the meteorological data, since they are very important for providing useful information that can significantly improve the prediction of the air quality particles. Finally, in order to reduce the training time and the resource consumption, we used a distributed deep leaning approach called data parallelism, which has never been used to tackle the problem of air quality forecasting. We evaluated our approach with extensive experiments based on the data collected in Busan metropolitan city. The results reveal the superiority of our framework over ten baseline models and display how the distributed deep learning model can significantly improve the training time and even the prediction accuracy.

AB  - Audio-based event detection poses a number of different challenges that are not encountered in other fields, such as image detection. Challenges such as ambient noise, low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and microphone distance are not yet fully understood. If the multimodal approaches are to become better in a range of fields of interest, audio analysis will have to play an integral part. Event recognition in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is such a field at a nascent stage that can especially leverage solely on audio or can be part of the multimodal approach. In this manuscript, an extensive analysis focused on the comparison of different magnitude representations of the raw audio is presented. The data on which the analysis is carried out is part of the publicly available MIVIA Audio Events dataset. Single channel Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), mel-scale and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) spectrogram representations are used. Furthermore, aggregation methods of the aforementioned spectrogram representations are examined; the feature concatenation compared to the stacking of features as separate channels. The effect of the SNR on recognition accuracy and the generalization of the proposed methods on datasets that were both seen and not seen during training are studied and reported.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Urban noise is one of the most serious and underestimated environmental problems. According to the World Health Organization, noise pollution from traffic and other human activities, negatively impact the population health and life quality. Monitoring noise usually requires the use of professional and expensive instruments, called phonometers, able to accurately measure sound pressure levels. In many cases, phonometers are human-operated; therefore, periodic fine-granularity city-wide measurements are expensive. Recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) offer a window of opportunities for low-cost autonomous sound pressure meters. Such devices and platforms could enable fine time&ndash;space noise measurements throughout a city. Unfortunately, low-cost sound pressure sensors are inaccurate when compared with phonometers, experiencing a high variability in the measurements. In this paper, we present RaveGuard, an unmanned noise monitoring platform that exploits artificial intelligence strategies to improve the accuracy of low-cost devices. RaveGuard was initially deployed together with a professional phonometer for over two months in downtown Bologna, Italy, with the aim of collecting a large amount of precise noise pollution samples. The resulting datasets have been instrumental in designing InspectNoise, a library that can be exploited by IoT platforms, without the need of expensive phonometers, but obtaining a similar precision. In particular, we have applied supervised learning algorithms (adequately trained with our datasets) to reduce the accuracy gap between the professional phonometer and an IoT platform equipped with low-end devices and sensors. Results show that RaveGuard, combined with the InspectNoise library, achieves a 2.24% relative error compared to professional instruments, thus enabling low-cost unmanned city-wide noise monitoring.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The proximity-based device-to-device (D2D) communication allows for internet of things, public safety, and data offloading services. Because of these advantages, D2D communication has been applied to wireless communication networks. In wireless networks using D2D communication, there are challenging problems of the data rate shortage and coverage limitation due to co-channel interference in the proximity communication. To resolve the problems, transmit power control schemes that are based on deep learning have been presented in network-assisted D2D communication systems. The power control schemes have focused on enhancing spectral efficiency and energy efficiency in the presence of interference. However, the data-rate fairness performance may be a key performance metric in D2D communications, because devices in proximity can expect fair quality of service in the system. Hence, in this paper, a transmit power control scheme using a deep-learning algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to consider the data-rate fairness performance in network-assisted D2D communication systems, where the wireless channels are modelled by path loss and Nakagami fading. In the proposed scheme, the batch normalization (BN) scheme is introduced in order to further enhance the spectral efficiency of the conventional deep-learning transmit power control scheme. In addition, a loss function for the deep-learning optimization is defined in order to consider both the data-rate fairness and spectral efficiency. Through simulation, we show that the proposed scheme can achieve extremely high fairness performance while improving the spectral efficiency of the conventional schemes. It is also shown that the improvement in the fairness and spectral efficiency is achieved for different Nakagami fading conditions and sizes of area containing the devices.

AB  - The sustainable development of mankind is a matter of concern to the whole world. Environmental pollution and haze diffusion have greatly affected the sustainable development of mankind. According to previous research, vehicle exhaust emissions are an important source of environmental pollution and haze diffusion. The sharp increase in the number of cars has also made the supply of energy increasingly tight. In this paper, we have explored the use of intelligent navigation technology based on data analysis to reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on road networks. We have implemented a traffic flow prediction method using a genetic algorithm and particle-swarm-optimization-enhanced support vector regression, constructed a model for predicting vehicle exhaust emissions based on predicted road conditions and vehicle fuel consumption, and built our low-carbon-emission-oriented navigation algorithm based on a spatially optimized dynamic path planning algorithm. The results show that our method could help to significantly reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on the road network, which means that our method could contribute to the construction of low-carbon-emission intelligent transportation systems and smart cities.

AB  - Acoustic pollution has been associated with adverse effects on the health and life expectancy of people, especially when noise exposure happens during the nighttime. With over half of the world population living in urban areas, acoustic pollution is an important concern for city administrators, especially those focused on transportation and leisure noise. Advances in sensor and network technologies made the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) possible in cities, which, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), can enable smart services for their citizens. However, the creation of such services often requires structured environmental audio databases to train AI algorithms. This paper reports on an environmental audio dataset of 363 min and 53 s created in a lively area of the Barcelona city center, which targeted traffic and leisure events. This dataset, which is free and publicly available, can provide researchers with real-world acoustic data to help the development and testing of sound monitoring solutions for urban environments.

AB  - Smart city strategies developed by cities around the world provide a useful resource for insights into the future of smart development. This study examines such strategies to identify plans for the explicit deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. A total of 12 case studies emerged from an online keyword search representing cities of various sizes globally. The search was based on the keywords of &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; (or &ldquo;AI&rdquo;), and &ldquo;robot,&rdquo; representing robotics and associated terminology. Based on the findings, it is evident that the more concentrated deployment of AI and robotics in smart city development is currently in the Global North, although countries in the Global South are also increasingly represented. Multiple cities in Australia and Canada actively seek to develop AI and robotics, and Moscow has one of the most in-depth elaborations for this deployment. The ramifications of these plans are discussed as part of cyber&ndash;physical systems alongside consideration given to the social and ethical implications.

VL  - 13

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Electrical load forecasting provides knowledge about future consumption and generation of electricity. There is a high level of fluctuation behavior between energy generation and consumption. Sometimes, the energy demand of the consumer becomes higher than the energy already generated, and vice versa. Electricity load forecasting provides a monitoring framework for future energy generation, consumption, and making a balance between them. In this paper, we propose a framework, in which deep learning and supervised machine learning techniques are implemented for electricity-load forecasting. A three-step model is proposed, which includes: feature selection, extraction, and classification. The hybrid of Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) is used to calculate features&rsquo; importance. The average feature importance of hybrid techniques selects the most relevant and high importance features in the feature selection method. The Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method is used to eliminate the irrelevant features in the feature extraction method. The load forecasting is performed with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a hybrid of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The meta-heuristic algorithms, i.e., Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Earth Worm Optimization (EWO) are applied to tune the hyper-parameters of SVM and CNN-GRU, respectively. The accuracy of our enhanced techniques CNN-GRU-EWO and SVM-GWO is 96.33% and 90.67%, respectively. Our proposed techniques CNN-GRU-EWO and SVM-GWO perform 7% and 3% better than the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA). In the end, a comparison with SOTA techniques is performed to show the improvement of the proposed techniques. This comparison showed that the proposed technique performs well and results in the lowest performance error rates and highest accuracy rates as compared to other techniques.

AB  - With the development of the next generation of information technology, an increasing amount of attention is being paid to smart residential spaces, including smart cities, smart buildings, and smart homes. Building indoor safety intelligence is an important research topic. However, current indoor safety management methods cannot comprehensively analyse safety data, owing to a poor combination of safety management and building information. Additionally, the judgement of danger depends significantly on the experience of the safety management staff. In this study, digital twins (DTs) are introduced to building indoor safety management. A framework for an indoor safety management system based on DT is proposed which exploits the Internet of Things (IoT), building information modelling (BIM), the Internet, and support vector machines (SVMs) to improve the level of intelligence for building indoor safety management. A DT model (DTM) is developed using BIM integrated with operation information collected by IoT sensors. The trained SVM model is used to automatically obtain the types and levels of danger by processing the data in the DTM. The Internet is a medium for interactions between people and systems. A building in the bobsleigh and sled stadium for the Beijing Winter Olympics is considered as an example; the proposed system realises the functions of the scene display of the operation status, danger warning and positioning, danger classification and level assessment, and danger handling suggestions.

AB  - The Internet of Things paradigm is growing rapidly. In fact, controlling this massive growth of IoT globally raises new security and privacy issues. The traditional access control mechanisms provide security to IoT systems such as DAC (discretionary access control) and mandatory access control (MAC). However, these mechanisms are based on central authority management, which raises some issues such as absence of scalability, single point of failure, and lack of privacy. Recently, the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain technology integrated with access control can help to overcome privacy and security issues in the IoT. This paper presents a review of different access control mechanisms in IoT systems. We present a comparison table of reviewed access control mechanisms. The mechanisms&rsquo; scalability, distribution, security, user-centric, privacy and policy enforcing are compared. In addition, we provide access control classifications. Finally, we highlight challenges and future research directions in developing decentralized access control mechanisms for IoT systems.

AB  - The concept of edge caching provision in emerging 5G and beyond mobile networks is a promising method to deal both with the traffic congestion problem in the core network, as well as reducing latency to access popular content. In that respect, end user demand for popular content can be satisfied by proactively caching it at the network edge, i.e., at close proximity to the users. In addition to model-based caching schemes, learning-based edge caching optimizations have recently attracted significant attention, and the aim hereafter is to capture these recent advances for both model-based and data-driven techniques in the area of proactive caching. This paper summarizes the utilization of deep learning for data caching in edge network. We first outline the typical research topics in content caching and formulate a taxonomy based on network hierarchical structure. Then, many key types of deep learning algorithms are presented, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning. Furthermore, a comparison of state-of-the-art literature is provided from the aspects of caching topics and deep learning methods. Finally, we discuss research challenges and future directions of applying deep learning for caching.

AB  - Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are emerging field characterized by complex data model, dynamics and strict time requirements. Ensuring cybersecurity in ITS is a complex task on which the safety and efficiency of transportation depends. The imposition of standards for a comprehensive architecture, as well as specific security standards, is one of the key steps in the evolution of ITS. The article examines the general outlines of the ITS architecture and security issues. The main focus of security approaches is: configuration and initialization of the devices during manufacturing at perception layer; anonymous authentication of nodes in VANET at network layer; defense of fog-based structures at support layer and description and standardization of the complex model of data and metadata and defense of systems, based on AI at application layer. The article oversees some conventional methods as network segmentation and cryptography that should be adapted in order to be applied in ITS cybersecurity. The focus is on innovative approaches that have recently been trying to find their place in ITS security strategies. These approaches includes blockchain, bloom filter, fog computing, artificial intelligence, game theory and ontologies. In conclusion, a correlation is made between the commented methods, the problems they solve and the architectural layers in which they are applied.

AB  - 5G networks and Internet of Things (IoT) offer a powerful platform for ubiquitous environments with their ubiquitous sensing, high speeds and other benefits. The data, analytics, and other computations need to be optimally moved and placed in these environments, dynamically, such that energy-efficiency and QoS demands are best satisfied. A particular challenge in this context is to preserve privacy and security while delivering quality of service (QoS) and energy-efficiency. Many works have tried to address these challenges but without a focus on optimizing all of them and assuming fixed models of environments and security threats. This paper proposes the UbiPriSEQ framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to adaptively, dynamically, and holistically optimize QoS, energy-efficiency, security, and privacy. UbiPriSEQ is built on a three-layered model and comprises two modules. UbiPriSEQ devises policies and makes decisions related to important parameters including local processing and offloading rates for data and computations, radio channel states, transmit power, task priority, and selection of fog nodes for offloading, data migration, and so forth. UbiPriSEQ is implemented in Python over the TensorFlow platform and is evaluated using a real-life application in terms of SINR, privacy metric, latency, and utility function, manifesting great promise.

AB  - Low power wide area network (LPWAN) is among the fastest growing networks in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Owing to varieties of outstanding features which include long range communication and low power consumption, LPWANs are fast becoming the most widely deployed connectivity standards in IoT domain. However, this promising network are exposed to various security and privacy threats and challenges. For reliable connectivity within networks, the security and privacy challenges need to be effectively addressed with proper mitigation protocol in place. In this paper, a comprehensive review on the security feature of LPWAN is presented.

AB  - Cooperative-Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) have brought a technological revolution, especially for ground vehicles, in terms of road safety, traffic efficiency, as well as in the experience of drivers and passengers. So far, these advances have been focused on traditional transportation means, leaving aside the new generation of personal vehicles that are nowadays flooding our streets. Together with bicycles and motorcycles, personal mobility devices such as segways or electric scooters are firm sustainable alternatives that represent the future to achieve eco-friendly personal mobility in urban settings. In a near future, smart cities will become hyper-connected spaces where these vehicles should be integrated within the underlying C-ITS ecosystem. In this paper, we provide a wide overview of the opportunities and challenges related to this necessary integration as well as the communication solutions that are already in the market to provide these moving devices with low-cost and efficient connectivity. We also present an On-Board Unit (OBU) prototype with different communication options based on the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) paradigm and several sensors to gather environmental information to facilitate eco-efficiency services. As the attained results suggest, this module allows personal vehicles to be fully integrated in smart city environments, presenting the possibilities of LoRaWAN and Narrow Band-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) communication technologies to provide vehicle connectivity and enable mobile urban sensing.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a new technology that enables both virtual and physical objects to be connected and communicate with each other, and produce new digitized services that improve our quality of life. The IoT system provides several advantages, however, the current centralized architecture introduces numerous issues involving a single point of failure, security, privacy, transparency, and data integrity. These challenges are an obstacle in the way of the future developments of IoT applications. Moving the IoT into one of the distributed ledger technologies may be the correct choice to resolve these issues. Among the common and popular types of distributed ledger technologies is the blockchain. Integrating the IoT with blockchain technology can bring countless benefits. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive discussion of integrating the IoT system with blockchain technology. After providing the basics of the IoT system and blockchain technology, a thorough review of integrating the blockchain with the IoT system is presented by highlighting benefits of the integration and how the blockchain can resolve the issues of the IoT system. Then, the blockchain as a service for the IoT is presented to show how various features of blockchain technology can be implemented as a service for various IoT applications. This is followed by discussing the impact of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on both IoT and blockchain. In the end, future research directions of IoT with blockchain are presented.

TI  - Trusted Decision-Making: Data Governance for Creating Trust in Data Science Decision Outcomes
T2  - Administrative Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
SN  - 2076-3387

AB  - Organizations are increasingly introducing data science initiatives to support decision-making. However, the decision outcomes of data science initiatives are not always used or adopted by decision-makers, often due to uncertainty about the quality of data input. It is, therefore, not surprising that organizations are increasingly turning to data governance as a means to improve the acceptance of data science decision outcomes. In this paper, propositions will be developed to understand the role of data governance in creating trust in data science decision outcomes. Two explanatory case studies in the asset management domain are analyzed to derive boundary conditions. The first case study is a data science project designed to improve the efficiency of road management through predictive maintenance, and the second case study is a data science project designed to detect fraudulent usage of electricity in medium and low voltage electrical grids without infringing privacy regulations. The duality of technology is used as our theoretical lens to understand the interactions between the organization, decision-makers, and technology. The results show that data science decision outcomes are more likely to be accepted if the organization has an established data governance capability. Data governance is also needed to ensure that organizational conditions of data science are met, and that incurred organizational changes are managed efficiently. These results imply that a mature data governance capability is required before sufficient trust can be placed in data science decision outcomes for decision-making.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Predicting dam inflow is necessary for effective water management. This study created machine learning algorithms to predict the amount of inflow into the Soyang River Dam in South Korea, using weather and dam inflow data for 40 years. A total of six algorithms were used, as follows: decision tree (DT), multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), recurrent neural network&ndash;long short-term memory (RNN&ndash;LSTM), and convolutional neural network&ndash;LSTM (CNN&ndash;LSTM). Among these models, the multilayer perceptron model showed the best results in predicting dam inflow, with the Nash&ndash;Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) value of 0.812, root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 77.218 m3/s, mean absolute error (MAE) of 29.034 m3/s, correlation coefficient (R) of 0.924, and determination coefficient (R2) of 0.817. However, when the amount of dam inflow is below 100 m3/s, the ensemble models (random forest and gradient boosting models) performed better than MLP for the prediction of dam inflow. Therefore, two combined machine learning (CombML) models (RF_MLP and GB_MLP) were developed for the prediction of the dam inflow using the ensemble methods (RF and GB) at precipitation below 16 mm, and the MLP at precipitation above 16 mm. The precipitation of 16 mm is the average daily precipitation at the inflow of 100 m3/s or more. The results show the accuracy verification results of NSE 0.857, RMSE 68.417 m3/s, MAE 18.063 m3/s, R 0.927, and R2 0.859 in RF_MLP, and NSE 0.829, RMSE 73.918 m3/s, MAE 18.093 m3/s, R 0.912, and R2 0.831 in GB_MLP, which infers that the combination of the models predicts the dam inflow the most accurately. CombML algorithms showed that it is possible to predict inflow through inflow learning, considering flow characteristics such as flow regimes, by combining several machine learning algorithms.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - According to the United Nations, 70% of the world&rsquo;s population will live in cities by 2050. This growth will be reflected in the demand for better services that should be adjusted to the collective and individual needs of the population. Governments and organizations are working on defining and implementing strategies that will enable them to respond to these challenges. The main challenges are related to transport and its management, considering transportation as a core issue in the economy, sustainability, and development of the regions. In this way, the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) play a key role in the response to these scenarios, being that they are the framework where the new hardware and software tools are integrated, allowing an efficient development of transportation systems management, attending to aspects such as: traffic management, communications between vehicles and infrastructures, and security, among others. Nevertheless, the concept of ITS evolves rapidly so it is necessary to understand its evolution. To do that, the current research develops a thematic analysis of ITS in literature, evaluating the intellectual structure and its evolution using SciMAT, quantifying the main bibliometric performance indicators, and identifying the main research areas, authors, journals, and countries. To this purpose, the publications related to ITS from 1993 to 2019 available in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection were retrieved (7649 publications) and analyzed. Finally, one of the main results is the latest research themes map of ITS, considering its intellectual structure, evolution, and relationship. It assists in the definition and implementation of strategies, the identification of the scientific, academic, and business opportunities, and future research lines to consolidate the role of ITS in the new city models.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Bruxism is a sleep disorder in which the patient clinches and gnashes their teeth. Bruxism detection using traditional methods is time-consuming, cumbersome, and expensive. Therefore, an automatic tool to detect this disorder will alleviate the doctor workload and give valuable help to patients. In this paper, we targeted this goal and designed an automatic method to detect bruxism from the physiological signals using a novel hybrid classifier. We began with data collection. Then, we performed the analysis of the physiological signals and the estimation of the power spectral density. After that, we designed the novel hybrid classifier to enable the detection of bruxism based on these data. The classification of the subjects into &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; or &ldquo;bruxism&rdquo; from the electroencephalogram channel (C4-A1) obtained a maximum specificity of 92% and an accuracy of 94%. Besides, the classification of the sleep stages such as the wake (w) stage and rapid eye movement (REM) stage from the electrocardiogram channel (ECG1-ECG2) obtained a maximum specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 95%. The combined bruxism classification and the sleep stages classification from the electroencephalogram channel (C4-P4) obtained a maximum specificity of 90% and an accuracy of 97%. The results show that more accurate bruxism detection is achieved by exploiting the electroencephalogram signal (C4-P4). The present work can be applied for home monitoring systems for bruxism detection.

AB  - New digital technologies are a driving force behind many pivotal changes in our modern world. For example, the carsharing business model has improved drastically through the adoption of technologies for online booking, instant access, vehicle monitoring, and automated billing. However, the challenge of vehicle supply and demand management hinders carsharing from reaching its full potential and mainstream application. The current norm of relocating vehicles via employees is expensive and unsustainable, counteracting the environmental benefits of carsharing. To engage this problem, a new concept called user-based relocation has emerged in recent years. For user-based relocation, customers are requested to return rented vehicles at undersupplied locations. However, research and practice lack knowledge on how to implement user-based relocation in a real-world carsharing system. This study employs an iterative research approach, including the implementation of user-based relocation in a real-world carsharing system. During the development and evaluation process, novel requirements and challenges for user-based relocation were discovered, providing valuable knowledge for its implementation and future research.

AB  - Recently, with the continuous evolution of information technology, various products such as Building Information, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Cloud Computing and Machine Learning have been developed and have created a lifestyle change. A smart Internet of Things (IoT) system is formed by combining the communication capabilities of the internet with control, monitoring and identification services to integrate people, things and objects. However, in some IoT environments that have a weak signal, such as remote areas, warehouses or basements, the network may become unstable, meaning that the IoT system is unable to provide efficient services. This paper therefore presents a framework that ensures the reliability of IoT system services so that even if the IoT system cannot connect to the network, the system can provide the services offline. To avoid increasing the installation cost or replacing existing traditional devices with modern smart devices, this framework can also be used to control traditional devices. The system operation is convenient because users can operate all their smart and traditional devices under the IoT system through voice commands and/or a handheld microcontroller, thus reducing the manual operation of the user. The framework proposed in this paper can be applied to various smart scenarios, including smart warehouses, smart restaurants, smart homes, smart farms and smart factories, to improve people&rsquo;s quality of life and convenience, and create a humane and comfortable smart living environment.

AB  - Improving road safety through artificial intelligence-based systems is now crucial turning smart cities into a reality. Under this highly relevant and extensive heading, an approach is proposed to improve vehicle detection in smart crosswalks using machine learning models. Contrarily to classic fuzzy classifiers, machine learning models do not require the readjustment of labels that depend on the location of the system and the road conditions. Several machine learning models were trained and tested using real traffic data taken from urban scenarios in both Portugal and Spain. These include random forest, time-series forecasting, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine, and logistic regression models. A deep reinforcement learning agent, based on a state-of-the-art double-deep recurrent Q-network, is also designed and compared with the machine learning models just mentioned. Results show that the machine learning models can efficiently replace the classic fuzzy classifier.

AB  - Real-time automatic identification of audio distress signals in urban areas is a task that in a smart city can improve response times in emergency alert systems. The main challenge in this problem lies in finding a model that is able to accurately recognize these type of signals in the presence of background noise and allows for real-time processing. In this paper, we present the design of a portable and low-cost device for accurate audio distress signal recognition in real urban scenarios based on deep learning models. As real audio distress recordings in urban areas have not been collected and made publicly available so far, we first constructed a database where audios were recorded in urban areas using a low-cost microphone. Using this database, we trained a deep multi-headed 2D convolutional neural network that processed temporal and frequency features to accurately recognize audio distress signals in noisy environments with a significant performance improvement to other methods from the literature. Then, we deployed and assessed the trained convolutional neural network model on a Raspberry Pi that, along with the low-cost microphone, constituted a device for accurate real-time audio recognition. Source code and database are publicly available.

AB  - This publication describes an innovative approach to voice control of operational and technical functions in a real Smart Home (SH) environment, where, for voice control within SH, it is necessary to provide robust technological systems for building automation and for technology visualization, software for recognition of individual voice commands, and a robust system for additive noise canceling. The KNX technology for building automation is used and described in the article. The LabVIEW SW tool is used for visualization, data connectivity to the speech recognizer, connection to the sound card, and the actual mathematical calculations within additive noise canceling. For the actual recognition of commands, the SW tool for recognition within the Microsoft Windows OS is used. In the article, the least mean squares algorithm (LMS) and independent component analysis (ICA) are used for additive noise canceling from the speech signal measured in a real SH environment. Within the proposed experiments, the success rate of voice command recognition for different types of additive interference (television, vacuum cleaner, washing machine, dishwasher, and fan) in the real SH environment was compared. The recognition success rate was greater than 95% for the selected experiments.

SN  - 2624-831X

AB  - In a context of increased environmental awareness, the Internet of Things has allowed individuals or entities to build their own connected devices to share data about the environment. These data are often obtained from widely available low-cost sensors. Some companies are also selling low-cost sensing kits for in-house or outdoor use. The work described in this paper evaluated, in the short term, the performance of a set of low-cost sensors for temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and carbon dioxide, commonly used in these platforms. The research challenge addressed with this work was assessing how trustable the raw data obtained from these sensors are. The experiments made use of 18 climatic sensors from six different models, and they were evaluated in a controlled climatic chamber that reproduced controlled situations for temperature and humidity. Four CO2 sensors from two different models were analysed through exposure to different gas concentrations in an indoor environment. Our results revealed temperature sensors with a very high positive coefficient of determination (r2 &ge; 0.99), as well as the presence of bias and almost zero random error; the humidity sensors demonstrated a very high positive correlation (r2 &ge; 0.98), significant bias and small-yet-relevant random error; the atmospheric pressure sensors presented good reproducibility, but further studies are required to evaluate their accuracy and precision. For carbon dioxide, the non-dispersive infra-red sensors demonstrated very satisfactory results (r2 &ge; 0.97, with a minimum root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 26 ppm); the metal oxide sensors, despite their moderate results (minimum RMSE equal to 40 ppm and r2 of 0.8&ndash;0.96), presented hysteresis, environmental dependence and even positioning interference. The results suggest that most of the evaluated low-cost sensors can provide a good sense of reality at a very good cost&ndash;benefit ratio in certain situations.

TI  - Tensor Decomposition for Spatial—Temporal Traffic Flow Prediction with Sparse Data

PY  - 2020

IS  - 21
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Urban transport traffic surveillance is of great importance for public traffic control and personal travel path planning. Effective and efficient traffic flow prediction is helpful to optimize these real applications. The main challenge of traffic flow prediction is the data sparsity problem, meaning that traffic flow on some roads or of certain periods cannot be monitored. This paper presents a transport traffic prediction method that leverages the spatial and temporal correlation of transportation traffic to tackle this problem. We first propose to model the traffic flow using a fourth-order tensor, which incorporates the location, the time of day, the day of the week, and the week of the month. Based on the constructed traffic flow tensor, we either propose a model to estimate the correlation in each dimension of the tensor. Furthermore, we utilize the gradient descent strategy to design a traffic flow prediction algorithm that is capable of tackling the data sparsity problem from the spatial and temporal perspectives of the traffic pattern. To validate the proposed traffic prediction method, case studies using real-work datasets are constructed, and the results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of our proposed method outperforms the baselines. The accuracy decreases the least with the percentage of missing data increasing, including the situation of data being missing on neighboring roads in one or continuous multi-days. This certifies that the proposed prediction method can be utilized for sparse data-based transportation traffic surveillance.

SN  - 2673-3951

AB  - Current and future smart cities are moving towards the zero-net energy use concept. To this end, the built environment should also be designed for efficient energy use and play a significant role in the production of such energy. At present, this is achieved by focusing on energy demand in buildings and to the renewable trade-off related to smart power grids. However, urban water distribution systems constantly carry an excess of hydraulic energy that can potentially be recovered to produce electricity. This paper presents a comprehensive review of current strategies for energy production by reviewing the state-of-the-art of smart water systems. New technologies (such as cyber-physical systems, digital twins, blockchain) and new methodologies (network dynamics, geometric deep learning) associated with digital water are also discussed. The paper then focuses on modelling the installation of both micro-turbines and pumps as turbines, instead of/together with pressure reduction valves, to further demonstrate the energy-recovery methods which will enable water network partitioning into district metered areas. The associated benefits on leakage control, as a source of energy, and for contributing to overall network resilience are also highlighted. The paper concludes by presenting future research directions. Notably, digital water is proposed as the main research and operational direction for current and future Water Distribution Systems (WDS) and as a holistic, data-centred framework for the operation and management of water networks.

AB  - This study proposes a Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based Human Machine Interface (HMI) framework for intuitive space-based energy management. The BIM-based HMI supports building managers with a method of linking data between BIM and Building Energy Management System (BEMS), which are heterogeneous systems, and provides space-based real-time energy monitoring. This study also proposes a BIM and BEMS data linking framework for systematic BIM-based HMI development. Towards this end, the BIM-based HMI framework was defined after deriving the considerations and requirements necessary for linking the energy control point and BIM through a questionnaire designed by practitioners. Through case analysis, the authors implemented BIM-based HMI and analyzed its effects. The results of the analysis confirmed the positive effects (3.9/5.0) on the connectivity of BIM-based HMI, the benefits (4.3/5.0) for real-time data monitoring, the system function expandability, and the BIM-based spatial intuitiveness.

AB  - In the recent era of the Internet of Things, the dominant role of sensors and the Internet provides a solution to a wide variety of real-life problems. Such applications include smart city, smart healthcare systems, smart building, smart transport and smart environment. However, the real-time IoT sensor data include several challenges, such as a deluge of unclean sensor data and a high resource-consumption cost. As such, this paper addresses how to process IoT sensor data, fusion with other data sources, and analyses to produce knowledgeable insight into hidden data patterns for rapid decision-making. This paper addresses the data processing techniques such as data denoising, data outlier detection, missing data imputation and data aggregation. Further, it elaborates on the necessity of data fusion and various data fusion methods such as direct fusion, associated feature extraction, and identity declaration data fusion. This paper also aims to address data analysis integration with emerging technologies, such as cloud computing, fog computing and edge computing, towards various challenges in IoT sensor network and sensor data analysis. In summary, this paper is the first of its kind to present a complete overview of IoT sensor data processing, fusion and analysis techniques.

AB  - The role of agriculture in environmental degradation and climate change has been at the center of a long-lasting and controversial debate. This situation combined with the expected growth in crop demand and the increasing prices of fertilizers and pesticides has made the need for a more resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable agriculture more evident than ever. Precision agriculture (PA), as a relatively new farming management concept, aims to improve crop performance as well as to reduce the environmental footprint by utilizing information about the temporal and the spatial variability of crops. Information and communication technology (ICT) systems have influenced and shaped every part of modern life, and PA is no exception. The current paper conducts a literature review of prominent ICT solutions, focusing on their role in supporting different phases of the lifecycle of PA-related data. In addition to this, a data lifecycle model was developed as part of a novel categorization approach for the analyzed solutions.

TI  - CNN-Based Fall Detection Strategy with Edge Computing Scheduling in Smart Cities

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The livelihood problem, especially the medical wisdom, has played an important role during the process of the building of smart cities. For the medical wisdom, the fall detection has attracted the considerable attention from the global researchers and medical institutions. It is very difficult for the traditional fall detection strategies to realize the intelligent detection with the following three reasons: (i) the data collection cannot reach the real-time level; (ii) the adopted detection methods cannot satisfy the enough stability; and (iii) the computation overhead of collection device is very high, which causes the barely satisfactory detection effect. Therefore, this paper proposes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fall detection strategy with edge computing consideration, where the global network view ability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is used to collect the generated data from smartphone. Meanwhile, on one hand, the edge computing is exploited to put some computation tasks at the edge server by the scheduling technique. On the other hand, CNN is equipped with both edge server and smartphone, and it is leveraged to train the related data and further give the guidance of fall detection. The experimental results show that the novel fall detection strategy has a more accurate rate, transmission delay, and stability than two cutting-edge strategies.

AB  - The epidemic of coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) started in Italy with the first official diagnosis on 21 February 2020; However, it is not known how many cases were already present in earlier days and weeks, thus limiting the possibilities of conducting any retrospective analysis. We hypothesized that an unbiased representation of COVID-19 diffusion in these early phases could be inferred by the georeferenced calls to the emergency number relevant to respiratory problems and by the following emergency medical services (EMS) interventions. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to identify the beginning of anomalous trends (change in the data morphology) in emergency calls and EMS ambulances dispatches and reconstruct COVID-19 spatiotemporal evolution on the territory of Lombardy region. Accordingly, a signal processing method, previously used to find morphological features on the electrocardiographic signal, was applied on a time series representative of territorial clusters of about 100,000 citizens. Both emergency calls and age- and gender-weighted ambulance dispatches resulted strongly correlated to COVID-19 casualties on a provincial level, and the identified local starting days anticipated the official diagnoses and casualties, thus demonstrating how these parameters could be effectively used as early indicators for the spatiotemporal evolution of the epidemic on a certain territory.

TI  - The Short-Term Forecasting of Asymmetry Photovoltaic Power Based on the Feature Extraction of PV Power and SVM Algorithm
T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 11
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - To improve forecasting accuracy for photovoltaic (PV) power output, this paper proposes a hybrid method for forecasting the short-term PV power output. First, by introducing the noise level, an improved complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) is developed to determine the ensemble size and amplitude of the added white noise adaptively. ICEEMDAN can change PV power output with non-symmetry into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with symmetry. ICEEMDAN can enhance the forecasting accuracy for PV power by IMFs with physical meaning (not including spurious modes). Second, the selection method of relative modes (IF), which is determined by the comprehensive factor, including the shape factor, crest factor and Kurtosis, is introduced to adaptively classify the IMFs into groups including similar fluctuating components. The IF can avoid the drawbacks of threshold determination by an empirical method. Third, the modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) (MPSO) is proposed to optimize the hyper-parameters in the support vector machine (SVM) by introducing the piecewise inertial weight. MPSO can improve the global and local search ability to make the particles traverse the global space and strengthen the performance of local convergence. Finally, the proposed method (ICEEMDAN-IF-MPSO-SVM) is used to forecast the PV power output of each group individually, and then, the single forecasting result is reconstructed to obtain the desired forecasting result for PV power output. By comparison with the other typical methods, the proposed method is more suitable for forecasting PV power output.

AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate elevated parks as urban green spaces using social media data analytics. Two popular elevated parks, the High Line Park in New York and the 606 in Chicago, were selected as the study sites. Tweets mentioning the two parks were collected from 2015 to 2019. By using text mining, social media users&rsquo; sentiments and conveyed perceptions about the elevated parks were studied. In addition, users&rsquo; activities and their satisfaction were analyzed. For the 606, users mainly enjoyed the free events at the park and worried about possible increases in housing prices and taxes because of the 606. They tended to participate in physical activities such as biking and walking. Although the 606 provides scenic observation points, users did not seem to enjoy these. Regarding the High Line, users frequently mentioned New York City, which is an important aspect of the identity of the park. The High Line users also frequently mentioned arts and relaxation. Overall, this study supports the idea that social media analytics can be used to gain an understanding of the public&rsquo;s use of urban green spaces and their attitudes and concerns.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - Human errors are probably the main cause of car accidents, and this type of vehicle is one of the most dangerous forms of transport for people. The danger comes from the fact that on public roads there are simultaneously different types of actors (drivers, pedestrians or cyclists) and many objects that change their position over time, making difficult to predict their immediate movements. The intelligent transport system (ITS-G5) standard specifies the European communication technologies and protocols to assist public road users, providing them with relevant information. The scientific community is developing ITS-G5 applications for various purposes, among which is the increasing of pedestrian safety. This paper describes the developed work to implement an ITS-G5 prototype that aims at the increasing of pedestrian and driver safety in the vicinity of a pedestrian crosswalk by sending ITS-G5 decentralized environmental notification messages (DENM) to the vehicles. These messages are analyzed, and if they are relevant, they are presented to the driver through a car&rsquo;s onboard infotainment system. This alert allows the driver to take safety precautions to prevent accidents. The implemented prototype was tested in a controlled environment pedestrian crosswalk. The results showed the capacity of the prototype for detecting pedestrians, suitable message sending, the reception and processing on a vehicle onboard unit (OBU) module and its presentation on the car onboard infotainment system.

AB  - In the real Internet of Everything scenario, many large-scale information systems can be converted into interdependent sensor networks, such as smart grids, smart medical systems, and industrial Internet systems. These complex systems usually have multiple interdependent sensor networks. Small faults or failure behaviors between networks may cause serious cascading failure effects of the entire system. Therefore, in this paper, we will focus on the security of interdependent sensor networks. Firstly, by calculating the size of the largest functional component in the entire network, the impact of random attacks on the security of interdependent sensor networks is analyzed. Secondly, it compares and analyzes the impact of cascading failures between interdependent sensor networks under different switching edge strategies. Finally, the simulation results verify the effect of the security of the system under different strategies, and give a better exchange strategy to enhance the security of the system. In addition, the research work in this article can help design how to further optimize the topology of interdependent sensor networks by reducing the impact of cascading failures.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) technology is increasingly pervasive in all aspects of our life and its usage is anticipated to significantly increase in future Smart Cities to support their myriad of revolutionary applications. This paper introduces a new architecture that can support several IoT-enabled smart home use cases, with a specified level of security and privacy preservation. The security threats that may target such an architecture are highlighted along with the cryptographic algorithms that can prevent them. An experimental study is performed to provide more insights about the suitability of several lightweight cryptographic algorithms for use in securing the constrained IoT devices used in the proposed architecture. The obtained results showed that many modern lightweight symmetric cryptography algorithms, as CLEFIA and TRIVIUM, are optimized for hardware implementations and can consume up to 10 times more energy than the legacy techniques when they are implemented in software. Moreover, the experiments results highlight that CLEFIA significantly outperforms TRIVIUM under all of the investigated test cases, and the latter performs 100 times worse than the legacy cryptographic algorithms tested.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 21
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The Passive House standard has become the standard for many countries in the construction of the Zero Energy Building (ZEB). Korea also adopted the standard and has achieved great success in building energy savings. However, some issues remain with ZEBs in Korea. Among them, this study aims to discuss overheating issues. Field measurements were carried out to analyze the overheating risk for a library built as a ZEB. A data-driven overheating risk prediction model was developed to analyze the overheating risk, requiring only a small amount of data and extending the analysis throughout the year. The main factors causing overheating during both the cooling season and the intermediate seasons are also analyzed in detail. The overheating frequency exceeded 60% of days in July and August, the midsummer season in Korea. Overheating also occurred during the intermediate seasons when air conditioners were off, such as in May and October in Korea. Overheating during the cooling season was caused mainly by unexpected increases in occupancy rate, while overheating in the mid-term was mainly due to an increase in solar irradiation. This is because domestic ZEB standards define the reinforcement of insulation and airtight performance, but there are no standards for solar insolation through windows or for internal heat generation. The results of this study suggest that a fixed performance standard for ZEBs that does not reflect the climate or cultural characteristics of the region in which a ZEB is built may not result in energy savings at the operational stage and may not guarantee the thermal comfort of occupants.

AB  - In next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, every object such as a wearable device, a smartphone, a vehicle, and even a sensor or an actuator will be provided with a digital counterpart (twin) with the aim of augmenting the physical object’s capabilities and acting on its behalf when interacting with third parties. Moreover, such objects can be able to interact and autonomously establish social relationships according to the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm. In such a context, the goal of this work is to provide an optimal solution for the social-aware placement of IoT digital twins (DTs) at the network edge, with the twofold aim of reducing the latency (i) between physical devices and corresponding DTs for efficient data exchange, and (ii) among DTs of friend devices to speed-up the service discovery and chaining procedures across the SIoT network. To this aim, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model taking into account limited computing resources in the edge cloud and social relationships among IoT devices.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 11
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Smart lighting systems based on the Digital Addressable Lighting Interface (DALI) protocol are the most suitable for street lighting systems, allowing digital lighting control operations. Unfortunately, the microcontrollers, which are commonly used in the Wireless Sensor Network nodes to control the lamps, do not implement this protocol. The DALI protocol implemented by software in the microcontroller consumes hardware resources (timers), processing time and requires a precise temporal analysis of the application, due to the strict bit times and the Manchester coding that it uses. In this work, the design of a bridge is proposed to free the microcontroller from the implementation of the DALI protocol. The novelty of this work is the implementation of the DALI Bridge in a low-cost Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with low power consumption. The bridge has been described in the hardware description language following the 1076-93 and 1076.3-97 standards, to guarantee its portability. The results of the synthesis show that a minimum amount of logical and routing resources is used, that the power consumption is in the order of tens of mW, that it has a very small latency time and that it supports a high operating frequency, which allows adding new functions. Its operation is verified by implementing a wireless sensor node using an FPGA of the Lattice Semiconductor iCE40 family.
