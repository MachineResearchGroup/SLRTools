TI  - SLIC Superpixel-Based l2,1-Norm Robust Principal Component Analysis for Hyperspectral Image Classification

AB  - Hyperspectral Images (HSIs) contain enriched information due to the presence of various bands, which have gained attention for the past few decades. However, explosive growth in HSIs&rsquo; scale and dimensions causes &ldquo;Curse of dimensionality&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hughes phenomenon&rdquo;. Dimensionality reduction has become an important means to overcome the &ldquo;Curse of dimensionality&rdquo;. In hyperspectral images, labeled samples are more difficult to collect because they require many labor and material resources. Semi-supervised dimensionality reduction is very important in mining high-dimensional data due to the lack of costly-labeled samples. The promotion of the supervised dimensionality reduction method to the semi-supervised method is mostly done by graph, which is a powerful tool for characterizing data relationships and manifold exploration. To take advantage of the spatial information of data, we put forward a novel graph construction method for semi-supervised learning, called SLIC Superpixel-based     l  2 , 1     -norm Robust Principal Component Analysis (SURPCA2,1), which integrates superpixel segmentation method Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) into Low-rank Decomposition. First, the SLIC algorithm is adopted to obtain the spatial homogeneous regions of HSI. Then, the     l  2 , 1     -norm RPCA is exploited in each superpixel area, which captures the global information of homogeneous regions and preserves spectral subspace segmentation of HSIs very well. Therefore, we have explored the spatial and spectral information of hyperspectral image simultaneously by combining superpixel segmentation with RPCA. Finally, a semi-supervised dimensionality reduction framework based on SURPCA2,1 graph is used for feature extraction task. Extensive experiments on multiple HSIs showed that the proposed spectral-spatial SURPCA2,1 is always comparable to other compared graphs with few labeled samples.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet, with the rise of the IoT, is one of the most powerful means of propagating a terrorist threat, and at the same time the perfect environment for deploying ubiquitous online surveillance systems. This paper tackles the problem of online surveillance, which we define as the monitoring by a security agency of a set of websites through tracking and classification of profiles that are potentially suspected of carrying out terrorist attacks. We conduct a theoretical analysis in this scenario that investigates the introduction of automatic classification technology compared to the status quo involving manual investigation of the collected profiles. Our analysis starts examining the suitability of game-theoretic-based models for decision-making in the introduction of this technology. We propose an adversarial-risk-analysis (ARA) model as a novel way of approaching the online surveillance problem that has the advantage of discarding the hypothesis of common knowledge. The proposed model allows us to study the rationality conditions of the automatic suspect detection technology, determining under which circumstances it is better than the traditional human-based approach. Our experimental results show the benefits of the proposed model. Compared to standard game theory, our ARA-based model indicates in general greater prudence in the deployment of the automatic technology and exhibits satisfactory performance without having to relax crucial hypotheses such as common knowledge and therefore subtracting realism from the problem, although at the expense of higher computational complexity.

PY  - 2019

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This contribution proposes an implementation for next generation smart homes, where heterogeneous data, coming from multiple sensors (medical, wellbeing, energy, contextual, etc.) and house equipment (smart fridge, smart TV, etc.), need to be managed, secured and visualized. As a first step, it focuses only on energy and health data. However, it aims to lay the foundations to manage any type of information towards the development of smart interactions with the house, which might include artificial intelligence and machine learning. These data are securely collected using a central Web of Things gateway, located inside the smart home. For the e-health part, a set of possible use-cases is provided, along with the current progress of the implantation. In this regard, the main idea is to link the next generation smart homes with external medical entities in order to provide, first, quick intervention in the event of an abnormality being detected, and to be able to provide basic medical services such as remote consultations with a doctor for a particular health issue. This vision can be very promising, particularly in rural areas, where access to medical services is difficult. As for the energy part, the aim is to collect users&rsquo; energy consumption inside the smart home, which can be supplied from different sources (heat, water, gas, or electricity), and to enable the use of advanced algorithms to predict and manage local energy consumption and production (if any). This approach combines data collected from smart meters, operational information of the smart energy devices (the status of smart plugs), user&rsquo;s requests and external network signals such as energy prices. By using a home energy management system that accepts such input parameters, the operation of in-home devices and appliances can be optimally controlled according to different objectives (e.g., minimizing energy costs and maximizing user&rsquo;s comfort level).

AB  - This paper considers a case where an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is used to monitor an area of interest. The UAV is assisted by a Sensor Network (SN), which is deployed in the area such as a smart city or smart village. The area being monitored has a reasonable size and hence may contain many sensors for efficient and accurate data collection. In this case, it would be expensive for one UAV to visit all the sensors; hence the need to partition the ground network into an optimum number of clusters with the objective of having the UAV visit only cluster heads (fewer sensors). In such a setting, the sensor readings (sensor data) would be sent to cluster heads where they are collected by the UAV upon its arrival. This paper proposes a clustering scheme that optimizes not only the sensor network energy usage, but also the energy used by the UAV to cover the area of interest. The computation of the number of optimal clusters in a dense and uniformly-distributed sensor network is proposed to complement the k-means clustering algorithm when used as a network engineering technique in hybrid UAV/terrestrial networks. Furthermore, for general networks, an efficient clustering model that caters for both orphan nodes and multi-layer optimization is proposed and analyzed through simulations using the city of Cape Town in South Africa as a smart city hybrid network engineering use-case.

AB  - One of the main obstacles towards the promotion of IoT adoption and innovation is data interoperability. Facilitating cross-domain interoperability is expected to be the core element for the realisation of the next generation of the IoT computing paradigm that is already taking shape under the name of Internet of Everything (IoE). In this article, an analysis of the current status on IoT semantic interoperability is presented that leads to the identification of a set of generic requirements that act as fundamental design principles for the specification of interoperability enabling solutions. In addition, an extension of NGSIv2 data model and API (de-facto) standards is proposed aiming to bridge the gap among IoT and social media and hence to integrate user communities with cyber-physical systems. These specifications have been utilised for the implementation of the IoT2Edge interoperability enabling mechanism which is evaluated within the context of a catastrophic wildfire incident that took place in Greece on July 2018. Weather data, social media activity, video recordings from the fire, sensor measurements and satellite data, linked to the location and the time of this fire incident have been collected, modeled in a uniform manner and fed to an early fire detection decision support system. The findings of the experiment certify that achieving minimum data interoperability with light-weight, plug-n-play mechanisms can be realised with significant benefits for our society.

AB  - In Tomsk University of Control Systems and Radioelectronics (TUSUR) one of the main areas of research is information security. The work is carried out by a scientific group under the guidance of Professor Shelupanov. One of the directions is the development of a comprehensive approach to assessing the security of the information systems. This direction includes the construction of an information security threats model and a protection system model, which allow to compile a complete list of threats and methods of protection against them. The main directions of information security tools development are dynamic methods of biometrics, methods for generating prime numbers for data encryption, steganography, methods and means of data protection in Internet of Things (IoT) systems. The article presents the main results of research in the listed areas of information security. The resultant properties in symmetric cryptography are based on the properties of the power of the generating functions.

AB  - The development of crowdsensing-based technologies has allowed for the use of smartphones in large-scale data collection for different scopes of applications, mostly in a transparent and ubiquitous way. When concerning urban areas and smart city initiatives, the collection and further analysis of information about the highest number of vehicles is of paramount importance, potentially supporting more efficient mobility planning and management actions in modern cities. In this context, this article proposes a public general-purpose platform for acquisition and visualization of vehicular speeds, which can then be exploited by any additional application. For that, a crowdsensing-based mobile software application was developed to collect instantaneous speeds provided by smartphone GPS, formatting and distributing this information to a database system. Such historical data can then be exported or visualized through a web-based comprehensive interface, which provides valuable data when planning traffic mobility in cities; for example, indicating areas with heavier traffic over a certain time period. Therefore, allowing the use of many different search filters and supporting data delivery in the JSON format, the CitySpeed platform can provide services not supported by popular applications, such as Waze and Google Maps, and potentially assist smart city initiatives in this area.

AB  - Designing advanced health monitoring systems is still an active research topic. Wearable and remote monitoring devices enable monitoring of physiological and clinical parameters (heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, etc.) and analysis using cloud-centric machine-learning applications and decision-support systems to predict critical clinical states. This paper moves from a totally cloud-centric concept to a more distributed one, by transferring sensor data processing and analysis tasks to the edges of the network. The resulting solution enables the analysis and interpretation of sensor-data traces within the wearable device to provide actionable alerts without any dependence on cloud services. In this paper, we use a supervised-learning approach to detect heartbeats and classify arrhythmias. The system uses a window-based feature definition that is suitable for execution within an asymmetric multicore embedded processor that provides a dedicated core for hardware assisted pattern matching. We evaluate the performance of the system in comparison with various existing approaches, in terms of achieved accuracy in the detection of abnormal events. The results show that the proposed embedded system achieves a high detection rate that in some cases matches the accuracy of the state-of-the-art algorithms executed in standard processors.

AB  - Energy efficiency in a data center is a challenge and has garnered researchers interest. In this study, we addressed the energy efficiency issue of a small scale data center by utilizing Single Board Computer (SBC)-based clusters. A compact layout was designed to build two clusters using 20 nodes each. Extensive testing was carried out to analyze the performance of these clusters using popular performance benchmarks for task execution time, memory/storage utilization, network throughput and energy consumption. Further, we investigated the cost of operating SBC-based clusters by correlating energy utilization for the execution time of various benchmarks using workloads of different sizes. Results show that, although the low-cost benefit of a cluster built with ARM-based SBCs is desirable, these clusters yield low comparable performance and energy efficiency due to limited onboard capabilities. It is possible to tweak Hadoop configuration parameters for an ARM-based SBC cluster to efficiently utilize resources. We present a discussion on the effectiveness of the SBC-based clusters as a testbed for inexpensive and green cloud computing research.

SN  - 2227-9717

AB  - A microgrid is a group of many small-scale distributed energy resources, such as solar/wind energy sources, diesel generators, energy storage units, and electric loads. As a small-scale power grid, it can be operated independently or within an existing power grid(s). The microgrid energy management system is a system that controls these components to achieve optimized operation in terms of price by reducing costs and maximizing efficiency in energy consumption. A post-Industry-4.0 consumer requires an optimal design and control of energy storage based on a demand forecast, using big data to stably supply clean, new, and renewable energy when necessary while maintaining a consistent level of quality. Thus, this study focused on software technology through which an optimized operation schedule for energy storage in a microgrid is derived. This energy storage operation schedule minimizes the costs involved in electricity use. For this, an optimization technique is used that sets an objective function representing the information and costs pertaining to electricity use, while minimizing its value by using Mixed Integer Linear Programming or a Genetic Algorithm. The main feature of the software is that an optimal operation schedule derivation function has been implemented with MATLAB for the following circumstances: when the basic operation rules are applied, when operating with another grid, when the external operating conditions are applied, and when the internal operating conditions are applied.

AB  - This paper explores the emerging and evolving landscape for metrics in smart cities in relation to big data challenges. Based on a review of the research literature, the problem of &ldquo;synthetic quantitative indicators&rdquo; along with concerns for &ldquo;measuring urban realities&rdquo; and &ldquo;making metrics meaningful&rdquo; are identified. In response, the purpose of this paper is to advance the need for innovating metrics for smarter, more interactive and responsive cities in addressing and mitigating algorithmic-related challenges on the one hand, and concerns associated with involving people more meaningfully on the other hand. As such, the constructs of awareness, learning, openness, and engagement are employed in this study. Using an exploratory case study approach, the research design for this work includes the use of multiple methods of data collection including survey and interviews. Employing a combination of content analysis for qualitative data and descriptive statistics for quantitative data, the main findings of this work support the need for rethinking and innovating metrics. As such, the main conclusion of this paper highlights the potential for developing new pathways and spaces for involving people more directly, knowingly, and meaningfully in addressing big and small data challenges for the innovating of urban metrics.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Low-cost air pollution wireless sensors are emerging in densely distributed networks that provide more spatial resolution than typical traditional systems for monitoring ambient air quality. This paper presents an air quality measurement system that is composed of a distributed sensor network connected to a cloud system forming a wireless sensor network (WSN). Sensor nodes are based on low-power ZigBee motes, and transmit field measurement data to the cloud through a gateway. An optimized cloud computing system has been implemented to store, monitor, process, and visualize the data received from the sensor network. Data processing and analysis is performed in the cloud by applying artificial intelligence techniques to optimize the detection of compounds and contaminants. This proposed system is a low-cost, low-size, and low-power consumption method that can greatly enhance the efficiency of air quality measurements, since a great number of nodes could be deployed and provide relevant information for air quality distribution in different areas. Finally, a laboratory case study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed system for the detection of some common volatile organic compounds, including: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. Principal component analysis, a multilayer perceptron with backpropagation learning algorithm, and support vector machine have been applied for data processing. The results obtained suggest good performance in discriminating and quantifying the concentration of the volatile organic compounds.

PY  - 2019

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The progress of technology on energy and IoT fields has led to an increasingly complicated electric environment in low-voltage local microgrid, along with the extensions of electric vehicle, micro-generation, and local storage. It is required to establish a home energy management system (HEMS) to efficiently integrate and manage household energy micro-generation, consumption and storage, in order to realize decentralized local energy systems at the community level. Domestic power demand prediction is of great importance for establishing HEMS on realizing load balancing as well as other smart energy solutions with the support of IoT techniques. Artificial neural networks with various network types (e.g., DNN, LSTM/GRU based RNN) and other configurations are widely utilized on energy predictions. However, the selection of network configuration for each research is generally a case by case study achieved through empirical or enumerative approaches. Moreover, the commonly utilized network initialization methods assign parameter values based on random numbers, which cause diversity on model performance, including learning efficiency, forecast accuracy, etc. In this paper, an evolutionary ensemble neural network pool (EENNP) method is proposed to achieve a population of well-performing networks with proper combinations of configuration and initialization automatically. In the experimental study, power demand predictions of multiple households are explored in three application scenarios: optimizing potential network configuration set, forecasting single household power demand, and refilling missing data. The impacts of evolutionary parameters on model performance are investigated. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method achieves better solutions on the considered scenarios. The optimized potential network configuration set using EENNP achieves a similar result to manual optimization. The results of household demand prediction and missing data refilling perform better than the na&iuml;ve and simple predictors.

AB  - This paper analyzes the use patterns of a residential smart grid pilot in the Netherlands, called PowerMatching City. The analysis is based on detailed monitoring data measured at 5-min intervals for the year 2012, originating from this pilot which was realized in 2007 in Groningen, Netherlands. In this pilot, smart appliances, heat pumps, micro-combined heat and power (&micro;-CHP), and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have been installed to evaluate their efficiency, their ability to reduce peak electricity purchase, and their effects on self-sufficiency and on the local use of solar electricity. As a result of the evaluation, diverse yearly and weekly indicators have been determined, such as electricity purchase and delivery, solar production, flexible generation, and load. Depending on the household configuration, up to 40% of self-sufficiency is achieved on an annual average basis, and 14.4% of the total consumption were flexible. In general, we can conclude that micro-CHP contributed to keep purchase from the grid relatively constant throughout the seasons. Adding to that, smart appliances significantly contributed to load shifting in peak times. It is recommended that similar evaluations will be conducted in other smart grid pilots to statistically enhance insights in the functioning of residential smart grids.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - This paper takes 50 ETF options in the options market with high transaction complexity as the research goal. The Random Forest (RF) model, the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) model, and the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model are used to predict 50 ETF price. Firstly, the original quantitative investment strategy is taken as the research object, and the 15 min trading frequency, which is more in line with the actual trading situation, is used, and then the Delta hedging concept of the options is introduced to control the risk of the quantitative investment strategy, to achieve the 15 min hedging strategy. Secondly, the final transaction price, buy price, highest price, lowest price, volume, historical volatility, and the implied volatility of the time segment marked with 50 ETF are the seven key factors affecting the price of 50 ETF. Then, two different types of LSTM-SVR models, LSTM-SVR I and LSTM-SVR II, are used to predict the final transaction price of the 50 ETF in the next time segment. In LSTM-SVR I model, the output of LSTM and seven key factors are combined as the input of SVR model. In LSTM-SVR II model, the hidden state vectors of LSTM and seven key factors are combined as the inputs of the SVR model. The results of the two LSTM-SVR models are compared with each other, and the better one is applied to the trading strategy. Finally, the benefit of the deep learning-based quantitative investment strategy, the resilience, and the maximum drawdown are used as indicators to judge the pros and cons of the research results. The accuracy and deviations of the LSTM-SVR prediction models are compared with those of the LSTM model and those of the RF model. The experimental results show that the quantitative investment strategy based on deep learning has higher returns than the traditional quantitative investment strategy, the yield curve is more stable, and the anti-fall performance is better.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Forecasting solar radiation has recently become the focus of numerous researchers due to the growing interest in green energy. This study aims to develop a seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to predict the daily and monthly solar radiation in Seoul, South Korea based on the hourly solar radiation data obtained from the Korean Meteorological Administration over 37 years (1981&ndash;2017). The goodness of fit of the model was tested against standardized residuals, the autocorrelation function, and the partial autocorrelation function for residuals. Then, model performance was compared with Monte Carlo simulations by using root mean square errors and coefficient of determination (R2) for evaluation. In addition, forecasting was conducted by using the best models with historical data on average monthly and daily solar radiation. The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: (i) a time series SARIMA model is implemented to forecast the daily and monthly solar radiation of Seoul, South Korea in consideration of the accuracy, suitability, adequacy, and timeliness of the collected data; (ii) the reliability, accuracy, suitability, and performance of the model are investigated relative to those of established tests, standardized residual, autocorrelation function (ACF), and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), and the results are compared with those forecasted by the Monte Carlo method; and (iii) the trend of monthly solar radiation in Seoul for the coming years is analyzed and compared on the basis of the solar radiation data obtained from KMS over 37 years. The results indicate that (1,1,2) the ARIMA model can be used to represent daily solar radiation, while the seasonal ARIMA (4,1,1) of 12 lags for both auto-regressive and moving average parts can be used to represent monthly solar radiation. According to the findings, the expected average monthly solar radiation ranges from 176 to 377 Wh/m2.

TI  - The Optimally Designed Variational Autoencoder Networks for Clustering and Recovery of Incomplete Multimedia Data

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Clustering analysis of massive data in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSN) has become a hot topic. However, most data clustering algorithms have difficulty in obtaining latent nonlinear correlations of data features, resulting in a low clustering accuracy. In addition, it is difficult to extract features from missing or corrupted data, so incomplete data are widely used in practical work. In this paper, the optimally designed variational autoencoder networks is proposed for extracting features of incomplete data and using high-order fuzzy c-means algorithm (HOFCM) to improve cluster performance of incomplete data. Specifically, the feature extraction model is improved by using variational autoencoder to learn the feature of incomplete data. To capture nonlinear correlations in different heterogeneous data patterns, tensor based fuzzy c-means algorithm is used to cluster low-dimensional features. The tensor distance is used as the distance measure to capture the unknown correlations of data as much as possible. Finally, in the case that the clustering results are obtained, the missing data can be restored by using the low-dimensional features. Experiments on real datasets show that the proposed algorithm not only can improve the clustering performance of incomplete data effectively, but also can fill in missing features and get better data reconstruction results.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has evolved towards intelligent IoT applications which exploit knowledge produced by IoT devices using artificial intelligence techniques. Knowledge sharing between IoT devices is a challenging issue in this trend. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge of Things (KoT) framework which enables sharing self-taught knowledge between IoT devices which require similar or identical knowledge without help from the cloud. The proposed KoT framework allows an IoT device to effectively produce, cumulate, and share its self-taught knowledge with other devices at the edge in the vicinity. This framework can alleviate behavioral repetition in users and computational redundancy in systems in intelligent IoT applications. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we examine a smart home case study and build a prototype of the KoT framework-based smart home system. Experimental results show that the proposed KoT framework reduces the response time to use intelligent IoT devices from a user&rsquo;s perspective and the power consumption for compuation from a system&rsquo;s perspective.

AB  - Online market places make their profit based on their advertisements or sales commission while businesses have the commercial interest to rank higher on recommendations to attract more customers. Web users cannot be guaranteed that the products provided by recommender systems within Big Data are either exhaustive or relevant to their needs. This article analyses the product rank relevance provided by different commercial Big Data recommender systems (Grouplens film, Trip Advisor and Amazon); it also proposes an Intelligent Recommender System (IRS) based on the Random Neural Network; IRS acts as an interface between the customer and the different Recommender Systems that iteratively adapts to the perceived user relevance. In addition, a relevance metric that combines both relevance and rank is presented; this metric is used to validate and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm. On average, IRS outperforms the Big Data recommender systems after learning iteratively from its customer.

TI  - Towards a Persuasive Recommender for Bike Sharing Systems: A Defeasible Argumentation Approach
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This work proposes a persuasion model based on argumentation theory and users&rsquo; characteristics for improving the use of resources in bike sharing systems, fostering the use of the bicycles and thus contributing to greater energy sustainability by reducing the use of carbon-based fuels. More specifically, it aims to achieve a balanced network of pick-up and drop-off stations in urban areas with the help of the users, thus reducing the dedicated management trucks that redistribute bikes among stations. The proposal aims to persuade users to choose different routes from the shortest route between a start and an end location. This persuasion is carried out when it is not possible to park the bike in the desired station due to the lack of parking slots, or when the user is highly influenceable. Differently to other works, instead of employing a single criteria to recommend alternative stations, the proposed system can incorporate a variety of criteria. This result is achieved by providing a defeasible logic-based persuasion engine that is capable of aggregating the results from multiple recommendation rules. The proposed framework is showcased with an example scenario of a bike sharing system.

AB  - Smart cities (SC) promote economic development, improve the welfare of their citizens, and help in the ability of people to use technologies to build sustainable services. However, computational methods are necessary to assist in the process of creating smart cities because they are fundamental to the decision-making process, assist in policy making, and offer improved services to citizens. As such, the aim of this research is to present a systematic review regarding data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) approaches adopted in the promotion of smart cities. The Methodi Ordinatio was used to find relevant articles and the VOSviewer software was performed for a network analysis. Thirty-nine significant articles were identified for analysis from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, in which we analyzed the DM and ML techniques used, as well as the areas that are most engaged in promoting smart cities. Predictive analytics was the most common technique and the studies focused primarily on the areas of smart mobility and smart environment. This study seeks to encourage approaches that can be used by governmental agencies and companies to develop smart cities, being essential to assist in the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - As one of the core data assets of telecom operators, base station almanac (BSA) plays an important role in the operation and maintenance of mobile networks. It is also an important source of data for the location-based service (LBS) providers. However, it is always less timely updated, nor it is accurate enough. Besides, it is not open to third parties. Conventional methods detect only the location of the base station (BS) which cannot satisfy the needs of network optimization and maintenance. Because of these drawbacks, in this paper, a big-data driven method of BSA information detection and cellular coverage identification is proposed. With the help of network-related data crowd sensed from the massive number of smartphone users in the live network, the algorithm can estimate more parameters of BSA with higher accuracy than conventional methods. The coverage capability of each cell was also identified in a granularity of small geographical grids. Computational results validate the proposed algorithm with higher performance and detection ability over the existing ones. The new method can be expected to improve the scope, accuracy, and timeliness of BSA, serving for wireless network optimization and maintenance as well as LBS service.

TI  - A Trusted Routing Scheme Using Blockchain and Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Sensor Networks

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A trusted routing scheme is very important to ensure the routing security and efficiency of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). There are a lot of studies on improving the trustworthiness between routing nodes, using cryptographic systems, trust management, or centralized routing decisions, etc. However, most of the routing schemes are difficult to achieve in actual situations as it is difficult to dynamically identify the untrusted behaviors of routing nodes. Meanwhile, there is still no effective way to prevent malicious node attacks. In view of these problems, this paper proposes a trusted routing scheme using blockchain and reinforcement learning to improve the routing security and efficiency for WSNs. The feasible routing scheme is given for obtaining routing information of routing nodes on the blockchain, which makes the routing information traceable and impossible to tamper with. The reinforcement learning model is used to help routing nodes dynamically select more trusted and efficient routing links. From the experimental results, we can find that even in the routing environment with 50% malicious nodes, our routing scheme still has a good delay performance compared with other routing algorithms. The performance indicators such as energy consumption and throughput also show that our scheme is feasible and effective.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - On-demand shared mobility is increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to address urban transport challenges in large and fast-growing cities. The appeal of this form of transport is largely attributed to its convenience, ease of use, and affordability made possible through digital platforms and innovations. The convergence of the shared economy with a number of established and emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud and Fog computing—is helping to expedite their deployment as a new form of public transport. Recently, this has manifested itself in the form of Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMoD) solutions, aimed at meeting personal travel demands through flexible routing and scheduling. Increasingly, these shared mobility solutions are blurring the boundaries with existing forms of public transport, particularly bus operations. This paper presents an environmental scan and analysis of the technological, social, and economic impacts surrounding disruptive technology-driven shared mobility trends. Specifically, the paper includes an examination of current and anticipated external factors that are of direct relevance to collaborative and low carbon mobility. The paper also outlines how these trends are likely to influence the mobility industries now and into the future. The paper collates information from a wide body of literature and reports on findings from actual ‘use cases’ that exist today which have used these disruptive mobility solutions to deliver substantial benefits to travellers around the world. Finally, the paper provides stakeholders with insight into identifying and responding to the likely needs and impacts of FMoD and informs their policy and strategy positions on the implementation of smart mobility systems in their cities and jurisdictions.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) has been a popular research area in the last decade. The dependability of CPS is still a critical issue, and few surveys have been published in this domain. CPS is a dynamic complex system, which involves various multidisciplinary technologies. To avoid human errors and to simplify management, self-management CPS (SCPS) is a wise choice. To achieve dependable self-management, systematic solutions are necessary to verify the design and to guarantee the safety of self-adaptation decisions, as well as to maintain the health of SCPS. This survey first recalls the concepts of dependability, and proposes a generic environment-in-loop processing flow of self-management CPS, and then analyzes the error sources and challenges of self-management through the formal feedback flow. Focusing on reducing the complexity, we first survey the self-adaptive architecture approaches and applied dependability means, then we introduce a hybrid multi-role self-adaptive architecture, and discuss the supporting technologies for dependable self-management at the architecture level. Focus on dependable environment-centered adaptation, we investigate the verification and validation (V&amp;V) methods for making safe self-adaptation decision and the solutions for processing decision dependably. For system-centered adaptation, the comprehensive self-healing methods are summarized. Finally, we analyze the missing pieces of the technology puzzle and the future directions. In this survey, the technical trends for dependable CPS design and maintenance are discussed, an all-in-one solution is proposed to integrate these technologies and build a dependable organic SCPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on dependable SCPS building and evaluation.

AB  - With the rapid development of sharing bicycles, unreasonable dispatching methods are likely to cause a series of issues, such as resource waste and traffic congestion in the city. In this paper, a new dynamic scheduling method is proposed, named Tri-G, so as to solve the above problems. First of all, the whole visualization information of bike stations was built based on a Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG), then Gaussian Mixture Mode (GMM) was used to group individual stations into clusters according to their geographical locations and transition patterns, and the Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) algorithm was adopted to predict the number of bikes inflow/outflow at each station in real time. This paper used New York&rsquo;s bicycle commute data to build global STG visualization information to evaluate Tri-G. Finally, it is concluded that Tri-G is superior to the methods in control groups, which can be applied to various geographical scenarios. In addition, this paper also discovered some human mobility patterns as well as some rules, which are helpful for governments to improve urban planning.

AB  - As the global environment is getting more competitive, sustainability is increasingly becoming an important assessment tool. An exponential distribution stochastic model is developed for the purpose of assessing and measuring the sustainability of healthcare system. The aim of this study is to provide a sustainability measuring model that is driven by the actual distribution status of the sustainability indicators. In this paper, the notions of the &ldquo;Triple Bottom Line&rdquo; (TBL) are followed in deriving the sustainability challenge and capacity indicators for the environmental, social, and economic indicators. Since basic challenges and capacities depend on the modes of the organization, the study proposes an exponentially distributed stochastic model for measuring sustainability. A numerical illustration of Iranian healthcare is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model. In the results obtained, sustainability index for environmental, economic, and social are 54.40%, 48.80%, and 66.80% respectively. It indicates the healthcare achieved some sustainability through the social aspect; therefore, improving the environmental and economic aspect of the TBL is necessary. The proposed model can be used as a panoramic tool for effective measurement of the sustainability level of any healthcare system.

AB  - Deriving 3D urban development patterns is necessary for urban planners to control the future directions of 3D urban growth considering the availability of infrastructure or being prepared for fundamental infrastructure. Urban metrics have been used so far for quantification of landscape and land-use change. However, these studies focus on the horizontal development of urban form. Therefore, questions remain about 3D growth patterns. Both 3D data and appropriate 3D metrics are fundamentally required for vertical development pattern extraction. Airborne light detection and ranging (Lidar) as an advanced remote-sensing technology provides 3D data required for such studies. Processing of airborne lidar to extract buildings&rsquo; heights above a footprint is a major task and current automatic algorithms fail to extract such information on vast urban areas especially in hilly sites. This research focuses on proposing new methods of extraction of ground points in hilly urban areas using autocorrelation-based algorithms. The ground points then would be used for digital elevation model generation and elimination of ground elevation from classified buildings points elevation. Technical novelties in our experimentation lie in choosing a different window direction and also contour lines for the slant area, and applying moving windows and iterating non-ground extraction. The results are validated through calculation of skewness and kurtosis values. The results show that changing the shape of windows and their direction to be narrow long squares parallel to the ground contour lines, respectively, improves the results of classification in slant areas. Four parameters, namely window size, window shape, window direction and cell size are empirically chosen in order to improve initial digital elevation model (DEM) creation, enhancement of the initial DEM, classification of non-ground points and final creation of a normalised digital surface model (NDSM). The results of these enhanced algorithms are robust for generating reliable DEMs and separation of ground and non-ground points in slant urban scenes as evidenced by the results of skewness and kurtosis. Offering the possibility of monitoring urban growth over time with higher accuracy and more reliable information, this work could contribute in drawing the future directions of 3D urban growth for a smarter urban growth in the Smart Cities paradigm.

AB  - Radio-based locating systems allow for a robust and continuous tracking in industrial environments and are a key enabler for the digitalization of processes in many areas such as production, manufacturing, and warehouse management. Time difference of arrival (TDoA) systems estimate the time-of-flight (ToF) of radio burst signals with a set of synchronized antennas from which they trilaterate accurate position estimates of mobile tags. However, in industrial environments where multipath propagation is predominant it is difficult to extract the correct ToF of the signal. This article shows how deep learning (DL) can be used to estimate the position of mobile objects directly from the raw channel impulse responses (CIR) extracted at the receivers. Our experiments show that our DL-based position estimation not only works well under harsh multipath propagation but also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in line-of-sight situations.

TI  - Henan Ecological Security Evaluation Using Improved 3D Ecological Footprint Model Based on Emergy and Net Primary Productivity
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 5
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The ecological footprint (EF) model is an effective tool for determining whether natural assets are over-utilized. The traditional EF (TEF) model and its improved model which include the emergy ecological footprint (EEF) and net primary productivity ecological footprint (NPPEF) have been widely used, but some emergy data are hard to obtain and NPP data is not stable. Therefore, in this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) EF model with emergy and net primary productivity (3DEF-ENPP) is proposed. The Henan province of China was chosen as the research area and commonly used statistical yearbook data and NPP data were used which are easy to obtain. We expanded a 2D EF model to a 3D EF model and took advantage of emergy analysis and net primary productivity because they have stable energy parameters, can reflect the difference in bioproductivity of different land types, and are suitable for spatial and temporal analysis. Based on our model, we obtained a rectified emergy-based ecological footprint (REEF), an ecological capacity based on net primary productivity (RNPPEC), a rectified ecological deficit (RED), an ecological footprint intensity (EFI), an ecological coordination coefficient, and a 3D-EF, which can comprehensively reflect Henan&rsquo;s ecological security status. The results show that: (1) The REEF and RNPPED obtained by our proposed model are more stable than those of the former method. (2) Henan&rsquo;s RED has been negative and has a downward trend, which indicates the burden of human activities on the natural environment are becoming increasingly serious. (3) The EF is increasing with time, indicating that the consumption of natural resources in Henan is gradually increasing. High EF regions are mainly distributed in the northwestern area. Southeastern regions have relatively low EFs. (4) Capital flows cannot meet the needs of current social development in Henan province and it is in a state of unsustainable development. (5) The ecological stress index is at a safe state but is still at an ecological security warning level and Henan has good ecological coordination.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - As an emerging and promising computing paradigm in the Internet of things (IoT), edge computing can significantly reduce energy consumption and enhance computation capability for resource-constrained IoT devices. Computation offloading has recently received considerable attention in edge computing. Many existing studies have investigated the computation offloading problem with independent computing tasks. However, due to the inter-task dependency in various devices that commonly happens in IoT systems, achieving energy-efficient computation offloading decisions remains a challengeable problem. In this paper, a cloud-assisted edge computing framework with a three-tier network in an IoT environment is introduced. In this framework, we first formulated an energy consumption minimization problem as a mixed integer programming problem considering two constraints, the task-dependency requirement and the completion time deadline of the IoT service. To address this problem, we then proposed an Energy-efficient Collaborative Task Computation Offloading (ECTCO) algorithm based on a semidefinite relaxation and stochastic mapping approach to obtain strategies of tasks computation offloading for IoT sensors. Simulation results demonstrated that the cloud-assisted edge computing framework was feasible and the proposed ECTCO algorithm could effectively reduce the energy cost of IoT sensors.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 5
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Sparse matrix-vector (SpMV) multiplication is a vital building block for numerous scientific and engineering applications. This paper proposes SURAA (translates to speed in arabic), a novel method for SpMV computations on graphics processing units (GPUs). The novelty lies in the way we group matrix rows into different segments, and adaptively schedule various segments to different types of kernels. The sparse matrix data structure is created by sorting the rows of the matrix on the basis of the nonzero elements per row (   n p r) and forming segments of equal size (containing approximately an equal number of nonzero elements per row) using the Freedman&ndash;Diaconis rule. The segments are assembled into three groups based on the mean     n p r     of the segments. For each group, we use multiple kernels to execute the group segments on different streams. Hence, the number of threads to execute each segment is adaptively chosen. Dynamic Parallelism available in Nvidia GPUs is utilized to execute the group containing segments with the largest mean     n p r, providing improved load balancing and coalesced memory access, and hence more efficient SpMV computations on GPUs. Therefore, SURAA minimizes the adverse effects of the     n p r     variance by uniformly distributing the load using equal sized segments. We implement the SURAA method as a tool and compare its performance with the de facto best commercial (cuSPARSE) and open source (CUSP, MAGMA) tools using widely used benchmarks comprising 26 high     n p r  v a r i a n c e     matrices from 13 diverse domains. SURAA outperforms the other tools by delivering 13.99x speedup on average. We believe that our approach provides a fundamental shift in addressing SpMV related challenges on GPUs including coalesced memory access, thread divergence, and load balancing, and is set to open new avenues for further improving SpMV performance in the future.

TI  - Measurement Noise Recommendation for Efficient Kalman Filtering over a Large Amount of Sensor Data

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - To effectively maintain and analyze a large amount of real-time sensor data, one often uses a filtering technique that reflects characteristics of original data well. This paper proposes a novel method for recommending the measurement noise for Kalman filtering, which is one of the most representative filtering techniques. Kalman filtering corrects inaccurate values of input sensor data, and its filtering performance varies depending on the input noise parameters. In particular, if the noise parameters determined based on the user&rsquo;s experience are incorrect, the accuracy of Kalman filtering may be reduced significantly. Based on this observation, this paper addresses how to determine the measurement noise variance, a major input parameter of Kalman filtering, by analyzing past sensor data and how to use the estimated noise to improve the filtering accuracy. More specifically, to estimate the measurement noise variance, two analytical methods are proposed: one a transform-based method using a wavelet transform and the other a learning-based method using a denoising autoencoder. Experimental results show that the proposed methods estimated the measurement noise variance accurately and were superior to the experience-based method in the filtering accuracy.

AB  - In this paper, we present a few novel simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) schemes that can be effectively used in various 5G wireless network implementations. First, we study the possibility of integrating distributed energy beamforming with the data rate fairness beamforming in a cooperative communication system with multiple cooperative relays and multiple destination users communicating simultaneously. We show that the system exploits significant performance gain using such a joint energy and data rate fairness beamforming scheme. Further, we propose an enhanced version of the SWIPT scheme, the energy-efficient modulation-based non-orthogonal multiple access (M-NOMA) SWIPT scheme, and observe its system efficiency in terms of more harvested energy. Finally, we consider an energy-harvesting SWIPT scheme where the channel response is estimated using the energy-harvesting signal as pilots superimposed on the information signal. For such a scheme, we compute the optimum transmit power ratio between the pilot and information signals under varying SNR conditions and improve the accuracy of the decoding process at the reception.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - In recent years, due to the unnecessary wastage of electrical energy in residential buildings, the requirement of energy optimization and user comfort has gained vital importance. In the literature, various techniques have been proposed addressing the energy optimization problem. The goal of each technique is to maintain a balance between user comfort and energy requirements, such that the user can achieve the desired comfort level with the minimum amount of energy consumption. Researchers have addressed the issue with the help of different optimization algorithms and variations in the parameters to reduce energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved yet due to its challenging nature. The gaps in the literature are due to advancements in technology, the drawbacks of optimization algorithms, and the introduction of new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly proposed optimization algorithms have produced better accuracy on the benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. Detailed discussion has been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort, visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge computing techniques used in smart homes.

TI  - Towards Semantic Sensor Data: An Ontology Approach
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In order to optimize intelligent applications driven by various sensors, it is vital to properly interpret and reuse sensor data from different domains. The construction of semantic maps which illustrate the relationship between heterogeneous domain ontologies plays an important role in knowledge reuse. However, most mapping methods in the literature use the literal meaning of each concept and instance in the ontology to obtain semantic similarity. This is especially the case for domain ontologies which are built for applications with sensor data. At the instance level, there is seldom work to utilize data of the sensor instances when constructing the ontologies&rsquo; mapping relationship. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to achieve the association between sensor data and domain ontology. In our approach, we first classify the sensor data by making them as SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) ontology instances, and map the corresponding instances to the concepts in the domain ontology. Secondly, a multi-strategy similarity calculation method is used to evaluate the similarity of the concept pairs between the domain ontologies at multiple levels. Finally, the set of concept pairs with a high similarity is selected by the analytic hierarchy process to construct the mapping relationship between the domain ontologies, and then the correlation between sensor data and domain ontologies are constructed. Using the method presented in this paper, we perform sensor data correlation experiments with a simulator for a real world scenario. By comparison to other methods, the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - This paper analyses attitudinal and socio-economic determinants of the householders&rsquo; willingness to monitor their energy consumption. Residential consumers can monitor their energy consumption by means of traditional (electricity bill) and modern tools (smart metering information platforms, SMP). Within this empirical study we test the effect of environmental attitudes, knowledge and perceived possibilities on consumers&rsquo; stages of readiness to adopt SMP based the stage model of self-regulated behavioral change (SSCB). Perceived possibilities to monitor energy consumption on a regular basis was found to be the predictor of adoption in every examined stage of readiness. General knowledge predicted adoption of the stage in which consumers declared willingness to learn know-how of using SMP. The results suggest that an effectiveness of educational campaigns may be restricted to only some consumers.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The problem of power demand forecasting for the effective planning and operation of smart grid, renewable energy and electricity market bidding systems is an open challenge. Numerous research efforts have been proposed for improving prediction performance in practical environments through statistical and artificial neural network approaches. Despite these efforts, power demand forecasting problems remain to be a grand challenge since existing methods are not sufficiently practical to be widely deployed due to their limited accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid power demand forecasting model, called (c, l)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) + Convolution Neural Network (CNN). We consider the power demand as a key value, while we incorporate c different types of contextual information such as temperature, humidity and season as context values in order to preprocess datasets into bivariate sequences consisting of &lt;Key, Context[1, c]&gt; pairs. These c bivariate sequences are then input into c LSTM networks with l layers to extract feature sets. Using these feature sets, a CNN layer outputs a predicted profile of power demand. To assess the applicability of the proposed hybrid method, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world datasets. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed (c, l)-LSTM+CNN hybrid model performs with higher accuracy than previous approaches.

TI  - Insights from Self-Organizing Maps for Predicting Accessibility Demand for Healthcare Infrastructure

SN  - 2413-8851

AB  - As urban populations grow worldwide, it becomes increasingly important to critically analyse accessibility&mdash;the ease with which residents can reach key places or opportunities. The combination of &lsquo;big data&rsquo; and advances in computational techniques such as machine learning (ML) could be a boon for urban accessibility studies, yet their application in this field remains limited. In this study, we provided detailed predictions of healthcare accessibility across a rapidly growing city and related them to socio-economic factors using a combination of classical and modern data analysis methods. Using the City of Surrey (Canada) as a case study, we clustered high-resolution income data for 2016 and 2022 using principal component analysis (PCA) and a powerful ML clustering tool, the self-organising map (SOM). We then combined this with door-to-door travel times to hospitals and clinics, calculated using a simple open-source tool. Focusing our analysis on senior populations (65+ years), we found that higher income clusters are projected to become more prevalent across Surrey over our study period. Low income clusters have on average better accessibility to healthcare facilities than high income clusters in both 2016 and 2022. Population growth will be the biggest accessibility challenge in neighbourhoods with good existing access to healthcare, whereas income change (both positive and negative) will be most challenging in poorly connected neighbourhoods. A dual accessibility problem may arise in Surrey: first, large senior populations will reside in areas with access to numerous and close-by, clinics, putting pressure on existing facilities for specialised services. Second, lower-income seniors will increasingly reside in areas poorly connected to healthcare services, which may impact accessibility equity. We demonstrate that combining PCA and SOM clustering techniques results in novel insights for predicting accessibility at the neighbourhood level. This allows for robust planning policy recommendations to be drawn from large multivariate datasets.

AB  - We present a novel Deep Learning (DL) stack for detecting Advanced Persistent threat (APT) attacks. This model is based on a theoretical approach where an APT is observed as a multi-vector multi-stage attack with a continuous strategic campaign. To capture these attacks, the entire network flow and particularly raw data must be used as an input for the detection process. By combining different types of tailored DL-methods, it is possible to capture certain types of anomalies and behaviour. Our method essentially breaks down a bigger problem into smaller tasks, tries to solve these sequentially and finally returns a conclusive result. This concept paper outlines, for example, the problems and possible solutions for the tasks. Additionally, we describe how we will be developing, implementing and testing the method in the near future.

TI  - Large-Scale Station-Level Crowd Flow Forecast with ST-Unet

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 3
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - High crowd mobility is a characteristic of transportation hubs such as metro/bus/bike stations in cities worldwide. Forecasting the crowd flow for such places, known as station-level crowd flow forecast (SLCFF) in this paper, would have many benefits, for example traffic management and public safety. Concretely, SLCFF predicts the number of people that will arrive at or depart from stations in a given period. However, one challenge is that the crowd flows across hundreds of stations irregularly scattered throughout a city are affected by complicated spatio-temporal events. Additionally, some external factors such as weather conditions or holidays may change the crowd flow tremendously. In this paper, a spatio-temporal U-shape network model (ST-Unet) for SLCFF is proposed. It is a neural network-based multi-output regression model, handling hundreds of target variables, i.e., all stations&rsquo; in and out flows. ST-Unet emphasizes stations&rsquo; spatial dependence by integrating the crowd flow information from neighboring stations and the cluster it belongs to after hierarchical clustering. It learns the temporal dependence by modeling the temporal closeness, period, and trend of crowd flows. With proper modifications on the network structure, ST-Unet is easily trained and has reliable convergency. Experiments on four real-world datasets were carried out to verify the proposed method&rsquo;s performance and the results show that ST-Unet outperforms seven baselines in terms of SLCFF.

AB  - In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and its subarea of deep learning have drawn the attention of many researchers. At the same time, advances in technologies enable the generation or collection of large amounts of valuable data (e.g., sensor data) from various sources in different applications, such as those for the Internet of Things (IoT), which in turn aims towards the development of smart cities. With the availability of sensor data from various sources, sensor information fusion is in demand for effective integration of big data. In this article, we present an AI-based sensor-information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of transportation data generated and collected from various types of sensors, including remote sensed imagery for the geographic information system (GIS), accelerometers, as well as sensors for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and global positioning system (GPS). The discovered knowledge and information returned from our system provides analysts with a clearer understanding of trajectories or mobility of citizens, which in turn helps to develop better transportation models to achieve the ultimate goal of smarter cities. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and practicality of our AI-based sensor information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of big transportation data.

AB  - For the past few years, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a recurrent view of the technological environment where nearly every object is expected to be connected to the network. This infrastructure will progressively allow one to monitor and efficiently manage the environment. Until recent years, the IoT applications have been constrained by the limited computational capacity and especially by efficient communications, but the emergence of new communication technologies allows us to overcome most of these issues. This situation paves the way for the fulfillment of the Smart-City concept, where the cities become a fully efficient, monitored, and managed environment able to sustain the increasing needs of its citizens and achieve environmental goals and challenges. However, many Smart-City approaches still require testing and study for their full development and adoption. To facilitate this, the university of M&aacute;laga made the commitment to investigate and innovate the concept of Smart-Campus. The goal is to transform university campuses into &ldquo;small&rdquo; smart cities able to support efficient management of their area as well as innovative educational and research activities, which would be key factors to the proper development of the smart-cities of the future. This paper presents the University of M&aacute;laga long-term commitment to the development of its Smart-Campus in the fields of its infrastructure, management, research support, and learning activities. In this way, the adopted IoT and telecommunication architecture is presented, detailing the schemes and initiatives defined for its use in learning activities. This approach is then assessed, establishing the principles for its general application.

AB  - Smart cities are urban environments where Internet of Things (IoT) devices provide a continuous source of data about urban phenomena such as traffic and air pollution. The exploitation of the spatial properties of data enables situation and context awareness. However, the integration and analysis of data from IoT sensing devices remain a crucial challenge for the development of IoT applications in smart cities. Existing approaches provide no or limited ability to perform spatial data analysis, even when spatial information plays a significant role in decision making across many disciplines. This work proposes a generic approach to enabling spatiotemporal capabilities in information services for smart cities. We adopted a multidisciplinary approach to achieving data integration and real-time processing, and developed a reference architecture for the development of event-driven applications. This type of applications seamlessly integrates IoT sensing devices, complex event processing, and spatiotemporal analytics through a processing workflow for the detection of geographic events. Through the implementation and testing of a system prototype, built upon an existing sensor network, we demonstrated the feasibility, performance, and scalability of event-driven applications to achieve real-time processing capabilities and detect geographic events.

AB  - Smart cities research evolved into one of the most vibrant fields of research and policy-making with sustainability and well-being becoming the bons mots of the debate. The business sector, i.e., the developers and the vendors, form an equally important group of stakeholders in this context. The question is to what extent that debate yields the kind of output that the end-users would expect and would consider useful and usable. A plethora of smart city services exists. Literature suggests that a myriad of new ICT-enhanced tools could find application in urban space. Methodologically speaking, the question is how to link these two meaningfully. The objective of this paper is to address this issue. To this end, smart city services are mapped and clusters of services are identified; end users’ perceptions and expectations are identified and observations are drawn. The value added of this paper is threefold: (i) at the conceptual level, it adds new insights in the ‘normative bias of smart cities research’ thesis, (ii) at the empirical level, it typifies smart city services and clusters them, and (iii) it introduces a practical toolkit that policymakers, regulators, and the business sector might employ to query end-users’ perceptions and expectations to effectively respond to citizens’ needs.

AB  - This work addresses the problem of energy consumption time series forecasting. In our approach, a set of time series containing energy consumption data is used to train a single, parameterised prediction model that can be used to predict future values for all the input time series. As a result, the proposed method is able to learn the common behaviour of all time series in the set (i.e., a fingerprint) and use this knowledge to perform the prediction task, and to explain this common behaviour as an algebraic formula. To that end, we use symbolic regression methods trained with both single- and multi-objective algorithms. Experimental results validate this approach to learn and model shared properties of different time series, which can then be used to obtain a generalised regression model encapsulating the global behaviour of different energy consumption time series.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Recently, data mining analysis techniques have been developed, as large spatial datasets have accumulated in various fields. Such a data-driven analysis is necessary in areas of high uncertainty and complexity, such as estimating groundwater potential. Therefore, in this study, data mining of various spatial datasets, including those based on remote sensing data, was applied to estimate groundwater potential. For the sustainable development of groundwater resources, a plan for the systematic management of groundwater resources should be established based on a quantitative understanding of the development potential. The purpose of this study was to map and analyze the groundwater potential of Goyang-si in Gyeonggi-do province, South Korea and to evaluate the sensitivity of each factor by applying data mining models for big data analysis. A total of 876 surveyed groundwater pumping capacity data were used, 50% of which were randomly classified into training and test datasets to analyze groundwater potential. A total of 13 factors extracted from satellite-based topographical, land cover, soil, forest, geological, hydrogeological, and survey-based precipitation data were used. The frequency ratio (FR) and boosted classification tree (BCT) models were used to analyze the relationships between the groundwater pumping capacity and related factors. Groundwater potential maps were constructed and validated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with accuracy rates of 68.31% and 69.39% for the FR and BCT models, respectively. A sensitivity analysis for both models was performed to assess the influence of each factor. The results of this study are expected to be useful for establishing an effective groundwater management plan in the future.

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The overcrowding of the wireless space has triggered a strict competition for scare network resources. Therefore, there is a need for a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technique that will ensure fair allocation of the available network resources for diverse network elements competing for the network resources. Spectrum handoff (SH) is a DSA technique through which cognitive radio (CR) promises to provide effective channel utilization, fair resource allocation, as well as reliable and uninterrupted real-time connection. However, SH may consume extra network resources, increase latency, and degrade network performance if the spectrum sensing technique used is ineffective and the channel selection strategy (CSS) is poorly implemented. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an SH policy that holistically considers the implementation of effective CSS, and spectrum sensing technique, as well as minimizes communication delays. In this work, two reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are integrated into the CSS to perform channel selection. The first algorithm is used to evaluate the channel future occupancy, whereas the second algorithm is used to determine the channel quality in order to sort and rank the channels in candidate channel list (CCL). A method of masking linearly dependent and useless state elements is implemented to improve the convergence of the learning. Our approach showed a significant reduction in terms of latency and a remarkable improvement in throughput performance in comparison to conventional approaches.

AB  - Noise pollution is one of the topmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the United States. Continued exposure to high levels of noise has proven effects on health, including acute effects such as sleep disruption, and long-term effects such as hypertension, heart disease, and hearing loss. To investigate and ultimately aid in the mitigation of urban noise, a network of 55 sensor nodes has been deployed across New York City for over two years, collecting sound pressure level (SPL) and audio data. This network has cumulatively amassed over 75 years of calibrated, high-resolution SPL measurements and 35 years of audio data. In addition, high frequency telemetry data have been collected that provides an indication of a sensors&rsquo; health. These telemetry data were analyzed over an 18-month period across 31 of the sensors. It has been used to develop a prototype model for pre-failure detection which has the ability to identify sensors in a prefail state 69.1% of the time. The entire network infrastructure is outlined, including the operation of the sensors, followed by an analysis of its data yield and the development of the fault detection approach and the future system integration plans for this.

AB  - In the last few years, we witnessed numerous episodes of terrorist attacks and menaces in public crowded places. The necessity of better surveillance in these places pushed the development of new automated solutions to spot and notify possible menaces as fast as possible. In this work, we propose a novel approach to create a decentralized architecture to manage patrolling drones and cameras exploiting lightweight protocols used in the internet of things (IoT) domain. Through the adoption of the mist computing paradigm it is possible to give to all the object of the smart ecosystem a cognitive intelligence to speed up the recognition and analysis tasks. Distributing the intelligence among all the objects of the surveillance ecosystem allows a faster recognition and reaction to possible warning situations. The recognition of unusual objects in certain areas, e.g., airports, train stations and bus stations, has been made using computer vision algorithms. The adoption of the IoT protocols in a hierarchical architecture provides high scalability allowing an easy and painless join of other smart objects. Also a study on the soft real-time feasibility has been conducted and is herein presented.

AB  - Soil salinization is a global issue resulting in soil degradation, arable land loss and ecological environmental deterioration. Over the decades, multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing have enabled efficient and cost-effective monitoring of salt-affected soils. However, the potential of hyperspectral sensors installed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to estimate and map soil salinity has not been thoroughly explored. This study quantitatively characterized and estimated field-scale soil salinity using an electromagnetic induction (EMI) equipment and a hyperspectral camera installed on a UAV platform. In addition, 30 soil samples (0~20 cm) were collected in each field for the lab measurements of electrical conductivity. First, the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) values measured by EMI were calibrated using the lab measured electrical conductivity derived from soil samples based on empirical line method. Second, the soil salinity was quantitatively estimated using the random forest (RF) regression method based on the reflectance factors of UAV hyperspectral images and satellite multispectral data. The performance of models was assessed by Lin&rsquo;s concordance coefficient (CC), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and root mean square error (RMSE). Finally, the soil salinity of three study fields with different land cover were mapped. The results showed that bare land (field A) exhibited the most severe salinity, followed by dense vegetation area (field C) and sparse vegetation area (field B). The predictive models using UAV data outperformed those derived from GF-2 data with lower RMSE, higher CC and RPD values, and the most accurate UAV-derived model was developed using 62 hyperspectral bands of the image of the field A with the RMSE, CC, and RPD values of 1.40 dS m&minus;1, 0.94, and 2.98, respectively. Our results indicated that UAV-borne hyperspectral imager is a useful tool for field-scale soil salinity monitoring and mapping. With the help of the EMI technique, quantitative estimation of surface soil salinity is critical to decision-making in arid land management and saline soil reclamation.

AB  - Recently, network attacks launched by malicious attackers have seriously affected modern life and enterprise production, and these network attack samples have the characteristic of type imbalance, which undoubtedly increases the difficulty of intrusion detection. In response to this problem, it would naturally be very meaningful to design an intrusion detection system (IDS) to effectively and quickly identify and detect malicious behaviors. In our work, we have proposed a method for an IDS-combined incremental extreme learning machine (I-ELM) with an adaptive principal component (A-PCA). In this method, the relevant features of network traffic are adaptively selected, where the best detection accuracy can then be obtained by I-ELM. We have used the NSL-KDD standard dataset and UNSW-NB15 standard dataset to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. Through analysis of the experimental results, we can see that our proposed method has better computation capacity, stronger generalization ability, and higher accuracy.

AB  - Recent advances in manufacturing technology, such as cyber&ndash;physical systems, industrial Internet, AI (Artificial Intelligence), and machine learning have driven the evolution of manufacturing architectures into integrated networks of automation devices, services, and enterprises. One of the resulting challenges of this evolution is the increased need for interoperability at different levels of the manufacturing ecosystem. The scope ranges from shop&ndash;floor software, devices, and control systems to Internet-based cloud-platforms, providing various services on-demand. Successful implementation of interoperability in smart manufacturing would, thus, result in effective communication and error-prone data-exchange between machines, sensors, actuators, users, systems, and platforms. A significant challenge to this is the architecture and the platforms that are used by machines and software packages. A better understanding of the subject can be achieved by studying industry-specific communication protocols and their respective logical semantics. A review of research conducted in this area is provided in this article to gain perspective on the various dimensions and types of interoperability. This article provides a multi-faceted approach to the research area of interoperability by reviewing key concepts and existing research efforts in the domain, as well as by discussing challenges and solutions.

AB  - Sustainable development is critical to ensure the future of humanity. Therefore, the assessment and governance of sustainability becomes a central challenge our society is facing. This paper provides a novel ICT framework for addressing sustainable development goals. It is characterized by both local and global considerations, in the context of economic, ecological, and social aspects of sustainable development. The framework consists of three modules: data module, sustainability module, and governance module. Data module integrates data from several sources, processes data, infers knowledge, and transforms data into understandable information and knowledge. The second module implements SDGs at the level of municipality/city, ensures ranking of locally transformed SDGs to arrange them in line with the values and needs of the local communities, and proposes an integrated approach in modeling the social-ecological systems. By implementing governance theories, the governance module permits an effective citizen engagement in governance of SDGs. The ICT framework addresses short-term and long-term SDGs and allows for the vertical and horizontal linkages among diverse stakeholders, as well as for their contributions to the nested rule structures employed at operational, collective, and constitutional levels. Thus, the framework we provide here ensures a paradigm shift in approaching SDGs for the advancement of our society.

AB  - Many cities around the world are facing immense pressure due to the expediting growth rates in urban population levels. The notion of &lsquo;smart cities&rsquo; has been proposed as a solution to enhance the sustainability of cities through effective urban management of governance, energy and transportation. The research presented herein examines the applicability of a mathematical framework to enhance the sustainability of decisions involved in zoning, land-use allocation and facility location within smart cities. In particular, a mathematical optimisation framework is proposed, which links through with other platforms in city settings, for optimising the zoning, land-use allocation, location of new buildings and the investment decisions made regarding infrastructure works in smart cities. Multiple objective functions are formulated to optimise social, economic and environmental considerations in the urban space. The impact on underlying traffic of location choices made for the newly introduced buildings is accounted for through optimised assignment of traffic to the underlying network. A case example on urban planning and infrastructure development within a smart city is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.

AB  - Higher educational institutes (HEI) are adopting ubiquitous and smart equipment such as mobile devices or digital gadgets to deliver educational content in a more effective manner than the traditional approaches. In present works, a lot of smart classroom approaches have been developed, however, the student learning experience is not yet fully explored. Moreover, module historical data over time is not considered which could provide insight into the possible outcomes in the future, leading new improvements and working as an early detection method for the future results within the module. This paper proposes a framework by taking into account module historical data in order to predict module performance, particularly the module result before the commencement of classes with the goal of improving module pass percentage. Furthermore, a video streaming server along with blended learning are sequentially integrated with the designed framework to ensure correctness of teaching and learning pedagogy. Simulation results demonstrate that by considering module historical data using time series forecasting helps in improving module performance in terms of module delivery and result outcome in terms of pass percentage. Furthermore, the proposed framework provides a mechanism for faculties to adjust their teaching style according to student performance level to minimize the student failure rate.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Through the Internet of things (IoT), as promoted by smart cities, there is an emergence of big data accentuating the use of artificial intelligence through various components of urban planning, management, and design. One such system is that of artificial neural networks (ANNs), a component of machine learning that boasts similitude with brain neurological networks and its functioning. However, the development of ANN was done in singular fashion, whereby processes are rendered in sequence in a unidimensional perspective, contrasting with the functions of the brain to which ANN boasts similitude, and in particular to the concept of neuroplasticity which encourages unique complex interactions in self-learning fashion, thereby encouraging more inclusive urban processes and render urban coherence. This paper takes inspiration from Christopher Alexander&rsquo;s Nature of Order and dwells in the concept of complexity theory; it also proposes a theoretical model of how ANN can be rendered with the same plastic properties as brain neurological networks with multidimensional interactivity in the context of smart cities through the use of big data and its emerging complex networks. By doing so, this model caters to the creation of stronger, richer, and more complex patterns that support Alexander&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; through the connection of overlapping networks. This paper is aimed toward engineers with interdisciplinary interest looking at creating more complex and intricate ANN models, and toward urban planners and urban theorists working on the emerging contemporary concept of smart cities.

AB  - With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), applications have become smarter and connected devices give rise to their exploitation in all aspects of a modern city. As the volume of the collected data increases, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are applied to further enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. The field of smart transportation has attracted many researchers and it has been approached with both ML and IoT techniques. In this review, smart transportation is considered to be an umbrella term that covers route optimization, parking, street lights, accident prevention/detection, road anomalies, and infrastructure applications. The purpose of this paper is to make a self-contained review of ML techniques and IoT applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and obtain a clear view of the trends in the aforementioned fields and spot possible coverage needs. From the reviewed articles it becomes profound that there is a possible lack of ML coverage for the Smart Lighting Systems and Smart Parking applications. Additionally, route optimization, parking, and accident/detection tend to be the most popular ITS applications among researchers.

AB  - Ambient Intelligence is currently a lively application domain of Artificial Intelligence and has become the central subject of multiple initiatives worldwide. Several approaches inside this domain make use of knowledge bases or knowledge graphs, both previously existing and ad hoc. This form of representation allows heterogeneous data gathered from diverse sources to be contextualized and combined to create relevant information for intelligent systems, usually following higher level constraints defined by an ontology. In this work, we conduct a systematic review of the existing usages of knowledge bases in intelligent environments, as well as an in-depth study of the predictive and decision-making models employed. Finally, we present a use case for smart homes and illustrate the use and advantages of Knowledge Graph Embeddings in this context.

AB  - The proliferation of inter-connected devices in critical industries, such as healthcare and power grid, is changing the perception of what constitutes critical infrastructure. The rising interconnectedness of new critical industries is driven by the growing demand for seamless access to information as the world becomes more mobile and connected and as the Internet of Things (IoT) grows. Critical industries are essential to the foundation of today&rsquo;s society, and interruption of service in any of these sectors can reverberate through other sectors and even around the globe. In today&rsquo;s hyper-connected world, the critical infrastructure is more vulnerable than ever to cyber threats, whether state sponsored, criminal groups or individuals. As the number of interconnected devices increases, the number of potential access points for hackers to disrupt critical infrastructure grows. This new attack surface emerges from fundamental changes in the critical infrastructure of organizations technology systems. This paper aims to improve understanding the challenges to secure future digital infrastructure while it is still evolving. After introducing the infrastructure generating big data, the functionality-based fog architecture is defined. In addition, a comprehensive review of security requirements in fog-enabled IoT systems is presented. Then, an in-depth analysis of the fog computing security challenges and big data privacy and trust concerns in relation to fog-enabled IoT are given. We also discuss blockchain as a key enabler to address many security related issues in IoT and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and fog computing. In this context, this work formalizes the task of securing big data and its scope, provides a taxonomy to categories threats to fog-based IoT systems, presents a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art contributions in the field according to their security service and recommends promising research directions for future investigations.

AB  - In digital and green city initiatives, smart mobility is a key aspect of developing smart cities and it is important for built-up areas worldwide. Double-parking and busy roadside activities such as frequent loading and unloading of trucks, have a negative impact on traffic situations, especially in cities with high transportation density. Hence, a real-time internet of things (IoT)-based system for surveillance of roadside loading and unloading bays is needed. In this paper, a fully integrated solution is developed by equipping high-definition smart cameras with wireless communication for traffic surveillance. Henceforth, this system is referred to as a computer vision-based roadside occupation surveillance system (CVROSS). Through a vision-based network, real-time roadside traffic images, such as images of loading or unloading activities, are captured automatically. By making use of the collected data, decision support on roadside occupancy and vacancy can be evaluated by means of fuzzy logic and visualized for users, thus enhancing the transparency of roadside activities. The CVROSS was designed and tested in Hong Kong to validate the accuracy of parking-gap estimation and system performance, aiming at facilitating traffic and fleet management for smart mobility.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Innovative Internet of Things (IoT) applications with strict performance and energy consumption requirements and where the agile collection of data is paramount are arising. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) represent a promising solution as they can be easily deployed to sense, process, and forward data. The large number of Sensor Nodes (SNs) composing a WSN are expected to be autonomous, with a node&rsquo;s lifetime dictated by the battery&rsquo;s size. As the form factor of the SN is critical in various use cases, minimizing energy consumption while ensuring availability becomes a priority. Moreover, energy harvesting techniques are increasingly considered as a viable solution for building an entirely green SN and prolonging its lifetime. In the process of building a SN and in the absence of a clear and well-rounded methodology, the designer can easily make unfounded and suboptimal decisions about the right hardware components, their configuration, and reliable data communication techniques, such as automatic repeat request (ARQ) and forward error correction (FEC). In this paper, a methodology to design, configure, and deploy a reliable ultra-low power WSNs is proposed. A comprehensive energy model and a realistic path-loss (PL) model of the sensor node are also established. Through estimations and field measurements it is proven that, following the proposed methodology, the designer can thoroughly explore the design space and the make most favorable decisions when choosing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, configuring the node, and deploying a reliable and energy-efficient WSN.

Protected agriculture is one of the fields which has broad application prospects of IoT. Protected agriculture is a mode of highly efficient development of modern agriculture that uses artificial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature, to create environmental conditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of IoT applications in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure and key technologies. Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research and deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the contributions made by different academicians and organizations. Selected references were clustered into three application domains corresponding to plant management, animal farming and food/agricultural product supply traceability. Furthermore, we discussed the challenges along with future research prospects, to help new researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.

AB  - As Internet of Things (IoT) involvement increases in our daily lives, several security and privacy concerns like linkability, unauthorized conversations, and side-channel attacks are raised. If they are left untouched, such issues may threaten the existence of IoT. They derive from two main reasons. One is that IoT objects are equipped with limited capabilities in terms of computation power, memory, and bandwidth which hamper the direct implementation of traditional Internet security techniques. The other reason is the absence of widely-accepted IoT security and privacy guidelines and their appropriate implementation techniques. Such guidelines and techniques would greatly assist IoT stakeholders like developers and manufacturers, paving the road for building secure IoT systems from the start and, thus, reinforcing IoT security and privacy by design. In order to contribute to such objective, we first briefly discuss the primary IoT security goals and recognize IoT stakeholders. Second, we propose a comprehensive list of IoT security and privacy guidelines for the edge nodes and communication levels of IoT reference architecture. Furthermore, we point out the IoT stakeholders such as customers and manufacturers who will benefit most from these guidelines. Moreover, we identify a set of implementation techniques by which such guidelines can be accomplished, and possible attacks against previously-mentioned levels can be alleviated. Third, we discuss the challenges of IoT security and privacy guidelines, and we briefly discuss digital rights management in IoT. Finally, through this survey, we suggest several open issues that require further investigation in the future. To the best of the authors&rsquo; knowledge, this work is the first survey that covers the above-mentioned objectives.

AB  - In the era of big data, smart cities have become a promising prospect for governments, citizens, and industrials. Many ideas and their derived systems for smart cities depend on big data for achieving a goal of data intelligence. However, there is an urgent transformation trend from data intelligence to service intelligence in the vision of smart cities due to the living requirements of citizens. People-centric service intelligence in smart cities has to support the realization of people&rsquo;s needs within urban and social domains. This paper introduces a concept of people-centric service intelligence, defines the level of it and its challenges in the aspect of infrastructure, human dynamics, human understanding and prediction, and the human&ndash;machine interface. Then, this paper proposes the theoretical framework and technical frameworks of people-centric service intelligence, and the service intelligence schemas for future construction of smart cities. It will be helpful for governments and industries to design people-centric service intelligence for improving the quality of life, the capabilities of good sustainability, and better development.

AB  - In today&rsquo;s world, ruled by a great amount of data and mobile devices, cloud-based systems are spreading all over. Such phenomenon increases the number of connected devices, broadcast bandwidth, and information exchange. These fine-grained interconnected systems, which enable the Internet connectivity for an extremely large number of facilities (far beyond the current number of devices) go by the name of Internet of Things (IoT). In this scenario, mobile devices have an operating time which is proportional to the battery capacity, the number of operations performed per cycle and the amount of exchanged data. Since the transmission of data to a central cloud represents a very energy-hungry operation, new computational paradigms have been implemented. The computation is not completely performed in the cloud, distributing the power load among the nodes of the system, and data are compressed to reduce the transmitted power requirements. In the edge-computing paradigm, part of the computational power is moved toward data collection sources, and, only after a first elaboration, collected data are sent to the central cloud server. Indeed, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; term refers to the extremities of systems represented by IoT devices. This survey paper presents the hardware architectures of typical IoT devices and sums up many of the low power techniques which make them appealing for a large scale of applications. An overview of the newest research topics is discussed, besides a final example of a complete functioning system, embedding all the introduced features.

AB  - With the advancement of new technologies, the number of connected devices, the amount of data generated, and the need to build an intelligently connected network of things to improve and enrich the human ecosystem open new doors to modifications and adaptations of current cellular network infrastructures. While more focus is given to low power wide area (LPWA) applications and devices, a significant challenge is the definition of Internet of Things (IoT) use cases and the value generation of applications on already existing IoT devices. Smartphones and related devices are currently manufactured with a wide range of smart sensors such as accelerometers, video sensors, compasses, gyros, proximity sensors, fingerprint sensors, temperature sensors, and biometric sensors used for various purposes. Many of these sensors can be automatically expanded to monitor a user&rsquo;s daily activities (e.g., fitness workouts), locations, movements, and real-time body temperatures. Mobile network operators (MNOs) play a substantial role in providing IoT communications platforms, as they manage traffic flow in the network. In this paper, we discuss the global concept of IoT and machine-type communication (MTC), and we conduct device performance analytics based on data traffic collected from a cellular network. The experiment equips service providers with a model and framework to monitor device performance in a network.

AB  - To achieve the full analytical potential of the streaming data from the internet of things, the interconnection of various data sources is needed. By definition, those sources are heterogeneous and their integration is not a trivial task. A common approach to exploit streaming sensor data potential is to use machine learning techniques for predictive analytics in a way that is agnostic to the domain knowledge. Such an approach can be easily integrated in various use cases. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data fusion of a set of heterogeneous data streams. The proposed framework enriches streaming sensor data with the contextual and historical information relevant for describing the underlying processes. The final result of the framework is a feature vector, ready to be used in a machine learning algorithm. The framework has been applied to a cloud and to an edge device. In the latter case, incremental learning capabilities have been demonstrated. The reported results illustrate a significant improvement of data-driven models, applied to sensor streams. Beside higher accuracy of the models the platform offers easy setup and thus fast prototyping capabilities in real-world applications.

AB  - Cyber-attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) are growing at an alarming rate as devices, applications, and communication networks are becoming increasingly connected and integrated. When attacks on IoT networks go undetected for longer periods, it affects availability of critical systems for end users, increases the number of data breaches and identity theft, drives up the costs and impacts the revenue. It is imperative to detect attacks on IoT systems in near real time to provide effective security and defense. In this paper, we develop an intelligent intrusion-detection system tailored to the IoT environment. Specifically, we use a deep-learning algorithm to detect malicious traffic in IoT networks. The detection solution provides security as a service and facilitates interoperability between various network communication protocols used in IoT. We evaluate our proposed detection framework using both real-network traces for providing a proof of concept, and using simulation for providing evidence of its scalability. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed intrusion-detection system can detect real-world intrusions effectively.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - As the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge computing have been major paradigms for distributed data collection, communication, and processing, smart city applications in the real world tend to adopt IoT and edge computing broadly. Today, more and more machine learning algorithms would be deployed into front-end sensors, devices, and edge data centres rather than centralised cloud data centres. However, front-end sensors and devices are usually not so capable as those computing units in huge data centres, and for this sake, in practice, engineers choose to compromise for limited capacity of embedded computing and limited memory, e.g., neural network models being pruned to fit embedded devices. Visual object tracking is one of many important elements of a smart city, and in the IoT and edge computing context, high requirements to computing power and memory space severely prevent massive and accurate tracking. In this paper, we report on our contribution to object tracking on lightweight computing including (1) using limited computing capacity and memory space to realise tracking; (2) proposing a new algorithm region proposal correlation filter fitting for most edge devices. Systematic evaluations show that (1) our techniques can fit most IoT devices; (2) our techniques can keep relatively high accuracy; and (3) the generated model size is much less than others.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is the global network of interrelated physical devices such as sensors, actuators, smart applications, objects, computing devices, mechanical machines, and people that are becoming an essential part of the internet. In an industrial environment, these devices are the source of data which provide abundant information in manufacturing processes. Nevertheless, the massive, heterogeneous, and time-sensitive nature of the data brings substantial challenges to the real-time collection, processing, and decision making. Therefore, this paper presents a framework of an IoT-based Industrial Data Management System (IDMS) which can manage the huge industrial data, support online monitoring, and control smart manufacturing. The framework contains five basic layers such as physical, network, middleware, database, and application layers to provide a service-oriented architecture for the end users. Experimental results from a smart factory case study demonstrate that the framework can manage the regular data and urgent events generated from various factory devices in the distributed industrial environment through state-of-the-art communication protocols. The collected data is converted into useful information which improves productivity and the prognosis of production lines.

TI  - Dependable Fire Detection System with Multifunctional Artificial Intelligence Framework

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A fire detection system requires accurate and fast mechanisms to make the right decision in a fire situation. Since most commercial fire detection systems use a simple sensor, their fire recognition accuracy is deficient because of the limitations of the detection capability of the sensor. Existing proposals, which use rule-based algorithms or image-based machine learning can hardly adapt to the changes in the environment because of their static features. Since the legacy fire detection systems and network services do not guarantee data transfer latency, the required need for promptness is unmet. In this paper, we propose a new fire detection system with a multifunctional artificial intelligence framework and a data transfer delay minimization mechanism for the safety of smart cities. The framework includes a set of multiple machine learning algorithms and an adaptive fuzzy algorithm. In addition, Direct-MQTT based on SDN is introduced to solve the traffic concentration problems of the traditional MQTT. We verify the performance of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and delay time and found a fire detection accuracy of over 95%. The end-to-end delay, which comprises the transfer and decision delays, is reduced by an average of 72%.

TI  - Research on Time-Correlated Errors Using Allan Variance in a Kalman Filter Applicable to Vector-Tracking-Based GNSS Software-Defined Receiver for Autonomous Ground Vehicle Navigation
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 9
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has been applied to many areas, e.g., the autonomous ground vehicle, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), precision agriculture, smart city, and the GNSS-reflectometry (GNSS-R), being of considerable significance over the past few decades. Unfortunately, the GNSS signal performance has the high risk of being reduced by the environmental interference. The vector tracking (VT) technique is promising to enhance the robustness in high dynamics as well as improve the sensitivity against the weak environment of the GNSS receiver. However, the time-correlated error coupled in the receiver clock estimations in terms of the VT loop can decrease the accuracy of the navigation solution. There are few works present dealing with this issue. In this work, the Allan variance is accordingly exploited to specify a model which is expected to account for this type of error based on the 1st-order Gauss-Markov (GM) process. Then, it is used for proposing an enhanced Kalman filter (KF) by which this error can be suppressed. Furthermore, the proposed system model makes use of the innovation sequence so that the process covariance matrix can be adaptively adjusted and updated. The field tests demonstrate the performance of the proposed adaptive vector-tracking time-correlated error suppressed Kalman filter (A-VTTCES-KF). When compared with the results produced by the ordinary adaptive KF algorithm in terms of the VT loop, the real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning and code-based differential global positioning system (DGPS) positioning accuracies have been improved by 14.17% and 9.73%, respectively. On the other hand, the RTK positioning performance has been increased by maximum 21.40% when compared with the results obtained from the commercial low-cost U-Blox receiver.

TI  - Forecasting Heating Consumption in Buildings: A Scalable Full-Stack Distributed Engine

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Predicting power demand of building heating systems is a challenging task due to the high variability of their energy profiles. Power demand is characterized by different heating cycles including sequences of various transient and steady-state phases. To effectively perform the predictive task by exploiting the huge amount of fine-grained energy-related data collected through Internet of Things (IoT) devices, innovative and scalable solutions should be devised. This paper presents PHi-CiB, a scalable full-stack distributed engine, addressing all tasks from energy-related data collection, to their integration, storage, analysis, and modeling. Heterogeneous data measurements (e.g., power consumption in buildings, meteorological conditions) are collected through multiple hardware (e.g., IoT devices) and software (e.g., web services) entities. Such data are integrated and analyzed to predict the average power demand of each building for different time horizons. First, the transient and steady-state phases characterizing the heating cycle of each building are automatically identified; then the power-level forecasting is performed for each phase. To this aim, PHi-CiB relies on a pipeline of three algorithms: the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, and the Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent. PHi-CiB&rsquo;s current implementation exploits Apache Spark and MongoDB and supports parallel and scalable processing and analytical tasks. Experimental results, performed on energy-related data collected in a real-world system show the effectiveness of PHi-CiB in predicting heating power consumption of buildings with a limited prediction error and an optimal horizontal scalability.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In a smart home linked to a smart grid (SG), demand-side management (DSM) has the potential to reduce electricity costs and carbon/chlorofluorocarbon emissions, which are associated with electricity used in today&rsquo;s modern society. To meet continuously increasing electrical energy demands requested from downstream sectors in an SG, energy management systems (EMS), developed with paradigms of artificial intelligence (AI) across Internet of things (IoT) and conducted in fields of interest, monitor, manage, and analyze industrial, commercial, and residential electrical appliances efficiently in response to demand response (DR) signals as DSM. Usually, a DSM service provided by utilities for consumers in an SG is based on cloud-centered data science analytics. However, such cloud-centered data science analytics service involved for DSM is mostly far away from on-site IoT end devices, such as DR switches/power meters/smart meters, which is usually unacceptable for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications in DSM. This implies that, for instance, IoT end devices deployed on-site for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications in DSM should be aware of immediately analytical, interpretable, and real-time actionable data insights processed on and identified by IoT end devices at IoT sources. Therefore, this work designs and implements a smart edge analytics-empowered power meter prototype considering advanced AI in DSM for smart homes. The prototype in this work works in a cloud analytics-assisted electrical EMS architecture, which is designed and implemented as edge analytics in the architecture described and developed toward a next-generation smart sensing infrastructure for smart homes. Two different types of AI deployed on-site on the prototype are conducted for DSM and compared in this work. The experimentation reported in this work shows the architecture described with the prototype in this work is feasible and workable.

AB  - The Smart campus is a concept of an education institute using technologies, such as information systems, internet of things (IoT), and context-aware computing, to support learning, teaching, and administrative activities. Classrooms are important building blocks of a school campus. Therefore, a feasible architecture for building and running smart classrooms is essential for a smart campus. However, most studies related to the smart classroom are focused on studying or addressing particular technical or educational issues, such as networking, AI applications, lecture quality, and user responses to technology. In this study, an architecture for building and running context-aware smart classrooms is proposed. The proposed architecture consists of three parts including a prototype of a context-aware smart classroom, a model for technology integration, and supporting measures for the operation of smart classrooms in this architecture. The classroom prototype was designed based on our study results and a smart classroom project in Ming Chuan University (MCU). The integration model was a layered model uses Raspberry Pi in the bottom layer of the model to integrate underlying technologies and provide application interfaces to the higher layer applications for the ease of building context-aware smart classroom applications. As a result, application interfaces were implemented using Raspberry Pi based on the proposed technology integration model, and a context-aware energy-saving smart classroom application was implemented based on the proposed classroom prototype and the implemented web application interface. The result shows that, in terms of technology, the proposed architecture is feasible for building context-aware smart classrooms in smart campuses.

TI  - A Novel Internet of Things-Enabled Accident Detection and Reporting System for Smart City Environments
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Internet of Things-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are gaining significant attention in academic literature and industry, and are seen as a solution to enhancing road safety in smart cities. Due to the ever increasing number of vehicles, a significant rise in the number of road accidents has been observed. Vehicles embedded with a plethora of sensors enable us to not only monitor the current situation of the vehicle and its surroundings but also facilitates the detection of incidents. Significant research, for example, has been conducted on accident rescue, particularly on the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for efficient and prompt rescue operations. The majority of such works provide sophisticated solutions that focus on reducing response times. However, such solutions can be expensive and are not available in all types of vehicles. Given this, we present a novel Internet of Things-based accident detection and reporting system for a smart city environment. The proposed approach aims to take advantage of advanced specifications of smartphones to design and develop a low-cost solution for enhanced transportation systems that is deployable in legacy vehicles. In this context, a customized Android application is developed to gather information regarding speed, gravitational force, pressure, sound, and location. The speed is a factor that is used to help improve the identification of accidents. It arises because of clear differences in environmental conditions (e.g., noise, deceleration rate) that arise in low speed collisions, versus higher speed collisions). The information acquired is further processed to detect road incidents. Furthermore, a navigation system is also developed to report the incident to the nearest hospital. The proposed approach is validated through simulations and comparison with a real data set of road accidents acquired from Road Safety Open Repository, and shows promising results in terms of accuracy.

The underdevelopment of specialized defenses against energy exhaustion attacks as well as their often hidden nature for the owner of the target device determine a necessity of an integrated approach to modeling and evaluation of this class of attacks and various types of intruders. The paper analyzes conditions of applicability of energy resource exhaustion attacks performed by various classes of intruders, models them on physical implementations of devices for two application areas, and calculates their performance indicators. Application areas are a TCP/IP network of end-user mobile devices and a self-organizing mesh network designed for operational management and emergency response.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The exact location of objects, such as infrastructure, is crucial to the systematic understanding of the built environment. The emergence and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) have attracted growing attention to the low-cost location scheme, which can respond to a dramatic increasing amount of public infrastructure in smart cities. Various Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID)-based locating systems and noise mitigation methods have been developed. However, most of them are impractical for built environments in large areas due to their high cost, computational complexity, and low noise detection capability. In this paper, we proposed a novel noise mitigation solution integrating the low-cost localization scheme with one mobile RFID reader. We designed a filter algorithm to remove the influence of abnormal data. Inspired the sampling concept, a more carefully parameters calibration was carried out for noise data sampling to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational complexity. To achieve robust noise detection results, we employed the powerful noise detection capability of the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method for the localization and noise mitigation in a large area. The proposed scheme has potential applications for location-based services in smart cities.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications has taken the attention of several researchers. In an effort to provide interoperability and IPv6 support for the IoT devices, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed the 6LoWPAN stack. However, the particularities and hardware limitations of networks associated with IoT devices lead to several challenges, mainly for routing protocols. On its stack proposal, IETF standardizes the RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) as the routing protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). RPL is a tree-based proactive routing protocol that creates acyclic graphs among the nodes to allow data exchange. Although widely considered and used by current applications, different recent studies have shown its limitations and drawbacks. Among these, it is possible to highlight the weak support of mobility and P2P traffic, restrictions for multicast transmissions, and lousy adaption for dynamic throughput. Motivated by the presented issues, several new solutions have emerged during recent years. The approaches range from the consideration of different routing metrics to an entirely new solution inspired by other routing protocols. In this context, this work aims to present an extensive survey study about routing solutions for IoT/LLN, not limited to RPL enhancements. In the course of the paper, the routing requirements of LLNs, the initial protocols, and the most recent approaches are presented. The IoT routing enhancements are divided according to its main objectives and then studied individually to point out its most important strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, as the main contribution, this study presents a comprehensive discussion about the considered approaches, identifying the still remaining open issues and suggesting future directions to be recognized by new proposals.

AB  - Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been designed, implemented, and validated to help clinicians and practitioners for decision-making about diagnosing some diseases. Within the CDSSs, we can find Fuzzy inference systems. For the reasons above, the objective of this study was to design, to implement, and to validate a methodology for developing data-driven Mamdani-type fuzzy clinical decision support systems using clusters and pivot tables. For validating the proposed methodology, we applied our algorithms on five public datasets including Wisconsin, Coimbra breast cancer, wart treatment (Immunotherapy and cryotherapy), and caesarian section, and compared them with other related works (Literature). The results show that the Kappa Statistics and accuracies were close to 1.0% and 100%, respectively for each output variable, which shows better accuracy than some literature results. The proposed framework could be considered as a deep learning technique because it is composed of various processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - A variety of applications and forwarding protocols have been proposed for opportunistic networks (OppNets) in the literature. However, the methodology of evaluation, testing and comparing these forwarding protocols are not standardized yet, which leads to large levels of ambiguity in performance evaluation studies. Performance results depend largely on the evaluation environment, and on the used parameters and models. More comparability in evaluation scenarios and methodologies would largely improve also the availability of protocols and the repeatability of studies, and thus would accelerate the development of this research topic. In this survey paper, we focus our attention on how various OppNets data forwarding protocols are evaluated rather than what they actually achieve. We explore the models, parameters and the evaluation environments and make observations about their scalability, realism and comparability. Finally, we deduce some best practices on how to achieve the largest impact of future evaluation studies of OppNets data dissemination/forwarding protocols.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Traffic congestion prediction is critical for implementing intelligent transportation systems for improving the efficiency and capacity of transportation networks. However, despite its importance, traffic congestion prediction is severely less investigated compared to traffic flow prediction, which is partially due to the severe lack of large-scale high-quality traffic congestion data and advanced algorithms. This paper proposes an accessible and general workflow to acquire large-scale traffic congestion data and to create traffic congestion datasets based on image analysis. With this workflow we create a dataset named Seattle Area Traffic Congestion Status (SATCS) based on traffic congestion map snapshots from a publicly available online traffic service provider Washington State Department of Transportation. We then propose a deep autoencoder-based neural network model with symmetrical layers for the encoder and the decoder to learn temporal correlations of a transportation network and predicting traffic congestion. Our experimental results on the SATCS dataset show that the proposed DCPN model can efficiently and effectively learn temporal relationships of congestion levels of the transportation network for traffic congestion forecasting. Our method outperforms two other state-of-the-art neural network models in prediction performance, generalization capability, and computation efficiency.

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Understanding hydrological processes in large, open areas, such as catchments, and further modelling these processes are still open research questions. The system proposed in this work provides an automatic end-to-end pipeline from data collection to information extraction that can potentially assist hydrologists to better understand the hydrological processes using a data-driven approach. In this work, the performance of a low-cost off-the-shelf self contained sensor unit, which was originally designed and used to monitor liquid levels, such as AdBlue, fuel, lubricants etc., in a sealed tank environment, is first examined. This process validates that the sensor does provide accurate water level information for open water level monitoring tasks. Utilising the dataset collected from eight sensor units, an end-to-end pipeline of automating the data collection, data processing and information extraction processes is proposed. Within the pipeline, a data-driven anomaly detection method that automatically extracts rapid changes in measurement trends at a catchment scale. The lag-time of the test site (Dodder catchment Dublin, Ireland) is also analyzed. Subsequently, the water level response in the catchment due to storm events during the 27 month deployment period is illustrated. To support reproducible and collaborative research, the collected dataset and the source code of this work will be publicly available for research purposes.

TI  - An Improved Ball Pivot Algorithm-Based Ground Filtering Mechanism for LiDAR Data
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Automatic ground filtering is an essential step for Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generation, which has significant application value. However, extraction and classification of ground points from the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, especially in multitudinous terrain situations, is a challenging task because it is difficult to determine the set of optimal parameters for removing various non-ground features. In this paper, a new ground filtering technique based on an improved Ball Pivot Algorithm (BPA) is proposed. At the beginning, the LiDAR point cloud dataset was divided into different subsets based on the 2D regular grid. The lowest point in each grid was selected as the seed point to build a single-layer surface. After that, the improved BPA was executed to remove points on the higher location. Then, the rest of the points were calculated and selected as a new seed point according to the spatial relationship with the initial surface. Finally, non-ground points were filtered by means of improved BPA traversing all the grids. Our experimental results on the Benchmark dataset provided by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Working Group III/3 showed high accuracy (with a mean kappa coefficient over 80%) in terms of completeness, correctness, and quality for DEM generation. The experimental results demonstrated the proposed method is robust to various terrain situations, as it is more effective and feasible for ground filtering.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The article proposes the concept of modeling that uses multi-agent systems of mutual interactions between city residents as well as interactions between residents and spatial objects. Adopting this perspective means treating residents, as well as buildings or other spatial objects, as distinct agents that exchange multifaceted packages of information in a dynamic and non-linear way. The exchanged information may be reinforced or diminished during the process, which may result in changing the social activity of the residents. Utilizing Latour&rsquo;s actor&ndash;network theory, the authors developed a model for studying the relationship between demographic and social factors, and the diversified spatial arrangement and the structure of a city. This concept was used to model the level of residents&rsquo; trust spatiotemporally and, indirectly, to study the level of social (geo)participation in a smart city. The devised system, whose test implementation as an agent-based system was done in the GAMA: agent-based, spatially explicit, modeling and simulation platform, was tested on both model and real data. The results obtained for the model city and the capital of Poland, Warsaw, indicate the significant and interdisciplinary analytical and scientific potential of the authorial methodology in the domain of geospatial science, geospatial data models with multi-agent systems, spatial planning, and applied social sciences.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The long continuity of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide high space and resolution data for ground deformation investigations. The ground deformation in this paper appeared in the city&rsquo;s development, although it is close to the Erhai region, which is different from a water-deficient city. Therefore, the analysis and prediction of ground deformation using a new method is required. In this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from 2015 to 2018 were used to study the characteristics of ground deformation in the Erhai region using the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique. The results were cross-validated using ascending and descending direction images to ensure the accuracy. In addition, the results showed that there was little ground deformation in the northern part of the Erhai region, while there was obvious ground deformation in the southern part. Four influencing factors&mdash;including the building area, water level, cumulative precipitation, and cumulative temperature of the southern Erhai region&mdash;were used together to predict the cumulative ground deformation using back-propagation (BP). The R of all the involved data was 0.966, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the simulated values using BP and the true measured values were 3.063, 1.003, and 1.119, respectively. The results showed that BP has great potential in predicting the change tendency of ground deformation with high precision. The main reason for ground deformation is the continuous increase of building area; the water level followed. The cumulative precipitation and cumulative temperature are the reasons for the seasonal ground deformation. Some countermeasures and suggestions are given to face the challenge of serious ground deformation.

AB  - In recent decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to process automation in agriculture. Regarding irrigation systems, this demand has found several difficulties, including the lack of communication networks and the large distances to electricity supply points. With the recent implementation of LPWAN wireless communication networks (SIGFOX, LoraWan, and NBIoT), and the expanding market of electronic controllers based on free software and hardware (i.e., Arduino, Raspberry, ESP, etc.) with low energy requirements, new perspectives have appeared for the automation of agricultural irrigation networks. This paper presents a low-cost solution for automatic cloud-based irrigation. In this paper, it is proposed the design of a node network based on microcontroller ESP32-Lora and Internet connection through SIGFOX network. The results obtained show the stability and robustness of the designed system.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - As a new area of science and technology (S&amp;T), big data science and analytics embodies an unprecedentedly transformative power—which is manifested not only in the form of revolutionizing science and transforming knowledge, but also in advancing social practices, catalyzing major shifts, and fostering societal transitions. Of particular relevance, it is instigating a massive change in the way both smart cities and sustainable cities are understood, studied, planned, operated, and managed to improve and maintain sustainability in the face of expanding urbanization. This relates to what has been dubbed data-driven smart sustainable urbanism, an emerging approach that is based on a computational understanding of city systems that reduces urban life to logical and algorithmic rules and procedures, as well as employs a new scientific method based on data-intensive science, while also harnessing urban big data to provide a more holistic and integrated view and synoptic intelligence of the city. This paper examines the unprecedented paradigmatic and scholarly shifts that the sciences underlying smart sustainable urbanism are undergoing in light of big data science and analytics and the underlying enabling technologies, as well as discusses how these shifts intertwine with and affect one another in the context of sustainability. I argue that data-intensive science, as a new epistemological shift, is fundamentally changing the scientific and practical foundations of urban sustainability. In specific terms, the new urban science—as underpinned by sustainability science and urban sustainability—is increasingly making cities more sustainable, resilient, efficient, and livable by rendering them more measurable, knowable, and tractable in terms of their operational functioning, management, planning, design, and development.

TI  - A System for Monitoring Breathing Activity Using an Ultrasonic Radar Detection with Low Power Consumption
T2  - Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - Continuous monitoring of breathing activity plays a major role in detecting and classifying a breathing abnormality. This work aims to facilitate detection of abnormal breathing syndromes, including tachypnea, bradypnea, central apnea, and irregular breathing by tracking of thorax movement resulting from respiratory rhythms based on ultrasonic radar detection. This paper proposes a non-contact, non-invasive, low cost, low power consumption, portable, and precise system for simultaneous monitoring of normal and abnormal breathing activity in real-time using an ultrasonic PING sensor and microcontroller PIC18F452. Moreover, the obtained abnormal breathing syndrome is reported to the concerned physician&rsquo;s mobile telephone through a global system for mobile communication (GSM) modem to handle the case depending on the patient&rsquo;s emergency condition. In addition, the power consumption of the proposed monitoring system is reduced via a duty cycle using an energy-efficient sleep/wake scheme. Experiments were conducted on 12 participants without any physical contact at different distances of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 m and the breathing rates measured with the proposed system were then compared with those measured by a piezo respiratory belt transducer. The experimental results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed system to extract breathing rate and detect the related abnormal breathing syndromes with a high degree of agreement, strong correlation coefficient, and low error ratio. The results also showed that the total current consumption of the proposed monitoring system based on the sleep/wake scheme was 6.936 mA compared to 321.75 mA when the traditional operation was used instead. Consequently, this led to a 97.8% of power savings and extended the battery life time from 8 h to approximately 370 h. The proposed monitoring system could be used in both clinical and home settings.

T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - This paper presents a novel framework to achieve 3D semantic labeling of objects (e.g., trees, buildings, and vehicles) from airborne laser-scanning point clouds. To this end, we propose a framework which consists of hierarchical clustering and higher-order conditional random fields (CRF) labeling. In the hierarchical clustering, the raw point clouds are over-segmented into a set of fine-grained clusters by integrating the point density clustering and the classic K-means clustering algorithm, followed by the proposed probability density clustering algorithm. Through this process, we not only obtain a more uniform size and more homogeneous clusters with semantic consistency, but the topological relationships of the cluster&rsquo;s neighborhood are implicitly maintained by turning the problem of topology maintenance into a clustering problem based on the proposed probability density clustering algorithm. Subsequently, the fine-grained clusters and their topological context are fed into the CRF labeling step, from which the fine-grained cluster&rsquo;s semantic labels are learned and determined by solving a multi-label energy minimization formulation, which simultaneously considers the unary, pairwise, and higher-order potentials. Our experiments of classifying urban and residential scenes demonstrate that the proposed approach reaches 88.5% and 86.1% of &ldquo;m    F 1    &rdquo; estimated by averaging all classes of the     F 1    -scores. We prove that the proposed method outperforms five other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed energy terms by using an &ldquo;ablation study&rdquo; strategy.

AB  - Smart city is an emerging initiative for integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in effective ways to support development of smart cities with enhanced quality of life for its citizens through safe and secure context-aware services. Major technical challenges to realize smart cities include resource use optimization, service delivery without interruption at all times in all aspects, minimization of costs, and reduction of resource consumption. To address these challenges, new techniques and technologies are required for modeling and processing the big data generated and used through the underlying Internet of Things (IoT). To this end, we propose a data-centric approach to IoT in conceptualizing the &ldquo;things&rdquo; from a service-oriented perspective and investigate efficient ways to identify, integrate, and manage big data. The data-centric approach is expected to better support efficient management of data with complexities inherent in IoT-generated big data. Furthermore, it supports efficient and scalable query processing and reasoning techniques required in development of smart city applications. This article redresses the literature and contributes to the foundations of smart cities applications.

VL  - 8
IS  - 6
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Delivering electronic health care (eHealth) services across multi-cloud providers to implement patient-centric care demands a trustworthy brokering architecture. Specifically, such an architecture should aggregate relevant medical information to allow informed decision-making. It should also ensure that this information is complete and authentic and that no one has tampered with it. Brokers deployed in eHealth services may fall short of meeting such criteria due to two key behaviors. The first involves violating international health-data protection laws by allowing user anonymity and limiting user access rights. Second, brokers claiming to provide trustworthy transactions between interested parties usually rely on user feedback, an approach vulnerable to manipulation by malicious users. This paper addresses these data security and trust challenges by proposing HealthyBroker, a novel, trust-building brokering architecture for multiple cloud environments. This architecture is designed specifically for patient-centric cloud eHealth services. It enables care-team members to complete eHealth transactions securely and access relevant patient data on a &ldquo;need-to-know&rdquo; basis in compliance with data-protection laws. HealthyBroker also protects against potential malicious behavior by assessing the trust relationship and tracking it using a neutral, tamper-proof, distributed blockchain ledger. Trust is assessed based on two strategies. First, all transactions and user feedback are tracked and audited in a distributed ledger for transparency. Second, only feedback coming from trustworthy parties is taken into consideration. HealthyBroker was tested in a simulated eHealth multi-cloud environment. The test produced better results than a benchmark algorithm in terms of data accuracy, service time, and the reliability of feedback received as measured by three malicious behavior models (na&iuml;ve, feedback isolated, and feedback collective). These results demonstrate that HealthyBroker can provide care teams with a trustworthy, transparent ecosystem that can facilitate information sharing and well-informed decisions for patient-centric care.

AB  - New advances in sensor technologies and communications in wireless sensor networks have favored the introduction of low-cost sensors for monitoring air quality applications. In this article, we present the results of the European project H2020 CAPTOR, where three testbeds with sensors were deployed to capture tropospheric ozone concentrations. One of the biggest challenges was the calibration of the sensors, as the manufacturer provides them without calibrating. Throughout the paper, we show how short-term calibration using multiple linear regression produces good calibrated data, but instead produces biases in the calculated long-term concentrations. To mitigate the bias, we propose a linear correction based on Kriging estimation of the mean and standard deviation of the long-term ozone concentrations, thus correcting the bias presented by the sensors.

AB  - With the development of online cars, the demand for travel prediction is increasing in order to reduce the information asymmetry between passengers and drivers of online car-hailing. This paper proposes a travel demand forecasting model named OC-CNN based on the convolutional neural network to forecast the travel demand. In order to make full use of the spatial characteristics of the travel demand distribution, this paper meshes the prediction area and creates a travel demand data set of the graphical structure to preserve its spatial properties. Taking advantage of the convolutional neural network in image feature extraction, the historical demand data of the first twenty-five minutes of the entire region are used as a model input to predict the travel demand for the next five minutes. In order to verify the performance of the proposed method, one-month data from online car-hailing of the Chengdu Fourth Ring Road are used. The results show that the model successfully extracts the spatiotemporal features of the data, and the prediction accuracies of the proposed method are superior to those of the representative methods, including the Bayesian Ridge Model, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory networks.

The data were collected from before and after 2016, and since the amount of data has been growing rapidly after global agreements such as the United Nations&rsquo; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, we attempted to focus on adjacent years of publication. In order to understand the flow of research, we conducted a central analysis, which is widely used in quantitative research relating to social network analysis, and performed cluster analysis to identify relationships with related research. The results of the analysis are represented in the form of network maps, and the role of each keyword was clarified based on these network maps. In addition, the overall flow explained the change of flow through discarded and emerging keywords, and the relationships with related fields were explained through cluster analysis. The findings could serve as a basis for policymakers, urban managers, and researchers seeking a comprehensive understanding of the smart city concept in urban planning areas.

AB  - With the popularity of small-screen smart mobile devices, gestures as a new type of human–computer interaction are highly demanded. Furthermore, finger gestures are more familiar to people in controlling devices. In this paper, a new method for recognizing finger gestures is proposed. Ultrasound was actively emitted to measure the micro-Doppler effect caused by finger motions and was obtained at high resolution. By micro-Doppler processing, micro-Doppler feature maps of finger gestures were generated. Since the feature map has a similar structure to the single channel color image, a recognition model based on a convolutional neural network was constructed for classification. The optimized recognition model achieved an average accuracy of 96.51% in the experiment.

AB  - A new mobility ethos is needed for cities looking to overcome the problems that have been accumulated for decades by a transport paradigm that prioritises automobiles over people. Bike-sharing, a measure promoting voluntary travel behaviour change, could be part of a refined toolbox that will help in forging this new ethos. Despite a rapid emergence during the last handful of years, as evidenced by 1956 operational local schemes and approximately 15,254,400 self-service public use bicycles across the world, bike-sharing has been attracting negative attention lately. Tens of schemes have closed down, deemed as financial or operational failures, stigmatising bike-sharing’s brand and putting the future of the concept itself in jeopardy. However, discounting bike-sharing as flawed may not be fair or accurate. This paper identifies a formula of success for bike-sharing operations based on a state-of-the-art case study analysis, which is supported by primary data evidence from two survey-based studies in Sweden and Greece. This paper suggests that residents in cities hosting or looking to host bike-sharing schemes are usually very supportive of them but not always likely to use them. More importantly, this paper delivers some key policy and business lessons that form a survival guide for effectively introducing and running public bicycle schemes. These lessons include, among others, the need for: tailoring the system design and expansion strategy according to the host city needs, city-operator and commercial partner synergies, more bike-friendly infrastructure and legislation, pro-active cultural engagement, anti-abuse measures, enhanced fleet management and realistic profit expectations.

AB  - With the development of the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT), soldiers have become key nodes of information collection and resource control on the battlefield. It has become a trend to develop wearable devices with diverse functions for the military. However, although densely deployed wearable sensors provide a platform for comprehensively monitoring the status of soldiers, wearable technology based on multi-source fusion lacks a generalized research system to highlight the advantages of heterogeneous sensor networks and information fusion. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-level fusion framework (MLFF) based on Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) of soldiers, and describes a model of the deployment of heterogeneous sensor networks. The proposed framework covers multiple types of information at a single node, including behaviors, physiology, emotions, fatigue, environments, and locations, so as to enable Soldier-BSNs to obtain sufficient evidence, decision-making ability, and information resilience under resource constraints. In addition, we systematically discuss the problems and solutions of each unit according to the frame structure to identify research directions for the development of wearable devices for the military.

AB  - Alarm and event logs are an immense but latent source of knowledge commonly undervalued in industry. Though, the current massive data-exchange, high efficiency and strong competitiveness landscape, boosted by Industry 4.0 and IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) paradigms, does not accommodate such a data misuse and demands more incisive approaches when analyzing industrial data. Advances in Data Science and Big Data (or more precisely, Industrial Big Data) have been enabling novel approaches in data analysis which can be great allies in extracting hitherto hidden information from plant operation data. Coping with that, this work proposes the use of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as a promising data-driven approach to pave industrial alarm and event analysis. This approach proved to be fully able to increase industrial perception by extracting insights and valuable information from real-world industrial data without making prior assumptions.

The design of river water quality monitoring programs has always been a complex process and despite the numerous methodologies employed by experts, there is still no generally accepted, holistic and practical approach to support all the phases and elements related. Here, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based multicriteria decision analysis approach was adopted so as to contribute to the design of the national network for monitoring of water quality parameters in Greece that will additionally fulfill the urgent needs for an operational, real-time monitoring of the water resources. During this cost-effective and easily applied procedure the high priority areas were defined by taking into consideration the most important conditioning factors that impose pressures on rivers and the special conditions that increase the need for monitoring locally. The areas of increased need for automatic monitoring of water quality parameters are highlighted and the output map is validated. The sites in high priority areas are proposed for the installation of automatic monitoring stations and the installation and maintenance budget is presented. Finally, the proposed network is contrasted with the current automatic monitoring network in Greece.

AB  - This study sought to propose a big data analysis and prediction model for transmission line tower outliers to assess when something is wrong with transmission line tower big data based on deep reinforcement learning. The model enables choosing automatic cluster K values based on non-labeled sensor big data. It also allows measuring the distance of action between data inside a cluster with the Q-value representing network output in the altered transmission line tower big data clustering algorithm containing transmission line tower outliers and old Deep Q Network. Specifically, this study performed principal component analysis to categorize transmission line tower data and proposed an automatic initial central point approach through standard normal distribution. It also proposed the A-Deep Q-Learning algorithm altered from the deep Q-Learning algorithm to explore policies based on the experiences of clustered data learning. It can be used to perform transmission line tower outlier data learning based on the distance of data within a cluster. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed model recorded an approximately 2.29%~4.19% higher prediction rate and around 0.8% ~ 4.3% higher accuracy rate compared to the old transmission line tower big data analysis model.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is considered one of the future disruptive technologies and has attracted lots of research attention in the recent past. IoT devices are tiny sensing or actuating devices attached to daily life objects, capable of sending sensing data and receiving commands. Cloud computing technology provides tremendous computing and storage capacity over the Internet to overcome limited resources of IoT devices. Many studies are conducted on IoT device virtualization in the cloud environment to facilitate remote access and control. In the future, IoT devices will be accessed through its corresponding virtual objects. Just like the network of physical devices, there needs to be a network of virtual objects in the cyber world. In this paper, we present a concept of building a dynamic virtual network in the cloud environment among connected IoT devices. The key idea is to provide a mechanism for building a virtual network among connected IoT devices from different domains through their corresponding virtual objects in the cloud environment. This will facilitate the sharing of resources and the rapid development of diverse applications on top of the virtualization layer by establishing a dynamic end-to-end connection between IoT devices. In this study, we present a detailed design of the proposed system for building a virtual IoT network. We have also implemented three application layers protocols in OMNET++ for simulation of a virtual objects network to conduct performance analysis of the proposed IoT network virtualization.

AB  - In Texas and elsewhere, the looming realities of rapid population growth and intensifying effects of climate change mean that the things we rely on to live&mdash;water, energy, dependable infrastructure, social cohesion, and an ecosystem to support them&mdash;are exposed to unprecedented risk. Limited resources will be in ever greater demand and the environmental stress from prolonged droughts, record-breaking heat waves, and destructive floods will increase. Existing long-term trends and behaviors will not be sustainable. That is our current trajectory, but we can still change course. Significant advances in information communication technologies and big data, combined with new frameworks for thinking about urban places as social&ndash;ecological&ndash;technical systems, and an increasing movement towards transdisciplinary scholarship and practice sets the foundation and framework for a metropolitan observatory. Yet, more is required than an infrastructure for data. Making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable will require that data become actionable knowledge that change policy and practice. Research and development of urban sustainability and resilience knowledge is burgeoning, yet the uptake to policy has been slow. An integrative and holistic approach is necessary to develop effective sustainability science that synthesizes different sources of knowledge, relevant disciplines, multi-sectoral alliances, and connections to policy-makers and the public. To address these challenges and opportunities, we developed a conceptual framework for a &ldquo;metropolitan observatory&rdquo; to generate standardized long-term, large-scale datasets about social, ecological, and technical dimensions of metropolitan systems. We apply this conceptual model in Texas, known as the Texas Metro Observatory, to advance strategic research and decision-making at the intersection of urbanization and climate change. The Texas Metro Observatory project is part of Planet Texas 2050, a University of Texas Austin grand challenge initiative.

AB  - The growth of the urban population together with a high concentration of air pollution have important health impacts on citizens who are exposed to them, causing serious risks of the development and evolution of different chronic diseases. This paper presents the design and development of a novel participatory citizen science-based application and data ecosystem model. These developments are imperative and scientifically designed to gather and process perceptual sensing of urban, environmental, and health data. This data acquisition approach allows citizens to gather and generate environment- and health-related data through mobile devices. The sum of all citizens&rsquo; data will continuously enrich and increase the volumes of data coming from the city sensors and sources across geographical locations. These scientifically generated data, coupled with data from the city sensors and sources, will enable specialized predictive analytic solutions to empower citizens with urban, environmental, and health recommendations, while enabling new data-driven policies. Although it is difficult for citizens to relate their personal behaviour to large-scale problems such as climate change, pollution, or public health, the developed ecosystem provides the necessary tools to enable a greener and healthier lifestyle, improve quality of life, and contribute towards a more sustainable local environment.

VL  - 9
IS  - 13
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In this study, a novel technique to support smart city planning in estimating and controlling the heating load (HL) of buildings, was proposed, namely PSO-XGBoost. Accordingly, the extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost) was developed to estimate HL first; then, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was applied to optimize the performance of the XGBoost model. The classical XGBoost model, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Gaussian process (GP), and classification and regression trees (CART) models were also investigated and developed to predict the HL of building systems, and compared with the proposed PSO-XGBoost model; 837 investigations of buildings were considered and analyzed with many influential factors, such as glazing area distribution (GAD), glazing area (GA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), and relative compactness (RC). Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), variance account for (VAF), mean absolute error (MAE), and determination coefficient (R2), were used as the statistical criteria for evaluating the performance of the above models. The color intensity, as well as the ranking method, were also used to compare and evaluate the models. The results showed that the proposed PSO-XGBoost model was the most robust technique for estimating the HL of building systems. The remaining models (i.e., XGBoost, SVM, RF, GP, and CART) yielded more mediocre performance through RMSE, MAE, R2, VAF, and MAPE metrics. Another finding of this study also indicated that OH, RA, WA, and SA were the most critical parameters for the accuracy of the proposed PSO-XGBoost model. They should be particularly interested in smart city planning as well as the optimization of smart cities.

The key contribution is a denoising procedure that includes an over-sampling scheme, the detection and removal of outlier trajectories, a kernelized time elastic averaging method, and a down-sampling as post-processing. The experiment carried out on benchmark datasets showed that the proposed procedure is effective and outperforms straightforward methods based on medoid or Euclidean averaging approaches.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) connects a wide range of objects and the types of environments in which IoT can be deployed dynamically change. Therefore, these environments can be modified dynamically at runtime considering the emergence of other requirements. Self-adaptive software alters its behavior to satisfy the requirements in a dynamic environment. In this context, the concept of self-adaptive software is suitable for some dynamic IoT environments (e.g., smart greenhouses, smart homes, and reality applications). In this study, we propose a self-adaptive framework for decision-making in an IoT environment at runtime. The framework comprises a finite-state machine model design and a game theoretic decision-making method for extracting efficient strategies. The framework was implemented as a prototype and experiments were conducted to evaluate its runtime performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can be applied to IoT environments at runtime. In addition, a smart greenhouse-based use case is included to illustrate the usability of the proposed framework.

IS  - 14
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The inevitable revolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its benefits can be witnessed everywhere. Two major issues related to IoT are the interoperability and the identification of trustworthy things. The proposed Context-Aware Trustworthy Social Web of Things System (CATSWoTS) addresses the interoperability issue by incorporating web technologies including Service Oriented Architecture where each thing plays the role of a service provider as well as a role of service consumer. The aspect of social web helps in getting recommendations from social relations. It was identified that the context dependency of trust along with Quality of Service (QoS) criteria, for identifying and recommending trustworthy Web of Things (WoT), require more attention. For this purpose, the parameters of context awareness and the constraints of QoS are considered. The research focuses on the idea of a user-centric system where the profiles of each thing (level of trustworthiness) are being maintained at a centralized level and at a distributed level as well. The CATSWoTS evaluates service providers based on the mentioned parameters and the constraints and then identifies a suitable service provider. For this, a rule-based collaborative filtering approach is used. The efficacy of CATSWoTS is evaluated with a specifically designed environment using a real QoS data set. The results showed that the proposed novel technique fills the gap present in the state of the art. It performed well by dynamically identifying and recommending trustworthy services as per the requirements of a service seeker.

TI  - Estimating PM10 Concentration from Drilling Operations in Open-Pit Mines Using an Assembly of SVR and PSO
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Dust is one of the components causing heavy environmental pollution in open-pit mines, especially PM10. Some pathologies related to the lung, respiratory system, and occupational diseases have been identified due to the effects of PM10 in open-pit mines. Therefore, the prediction and control of PM10 concentration in the production process are necessary for environmental and health protection. In this study, PM10 concentration from drilling operations in the Coc Sau open-pit coal mine (Vietnam) was investigated and considered through a database including 245 datasets collected. A novel hybrid artificial intelligence model was developed based on support vector regression (SVR) and a swarm optimization algorithm (i.e., particle swarm optimization (PSO)), namely PSO-SVR, for estimating PM10 concentration from drilling operations at the mine. Polynomial (P), radial basis function (RBF), and linear (L) kernel functions were considered and applied to the development of the PSO-SVR models in the present study, abbreviated as PSO-SVR-P, PSO-SVR-RBF, and PSO-SVR-L. Also, three benchmark artificial intelligence techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and classification and regression trees (CART), were applied and developed for estimating PM10 concentration and then compared with the PSO-SVR models. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R2) were used as the statistical criteria for evaluating the performance of the developed models. The results exhibited that the PSO algorithm had an essential role in the optimization of the hyper-parameters of the SVR models. The PSO-SVR models (i.e., PSO-SVR-L, PSO-SVR-P, and PSO-SVR-RBF) had higher performance levels than the other models (i.e., RF, CART, and KNN) with an RMSE of 0.040, 0.042, and 0.043; and R2 of 0.954, 0.948, and 0.946; for the PSO-SVR-L, PSO-SVR-P, and PSO-SVR-RBF models, respectively. Of these PSO-SVR models, the PSO-SVR-L model was the most dominant model with an RMSE of 0.040 and R2 of 0.954. The remaining three benchmark models (i.e., RF, CART, and KNN) yielded a more unsatisfactory performance with an RMSE of 0.060, 0.052, and 0.067; and R2 of 0.894, 0.924, and 0.867, for the RF, CART, and KNN models, respectively. Furthermore, the findings of this study demonstrated that the density of rock mass, moisture content, and the penetration rate of the drill were essential parameters on the PM10 concentration caused by drilling operations in open-pit mines.

AB  - Falls are a main cause of injury for patients with certain diseases. Patients who wear health monitoring systems can go about daily activities without limitations, thereby enhancing their quality of life. In this paper, patient falls and heart rate were accurately detected and measured using two proposed algorithms. The first algorithm, abnormal heart rate detection (AHRD), improves patient heart rate measurement accuracy and distinguishes between normal and abnormal heart rate functions. The second algorithm, TB-AIC, combines an acceleration threshold and monitoring of patient activity/inactivity functions to accurately detect patient falls. The two algorithms were practically implemented in a proposed autonomous wireless health monitoring system (AWHMS). The AWHMS was implemented based on a GSM module, GPS, microcontroller, heartbeat and accelerometer sensors, and a smartphone. The measurement accuracy of the recorded heart rate was evaluated based on the mean absolute error, Bland&ndash;Altman plots, and correlation coefficients. Fourteen types of patient activities were considered (seven types of falling and seven types of daily activities) to determine the fall detection accuracy. The results indicate that the proposed AWHMS succeeded in monitoring the patient&rsquo;s vital signs, with heart rate measurement and fall detection accuracies of 98.75% and 99.11%, respectively. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of the fall detection algorithm (both 99.12%) were explored.

New smart devices are developed every day with the ability to generate, send, and display messages about their status, data, and information about other devices. Consequently, the number of notifications received by a user is increasing and their tolerance may decrease in a short time. With this, it is necessary to develop a management system and notification controls. In this context, this work proposes a notification and alert management system called PRISER.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 7
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Outdoor parking systems are one of the most crucial needs in a smart city to find vacant parking spaces in outdoor environments, such as roadsides, university campuses, and so on. In a typical outdoor parking system, the detection of a vehicle entering and leaving the parking zone is a major step. At present, there are numerous external sensor-based and camera-based parking systems available to detect the entrance and leaving of vehicles. Camera-based parking systems rely on sophisticated camera set-ups, while sensor-based parking systems require the installation of sensors at the parking spots or vehicles&rsquo; sides. Due to such complication, the deployment and maintenance costs of the existing parking systems are very high. Furthermore, the need for additional hardware and network capacity increases the cost and complexity, which makes it difficult to use for large deployment. This paper proposes an approach for outdoor parking utilizing only smartphone integrated sensors that do not require manpower support nor additional sensor installation. The proposed algorithm first receives sensor signals from the driver&rsquo;s phone, performs pre-processing to recognize the context of drivers, which is followed by context flow recognition. The final result is obtained from context flow recognition which provides the output of whether the driver is parking or unparking. The proposed approach is validated with a set of comprehensive experiments. The performance of the proposed method is favorable as it uses only the smartphone&rsquo;s internal sensors to recognize whether the cars are entering or leaving the parking area.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Edge computing and the Internet of Things (IOT) provide the technological basis for the development of intelligent manufacturing nowadays. In order to support the intelligent interconnection and application of all kinds of equipment in the industrial field, edge computing should be equipped close to or embedded in all kinds of equipment nodes in the industrial wireless network. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate the wireless network design of the Industrial Internet of Things. Low power wireless sensor devices are widely used in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which are sensitive to electromagnetic noise. The electromagnetic noises in industrial scenarios are significantly different from the conventional assumed white noise. In this paper, the measurement results of electromagnetic noises at three different test positions are given in an automobile factory. The spectrum occupancy of the factory wireless environment in the 300 MHz&ndash;3 GHz band was obtained by frequency domain measurement. In the time domain measurement, four statistical parameters of the three bands of 315 MHz, 433 MHz, and 916 MHz were measured, and the electromagnetic noise distributions in different plant areas and different frequency bands were analyzed. According to the measurement results, the time-varying characteristics of electromagnetic noise can be characterized by continuous hidden Markov models (CHMM). These results are informative to the design and optimization for the edge computing networks for IIoT.

AB  - Improperly grown trees may cause huge hazards to the environment and to humans, through e.g., climate change, soil erosion, etc. A proximity environmental feature-based tree health assessment (PTA) scheme is proposed to prevent these hazards by providing guidance for early warning methods of potential poor tree health. In PTA development, tree health is defined and evaluated based on proximity environmental features (PEFs). The PEF takes into consideration the seven surrounding ambient features that strongly impact tree health. The PEFs were measured by the deployed smart sensors surrounding trees. A database composed of tree health and relative PEFs was established for further analysis. An adaptive data identifying (ADI) algorithm is applied to exclude the influence of interference factors in the database. Finally, the radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN), a machine leaning algorithm, has been identified as the appropriate tool with which to correlate tree health and PEFs to establish the PTA algorithm. One of the salient features of PTA is that the algorithm can evaluate, and thus monitor, tree health remotely and automatically from smart sensor data by taking advantage of the well-established internet of things (IoT) network and machine learning algorithm.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become increasingly widespread. Despite their potential of improving multiple application domains, these devices have poor security, which can be explored by attackers to build large-scale botnets. In this work, we propose a host-based approach to detect botnets in IoT devices, named IoTDS (Internet of Things Detection System). It relies on one-class classifiers, which model only the legitimate device behaviour for further detection of deviations, avoiding the manual labelling process. The proposed solution is underpinned by a novel agent-manager architecture based on HTTPS, which prevents the IoT device from being overloaded by the training activities. To analyse the device&rsquo;s behaviour, the approach extracts features from the device&rsquo;s CPU utilisation and temperature, memory consumption, and number of running tasks, meaning that it does not make use of network traffic data. To test our approach, we used an experimental IoT setup containing a device compromised by bot malware. Multiple scenarios were made, including three different IoT device profiles and seven botnets. Four one-class algorithms (Elliptic Envelope, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-class Support Vector Machine) were evaluated. The results show the proposed system has a good predictive performance for different botnets, achieving a mean F1-score of 94% for the best performing algorithm, the Local Outlier Factor. The system also presented a low impact on the device&rsquo;s energy consumption, and CPU and memory utilisation.

AB  - A feedback-based architecture is presented for the distribution grid which enables the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for various applications, including Dynamic Voltage Optimization (DVO) and Demand Response (DR). In this architecture, sensor devices are resident on the distribution grid and therefore have a unique awareness of multiple system parameters. This enables the use of ongoing ML techniques for implementation of critical applications in the Smart Grid. Monitoring devices are placed at the endpoints and monitoring/control devices are placed along the power line on various types of grid-resident systems. Because the devices are grid-resident and interact directly with other devices on the same physical link, applications such as ML-assisted DVO can be targeted with very high confidence.

AB  - Modern supply chains have evolved into highly complex value networks and turned into a vital source of competitive advantage. However, it has become increasingly challenging to verify the source of raw materials and maintain visibility of products and merchandise while they are moving through the value chain network. The application of the Internet of Things (IoT) can help companies to observe, track, and monitor products, activities, and processes within their respective value chain networks. Other applications of IoT include product monitoring to optimize operations in warehousing&sbquo; manufacturing, and transportation. In combination with IoT, Blockchain technology can enable a broad range of different application scenarios to enhance value chain transparency and to increase B2B trust. When combined, IoT and Blockchain technology have the potential to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of modern supply chains. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we illustrate how the deployment of Blockchain technology in combination with IoT infrastructure can streamline and benefit modern supply chains and enhance value chain networks. Second, we derive six research propositions outlining how Blockchain technology can impact key features of the IoT (i.e., scalability, security, immutability and auditing, information flows, traceability and interoperability, quality) and thus lay the foundation for future research projects.

TI  - An Agent-based Model Simulation of Human Mobility Based on Mobile Phone Data: How Commuting Relates to Congestion
T2  - ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 7
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The commute of residents in a big city often brings tidal traffic pressure or congestions. Understanding the causes behind this phenomenon is of great significance for urban space optimization. Various spatial big data make the fine description of urban residents&rsquo; travel behaviors possible, and bring new approaches to related studies. The present study focuses on two aspects: one is to obtain relatively accurate features of commuting behaviors by using mobile phone data, and the other is to simulate commuting behaviors of residents through the agent-based model and inducing backward the causes of congestion. Taking the Baishazhou area of Wuhan, a local area of a mega city in China, as a case study, we simulated the travel behaviors of commuters: the spatial context of the model is set up using the existing urban road network and by dividing the area into space units. Then, using the mobile phone call detail records of a month, statistics of residents&rsquo; travel during the four time slots in working day mornings are acquired and then used to generate the Origin-Destination matrix of travels at different time slots, and the data are imported into the model for simulation. Under the preset rules of congestion, the agent-based model can effectively simulate the traffic conditions of each traffic intersection, and can induce backward the causes of traffic congestion using the simulation results and the Origin-Destination matrix. Finally, the model is used for the evaluation of road network optimization, which shows evident effects of the optimizing measures adopted in relieving congestion, and thus also proves the value of this method in urban studies.

AB  - Overweight and obesity are affecting productivity and quality of life worldwide. The Internet of Things (IoT) makes it possible to interconnect, detect, identify, and process data between objects or services to fulfill a common objective. The main advantages of IoT in healthcare are the monitoring, analysis, diagnosis, and control of conditions such as overweight and obesity and the generation of recommendations to prevent them. However, the objects used in the IoT have limited resources, so it has become necessary to consider other alternatives to analyze the data generated from monitoring, analysis, diagnosis, control, and the generation of recommendations, such as machine learning. This work presents PISIoT: a machine learning and IoT-based smart health platform for the prevention, detection, treatment, and control of overweight and obesity, and other associated conditions or health problems. Weka API and the J48 machine learning algorithm were used to identify critical variables and classify patients, while Apache Mahout and RuleML were used to generate medical recommendations. Finally, to validate the PISIoT platform, we present a case study on the prevention of myocardial infarction in elderly patients with obesity by monitoring biomedical variables.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 15
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus must monitor their blood glucose levels in order to control the glycaemia. Consequently, they must perform a capillary test at least three times per day and, besides that, a laboratory test once or twice per month. These standard methods pose difficulty for patients since they need to prick their finger in order to determine the glucose concentration, yielding discomfort and distress. In this paper, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based framework for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring is described. The system is based on Raspberry Pi Zero (RPi) energised with a power bank, using a visible laser beam and a Raspberry Pi Camera, all implemented in a glove. Data for the non-invasive monitoring is acquired by the RPi Zero taking a set of pictures of the user fingertip and computing their histograms. Generated data is processed by an artificial neural network (ANN) implemented on a Flask microservice using the Tensorflow libraries. In this paper, all measurements were performed in vivo and the obtained data was validated against laboratory blood tests by means of the mean absolute error (10.37%) and Clarke grid error (90.32% in zone A). Estimated glucose values can be harvested by an end device such as a smartphone for monitoring purposes.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 15
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Human motion detection and activity recognition are becoming vital for the applications in smart homes. Traditional Human Activity Recognition (HAR) mechanisms use special devices to track human motions, such as cameras (vision-based) and various types of sensors (sensor-based). These mechanisms are applied in different applications, such as home security, Human&ndash;Computer Interaction (HCI), gaming, and healthcare. However, traditional HAR methods require heavy installation, and can only work under strict conditions. Recently, wireless signals have been utilized to track human motion and HAR in indoor environments. The motion of an object in the test environment causes fluctuations and changes in the Wi-Fi signal reflections at the receiver, which result in variations in received signals. These fluctuations can be used to track object (i.e., a human) motion in indoor environments. This phenomenon can be improved and leveraged in the future to improve the internet of things (IoT) and smart home devices. The main Wi-Fi sensing methods can be broadly categorized as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Wi-Fi radar (by using Software Defined Radio (SDR)) and Channel State Information (CSI). CSI and RSSI can be considered as device-free mechanisms because they do not require cumbersome installation, whereas the Wi-Fi radar mechanism requires special devices (i.e., Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)). Recent studies demonstrate that CSI outperforms RSSI in sensing accuracy due to its stability and rich information. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in the CSI-based sensing mechanism and illustrates the drawbacks, discusses challenges, and presents some suggestions for the future of device-free sensing technology.

TI  - Exploiting Scalable Machine-Learning Distributed Frameworks to Forecast Power Consumption of Buildings
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 15
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The pervasive and increasing deployment of smart meters allows collecting a huge amount of fine-grained energy data in different urban scenarios. The analysis of such data is challenging and opening up a variety of interesting and new research issues across energy and computer science research areas. The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches. This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption. SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets. As a case study, SPEC has been tested on real data of an heating distribution network and power consumption data collected in a major Italian city. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SPEC to forecast both fine-grained values and coarse levels of power consumption of buildings.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Preservation of privacy of users&rsquo; personal data has always been a critical issue to deal with. This issue in the Internet of Things (IoT), which facilitates millions of applications, has become even more challenging. Currently, several approaches and methods are available to safeguard privacy but each of them suffers from one or more anomalies. In particular, Trusted Third-Party approach relies on the trust of a third-party server, Cooperation needs the trust of other peers, Obfuscation is known to return inaccurate results, and Dummy generates too much overhead. Moreover, these and most of the other well-known approaches deal only with specific types of applications linked to the location-based services. In this paper, we present two new methods, namely: Blind Third Party (BTP) and Blind Peers (     B L  P    ), and combine them to form a new one to be known as the Blind Approach (     B L  A    ). With the help of simulation results we shall demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of      B L  A     over the other available methods. The simulation results also exhibit that      B L  A     is free from all the existing problems of the other approaches. However,      B L  A     causes a slight increase in the average (response) time, which we consider to be a minor issue. We shall also discuss the capability and superiority of the Blind Approach in the cases of E-health, Smart Transportation, and Smart Home systems.

VL  - 9
IS  - 15
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Psycho-acoustic parameters have been extensively used to evaluate the discomfort or pleasure produced by the sounds in our environment. In this context, wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) can be an interesting solution for monitoring subjective annoyance in certain soundscapes, since they can be used to register the evolution of such parameters in time and space. Unfortunately, the calculation of the psycho-acoustic parameters involved in common annoyance models implies a significant computational cost, and makes difficult the acquisition and transmission of these parameters at the nodes. As a result, monitoring psycho-acoustic annoyance becomes an expensive and inefficient task. This paper proposes the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large urban sound dataset capable of efficiently predicting psycho-acoustic annoyance from raw audio signals continuously. We evaluate the proposed regression model and compare the resulting computation times with the ones obtained by the conventional direct calculation approach. The results confirm that the proposed model based on CNN achieves high precision in predicting psycho-acoustic annoyance, predicting annoyance values with an average quadratic error of around 3%. It also achieves a very significant reduction in processing time, which is up to 300 times faster than direct calculation, making CNN designed a clear exponent to work in IoT devices.

AB  - An exemplary paradigm of how an AI can be a disruptive technological paragon via the utilization of blockchain comes straight from the world of deep learning. Data scientists have long struggled to maintain the quality of a dataset for machine learning by an AI entity. Datasets can be very expensive to purchase, as, depending on both the proper selection of the elements and the homogeneity of the data contained within, constructing and maintaining the integrity of a dataset is difficult. Blockchain as a highly secure storage medium presents a technological quantum leap in maintaining data integrity. Furthermore, blockchain&rsquo;s immutability constructs a fruitful environment for creating high quality, permanent and growing datasets for deep learning. The combination of AI and blockchain could impact fields like Internet of things (IoT), identity, financial markets, civil governance, smart cities, small communities, supply chains, personalized medicine and other fields, and thereby deliver benefits to many people.

It also enabled the analysis of factors affecting the efficiency of this process, e.g., the photovoltaic potential of solar roofs, the ownership of buildings, the type of building development, the level of social trust, institutional and social incentives, and the development of an information society.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) and Blockchain-based delivery framework, called DeliveryCoin, for drone-delivered services. The DeliveryCoin framework consists of four phases, including system initialization phase, creating the block, updating the blockchain, and intrusion detection phase. To achieve privacy-preservation, the DeliveryCoin framework employs hash functions and short signatures without random oracles and the Strong Diffie&ndash;Hellman (SDH) assumption in bilinear groups. To achieve consensus inside the blockchain-based delivery platform, we introduce a UAV-aided forwarding mechanism, named pBFTF. We also propose an IDS system in each macro eNB (5G) for detecting self-driving network attacks as well as false transactions between self-driving nodes. Furthermore, extensive simulations are conducted, and results confirm the efficiency of our proposed DeliveryCoin framework in terms of latency of blockchain consensus and accuracy.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of transforming an unmodified WiFi radio infrastructure into a flexible sensing system for passive subject counting. We first introduce the multi-dimensional channel features that capture the subject presence. Then, we compare Bayesian and neural network based machine learning tools specialized for subject discrimination and counting. Ensemble classification is used to leverage space-frequency diversity and combine learning tools trained with different channel features. A combination of multiple models is shown to improve the counting accuracy. System design is based on a dense network of WiFi devices equipped with multiple antennas. Experimental validation is conducted in an indoor space featuring up to five moving people. Real-time computing and practical solutions for cloud migration are also considered. The proposed approach for passive counting gives detection results with 99% average accuracy.

AB  - Social investment programs are designed to provide opportunities to the less privileged so that they can contribute to the socioeconomic development of society. Stakeholders in social safety net programs (SSNPs) target vulnerable groups, such as the urban poor, women, the unemployed, and the elderly, with initiatives that have a transformative impact. Inadequate policy awareness remains a challenge, resulting in low participation rates in SSNPs. To achieve all-inclusive development, deliberate policies and programs that target this population have to be initiated by government, corporate bodies, and public-minded individuals. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques could play an important role in improving the managerial decision support and policy-making process of SSNPs and increasing the social resilience of urban populations. To enhance managerial decision-making in social investment programs, we used a Bayesian network to develop an intelligent decision support system called the Social Safety Net Expert System (SSNES). Using the SSNES, we provide an advisory system to stakeholders who make management decisions, which clearly demonstrates the efficacy of SSNPs and inclusive development.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - The application of blockchain technology to the energy sector promises to derive new operating models focused on local generation and sustainable practices, which are driven by peer-to-peer collaboration and community engagement. However, real-world energy blockchains differ from typical blockchain networks insofar as they must interoperate with grid infrastructure, adhere to energy regulations, and embody engineering principles. Naturally, these additional dimensions make real-world energy blockchains highly dependent on the participation of grid operators, engineers, and energy providers. Although much theoretical and proof-of-concept research has been published on energy blockchains, this research aims to establish a lens on real-world projects and implementations that may inform the alignment of academic and industry research agendas. This research classifies 131 real-world energy blockchain initiatives to develop an understanding of how blockchains are being applied to the energy domain, what type of failure rates can be observed from recently reported initiatives, and what level of technical and theoretical details are reported for real-world deployments. The results presented from the systematic analysis highlight that real-world energy blockchains are (a) growing exponentially year-on-year, (b) producing relatively low failure/drop-off rates (~7% since 2015), and (c) demonstrating information sharing protocols that produce content with insufficient technical and theoretical depth.

AB  - Building energy consumption accounts for 30%&ndash;45% of the global energy demand. With an ever-increasing world population, it has now become essential to minimize the energy consumption for the future of the environment. One of the most crucial aspects in this regard is the utilization of sensing and environmental monitoring technologies in buildings as these technologies provide stakeholders, such as owners, designers, managers, and occupants, with important information regarding the energy performance, safety and cost-effectiveness of the building. With the global sensors market value predicted to exceed $190 billion by 2021 and the number of sensors deployed worldwide forecasted to reach the &lsquo;1 Trillion&rsquo; mark by 2025, a state-of-the-art review of various commercially-viable sensor devices and the wide range of communication technologies that complement them is highly desirable. This paper provides an insight into various sensing and environmental monitoring technologies commonly deployed in buildings by surveying different sensor technologies, wired and wireless communication technologies, and the key selection parameters and strategies for optimal sensor placement. In addition, we review the key characteristics and limitations of the most prominent battery technologies in use today, different energy harvesting sources and commercial off-the-shelf solutions, and various challenges and future perspectives associated with the application of sensing and environmental monitoring technologies within buildings.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The accurate prediction of bus passenger flow is the key to public transport management and the smart city. A long short-term memory network, a deep learning method for modeling sequences, is an efficient way to capture the time dependency of passenger flow. In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have sought to apply the LSTM model to passenger flow prediction. However, few of them pay attention to the optimization procedure during model training. In this article, we propose a hybrid, optimized LSTM network based on Nesterov accelerated adaptive moment estimation (Nadam) and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD). This method trains the model with high efficiency and accuracy, solving the problems of inefficient training and misconvergence that exist in complex models. We employ a hybrid optimized LSTM network to predict the actual passenger flow in Qingdao, China and compare the prediction results with those obtained by non-hybrid LSTM models and conventional methods. In particular, the proposed model brings about a 4%–20% extra performance improvements compared with those of non-hybrid LSTM models. We have also tried combinations of other optimization algorithms and applications in different models, finding that optimizing LSTM by switching Nadam to SGD is the best choice. The sensitivity of the model to its parameters is also explored, which provides guidance for applying this model to bus passenger flow data modelling. The good performance of the proposed model in different temporal and spatial scales shows that it is more robust and effective, which can provide insightful support and guidance for dynamic bus scheduling and regional coordination scheduling.

This eventually leads to the development of many smart applications such as smart cities, smart homes, smart healthcare, smart transportation, etc. Due to the fact that the IoT devices have limited resources, the cybersecurity approaches that relied on complex and long processing cryptography are not a good fit for these constrained devices. Moreover, the current IoT systems experience critical security vulnerabilities that include identifying which devices were affected, what data or services were accessed or compromised, and which users were impacted. The cybersecurity challenge in IoT systems is to find a solution for handling the identity of the user, things/objects and devices in a secure manner. This paper proposes an effective multifactor authentication (CMA) solution based on robust combiners of the hash functions implemented in the IoT devices. The proposed CMA solution mitigates the authentication vulnerabilities of IoT and defends against several types of attacks. Also, it achieves multi-property robustness and preserves the collision-resistance, the pseudo-randomness, the message authentication code, and the one-wayness. It also ensures the integrity, authenticity and availability of sensed data for the legitimate IoT devices. The simulation results show that CMA outperforms the TOTP in term of the authentication failure rate. Moreover, the evaluation of CMA shows an acceptable QoS measurement in terms of computation time overhead, throughput, and packet loss ratio.

AB  - Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) are helping to make water management smarter and optimizing consumption in the smart agriculture industry. This article proposes a new topology of sensor nodes based on the use of inexpensive and highly efficient components, such as water level, soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rain sensors. Additionally, to guarantee good performance of the system, the used transmission module is based on LoRa LPWAN technology. The design of the main circuit board of the system is optimized by combining two layers and implementing software optimization. The overall sensor network is developed and tested in the research lab, and real farms can be controlled by users manually or automatically using the mobile application. Experimental results are produced by testing sensor and communication link effectiveness, and are subsequently validated in the field through a one-week measurement campaign.

AB  - This paper proposes a framework for an Air Quality Decision Support System (AQDSS), and as a proof of concept, develops an Internet of Things (IoT) application based on this framework. This application was assessed by means of a case study in the City of Madrid. We employed different sensors and combined outdoor and indoor data with spatiotemporal activity patterns to estimate the Personal Air Pollution Exposure (PAPE) of an individual. This pilot case study presents evidence that PAPE can be estimated by employing indoor air quality monitors and e-beacon technology that have not previously been used in similar studies and have the advantages of being low-cost and unobtrusive to the individual. In future work, our IoT application can be extended to include prediction models, enabling dynamic feedback about PAPE risks. Furthermore, PAPE data from this type of application could be useful for air quality policy development as well as in epidemiological studies that explore the effects of air pollution on certain diseases.

AB  - The integration of different networks has attracted significant attention in academia. Both terrestrial and maritime communications systems have been attracting keen interest for ways to deal with various applications. As the environment of cognitive vehicular and maritime networks is extremely dynamic, these networks suffer with a long delay because of intermittent links while providing services for different applications. To this end, here we introduce the integration of cognitive vehicular and maritime networks to design a coastal smart city by utilizing software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and fog computing under the same infrastructure. This novel integrated cognitive coastal city fulfills the demand of each application user in a hybrid environment with a quicker response time. The idea is to combine vehicular and maritime communications to meet different user demands. Different virtual networks are launched by network function virtualization, and are managed and controlled by a software-defined networking controller. From the integration of software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and fog computing, both vehicular and marine users are provided with stable paths to meet each application&rsquo;s demands.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Urban development in recent decades has had a significant impact on climate change. Cities have implemented traffic monitoring systems to sustain the new building code in meeting the target for environmental indicators. Timisoara is the second city in Romania and manages over 60% of the development and pollution of Timis County. The analysis of large volumes of data provided by local sensors and databases requires big data analytics. In this research, for the first time, we simultaneously developed two parallel scenario-based decision-making support models to assess a CO2 sequestration index. The model is based on a tree inventory for traffic area and car flow using Roegenian processes with borders. The first scenario (dt1) analyzes the real O2-pollution car flows for process streets as receivers of pollution. The second scenario (dt2) analyzes O2-pollution flows for the same streets from the perspective of streets that garage the cars. We modeled the parallel integration of actual O2 production and pollution flows for 160 main streets that account for over 50% of the urban mileage of Timisoara city. The carbon sequestration indexes of the streets are in the range of 0.0000043&ndash;0.437 (dt1) and 0.0000092&ndash;11.78 (dt2). The results can be used to support local decision making regarding the environment CO2-O2 balances by optimizing the local fiscal policies. The research could be extended to secondary streets and separately for the pollution of heating-cooling devices for residential building areas.

VL  - 9
IS  - 18
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The need to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, as well as the use of local renewable heat sources has caused heat meters to be used not only to calculate the consumed energy, but also for the active management of central heating systems. Increasing the reading frequency and the use of measurement data to control the heating system expands the requirements for the reliability of heat meters. The aim of the research is to analyze a large set of meters in the real network and predict their faults to avoid inaccurate readings, incorrect billing, heating system disruption, and unnecessary maintenance. The reliability analysis of heat meters, based on historical data collected over several years, shows some regularities, which cannot be easily described by physics-based models. The failure rate is almost constant and does depend on the past, but is a non-linear combination of state variables. To predict meters&rsquo; failures in the next billing period, three independent machine learning models are implemented and compared with selected metrics, because even the high performance of a single model (87% true positive for neural network) may be insufficient to make a maintenance decision. Additionally, performing hyperparameter optimization boosts the models&rsquo; performance by a few percent. Finally, three improved models are used to build an ensemble classifier, which outperforms the individual models. The proposed procedure ensures the high efficiency of fault detection (&gt;95%), while maintaining overfitting at the minimum level. The methodology is universal and can be utilized to study the reliability and predict faults of other types of meters and different objects with the constant failure rate.

AB  - Machine learning-based indoor localization used to suffer from the collection, construction, and maintenance of labeled training databases for practical implementation. Semi-supervised learning methods have been developed as efficient indoor localization methods to reduce use of labeled training data. To boost the efficiency and the accuracy of indoor localization, this paper proposes a new time-series semi-supervised learning algorithm. The key aspect of the developed method, which distinguishes it from conventional semi-supervised algorithms, is the use of unlabeled data. The learning algorithm finds spatio-temporal relationships in the unlabeled data, and pseudolabels are generated to compensate for the lack of labeled training data. In the next step, another balancing-optimization learning algorithm learns a positioning model. The proposed method is evaluated for estimating the location of a smartphone user by using a Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurement. The experimental results show that the developed learning algorithm outperforms some existing semi-supervised algorithms according to the variation of the number of training data and access points. Also, the proposed method is discussed in terms of why it gives better performance, by the analysis of the impact of the learning parameters. Moreover, the extended localization scheme in conjunction with a particle filter is executed to include additional information, such as a floor plan.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Increasingly serious traffic jams and traffic accidents pose threats to the social economy and human life. The lamp semantics of driving is a major way to transmit the driving behavior information between vehicles. The detection and recognition of the vehicle taillights can acquire and understand the taillight semantics, which is of great significance for realizing multi-vehicle behavior interaction and assists driving. It is a challenge to detect taillights and identify the taillight semantics on real traffic road during the day. The main research content of this paper is mainly to establish a neural network to detect vehicles and to complete recognition of the taillights of the preceding vehicle based on image processing. First, the outlines of the preceding vehicles are detected and extracted by using convolutional neural networks. Then, the taillight area in the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space are extracted and the taillight pairs are detected by correlations of histograms, color and positions. Then the taillight states are identified based on the histogram feature parameters of the taillight image. The detected taillight state of the preceding vehicle is prompted to the driver to reduce traffic accidents caused by the untimely judgement of the driving intention of the preceding vehicle. The experimental results show that this method can accurately identify taillight status during the daytime and can effectively reduce the occurrence of confused judgement caused by light interference.

Thus, it minimizes the unexpected device downtime, lowers the maintenance costs, extends equipment lifecycle, etc. Therefore, this article developed a predictive maintenance mechanism with the construction of a test platform and data analysis along with machine learning. The information transmission of sensors was based on Raspberry Pi via the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) communication protocol. The sensors used for environmental sensing were implemented on the programmable interface controller and the data were stored in time sequence. A statistical analysis software platform was adopted for data preprocessing, modelling, and prediction to provide necessary maintenance decision. Using multivariate analysis users can obtain more information about the equipment&rsquo;s status, and the administrator can also determine the operational situation before unexpected device anomalies. The developed modules are decisively helpful in preventing unpredictable losses, thus improving the quality of services.

AB  - The interrelations between cities, inland areas, connecting road networks, urban, and political polarities have evolved, thereby determining economic, social, and place-based impacts. Thus, via a case study of Sardinia island (Italy), this study analyses regional transport data to evaluate the interrelations and mobility issues between the main cities and the settlement geographies of internal areas with a predominantly agricultural vocation. First, it frames the problems (common to the islands) theoretically and focuses on how the internal areas (considered marginal for a long time) have considerable material and immaterial resources to be valorised. Second, the study evaluates the internal relationship networks that characterise the island territory through the cluster and principal components analysis using origin&ndash;destination data to represent vocations and population needs. A smart governance strategy is proposed for Sardinia through an assessment of the functionality of urban settlements and interconnections between the hinterlands (the small and the main cities of the case study), following the smart region paradigm. The study underlines the importance of the interconnection between urban geographical areas. Thus, given an analytical-numerical approach, the originality of this research is highlighted in how it is possible to extract social vocations of the territory, which is generally not easily quantifiable.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Along with the advancement of light-weight sensing and processing technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become popular platforms for intelligent traffic monitoring and control. UAV-mounted cameras can capture traffic-flow videos from various perspectives providing a comprehensive insight into road conditions. To analyze the traffic flow from remotely captured videos, a reliable and accurate vehicle detection-and-tracking approach is required. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning framework for vehicle detection and tracking from UAV videos for monitoring traffic flow in complex road structures. This approach is designed to be invariant to significant orientation and scale variations in the videos. The detection procedure is performed by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art object detector, You Only Look Once (YOLOv3), using several custom-labeled traffic datasets. Vehicle tracking is conducted following a tracking-by-detection paradigm, where deep appearance features are used for vehicle re-identification, and Kalman filtering is used for motion estimation. The proposed methodology is tested on a variety of real videos collected by UAVs under various conditions, e.g., in late afternoons with long vehicle shadows, in dawn with vehicles lights being on, over roundabouts and interchange roads where vehicle directions change considerably, and from various viewpoints where vehicles&rsquo; appearance undergo substantial perspective distortions. The proposed tracking-by-detection approach performs efficiently at 11 frames per second on color videos of 2720p resolution. Experiments demonstrated that high detection accuracy could be achieved with an average F1-score of 92.1%. Besides, the tracking technique performs accurately, with an average multiple-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) of 81.3%. The proposed approach also addressed the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art in multi-object tracking regarding frequent identity switching, resulting in a total of only one identity switch over every 305 tracked vehicles.

AB  - Big data is the buzz-word of today, and yet their specific impact on individuals and societies remains assumed rather than fully understood. Clearly, big data and their use have already given rise to a number of questions, including those of how data can be collected and used in ethical and socially sensitive ways. Building on these points, the objective of this study was to explore how precisely big data and big data based services influence individuals and societies. This paper elaborates on individuals&rsquo; perceptions of data, especially on how they perceive the actual sharing of their data. In this way, this paper defines a value space for the social impact of big data relevant to three factors, namely the intention to share personal data, individual&rsquo;s concerns, and social impact of big data.The main contribution of this study consists of the insights into the still nascent area of research that unfolds at the cross-section of social science and computer science.

AB  - This paper studies the indoor localization based on Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI). In addition to position estimation, this study examines the expansion of applications using Wi-Fi RSSI data sets in three areas: (i) feature extraction, (ii) mobile fingerprinting, and (iii) mapless localization. First, the features of Wi-Fi RSSI observations are extracted with respect to different floor levels and designated landmarks. Second, the mobile fingerprinting method is proposed to allow a trainer to collect training data efficiently, which is faster and more efficient than the conventional static fingerprinting method. Third, in the case of the unknown-map situation, the trajectory learning method is suggested to learn map information using crowdsourced data. All of these parts are interconnected from the feature extraction and mobile fingerprinting to the map learning and the estimation. Based on the experimental results, we observed (i) clearly classified data points by the feature extraction method as regards the floors and landmarks, (ii) efficient mobile fingerprinting compared to conventional static fingerprinting, and (iii) improvement of the positioning accuracy owing to the trajectory learning.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Affect recognition is an interdisciplinary research field bringing together researchers from natural and social sciences. Affect recognition research aims to detect the affective state of a person based on observables, with the goal to, for example, provide reasoning for the person&rsquo;s decision making or to support mental wellbeing (e.g., stress monitoring). Recently, beside of approaches based on audio, visual or text information, solutions relying on wearable sensors as observables, recording mainly physiological and inertial parameters, have received increasing attention. Wearable systems enable an ideal platform for long-term affect recognition applications due to their rich functionality and form factor, while providing valuable insights during everyday life through integrated sensors. However, existing literature surveys lack a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art research in wearable-based affect recognition. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a broad overview and in-depth understanding of the theoretical background, methods and best practices of wearable affect and stress recognition. Following a summary of different psychological models, we detail the influence of affective states on the human physiology and the sensors commonly employed to measure physiological changes. Then, we outline lab protocols eliciting affective states and provide guidelines for ground truth generation in field studies. We also describe the standard data processing chain and review common approaches related to the preprocessing, feature extraction and classification steps. By providing a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art and guidelines to various aspects, we would like to enable other researchers in the field to conduct and evaluate user studies and develop wearable systems.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by high voltage power systems can cause a serious problem for nearby electrically conductive structures, such as railroads, communication lines, or pipelines, that would place a system&rsquo;s integrity and the operational safety of the structure at high level of risk. According to the IEEE standard-80, by implementing a well-designed mitigation system, the induced voltage on neighboring electrically conductive structure can reach a harmless level. The mitigation system can enhance the overall integrity of pipelines and provide higher operation safety for personal during working on the exposed parts of metallic pipelines or conductive appurtenances. An accurate prediction about the level of induced voltage is absolutely necessary to design a suitable mitigation system for metallic pipelines. Thus, in this work a hybrid prediction methodology composed of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and a backtracking search algorithm (BSA) is developed to accurately predict the electromagnetic inference&rsquo;s effects on metallic pipelines with shared right-of-way (RoW) and high voltage overhead lines (OHLs). Through the combination of BSA as a robust and efficient optimization algorithm in the learning process of an ANFIS approach, a hybrid data mining algorithm has been developed to predict the induced voltage on mitigated and unmitigated pipelines more accurately and reliably. The simulation results are validated by data sets observed from the Current Distribution, Electromagnetic Interference, Grounding and Soil Structure Analysis (CDEGS) software. From the simulation results it was confirmed that the proposed hybrid method is effective in accurately predicting the induced voltage on pipelines with changing system parameters. Furthermore, to evaluate the precision and applicability of the developed approach in this paper, its estimates are compared with the results obtained from an artificial neural network (ANN), a support vector regression (SVR) and an ANFIS optimized by other well-known optimization algorithms. The obtained results indicate higher accuracy of the developed hybrid method over other artificial intelligence based approaches.

The present study applied machine-learning analysis technique to forecast the risk of particulate matter. Emotions related to particulate matter were found to be 65.4% negative, 7.7% neutral, and 27.0% positive. Intelligent services that can detect early and prevent unknown crisis situations of particulate matter may be possible if risk factors of particulate matter are predicted through the linkage of the machine-learning prediction model.

AB  - Pervasive healthcare services have undergone a great evolution in recent years. The technological development of communication networks, including the Internet, sensor networks, and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) have given rise to new architectures, applications, and standards related to addressing almost all current e-health challenges. Among the standards, the importance of OpenEHR has been recognized, since it enables the separation of medical semantics from data representation of electronic health records. However, it does not meet the requirements related to interoperability of e-health devices in M2M networks, or in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Moreover, the lack of interoperability hampers the application of new data-processing techniques, such as data mining and online analytical processing, due to the heterogeneity of the data and the sources. This article proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform for pervasive healthcare that ensures interoperability, quality of the detection process, and scalability in an M2M-based architecture, and provides functionalities for the processing of high volumes of data, knowledge extraction, and common healthcare services. The platform uses the semantics described in OpenEHR for both data quality evaluation and standardization of healthcare data stored by the association of IoMT devices and observations defined in OpenEHR. Moreover, it enables the application of big data techniques and online analytic processing (OLAP) through Hadoop Map/Reduce and content-sharing through fast healthcare interoperability resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs).

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) pipe network modeling plays an essential part in high performance-based smart city applications. Given that massive 3D pipe networks tend to be difficult to manage and to visualize, we propose in this study a hybrid framework for high-performance modeling of a 3D pipe network, including pipe network data model and high-performance modeling. The pipe network data model is devoted to three-dimensional pipe network construction based on network topology and building information models (BIMs). According to the topological relationships of the pipe point pipelines, the pipe network is decomposed into multiple pipe segment units. The high-performance modeling of 3D pipe network contains a spatial 3D model, the instantiation, adaptive rendering, and combination parallel computing. Spatial 3D model (S3M) is proposed for spatial data transmission, exchange, and visualization of massive and multi-source 3D spatial data. The combination parallel computing framework with GPU and OpenMP was developed to reduce the processing time for pipe networks. The results of the experiments showed that the hybrid framework achieves a high efficiency and the hardware resource occupation is reduced.

AB  - The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) as a solution in diverse application domains has nurtured the expansion in the number of devices and data volume. Multiple platforms and protocols have been introduced and resulted in high device ubiquity and heterogeneity. However, currently available IoT architectures face challenges to accommodate the diversity in IoT devices or services operating under different operating systems and protocols. In this paper, we propose a new IoT architecture that utilizes the component-based design approach to create and define the loosely-coupled, standalone but interoperable service components for IoT systems. Furthermore, a data-driven feedback function is included as a key feature of the proposed architecture to enable a greater degree of system automation and to reduce the dependency on mankind for data analysis and decision-making. The proposed architecture aims to tackle device interoperability, system reusability and the lack of data-driven functionality issues. Using a real-world use case on a proof-of-concept prototype, we examined the viability and usability of the proposed architecture.

AB  - Modelling and simulation of social interaction and networks are of high interest in multiple disciplines and fields of application ranging from fundamental social sciences to smart city management. Future smart city infrastructures and management are characterised by adaptive and self-organising control using real-world sensor data. In this work, humans are considered as sensors. Virtual worlds, e.g., simulations and games, are commonly closed and rely on artificial social behaviour and synthetic sensor information generated by the simulator program or using data collected off-line by surveys. In contrast, real worlds have a higher diversity. Agent-based modelling relies on parameterised models. The selection of suitable parameter sets is crucial to match real-world behaviour. In this work, a framework combining agent-based simulation with crowd sensing and social data mining using mobile agents is introduced. The crowd sensing via chat bots creates augmented virtuality and reality by augmenting the simulated worlds with real-world interaction and vice versa. The simulated world interacts with real-world environments, humans, machines, and other virtual worlds in real-time. Among the mining of physical sensors (e.g., temperature, motion, position, and light) of mobile devices like smartphones, mobile agents can perform crowd sensing by participating in question&ndash;answer dialogues via a chat blog (provided by smartphone Apps or integrated into WEB pages and social media). Additionally, mobile agents can act as virtual sensors (offering data exchanged with other agents) and create a bridge between virtual and real worlds. The ubiquitous usage of digital social media has relevant impact on social interaction, mobility, and opinion-making, which has to be considered. Three different use-cases demonstrate the suitability of augmented agent-based simulation for social network analysis using parameterised behavioural models and mobile agent-based crowd sensing. This paper gives a rigorous overview and introduction of the challenges and methodologies used to study and control large-scale and complex socio-technical systems using agent-based methods.

AB  - The purpose of this descriptive research paper is to initiate discussions on the use of innovative technologies and their potential to support the research and development of pan-Canadian monitoring and surveillance activities associated with environmental impacts on health and within the health system. Its primary aim is to provide a review of disruptive technologies and their current uses in the environment and in healthcare. Drawing on extensive experience in population-level surveillance through the use of technology, knowledge from prior projects in the field, and conducting a review of the technologies, this paper is meant to serve as the initial steps toward a better understanding of the research area. In doing so, we hope to be able to better assess which technologies might best be leveraged to advance this unique intersection of health and environment. This paper first outlines the current use of technologies at the intersection of public health and the environment, in particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The paper provides a description for each of these technologies, along with a summary of their current applications, and a description of the challenges one might face with adopting them. Thereafter, a high-level reference architecture, that addresses the challenges of the described technologies and could potentially be incorporated into the pan-Canadian surveillance system, is conceived and presented.

AB  - Making transport systems sustainable is a topic that has attracted the attention of many researchers and urban planners. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Smart Cities Network (ASCN) was initiated to develop a sustainable transport system in the ASEAN countries. A comprehensive understanding of street networks (SNs) can contribute significantly to the achievement of this initiative. Therefore, this paper measured and compared characteristics of drivable street networks (DSNs) and walkable street networks (WSNs) of the 26 ASCN pilot cities by applying multiple network metrics. The OSMnx tool was used to download and analyse WSNs and DSNs from the OpenStreetMap. The findings present the topological and geometric characteristics of WSNs and DSNs that are diverse and characterized by different factors. The cities with orthogonal street grids, high street density, intersection density, and fewer cul-de-sacs have good accessibility to reach destinations. In contrast, some other cities have more curvilinear and circuitous SNs with many missing links to other streets, which in turn are prone to traffic disruption. The study highlights the important features of SNs that have significant implications for future designs of SNs in the ASCN whose goal is to make cities smart and liveable for ASEAN members.

AB  - Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) issues have a direct impact on the health and comfort of building occupants. In this paper, an experimental low-cost system has been developed to address IAQ issues by using a distributed internet of things platform to control and monitor the indoor environment in building spaces while adopting a data-driven approach. The system is based on several real-time sensor data to model the indoor air quality and accurately control the ventilation system through algorithms to maintain a comfortable level of IAQ by balancing indoor and outdoor pollutant concentrations using the Indoor Air Quality Index approach. This paper describes hardware and software details of the system as well as the algorithms, models, and control strategies of the proposed solution which can be integrated in detached ventilation systems. Furthermore, a mobile app has been developed to inform, in real time, different-expertise-user profiles showing indoor and outdoor IAQ conditions. The system is implemented in a small prototype box and early-validated with different test cases considering various pollutant concentrations, reaching a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3&ndash;4.

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Vehicle Logo Recognition (VLR) is an important part of vehicle behavior analysis and can provide supplementary information for vehicle identification, which is an essential research topic in robotic systems. However, the inaccurate extraction of vehicle logo candidate regions will affect the accuracy of logo recognition. Additionally, the existing methods have low recognition rate for most small vehicle logos and poor performance under complicated environments. A VLR method based on enhanced matching, constrained region extraction and SSFPD network is proposed in this paper to solve the aforementioned problems. A constrained region extraction method based on segmentation of the car head and car tail is proposed to accurately extract the candidate region of logo. An enhanced matching method is proposed to improve the detection performance of small objects, which augment each of training images by copy-pasting small objects many times in the unconstrained region. A single deep neural network based on a reduced ResNeXt model and Feature Pyramid Networks is proposed in this paper, which is named as Single Shot Feature Pyramid Detector (SSFPD). The SSFPD uses the reduced ResNeXt to improve classification performance of the network and retain more detailed information for small-sized vehicle logo detection. Additionally, it uses the Feature Pyramid Networks module to bring in more semantic context information to build several high-level semantic feature maps, which effectively improves recognition performance. Extensive evaluations have been made on self-collected and public vehicle logo datasets. The proposed method achieved 93.79% accuracy on the Common Vehicle Logos Dataset and 99.52% accuracy on another public dataset, respectively, outperforming the existing methods.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are increasingly embraced around the world to advance smart mobility and more broadly, smart, and sustainable cities. Algorithms form the basis of decision-making in AVs, allowing them to perform driving tasks autonomously, efficiently, and more safely than human drivers and offering various economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, algorithmic decision-making in AVs can also introduce new issues that create new safety risks and perpetuate discrimination. We identify bias, ethics, and perverse incentives as key ethical issues in the AV algorithms&rsquo; decision-making that can create new safety risks and discriminatory outcomes. Technical issues in the AVs&rsquo; perception, decision-making and control algorithms, limitations of existing AV testing and verification methods, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can also undermine the performance of the AV system. This article investigates the ethical and technical concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making in AVs by exploring how driving decisions can perpetuate discrimination and create new safety risks for the public. We discuss steps taken to address these issues, highlight the existing research gaps and the need to mitigate these issues through the design of AV&rsquo;s algorithms and of policies and regulations to fully realise AVs&rsquo; benefits for smart and sustainable cities.

TI  - An Improved UAV-PHD Filter-Based Trajectory Tracking Algorithm for Multi-UAVs in Future 5G IoT Scenarios

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The 5G cellular network is expected to provide core service platform for the expanded Internet of Things (IoT) by supporting enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communication (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, provide civil, commercial, and government services in various fields. Particularly in a 5G IoT scenario, UAV-aided network communications will fulfill an increasingly important role and will require the tracking of multiple UAV targets. As UAVs move quickly, maintaining the stability of the communication connection in 5G will be a challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to track the trajectory of UAVs. At present, the GM-PHD filter has a problem that the new target intensity must be known, and it cannot obtain the moving target trajectory and the influence of the clutter is likely to cause false alarm. A UAV-PHD filter is proposed in this work to improve the traditional GM-PHD filter by applying machine learning to the emergency detection and trajectory tracking of UAV targets. An out-of-sight detection algorithm for multiple UAVs is then presented to improve tracking performance. The method is assessed by simulation using MATLAB, and OSPA distance is utilized as an evaluation indicator. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed method can be applied to the tracking of multiple UAV targets in future 5G-IoT scenarios, and the performance is superior to the traditional GM-PHD filter.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors are becoming increasingly popular, especially in monitoring large and ambient environments. Applications that embrace IoT and sensors often require mining the data feeds that are collected at frequent intervals for intelligence. Despite the fact that such sensor data are massive, most of the data contents are identical and repetitive; for example, human traffic in a park at night. Most of the traditional classification algorithms were originally formulated decades ago, and they were not designed to handle such sensor data effectively. Hence, the performance of the learned model is often poor because of the small granularity in classification and the sporadic patterns in the data. To improve the quality of data mining from the IoT data, a new pre-processing methodology based on subspace similarity detection is proposed. Our method can be well integrated with traditional data mining algorithms and anomaly detection methods. The pre-processing method is flexible for handling similar kinds of sensor data that are sporadic in nature that exist in many ambient sensing applications. The proposed methodology is evaluated by extensive experiment with a collection of classical data mining models. An improvement over the precision rate is shown by using the proposed method.

AB  - Fly-rock induced by blasting is an undesirable phenomenon in quarries. It can be dangerous for humans, equipment, and buildings. To minimize its undesirable hazards, we proposed a state-of-the-art technology of fly-rock prediction based on artificial neural network (ANN) models and their robust combination, called EANNs model (ensemble of ANN models); 210 fly-rock events were recorded to develop and test the ANN and EANNs models. Of thi sample, 80% of the whole dataset was assigned to develop the models, the remaining 20% was assigned to confirm the models developed. Accordingly, five ANN models were designed and developed using the training dataset (i.e., 80% of the whole original data) first; then, their predictions on the training dataset were ensembled to generate a new training dataset. Subsequently, another ANN model was developed based on the new set of training data (i.e., EANNs model). Its performance was evaluated through a variety of performance indices, such as MAE (mean absolute error), MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), RMSE (root-mean-square error), R2 (correlation coefficient), and VAF (variance accounted for). A promising result was found for the proposed EANNs model in predicting blast-induced fly-rock with a MAE = 2.777, MAPE = 0.017, RMSE = 4.346, R2 = 0.986, and VAF = 98.446%. To confirm the performance of the proposed EANNs model, another ANN model with the same structure was developed and tested on the training and testing datasets. The findings also indicated that the proposed EANNs model yielded better performance than those of the ANN model with the same structure.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Underground spaces have become increasingly important in recent decades in metropolises. In this regard, the demand for the use of underground spaces and, consequently, the excavation of these spaces has increased significantly. Excavation of an underground space is accompanied by risks and many uncertainties. Tunnel convergence, as the tendency for reduction of the excavated area due to change in the initial stresses, is frequently observed, in order to monitor the safety of construction and to evaluate the design and performance of the tunnel. This paper presents a model/equation obtained by a gene expression programming (GEP) algorithm, aiming to predict convergence of tunnels excavated in accordance to the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM). To obtain this goal, a database was prepared based on experimental datasets, consisting of six input and one output parameter. Namely, tunnel depth, cohesion, frictional angle, unit weight, Poisson&rsquo;s ratio, and elasticity modulus were considered as model inputs, while the cumulative convergence was utilized as the model&rsquo;s output. Configurations of the GEP model were determined through the trial-error technique and finally an optimum model is developed and presented. In addition, an equation has been extracted from the proposed GEP model. The comparison of the GEP-derived results with the experimental findings, which are in very good agreement, demonstrates the ability of GEP modeling to estimate the tunnel convergence in a reliable, robust, and practical manner.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Smart growth is widely adopted by urban planners as an innovative approach, which can guide a city to develop into an environmentally friendly modern city. Therefore, determining the degree of smart growth is quite significant. In this paper, sustainable degree (SD) is proposed to evaluate the level of urban smart growth, which is established by principal component regression (PCR) and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network. In the case study of Yumen and Otago, the SD values of Yumen and Otago are 0.04482 and 0.04591, respectively, and both plans are moderately successful. Yumen should give more attention to environmental development while Otago should concentrate on economic development. In order to make a reliable future plan, a self-organizing map (SOM) is conducted to classify all indicators and the RBF neural network-trained indicators are separate under different classifications to output new plans. Finally, the reliability of the plan is confirmed by cellular automata (CA). Through simulation of the trend of urban development, it is found that the development speed of Yumen and Otago would increase slowly in the long term. This paper provides a powerful reference for cities pursuing smart growth.

AB  - Smart Cities are approaching the Internet of Things (IoT) World. Most of the first-generation Smart City solutions are based on Extract Transform Load (ETL); processes and languages that mainly support pull protocols for data gathering. IoT solutions are moving forward to event-driven processes using push protocols. Thus, the concept of IoT applications has turned out to be widespread; but it was initially &ldquo;implemented&rdquo; with ETL; rule-based solutions; and finally; with true data flows. In this paper, these aspects are reviewed, highlighting the requirements for smart city IoT applications and in particular, the ones that implement a set of specific MicroServices for IoT Applications in Smart City contexts. Moreover; our experience has allowed us to implement a suite of MicroServices for Node-RED; which has allowed for the creation of a wide range of new IoT applications for smart cities that includes dashboards, IoT Devices, data analytics, discovery, etc., as well as a corresponding Life Cycle. The proposed solution has been validated against a large number of IoT applications, as it can be verified by accessing the https://www.Snap4City.org portal; while only three of them have been described in the paper. In addition, the reported solution assessment has been carried out by a number of smart city experts. The work has been developed in the framework of the Select4Cities PCP (PreCommercial Procurement), funded by the European Commission as Snap4City platform.

AB  - Industry is going through a transformation phase, enabling automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes, and this transformation is called Industry 4.0. Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) applications require real-time processing, near-by storage, ultra-low latency, reliability and high data rate, all of which can be satisfied by fog computing architecture. With smart devices expected to grow exponentially, the need for an optimized fog computing architecture and protocols is crucial. Therein, efficient, intelligent and decentralized solutions are required to ensure real-time connectivity, reliability and green communication. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of methods and techniques in fog computing. Our focus is on fog infrastructure and protocols in the context of IIoT applications. This article has two main research areas: In the first half, we discuss the history of industrial revolution, application areas of IIoT followed by key enabling technologies that act as building blocks for industrial transformation. In the second half, we focus on fog computing, providing solutions to critical challenges and as an enabler for IIoT application domains. Finally, open research challenges are discussed to enlighten fog computing aspects in different fields and technologies.

TI  - A Novel Data Reduction Approach for Structural Health Monitoring Systems

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The massive amount of data generated by structural health monitoring (SHM) systems usually affects the system&rsquo;s capacity for data transmission and analysis. This paper proposes a novel concept based on the probability theory for data reduction in SHM systems. The beauty salient feature of the proposed method is that it alleviates the burden of collecting and analysis of the entire strain data via a relative damage approach. In this methodology, the rate of variation of strain distributions is related to the rate of damage. In order to verify the accuracy of the approach, experimental and numerical studies were conducted on a thin steel plate subjected to cyclic in-plane tension loading. Circular holes with various sizes were made on the plate to define damage states. Rather than measuring the entire strain response, the cumulative durations of strain events at different predefined strain levels were obtained for each damage scenario. Then, the distribution of the calculated cumulative times was used to detect the damage progression. The results show that the presented technique can efficiently detect the damage progression. The damage detection accuracy can be improved by increasing the predefined strain levels. The proposed concept can lead to over 2500% reduction in data storage requirement, which can be particularly important for data generation and data handling in on-line SHM systems.

AB  - The New Urban Agenda (Agenda 2030) adopted at the United Nations Conference related to Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in the year 2016 has the goal of prompting cities to achieve the identified Sustainable Development Goals by the year 2030. In this context, cities can experiment strategies of circular economy for the optimization of resources, waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. The data generated by the components of an Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem can contribute in two relevant ways to a smart city model: (1) by the generation of a circular economy and (2) by the creation of intelligence to improve the decision-making processes by citizens or city managers. In this context, it is in our interest to understand the most relevant axes of the research related to IoT, particularly those based on the LoRa technology. LoRa has attracted the interest of researchers because it is an open standard and contributes to the development of sustainable smart cities, since they are linked to the concepts of a circular economy. Additionally, the intention of this work is to identify the technological or practical barriers that hamper the development of solutions, find possible future trends that could exist in the context of smart cities and IoT, and understand how they could be exploited by the industry and academy.

TI  - Identification of Enablers and Barriers for Public Bike Share System Adoption using Social Media and Statistical Models
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Public bike share (PBS) systems are meant to be a sustainable urban mobility solution in areas where different travel options and the practice of active transport modes can diminish the need on the vehicle and decrease greenhouse gas emission. Although PBS systems have been included in transportation plans in the last decades experiencing an important development and growth, it is crucial to know the main enablers and barriers that PBS systems are facing to reach their goals. In this paper, first, sentiment analysis techniques are applied to user generated content (UGC) in social media comments (Facebook, Twitter and TripAdvisor) to identify these enablers and barriers. This analysis provides a set of explanatory variables that are combined with data from official statistics and the PBS observatory in Spain. As a result, a statistical model that assesses the connection between PBS use and certain characteristics of the PBS systems, utilizing sociodemographic, climate, and positive and negative opinion data extracted from social media is developed. The outcomes of the research work show that the identification of the main enablers and barriers of PBS systems can be effectively achieved following the research method and tools presented in the paper. The findings of the research can contribute to transportation planners to uncover the main factors related to the adoption and use of PBS systems, by taking advantage of publicly available data sources.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Gross calorific value (GCV) is one of the essential parameters for evaluating coal quality. Therefore, accurate GCV prediction is one of the primary ways to improve heating value as well as coal production. A novel evolutionary-based predictive system was proposed in this study for predicting GCV with high accuracy, namely the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-support vector regression (SVR) model. It was developed based on the SVR and PSO algorithms. Three different kernel functions were employed to establish the PSO-SVR models, including radial basis function, linear, and polynomial functions. Besides, three benchmark machine learning models including classification and regression trees (CART), multiple linear regression (MLR), and principle component analysis (PCA) were also developed to estimate GCV and then compared with the proposed PSO-SVR model; 2583 coal samples were used to analyze the proximate components and GCV for this study. Then, they were used to develop the mentioned models as well as check their performance in experimental results. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R2), ranking, and intensity color criteria were used and computed to evaluate the GCV predictive models developed. The results revealed that the proposed PSO-SVR model with radial basis function had better accuracy than the other models. The PSO algorithm was optimized in the SVR model with high efficiency. These should be used as a supporting tool in practical engineering to determine the heating value of coal seams in complex geological conditions.

AB  - Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors that increase the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes mellitus. It is crucial to get diagnosed with time to take preventive measures, especially for patients in locations without proper access to laboratories and medical consultations. This work presented a new methodology to diagnose diseases using data mining that documents all the phases thoroughly for further improvement of the resulting models. We used the methodology to create a new model to diagnose the syndrome without using biochemical variables. We compared similar classification models, using their reported variables and previously obtained data from a study in Colombia. We built a new model and compared it to previous models using the holdout, and random subsampling validation methods to get performance evaluation indicators between the models. Our resulting ANN model used three hidden layers and only Hip Circumference, dichotomous Waist Circumference, and dichotomous blood pressure variables. It gave an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 87.75% by the IDF and 85.12% by HMS MetS diagnosis criteria, higher than previous models. Thanks to our new methodology, diagnosis models can be thoroughly documented for appropriate future comparisons, thus benefiting the diagnosis of the studied diseases.

AB  - Floods are amongst the most common and devastating of all natural hazards. The alarming number of flood-related deaths and financial losses suffered annually across the world call for improved response to flood risks. Interestingly, the last decade has presented great opportunities with a series of scholarly activities exploring how camera images and wireless sensor data from Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks can improve flood management. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature regarding IoT-based sensors and computer vision applications in flood monitoring and mapping. The paper contributes by highlighting the main computer vision techniques and IoT sensor approaches utilised in the literature for real-time flood monitoring, flood modelling, mapping and early warning systems including the estimation of water level. The paper further contributes by providing recommendations for future research. In particular, the study recommends ways in which computer vision and IoT sensor techniques can be harnessed to better monitor and manage coastal lagoons&mdash;an aspect that is under-explored in the literature.

TI  - The Design of an Automated System for the Analysis of the Activity and Emotional Patterns of Dogs with Wearable Sensors Using Machine Learning
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The safety and welfare of companion animals such as dogs has become a large challenge in the last few years. To assess the well-being of a dog, it is very important for human beings to understand the activity pattern of the dog, and its emotional behavior. A wearable, sensor-based system is suitable for such ends, as it will be able to monitor the dogs in real-time. However, the question remains unanswered as to what kind of data should be used to detect the activity patterns and emotional patterns, as does another: what should be the location of the sensors for the collection of data and how should we automate the system? Yet these questions remain unanswered, because to date, there is no such system that can address the above-mentioned concerns. The main purpose of this study was (1) to develop a system that can detect the activities and emotions based on the accelerometer and gyroscope signals and (2) to automate the system with robust machine learning techniques for implementing it for real-time situations. Therefore, we propose a system which is based on the data collected from 10 dogs, including nine breeds of various sizes and ages, and both genders. We used machine learning classification techniques for automating the detection and evaluation process. The ground truth fetched for the evaluation process was carried out by taking video recording data in frame per second and the wearable sensors data were collected in parallel with the video recordings. Evaluation of the system was performed using an ANN (artificial neural network), random forest, SVM (support vector machine), KNN (k nearest neighbors), and a na&iuml;ve Bayes classifier. The robustness of our system was evaluated by taking independent training and validation sets. We achieved an accuracy of 96.58% while detecting the activity and 92.87% while detecting emotional behavior, respectively. This system will help the owners of dogs to track their behavior and emotions in real-life situations for various breeds in different scenarios.

IS  - 23
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - With electricity representing around 20% of the global energy demand, and increasing support for renewable sources of electricity, there is also an escalating need to improve solar forecasts to support power management. While considerable research has been directed to statistical methods to improve solar power forecasting, few have employed finite mixture distributions. A statistically-objective classification of the overall sky condition may lead to improved forecasts. Combining information from the synoptic driving conditions for daily variability with local processes controlling subdaily fluctuations could assist with forecast validation and enhancement where few observations are available. Gaussian mixture models provide a statistical learning approach to automatically identify prevalent sky conditions (clear, semi-cloudy, and cloudy) and explore associated weather patterns. Here a first stage in the development of such a model is presented: examining whether there is sufficient information in the large-scale environment to identify days with clear, semi-cloudy, or cloudy conditions. A three-component Gaussian distribution is developed that reproduces the observed multimodal peaks in sky clearness indices, and their temporal distribution. Posterior probabilities from the fitted mixture distributions are used to identify periods of clear, partially-cloudy, and cloudy skies. Composites of low-level (850 hPa) humidity and winds for each of the mixture components reveal three patterns associated with the typical synoptic conditions governing the sky clarity, and hence, potential solar power.

AB  - Nowadays, the problem of parking guidance information (PGI) is one of the great challenges of smart cities. Sensor networks have been traditionally used, but they sometimes constitute a high administrative cost. For this reason, this paper presents social parking, a system that is based on the citizens as sensors paradigm, where data are collected by users and are processed using data mining techniques. Moreover, an ontology is used to enable the standardization of information. This way, social parking is compatible with the FIWARE platform. A forecast algorithm was also designed and verified to estimate the number of free parking spots inside a parking lot. With this aim, we used public parking data from eight parking lots in the city of Zaragoza. Client applications allowed testing of all the functions of the parking system. These tests were carried out in three experimental parking lots in the city of M&aacute;laga.

AB  - As urbanization continues to accelerate, the number of cities and their growing populations have created problems, such as the congestion and noise related to transportation, the pollution from industry, and the difficulty of disposing of garbage. An emerging urban strategy is to make use of digital technologies and big data to help improve the quality of life of urban residents. In the past decade, more and more researchers have studied smart cities, and the number of literature in this field grows rapidly, making it &ldquo;big data&rdquo;. With the aim of better understanding the contexts of smart-city research, including the distribution of topics, knowledge bases, and the research frontiers in the field, this paper is based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection, and the method used is that of comprehensive scientometric analysis and knowledge mapping in terms of diversity, time slicing, and dynamics, using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to study the literature in the field. The main research topics can be divided into three areas&mdash;&ldquo;the concepts and elements of the smart city&rdquo;, &ldquo;the smart city and the Internet of Things&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the smart city of the future&rdquo;&mdash;through document co-citation analysis.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - It is critical for quality requirements, such as trust, privacy, and confidentiality, to be fulfilled during the execution of smart city applications. In this study, smart city applications were modeled as agent systems composed of many agents, each with its own privacy and confidentiality properties. Violations of those properties may occur during execution due to the dynamic of agent behavior, decision-making capabilities, and social activities. In this research, a framework called Agent Quality Management was proposed and implemented to manage agent quality in agent systems. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach by applying it toward a smart city application called a crowdsourced navigation system to verify and assess agent data confidentiality. The AnyLogic Agent-Based Modeling tool was used to model and conduct the experiments. The experiments showed that the framework helped to improve the detection of agent quality violations in a dynamic smart city application. The results can be further analyzed using advanced data analytic approach to reduce future violations and improve data confidentiality in a smart city environment.

Nowadays, roads and highways are equipped with a huge amount of surveillance cameras, which can be used for real-time vehicle identification, and thus providing traffic flow estimation. This research provides a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art object detectors, visual features, and classification models useful to implement traffic state estimations. More specifically, three different object detectors are compared to identify vehicles. Four machine learning techniques are successively employed to explore five visual features for classification aims. These classic machine learning approaches are compared with the deep learning techniques. This research demonstrates that, when methods and resources are properly implemented and tested, results are very encouraging for both methods, but the deep learning method is the most accurately performing one reaching an accuracy of 99.9% for binary traffic state classification and 98.6% for multiclass classification.

AB  - The exponential growth of cities has brought important challenges such as waste management, pollution and overpopulation, and the administration of transportation. To mitigate these problems, the idea of the smart city was born, seeking to provide robust solutions integrating sensors and electronics, information technologies, and communication networks. More particularly, to face transportation challenges, intelligent transportation systems are a vital component in this quest, helped by vehicular communication networks, which offer a communication framework for vehicles, road infrastructure, and pedestrians. The extreme conditions of vehicular environments, nonetheless, make communication between nodes that may be moving at very high speeds very difficult to achieve, so non-deterministic approaches are necessary to maximize the chances of packet delivery. In this paper, we address this problem using artificial intelligence from a hybrid perspective, focusing on both the best next message to replicate and the best next hop in its path. Furthermore, we propose a deep learning&ndash;based router (DLR+), a router with a prioritized type of message scheduler and a routing algorithm based on deep learning. Simulations done to assess the router performance show important gains in terms of network overhead and hop count, while maintaining an acceptable packet delivery ratio and delivery delays, with respect to other popular routing protocols in vehicular networks.

AB  - Sensor-clouds are a combination of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and cloud computing. The emergence of sensor-clouds has greatly enhanced the computing power and storage capacity of traditional WSNs via exploiting the advantages of cloud computing in resource utilization. However, there are still many problems to be solved in sensor-clouds, such as the limitations of WSNs in terms of communication and energy, the high latency, and the security and privacy issues due to applying a cloud platform as the data processing and control center. In recent years, mobile edge computing has received increasing attention from industry and academia. The core of mobile edge computing is to migrate some or all of the computing tasks of the original cloud computing center to the vicinity of the data source, which gives mobile edge computing great potential in solving the shortcomings of sensor-clouds. In this paper, the latest research status of sensor-clouds is briefly analyzed and the characteristics of the existing sensor-clouds are summarized. After that we discuss the issues of sensor-clouds and propose some applications, especially a trust evaluation mechanism and trustworthy data collection which use mobile edge computing to solve the problems in sensor-clouds. Finally, we discuss research challenges and future research directions in leveraging mobile edge computing for sensor-clouds.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 24
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Urban traffic routing is deemed to be a significant challenge in intelligent transportation systems. Existing implementations suffer from several intrinsic issues such as scalability in centralized systems, unnecessary complexity of mechanisms and communication in distributed systems, and lack of privacy. These imply force intensive computational tasks in the traffic control center, continuous communication in real-time with involved stakeholders which require drivers to reveal their location, origin, and destination of their trips. In this paper we present an innovative urban traffic routing framework and reference architecture (multimap traffic control architecture, MuTraff), which is based on the strategical generation and distribution of a set of traffic network maps (traffic weighted multimaps, TWM) to vehicle categories or fleets. Each map in a TWM map set has the same topology but a different distribution of link weights, which are computed by considering policies and constraints that may apply to different vehicle groups. MuTraff delivers a traffic management system (TMS), where a traffic control center generates and distributes maps, while routing computation is performed at the vehicles. We show how this balance between generation, distribution, and routing computation improves scalability, eases communication complexities, and solves former privacy issues. Our study presents case studies in a real city environment for (a) global congestion management using random maps; (b) congestion control on road incidents; and c) emergency fleets routing. We show that MuTraff is a promising foundation framework that is easy to deploy, and is compatible with other existing TMS frameworks.

For the above reasons, it is so important to assess the capability of monitored processes, and shaping, analyzing and controlling the capability of processes is an important aspect of managing an organization that uses a process approach to management. The use of an appropriate method to analyze the course of production processes is a necessity imposed by quality standards, e.g., ISO 9001: 2015. That is why it is so important to propose a quick and low-cost method of assessing production processes. For this purpose, a method of assessing the capability of the manufacturing process using bootstrap analysis was used. The article presents the analysis of inherent properties of the production process based on the results of measurements of the characteristic features of the process or the characteristics of the manufactured products (process variables) for the shafts with grooves. The main goals of the work are to develop a procedure for determining process capability based on the bootstrap method, including criteria for the classification of production process capability; to develop the criterion values for confidence intervals of production process capability; as well as to demonstrate the practical application of bootstrap analysis in manufacturing. Moreover, comparative analyses of process capabilities using bootstrap and classic methods were carried out. They confirm both the narrowing of the confidence interval when using the bootstrap method and the possibility of determining a better estimator of the lower limit of this range compared to the results obtained using the classic method. The tests carried out for the unit production of shafts with grooves showed that the analysis of the process capability for measuring tests n = 10 is possible. Finally, new criterion values for the assessment of process capability for the bootstrap method were proposed. The model for assessing the capability of production processes presented in the paper was implemented in low-volume production in the defense industry.

AB  - Solar energy is one of the most promising sources of energy that could be used to address distributed supply problems. Global warming and decarbonization are significant global concerns, particularly for countries that are not fossil fuel providers. This paper presents a study focused on Spain, a country with a favorable location with respect to horizontal irradiance. The study addresses the future energy demand forecast and how photovoltaic energy could supply an important part of electricity needs. Our approach focuses on two analyses. First, several traditional statistical techniques are discussed in order to obtain a model that best suits Spanish energy demand forecasts for the future years. Different algorithms are compared in order to determine which is the most appropriate for the considered purpose. Second, the evolution of solar photovoltaic technology in Spain is analyzed. The latitude of Spanish cities makes them suitable for utilizing this kind of technology. In this sense, seasonal and monthly trends are identified with high levels of detail, considering a large historical dataset. The increase of the capacity of electricity generation based on this procedure is evaluated. Finally, a discussion about matching electricity demand forecasts and photovoltaic production is offered. Considering the selected model for the photovoltaic power of Spain, from    5    to     42     GW in 2030, the Spanish production is determined as     81     TWh. The obtained results suggest that a possible energy transition is feasible. However, some challenges have to be considered, such us the design of an effective strategy to store excess energy produced when generation is higher than electricity demand. In this way, the electrical distribution system could be fed by the stored energy when solar energy production is deficient.

AB  - The present work tries to fill part of the gap regarding the pilots&rsquo; emotions and their bio-reactions during some flight procedures such as, takeoff, climbing, cruising, descent, initial approach, final approach and landing. A sensing architecture and a set of experiments were developed, associating it to several simulated flights (     N  f l i g h t s   = 13    ) using the Microsoft Flight Simulator Steam Edition (FSX-SE). The approach was carried out with eight beginner users on the flight simulator (     N  p i l o t s   = 8    ). It is shown that it is possible to recognize emotions from different pilots in flight, combining their present and previous emotions. The cardiac system based on Heart Rate (HR), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Electroencephalography (EEG), were used to extract emotions, as well as the intensities of emotions detected from the pilot face. We also considered five main emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprise and scared. The emotion recognition is based on Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning techniques. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were the main methods used to measure the quality of the regression output models. The tests of the produced output models showed that the lowest recognition errors were reached when all data were considered or when the GSR datasets were omitted from the model training. It also showed that the emotion surprised was the easiest to recognize, having a mean RMSE of 0.13 and mean MAE of 0.01; while the emotion sad was the hardest to recognize, having a mean RMSE of 0.82 and mean MAE of 0.08. When we considered only the higher emotion intensities by time, the most matches accuracies were between 55% and 100%.

AB  - An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) particulate-matter (PM) monitoring system was developed that can perform three-dimensional stereoscopic observation of PM2.5 and PM10 in the atmosphere. The UAV monitoring system was mainly integrated by modules of data acquisition and processing, wireless data transmission, and global positioning system (GPS). Particularly, in this study, a ground measurement-control subsystem was added that can display and store collected data in real time and set up measurement scenarios, data-storage modes, and system sampling frequency as needed. The UAV PM monitoring system was calibrated via comparison with a national air-quality monitoring station; the data of both systems were highly correlated. Since rotation of the UAV propeller affects measured PM concentration, this study specifically tested this effect by setting up another identical monitoring system fixed at a tower as reference. The UAV systems worked simultaneously to collect data for comparison. A correction method for the propeller disturbance was proposed. Averaged relative errors for the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations measured by the two systems were 6.2% and 6.6%, respectively, implying that the UAV system could be used for monitoring PM in an atmosphere environment.

AB  - Water management towards smart cities is an issue increasingly appreciated under financial and environmental sustainability focus in any water sector. The main objective of this research is to disclose the technological breakthroughs associated with water and energy use. A methodology is proposed and applied in a case study to analyze the benefits to develop smart water grids, showing the advantages offered by the development of control measures. The case study showed the positive results, particularly savings of 57 GWh and 100 Mm3 in a period of twelve years when different measures from the common ones were developed for the monitoring and control of water losses in smart water management. These savings contributed to reducing the CO2 emissions to 47,385 t CO2-eq. Finally, in order to evaluate the financial effort and savings obtained in this reference systems (RS) network, the investment required in the monitoring and water losses control in a correlation model case (CMC) was estimated, and, as a consequence, the losses level presented a significant reduction towards sustainable values in the next nine years. Since the pressure control is one of the main issues for the reduction of leakage, an estimation of energy production for Portugal is also presented.

AB  - Layered internet of things (IoT) architectures have been proposed over the last years as they facilitate understanding the roles of different networking, hardware, and software components of smart applications. These are inherently distributed, spanning from devices installed in the field up to a cloud datacenter and further to a user smartphone, passing by intermediary stages at different levels of fog computing infrastructure. However, IoT architectures provide almost no hints on where components should be deployed. IoT Software Platforms derived from the layered architectures are expected to adapt to scenarios with different characteristics, requirements, and constraints from stakeholders and applications. In such a complex environment, a one-size-fits-all approach does not adapt well to varying demands and may hinder the adoption of IoT Smart Applications. In this paper, we propose a 5-layer IoT Architecture and a 5-stage IoT Computing Continuum, as well as provide insights on the mapping of software components of the former into physical locations of the latter. Also, we conduct a performance analysis study with six configurations where components are deployed into different stages. Our results show that different deployment configurations of layered components into staged locations generate bottlenecks that affect system performance and scalability. Based on that, policies for static deployment and dynamic migration of layered components into staged locations can be identified.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) remains a scourge that compromises the rights of many women around the world, shaping an asymmetry in civil rights. Fighting gender-based violence, especially when it is committed by an intimate partner, is an important responsibility that needs to be addressed from all angles. It is also remarkable that our society is clearly conditioned by information and communication technology (ICT), which involves many aspects of our daily life. Unfortunately, violence that is performed in the real world is also replicated in this &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; existence, by offenders in ICT contexts. On the other hand, the same technologies also provide a plethora of opportunities to fight IPV, which are enhanced by the innovative paradigm of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, we first present a thorough compilation of ICT proposals already published&mdash;based on either hardware or software&mdash;aimed at protecting IPV survivors, and which can be applied in real life situations but also within social networks. The challenges that still lie ahead are highlighted and, a complete ICT-based platform for IPV management, within an IoT framework, that overcomes the limitations of previous works is proposed, and then promoting a symmetry between individuals in society.

AB  - Airborne particulates are of particular significance for their human health impacts and their roles in both atmospheric radiative transfer and atmospheric chemistry. Observations of airborne particulates are typically made by environmental agencies using rather expensive instruments. Due to the expense of the instruments usually used by environment agencies, the number of sensors that can be deployed is limited. In this study we show that machine learning can be used to effectively calibrate lower cost optical particle counters. For this calibration it is critical that measurements of the atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature are also made.

AB  - Rising interest in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems combined with the increased availability of collected data allows the study of different methods for prevention of traffic congestion in cities. A common need in all of these methods is the use of traffic predictions for supporting planning and operation of the traffic lights and traffic management schemes. This paper focuses on comparing the forecasting effectiveness of three machine learning models, namely Random Forests, Support Vector Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron&mdash;in addition to Multiple Linear Regression&mdash;using probe data collected from the road network of Thessaloniki, Greece. The comparison was conducted with multiple tests clustered in three types of scenarios. The first scenario tests the algorithms on specific randomly selected dates on different randomly selected roads. The second scenario tests the algorithms on randomly selected roads over eight consecutive 15 min intervals; the third scenario tests the algorithms on random roads for the duration of a whole day. The experimental results show that while the Support Vector Regression model performs best at stable conditions with minor variations, the Multilayer Perceptron model adapts better to circumstances with greater variations, in addition to having the most near-zero errors.
