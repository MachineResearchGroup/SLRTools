AB  - The advent of the autonomous car is paving the road to the realization of ideas that will help optimize traffic flows, increase safety and reduce fuel consumption, among other advantages. We present one proposal to bring together Virtual Traffics Lights (VTLs) and platooning in urban scenarios, leaning on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication protocols that turn intersections into virtual containers of data. Newly-introduced protocols for the combined management of VTLs and platoons are validated by simulation, comparing a range of routing protocols for the vehicular networks with the baseline given by common deployments of traditional traffic lights ruled by state-of-the-art policies. The simulation results show that the combination of VTLs and platoons can achieve significant reductions in travel times and fuel consumption, provided that proper algorithms are used to handle the V2V communications.

TI  - Adding Active Slot Joint Larger Broadcast Radius for Fast Code Dissemination in WSNs

IS  - 11
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - By using Software Defined Network (SDN) technology, senor nodes can get updated program code which can provide new features, so it has received extensive attention. How to effectively spread code to each node fast is a challenge issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, an Adding Active Slot joint Larger Broadcast Radius (AAS-LBR) scheme is proposed for fast code dissemination. The AAS-LBR scheme combines the energy of data collection and code dissemination, making full use of the remaining energy in the far-sink area to increase the active slot and the broadcast radius to speed up the code dissemination. The main contributions of the proposed AAS-LBR scheme are the following: (1) Make full use of the remaining energy of the far sink area to expand the broadcast radius, so that the node broadcasts a longer distance. The wide range of broadcasts makes the number of nodes receiving code more, which speeds up the spread of code dissemination. (2) AAS-LBR uses two improved methods to further reduce the number of broadcasts and speed up the code dissemination: (a) When constructing the broadcast backbone whose nodes dominate all nodes in network and are responsible for broadcasting code, the active slot is added to the next hop node in a pipeline style on the diffusion path, which enables the code dissemination process to continue without pause. Thus, the code can quickly spread to the entire broadcast backbone. (b) For the nodes in the non-broadcast backbone whose nodes are dominated by the broadcast backbone and only for receiving code, an active slot is added coincident with its broadcast backbone&rsquo; active slot, which can reduce the time required for code dissemination and reduce the number of broadcasts. A lot of performance analysis and simulation results show that compared to previous schemed, the AAS-LBR scheme can balance energy consumption, the transmission delay can be reduced 43.09&ndash;78.69%, the number of broadcasts can be reduced 44.51&ndash;86.18% and the energy efficiency is improved by about 24.5%.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Cultural landscapes are regarded to be complex socioecological systems that originated as a result of the interaction between humanity and nature across time. Cultural landscapes present complex-system properties, including nonlinear dynamics among their components. There is a close relationship between socioeconomy and landscape in cultural landscapes, so that changes in the socioeconomic dynamic have an effect on the structure and functionality of the landscape. Several numerical analyses have been carried out to study this relationship, with linear regression models being widely used. However, cultural landscapes comprise a considerable amount of elements and processes, whose interactions might not be properly captured by a linear model. In recent years, machine-learning techniques have increasingly been applied to the field of ecology to solve regression tasks. These techniques provide sound methods and algorithms for dealing with complex systems under uncertainty. The term &lsquo;machine learning&rsquo; includes a wide variety of methods to learn models from data. In this paper, we study the relationship between socioeconomy and cultural landscape (in Andalusia, Spain) at two different spatial scales aiming at comparing different regression models from a predictive-accuracy point of view, including model trees and neural or Bayesian networks.

AB  - Smart cities are built to help people address issues like air pollution, traffic optimization, and energy efficiency. Electrical energy efficiency has become a central research issue in the energy field. Smart houses and buildings, which lower electricity costs, form an integral part of a smart city in a smart grid. This article presents an Internet of Things (IoT)-oriented smart Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that identifies electrical home appliances based on a novel hybrid Unsupervised Automatic Clustering-Integrated Neural-Fuzzy Classification (UAC-NFC) model. The smart HEMS designed and implemented in this article is composed of (1) a set of IoT-empowered smart e-meters, called smart sockets, installed as a benchmark in a realistic domestic environment with uncertainties and deployed against non-intrusive load monitoring; (2) a central Advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computing machine-based home gateway configured with a ZigBee wireless communication network; and (3) a cloud-centered analytical platform constructed to the hybrid UAC-NFC model for Demand-Side Management (DSM)/home energy management as a load classification task. The novel hybrid UAC-NFC model proposed in DSM and presented in this article is used to overcome the difficulties in distinguishing electrical appliances operated under similar electrical features and classified as unsupervised and self-organized. The smart HEMS developed with the proposed novel hybrid UAC-NFC model for DSM was able to identify electrical household appliances with an acceptable average and generalized classification rate of 95.73%.

AB  - Nowadays, it is more and more important to deal with the potential security issues of internet-of-things (IoT). Indeed, using the physical layer features of IoT wireless signals to achieve individual identity authentication is an effective way to enhance the security of IoT. However, traditional classifiers need to know all the categories in advance to get the recognition models. Realistically, it is difficult to collect all types of samples, which will result in some mistakes that the unknown target class may be decided as a known one. Consequently, this paper constructs an improving open-categorical classification model based on the generative adversarial networks (OCC-GAN) to solve the above problems. Here, we have modified the loss function of the generative model G and the discriminative model D. Compared to the traditional GAN model which can generate the fake sample overlapping with the real samples, our proposed G model generates the fake samples as negative samples which are evenly surrounding with the real samples, while the D model learns to distinguish between real samples and fake samples. Besides, we add auxiliary training not only to gain a better recognition result but also to improve the efficiency of the model. Furthermore, Our proposed model is verified through experimental study. Compared to other common methods, such as one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) and one-versus-rest support vector machine (OvR-SVM), the OCC-GAN model has a better performance. The recognition rate of the OCC-GAN model can reach more than 90% with a recall rate of 97% by the data of the IoT module.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Social sensors perceive the real world through social media and online web services, which have the advantages of low cost and large coverage over traditional physical sensors. In intelligent transportation researches, sensing and analyzing such social signals provide a new path to monitor, control and optimize transportation systems. However, current research is largely focused on using single channel online social signals to extract and sense traffic information. Clearly, sensing and exploiting multi-channel social signals could effectively provide deeper understanding of traffic incidents. In this paper, we utilize cross-platform online data, i.e., Sina Weibo and News, as multi-channel social signals, then we propose a word2vec-based event fusion (WBEF) model   for sensing, detecting, representing, linking and fusing urban traffic incidents. Thus, each traffic incident can be comprehensively described from multiple aspects, and finally the whole picture of unban traffic events can be obtained and visualized. The proposed WBEF architecture was trained by about 1.15 million multi-channel online data from Qingdao (a coastal city in China), and the experiments show our method surpasses the baseline model, achieving an 88.1% F1 score in urban traffic incident detection. The model also demonstrates its effectiveness in the open scenario test.

AB  - Renewable energy sources, on one hand, are environmentally friendly, but on the other, they suffer from volatility in power generation, which endangers power-grid stability. A viable solution to circumvent the intermittent behavior of renewables is the usage of energy-storage systems. In this paper, we study the energy management of a proof-of-concept system consisting of solar panels, energy-storage systems, a power grid, and household loads. Using neural networks, we identify the most relevant parameters impacting the power generation of solar panels, and then train the corresponding network to derive forecasts. We also go one step further, and propose a heuristics-based energy-management policy for the purpose of reducing curtailments. We show that our proposed policy outperforms the naive policy by 8%, which does not consider any power-generation forecasts.

All this was done along with the construction of a real system in a city, which hopefully resulted in a very comprehensive work in smart cities using sensors.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Most typical distribution networks are unbalanced due to unequal loading on each of the three phases and untransposed lines. In this paper, models and methods which can handle three-phase unbalanced scenarios are developed. The authors present a novel three-phase home energy management system to control both active and reactive power to provide per-phase optimization. Simplified single-phase algorithms are not sufficient to capture all the complexities a three-phase unbalance system poses. Distributed generators such as photo-voltaic systems, wind generators, and loads such as household electric and thermal demand connected to these networks directly depend on external factors such as weather, ambient temperature, and irradiation. They are also time dependent, containing daily, weekly, and seasonal cycles. Economic and phase-balanced operation of such generators and loads is very important to improve energy efficiency and maximize benefit while respecting consumer needs. Since homes and buildings are expected to consume a large share of electrical energy of a country, they are the ideal candidate to help solve these issues. The method developed will include typical distributed generation, loads, and various smart home models which were constructed using realistic models representing typical homes in Austria. A control scheme is provided which uses model predictive control with multi-objective mixed-integer quadratic programming to maximize self-consumption, user comfort and grid support.

AB  - Tiles are commonly used to cover the exteriors of buildings in Taiwan. However, older buildings in Taiwan encounter the problem of tiles falling off due to natural deterioration, which is unsightly, and more importantly, a threat to public safety. Nevertheless, no current method exists that can effectively detect flaws in building tiles in real time. This study combined the fields of civil engineering and automatic control to reduce risks caused by falling tiles by improving real-time detection of at-risk areas. Micro-resistance was combined with fuzzy theory as the logical foundation for evaluating tile status. String-type strain gauges were adopted as sensors to design a smart skin sensory system that could measure signs of deterioration in tile surface lesions. The design was found to be feasible. In the future, it can be further developed for facile real-time assessment of tile status.

AB  - The use of wearable and Internet-of-Things (IoT) for smart and affordable healthcare is trending. In traditional setups, the cloud backend receives the healthcare data and performs monitoring and prediction for diseases, diagnosis, and wellness prediction. Fog computing (FC) is a distributed computing paradigm that leverages low-power embedded processors in an intermediary node between the client layer and cloud layer. The diagnosis for wellness and fitness monitoring could be transferred to the fog layer from the cloud layer. Such a paradigm leads to a reduction in latency at an increased throughput. This paper processes a fog-based deep learning model, DeepFog that collects the data from individuals and predicts the wellness stats using a deep neural network model that can handle heterogeneous and multidimensional data. The three important abnormalities in wellness namely, (i) diabetes; (ii) hypertension attacks and (iii) stress type classification were chosen for experimental studies. We performed a detailed analysis of proposed models&rsquo; accuracy on standard datasets. The results validated the efficacy of the proposed system and architecture for accurate monitoring of these critical wellness and fitness criteria. We used standard datasets and open source software tools for our experiments.

AB  - This work focuses on fuzzy data processing in control and decision-making systems based on the transformation of real-timeseries and high-frequency data to fuzzy sets with further implementation of diverse fuzzy arithmetic operations. Special attention was paid to the synthesis of the computational library of horizontal and vertical analytic models for fuzzy sets as the results of fuzzy arithmetic operations. The usage of the developed computational library allows increasing the operating speed and accuracy of fuzzy data processing in real time. A computational library was formed for computing of such fuzzy arithmetic operations as fuzzy-maximum. Fuzzy sets as components of fuzzy data processing were chosen as triangular fuzzy numbers. The analytic models were developed based on the analysis of the intersection points between left and right branches of considered triangular fuzzy numbers with different relations between their parameters. Our study introduces the mask for the evaluation of the relations between corresponding parameters of fuzzy numbers that allows to determine the appropriate model from the computational library in automatic mode. The simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed computational library for different applications.

AB  - Current studies show that traditional deterministic models tend to struggle to capture the non-linear relationship between the concentration of air pollutants and their sources of emission and dispersion. To tackle such a limitation, the most promising approach is to use statistical models based on machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, it is puzzling why a certain algorithm is chosen over another for a given task. This systematic review intends to clarify this question by providing the reader with a comprehensive description of the principles underlying these algorithms and how they are applied to enhance prediction accuracy. A rigorous search that conforms to the PRISMA guideline is performed and results in the selection of the 46 most relevant journal papers in the area. Through a factorial analysis method these studies are synthetized and linked to each other. The main findings of this literature review show that: (i) machine learning is mainly applied in Eurasian and North American continents and (ii) estimation problems tend to implement Ensemble Learning and Regressions, whereas forecasting make use of Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The next challenges of this approach are to improve the prediction of pollution peaks and contaminants recently put in the spotlights (e.g., nanoparticles).

AB  - Renewable energy systems (RES) are reliable by nature; the sun and wind are theoretically endless resources. From the beginnings of the power systems, the concern was to know &ldquo;how much&rdquo; energy will be generated. Initially, there were voltmeters and power meters; nowadays, there are much more advanced solar controllers, with small displays and built-in modules that handle big data. Usually, large photovoltaic (PV)-battery systems have sophisticated energy management strategies in order to operate unattended. By adding the information collected by sensors managed with powerful technologies such as big data and analytics, the system is able to efficiently react to environmental factors and respond to consumers&rsquo; requirements in real time. According to the weather parameters, the output of PV could be symmetric, supplying an asymmetric electricity demand. Thus, a smart adaptive switching module that includes a forecasting component is proposed to improve the symmetry between the PV output and daily load curve. A scaling approach for smaller off-grid systems that provides an accurate forecast of the PV output based on data collected from sensors is developed. The proposed methodology is based on sensor implementation in RES operation and big data technologies are considered for data processing and analytics. In this respect, we analyze data captured from loggers and forecast the PV output with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and linear regression, finding that Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for prediction is considerably improved when using more parameters in the machine learning process.

AB  - Traffic jams can be avoided by controlling traffic signals according to quickly building congestion with steep gradients on short temporal and small spatial scales. With the rising standards of computational technology, single-board computers, software packages, platforms, and APIs (Application Program Interfaces), it has become relatively easy for developers to create systems for controlling signals and informative systems. Hence, for enhancing the power of Intelligent Transport Systems in automotive telematics, in this study, we used crowdsourced traffic congestion data from Google to adjust traffic light cycle times with a system that is adaptable to congestion. One aim of the system proposed here is to inform drivers about the status of the upcoming traffic light on their route. Since crowdsourced data are used, the system does not entail the high infrastructure cost associated with sensing networks. A full system module-level analysis is presented for implementation. The system proposed is fail-safe against temporal communication failure. Along with a case study for examining congestion levels, generic information processing for the cycle time decision and status delivery system was tested and confirmed to be viable and quick for a restricted prototype model. The information required was delivered correctly over sustained trials, with an average time delay of 1.5 s and a maximum of 3 s.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - Freight transportation is becoming an increasingly critical activity for enterprises in a global world. Moreover, the distribution activities have a non-negligible impact on the environment, as well as on the citizens&rsquo; welfare. The classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) aims at designing routes that minimize the cost of serving customers using a given set of capacitated vehicles. Some VRP variants consider traveling times, either in the objective function (e.g., including the goal of minimizing total traveling time or designing balanced routes) or as constraints (e.g., the setting of time windows or a maximum time per route). Typically, the traveling time between two customers or between one customer and the depot is assumed to be both known in advance and static. However, in real life, there are plenty of factors (predictable or not) that may affect these traveling times, e.g., traffic jams, accidents, road works, or even the weather. In this work, we analyze the VRP with dynamic traveling times. Our work assumes not only that these inputs are dynamic in nature, but also that they are a function of the structure of the emerging routing plan. In other words, these traveling times need to be dynamically re-evaluated as the solution is being constructed. In order to solve this dynamic optimization problem, a learnheuristic-based approach is proposed. Our approach integrates statistical learning techniques within a metaheuristic framework. A number of computational experiments are carried out in order to illustrate our approach and discuss its effectiveness.

AB  - More and more countries and utilities are trying to develop smart grid projects to make transformation of their power infrastructure towards future grids with increased share of renewable energy production and near zero emissions. The intermittent nature of solar and wind power can in general cause large problems for power system control. Parallel to this process, the aging of existing infrastructure also imposes requirements to utility budgets in the form of a need for large capital investments in reconstruction or maintenance of key equipment. Synchrophasor and other synchronized measurement technologies are setting themselves as one of the solutions for larger wind power integration. With that aim, in this paper one possible solution for wind power control through data mining algorithms used on a large quantity of data gathered from phasor measurement units (PMU) is described. Developed model and algorithm are tested on an IEEE 14 bus test system as well as on real measurements made on wind power plants currently in operation. One such wind power plant is connected to the distribution grid and the other one to the transmission grid. Results are analyzed and compared.

Miniature integrated artificial neural networks (ANN) applied directly in the sensor can take over the analysis of data collected from the environment, thus reducing amount of data sent over the RF communication block. A prototype specialized chip with components of the ANN was designed in the CMOS 130 nm technology. An adaptation mechanism and a programmable multi-phase clock generator&mdash;components of the ANN&mdash;are described in more detail. Both simulation and measurement results of selected blocks are presented to demonstrate the correctness of the design.

TI  - Coarse-to-Fine Adaptive People Detection for Video Sequences by Maximizing Mutual Information †

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Applying people detectors to unseen data is challenging since patterns distributions, such as viewpoints, motion, poses, backgrounds, occlusions and people sizes, may significantly differ from the ones of the training dataset. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework to adapt frame by frame people detectors during runtime classification, without requiring any additional manually labeled ground truth apart from the offline training of the detection model. Such adaptation make use of multiple detectors mutual information, i.e., similarities and dissimilarities of detectors estimated and agreed by pair-wise correlating their outputs. Globally, the proposed adaptation discriminates between relevant instants in a video sequence, i.e., identifies the representative frames for an adaptation of the system. Locally, the proposed adaptation identifies the best configuration (i.e., detection threshold) of each detector under analysis, maximizing the mutual information to obtain the detection threshold of each detector. The proposed coarse-to-fine approach does not require training the detectors for each new scenario and uses standard people detector outputs, i.e., bounding boxes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art detectors whose optimal threshold configurations are previously determined and fixed from offline training data.

AB  - The fifth generation (5G) of wireless communication systems is considered the key technology to enable a wide range of application scenarios and the effective spreading of the smart city concept. Vertical business use cases, specifically designed for the future 5G city, will have a strong economical and social impact. For this reason, ongoing 5G field trials have to test newly deployed technologies as well as the capability of 5G to create a new digital economy. This paper describes the 5G field trial environment that was launched in Italy at the end of 2017. The aim is to evaluate the capability of the 5G network of supporting innovative services with reference to suitably designed key performance indicators and to evaluate the opportunities offered by these services. Indeed, vertical business use cases, specifically designed for the future 5G city, with a strong economic and social impact, are under implementation and will be evaluated. In particular, the paper provides a detailed description of the deployment of an actual complete integrated 5G network. It shows how 5G is effective enabling technology for a wide range of vertical business and use cases. Indeed, its flexibility allows to satisfy completely different performance requirements of real services. Some preliminary results, obtained during the first phase, are presented for a smart mobility scenario.

VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SN  - 2411-9660

AB  - To be able to provide appropriate services in social and human application contexts, smart cyber-physical systems (S-CPSs) need ampliative reasoning and decision-making (ARDM) mechanisms. As one option, procedural abduction (PA) is suggested for self-managing S-CPSs. PA is a knowledge-based computation and learning mechanism. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive description of the computational framework proposed for PA. Towards this end, first the essence of smart cyber-physical systems is discussed. Then, the main recent research results related to computational abduction and ampliative reasoning are discussed. PA facilitates beliefs-driven contemplation of the momentary performance of S-CPSs, including a &lsquo;best option&rsquo;-based setting of the servicing objective and realization of any demanded adaptation. The computational framework of PA includes eight clusters of computational activities: (i) run-time extraction of signals and data by sensing, (ii) recognition of events, (iii) inferring about existing situations, (iv) building awareness of the state and circumstances of operation, (v) devising alternative performance enhancement strategies, (vi) deciding on the best system adaptation, (vii) devising and scheduling the implied interventions, and (viii) actuating effectors and controls. Several cognitive algorithms and computational actions are used to implement PA in a compositional manner. PA necessitates not only a synergic interoperation of the algorithms, but also an objective-dependent fusion of the pre-programmed and the run time acquired chunks of knowledge. A fully fledged implementation of PA is underway, which will make verification and validation possible in the context of various smart CPSs.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) contains sets of hundreds of thousands of network-enabled devices communicating with central controlling nodes or information collectors. The correct behaviour of these devices can be monitored by inspecting the traffic that they create. This passive monitoring methodology allows the detection of device failures or security breaches. However, the creation of hundreds of thousands of traffic time series in real time is not achievable without highly optimised algorithms. We herein compare three algorithms for time-series extraction from traffic captured in real time. We demonstrate how a single-core central processing unit (CPU) can extract more than three bidirectional traffic time series for each one of more than 20,000 IoT devices in real time using the algorithm DStries with recursive search. This proposal also enables the fast reconfiguration of the analysis computer when new IoT devices are added to the network.

TI  - Prediction of Hourly Effect of Land Use on Crime
T2  - ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Predicting the exact urban places where crime is most likely to occur is one of the greatest interests for Police Departments. Therefore, the goal of the research presented in this paper is to identify specific urban areas where a crime could happen in Manhattan, NY for every hour of a day. The outputs from this research are the following: (i) predicted land uses that generates the top three most committed crimes in Manhattan, by using machine learning (random forest and logistic regression), (ii) identifying the exact hours when most of the assaults are committed, together with hot spots during these hours, by applying time series and hot spot analysis, (iii) built hourly prediction models for assaults based on the land use, by deploying logistic regression. Assault, as a physical attack on someone, according to criminal law, is identified as the third most committed crime in Manhattan. Land use (residential, commercial, recreational, mixed use etc.) is assigned to every area or lot in Manhattan, determining the actual use or activities within each particular lot. While plotting assaults on the map for every hour, this investigation has identified that the hot spots where assaults occur were ‘moving’ and not confined to specific lots within Manhattan. This raises a number of questions: Why are hot spots of assaults not static in an urban environment? What makes them ‘move’—is it a particular urban pattern? Is the ‘movement’ of hot spots related to human activities during the day and night? Answering these questions helps to build the initial frame for assault prediction within every hour of a day. Knowing a specific land use vulnerability to assault during each exact hour can assist the police departments to allocate forces during those hours in risky areas. For the analysis, the study is using two datasets: a crime dataset with geographical locations of crime, date and time, and a geographic dataset about land uses with land use codes for every lot, each obtained from open databases. The study joins two datasets based on the spatial location and classifies data into 24 classes, based on the time range when the assault occurred. Machine learning methods reveal the effect of land uses on larceny, harassment and assault, the three most committed crimes in Manhattan. Finally, logistic regression provides hourly prediction models and unveils the type of land use where assaults could occur during each hour for both day and night.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Nowadays, the sensor community has become wireless, increasing their potential and applications. In particular, these emerging technologies are promising for vehicles&rsquo; communications (V2V) to dramatically reduce the number of fatal roadway accidents by providing early warnings. The ECMA-368 wireless communication standard has been developed and used in wireless sensor networks and it is also proposed to be used in vehicular networks. It adopts Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) technology to transmit data. However, the large power envelope fluctuation of OFDM signals limits the power efficiency of the High Power Amplifier (HPA) due to nonlinear distortion. This is especially important for mobile broadband wireless and sensors in vehicular networks. Many algorithms have been proposed for solving this drawback. However, complexity and implementations are usually an issue in real developments. In this paper, the implementation of a novel architecture based on multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip is evaluated and some guidelines are drawn suitable for vehicular communications. The proposed implementation improves performance in terms of Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) reduction, distortion and Bit Error Rate (BER) with much lower complexity. Two different chips have been used, namely, Xilinx and Altera and a comparison is also provided. As a conclusion, the proposed implementation allows a minimal consumption of the resources jointly with a higher maximum frequency, higher performance and lower complexity.

AB  - By nature, some jobs are always in closed environments and employees may stay for long periods. This is the case for many professional activities such as military watch tours of borders, civilian buildings and facilities that need efficient control processes. The role assigned to personnel in such environments is usually sensitive and of high importance, especially in terms of security and protection. With this in mind, we proposed in our research a novel approach using multi-sensor technology to monitor many safety and security parameters including the health status of indoor workers, such as those in watchtowers and at guard posts. In addition, the data gathered for those employees (heart rate, temperature, eye movement, human motion, etc.) combined with the room’s sensor data (temperature, oxygen ratio, toxic gases, air quality, etc.) were saved by appropriate cloud services, which ensured easy access to the data without ignoring the privacy protection aspect of such critical material. This information can be used later by specialists to monitor the evolution of the worker’s health status as well as its cost-effectiveness, which gives the possibility to improve productivity in the workplace and general employee health.

AB  - With the increase of population density and the rural exodus to cities, urbanization is assuming extreme proportions and presents a tremendous urban problem related to waste generation. The increase of waste generation has been considered a significant challenge to large urban centers worldwide and represents a critical issue for countries with accelerated population growth in cities. The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing offer an automation possibility through cyberphysical systems that will change the way solid waste management is performed. Considering IoT requirements, a review analysis of waste management models available in the literature is performed in detail in this paper. Then, a deep review is undertaken of the related literature based on IoT infrastructure for efficient handling of waste generated in urban scenarios, focusing on the interaction among concessionaires and waste generators (citizens) from the perspective of a shorter collection time with reduced costs, as well as citizenship promotion. An IoT-based reference model is described, and a comparison analysis of the available solutions is presented, with the goal to highlight the most relevant approaches and identify open research issues on the topic.

AB  - We describe the sentiment analysis experiments that were performed on the Lithuanian Internet comment dataset using traditional machine learning (Na&iuml;ve Bayes Multinomial&mdash;NBM and Support Vector Machine&mdash;SVM) and deep learning (Long Short-Term Memory&mdash;LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network&mdash;CNN) approaches. The traditional machine learning techniques were used with the features based on the lexical, morphological, and character information. The deep learning approaches were applied on the top of two types of word embeddings (Vord2Vec continuous bag-of-words with negative sampling and FastText). Both traditional and deep learning approaches had to solve the positive/negative/neutral sentiment classification task on the balanced and full dataset versions. The best deep learning results (reaching 0.706 of accuracy) were achieved on the full dataset with CNN applied on top of the FastText embeddings, replaced emoticons, and eliminated diacritics. The traditional machine learning approaches demonstrated the best performance (0.735 of accuracy) on the full dataset with the NBM method, replaced emoticons, restored diacritics, and lemma unigrams as features. Although traditional machine learning approaches were superior when compared to the deep learning methods; deep learning demonstrated good results when applied on the small datasets.

In practical experimental environments, there are 4525 records, 59 different base stations, and 582 different Wi-Fi access points detected in Fuzhou University in China. The lower location errors can be obtained by the recurrent neural networks with multiple consecutive timestamps (e.g., two timestamps and three timestamps); from the experimental results, it can be observed that the average error of location estimation was 9.19 m by the proposed mobile positioning method with two timestamps.

T2  - Algorithms

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - This paper proposes total optimization of energy networks in a smart city by multi-population global-best modified brain storm optimization (MP-GMBSO). Efficient utilization of energy is necessary for reduction of CO2 emission, and smart city demonstration projects have been conducted around the world in order to reduce total energies and the amount of CO2 emission. The problem can be formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and various evolutionary computation techniques such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), Differential Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (DEEPSO), Brain Storm Optimization (BSO), Modified BSO (MBSO), Global-best BSO (BSO), and Global-best Modified Brain Storm Optimization (GMBSO) have been applied to the problem. However, there is still room for improving solution quality. Multi-population based evolutionary computation methods have been verified to improve solution quality and the approach has a possibility for improving solution quality. The proposed MS-GMBSO utilizes only migration for multi-population models instead of abest, which is the best individual among all of sub-populations so far, and both migration and abest. Various multi-population models, migration topologies, migration policies, and the number of sub-populations are also investigated. It is verified that the proposed MP-GMBSO based method with ring topology, the W-B policy, and 320 individuals is the most effective among all of multi-population parameters.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) utilize a sensor network-based system to gather and interpret traffic information. In addition, mobility users utilize mobile applications to collect transport information for safe traveling. However, these types of information are not sufficient to examine all aspects of the transportation networks. Therefore, both ITSs and mobility users need a smart approach and social media data, which can help ITSs examine transport services, support traffic and control management, and help mobility users travel safely. People utilize social networks to share their thoughts and opinions regarding transportation, which are useful for ITSs and travelers. However, user-generated text on social media is short in length, unstructured, and covers a broad range of dynamic topics. The application of recent Machine Learning (ML) approach is inefficient for extracting relevant features from unstructured data, detecting word polarity of features, and classifying the sentiment of features correctly. In addition, ML classifiers consistently miss the semantic feature of the word meaning. A novel fuzzy ontology-based semantic knowledge with Word2vec model is proposed to improve the task of transportation features extraction and text classification using the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) approach. The proposed fuzzy ontology describes semantic knowledge about entities and features and their relation in the transportation domain. Fuzzy ontology and smart methodology are developed in Web Ontology Language and Java, respectively. By utilizing word embedding with fuzzy ontology as a representation of text, Bi-LSTM shows satisfactory improvement in both the extraction of features and the classification of the unstructured text of social media.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The importance of vacant parking space detection systems is increasing dramatically as the avoidance of traffic congestion and the time-consuming process of searching an empty parking space is a crucial problem for drivers in urban centers. However, the existing parking space occupancy detection systems are either hardware expensive or not well-generalized for varying images captured from different camera views. As a solution, we take advantage of an affordable visual detection method that is made possible by the fact that camera monitoring is already available in the majority of parking areas. However, the current problem is a challenging vision task because of outdoor lighting variation, perspective distortion, occlusions, different camera viewpoints, and the changes due to the various seasons of the year. To overcome these obstacles, we propose an approach based on Dilated Convolutional Neural Network specifically designed for detecting parking space occupancy in a parking lot, given only an image of a single parking spot as input. To evaluate our method and allow its comparison with previous strategies, we trained and tested it on well-known publicly available datasets, PKLot and CNRPark + EXT. In these datasets, the parking lot images are already labeled, and therefore, we did not need to label them manually. The proposed method shows more reliability than prior works especially when we test it on a completely different subset of images. Considering that in previous studies the performance of the methods was compared with well-known architecture&mdash;AlexNet, which shows a highly promising achievement, we also assessed our model in comparison with AlexNet. Our investigations showed that, in comparison with previous approaches, for the task of classifying given parking spaces as vacant or occupied, the proposed approach is more robust, stable, and well-generalized for unseen images captured from completely different camera viewpoints, which has strong indications that it would generalize effectively to other parking lots.

AB  - Numerous autonomous robots are used not only for factory automation as labor saving devices, but also for interaction and communication with humans in our daily life. Although superior compatibility for semantic recognition of generic objects provides wide applications in a practical use, it is still a challenging task to create an extraction method that includes robustness and stability against environmental changes. This paper proposes a novel method of scene and position recognition based on visual landmarks (VLs) used for an autonomous mobile robot in an environment living with humans. The proposed method provides a mask image of human regions using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG). The VL features are described with accelerated KAZE (AKAZE) after extracting conspicuous regions obtained using saliency maps (SMs). The experimentally obtained results using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) revealed that recognition accuracy of high-saliency feature points was higher than that of low-saliency feature points. We created our original benchmark datasets using a mobile robot. The recognition accuracy evaluated using LOOCV reveals 49.9% for our method, which is 3.2 percentage points higher than the accuracy of the comparison method without HOG detectors. The analysis of false recognition using a confusion matrix examines false recognition occurring in neighboring zones. This trend is reduced according to zone separations.

AB  - In this paper, a monitoring system of agricultural production is modeled as a Data Fusion System (data from local fairs and meteorological data). The proposal considers the particular information of sales in agricultural markets for knowledge extraction about the associations among them. This association knowledge is employed to improve predictions of sales using a spatial prediction technique, as shown with data collected from local markets of the Andean region of Ecuador. The commercial activity in these markets uses Alternative Marketing Circuits (CIALCO). This market platform establishes a direct relationship between producer and consumer prices and promotes direct commercial interaction among family groups. The problem is presented first as a general fusion problem with a network of spatially distributed heterogeneous data sources, and is then applied to the prediction of products sales based on association rules mined in available sales data. First, transactional data is used as the base to extract the best association rules between products sold in different local markets, knowledge that allows the system to gain a significant improvement in prediction accuracy in the spatial region considered.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Small-to-medium scale smart buildings are an important part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the major enabler for smart control in such environments. Reliability is among the key performance requirements for many loss-sensitive IoT and WSN applications, while Energy Consumption (EC) remains a primary concern in WSN design. Error-prone links, traffic intense applications, and limited physical resources make it challenging to meet these service goals&mdash;not only that these performance metrics often conflict with one another, but also require solving optimization problems, which are intrinsically NP-hard. Correctly forecasting Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and EC can play a significant role in different loss-sensitive application environments. With the ever-increasing availability of performance data, data-driven techniques are becoming popular in such settings. It is observed that a number of communication parameters like transmission power, packet size, etc., influence metrics like PDR and EC in diverse ways. In this work, different regression models including linear, gradient boosting, random forest, and deep learning are used for the purpose of predicting both PDR and EC based on such communication parameters. To evaluate the performance, a public dataset of the IEEE 802.15.4 network, containing measurements against more than 48,000 combinations of parameter configurations, is used. Results are evaluated using root mean square error and it turns out that deep learning achieves up to 98% accuracy for both PDR and EC predictions. These prediction results can help configure communication parameters taking into account the performance goals.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - During the past few years, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become widely used due to their large amount of applications. The use of WSNs is an imperative necessity for future revolutionary areas like ecological fields or smart cities in which more than hundreds or thousands of sensor nodes are deployed. In those large scale WSNs, hierarchical approaches improve the performance of the network and increase its lifetime. Hierarchy inside a WSN consists in cutting the whole network into sub-networks called clusters which are led by Cluster Heads. In spite of the advantages of the clustering on large WSNs, it remains a non-deterministic polynomial hard problem which is not solved efficiently by traditional clustering. The recent researches conducted on Machine Learning, Computational Intelligence, and WSNs bring out the optimized clustering algorithms for WSNs. These kinds of clustering are based on environmental behaviors and outperform the traditional clustering algorithms. However, due to the diversity of WSN applications, the choice of an appropriate paradigm for a clustering solution remains a problem. In this paper, we conduct a wide review of proposed optimized clustering solutions nowadays. In order to evaluate them, we consider 10 parameters. Based on these parameters, we propose a comparison of these optimized clustering approaches. From the analysis, we observe that centralized clustering solutions based on the Swarm Intelligence paradigm are more adapted for applications with low energy consumption, high data delivery rate, or high scalability than algorithms based on the other presented paradigms. Moreover, when an application does not need a large amount of nodes within a field, the Fuzzy Logic based solution are suitable.

AB  - European cities and communities (and beyond) require a structured overview and a set of tools as to achieve a sustainable transformation towards smarter cities/municipalities, thereby leveraging on the enormous potential of the emerging data driven economy. This paper presents the results of a recent study that was conducted with a number of German municipalities/cities. Based on the obtained and briefly presented recommendations emerging from the study, the authors propose the concept of an Urban Data Space (UDS), which facilitates an eco-system for data exchange and added value creation thereby utilizing the various types of data within a smart city/municipality. Looking at an Urban Data Space from within a German context and considering the current situation and developments in German municipalities, this paper proposes a reasonable classification of urban data that allows the relation of various data types to legal aspects, and to conduct solid considerations regarding technical implementation designs and decisions. Furthermore, the Urban Data Space is described/analyzed in detail, and relevant stakeholders are identified, as well as corresponding technical artifacts are introduced. The authors propose to setup Urban Data Spaces based on emerging standards from the area of ICT reference architectures for Smart Cities, such as DIN SPEC 91357 &ldquo;Open Urban Platform&rdquo; and EIP SCC. In the course of this, the paper walks the reader through the construction of a UDS based on the above-mentioned architectures and outlines all the goals, recommendations and potentials, which an Urban Data Space can reveal to a municipality/city. Finally, we aim at deriving the proposed concepts in a way that they have the potential to be part of the required set of tools towards the sustainable transformation of German and European cities in the direction of smarter urban environments, based on utilizing the hidden potential of digitalization and efficient interoperable data exchange.

AB  - The last decade has seen the development of complex IT systems to support city management, i.e., the creation of so-called intelligent cities. These systems include modules dedicated to particular branches of municipal economy, such as urban transport, heating systems, energy systems, telecommunications, and finally water and sewage management. In turn, with regard to the latter branch, IT systems supporting the management of water supply and sewage networks and sewage treatment plants are being developed. This paper deals with the system concerning the urban water supply network, and in particular, with the subsystem for detecting and locating leakages on the water supply network, including so-called hidden leakages. These leaks cause the greatest water losses in networks, especially in old ones, with a very diverse age and material structure. In the proposed concept of the subsystem consisting of a GIS (Geographical Information System), SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system and hydraulic model of the water supply network, an algorithm of leak detection and location based on the neural networks&rsquo; MLP (multi-layer perceptron) and Kohonen was developed. The algorithm has been tested on the hydraulic models of several municipal water supply networks.

AB  - Monitoring traffic states from the road is arousing increasing concern from traffic management authorities. To complete the picture of real-time traffic states, novel data sources have been introduced and studied in the transportation community for decades. This paper explores a supplementary and novel data source, Wi-Fi signal data, to extract traffic information through a well-designed system. An IoT (Internet of Things)-based Wi-Fi signal detector consisting of a solar power module, high capacity module, and IoT functioning module was constructed to collect Wi-Fi signal data. On this basis, a filtration and mining algorithm was developed to extract traffic state information (i.e., travel time, traffic volume, and speed). In addition, to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, a practical field test was conducted through the use of the system to monitor traffic states of a major corridor in China. The comparison results with loop data indicated that traffic speed obtained from the system was consistent with that collected from loop detectors. The mean absolute percentage error reached 3.55% in the best case. Furthermore, the preliminary analysis proved the existence of the highly correlated relationship between volumes obtained from the system and from loop detectors. The evaluation confirmed the feasibility of applying Wi-Fi signal data to acquisition of traffic information, indicating that Wi-Fi signal data could be used as a supplementary data source for monitoring real-time traffic states.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - With the increasing penetration of Internet of Things devices and distributed energy resources in the next-generation distribution network, the efficient energy management for system operation are facing new challenges. One reason is that the large-scale resources cannot be all connected to the supervisory control and data acquisition system, which have limited storage and computation capabilities. In order to adapt to the new energy management requirements of next-generation distribution networks, a state-of-the-art energy management method called cloud-fog hierarchical architecture is proposed in this work. Based on this architecture, we established a utility and revenue model for various stakeholders, including normal customers, prosumers, and distribution system operators. Furthermore, by embedding an artificial intelligence module in the proposed architecture, energy management could be implemented automatically. In this work, neural network are used at fog computing layers to achieve regression prediction of energy usage behavior and power source output. Moreover, based on the maximizing utility objective function, the amount of energy consumption of customers and prosumers in the distribution network was optimized with a genetic algorithm at cloud layer. The proposed methods were tested with a set of normal customers and prosumers in a general distribution network, and the results, including the captured usage patterns of the customers and revenues of various stakeholders, verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. This work provides an effective reference for the development of real-time energy management systems for the next-generation distribution network.

AB  - Indoor localization systems have already wide applications mainly for providing localized information and directions. The majority of them focus on commercial applications providing information such us advertisements, guidance and asset tracking. Medical oriented localization systems are uncommon. Given the fact that an individual&rsquo;s indoor movements can be indicative of his/her clinical status, in this paper we present a low-cost indoor localization system with room-level accuracy used to assess the frailty of older people. We focused on designing a system with easy installation and low cost to be used by non technical staff. The system was installed in older people houses in order to collect data about their indoor localization habits. The collected data were examined in combination with their frailty status, showing a correlation between them. The indoor localization system is based on the processing of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements by a tracking device, from Bluetooth Beacons, using a fingerprint-based procedure. The system has been tested in realistic settings achieving accuracy above 93% in room estimation. The proposed system was used in 271 houses collecting data for 1&ndash;7-day sessions. The evaluation of the collected data using ten-fold cross-validation showed an accuracy of 83% in the classification of a monitored person regarding his/her frailty status (Frail, Pre-frail, Non-frail).

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - An in-depth descriptive approach to the dynamics of the urban population is fundamental as a first step towards promoting effective planning and designing processes in cities. Understanding the behavioral aspects of human activities can contribute to their effective management and control. We present a framework, based on statistical methods, for studying the spatio-temporal distribution of geolocated tweets as a proxy for where and when people carry out their activities. We have evaluated our proposal by analyzing the distribution of collected geolocated tweets over a two-week period in the summer of 2017 in Lisbon, London, and Manhattan. Our proposal considers a negative binomial regression analysis for the time series of counts of tweets as a first step. We further estimate a functional principal component analysis of second-order summary statistics of the hourly spatial point patterns formed by the locations of the tweets. Finally, we find groups of hours with a similar spatial arrangement of places where humans develop their activities through hierarchical clustering over the principal scores. Social media events are found to show strong temporal trends such as seasonal variation due to the hour of the day and the day of the week in addition to autoregressive schemas. We have also identified spatio-temporal patterns of clustering, i.e., groups of hours of the day that present a similar spatial distribution of human activities.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting (STELF) through Data Analytics (DA) is an emerging and active research area. Forecasting about electricity load and price provides future trends and patterns of consumption. There is a loss in generation and use of electricity. So, multiple strategies are used to solve the aforementioned problems. Day-ahead electricity price and load forecasting are beneficial for both suppliers and consumers. In this paper, Deep Learning (DL) and data mining techniques are used for electricity load and price forecasting. XG-Boost (XGB), Decision Tree (DT), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Random Forest (RF) are used for feature selection and feature extraction. Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (ECNN) and Enhanced Support Vector Regression (ESVR) are used as classifiers. Grid Search (GS) is used for tuning of the parameters of classifiers to increase their performance. The risk of over-fitting is mitigated by adding multiple layers in ECNN. Finally, the proposed models are compared with different benchmark schemes for stability analysis. The performance metrics MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperformed other benchmark schemes. ECNN performed well with threshold 0.08 for load forecasting. While ESVR performed better with threshold value 0.15 for price forecasting. ECNN achieved almost 2% better accuracy than CNN. Furthermore, ESVR achieved almost 1% better accuracy than the existing scheme (SVR).

AB  - The Mamdani fuzzy inference method is one of the most important fuzzy logic control (FLC) techniques and has several applications in different fields. Despite its applications, the Mamdani fuzzy inference method has some core issues which still require solutions. The most critical issue is the selection of accurate shape and boundaries of membership functions (MFs) in the universe of discourse. In this work, we introduced a methodology called learning to control (LtC) to resolve the problem. The proposed methodology consisted of two main modules, namely, a control algorithm (CA) module and a learning algorithm (LA) module. In the CA module, the Mamdani FLC method has been used, whereas, in the LA module, we have used the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. Inputs into the ANN were the error difference between environmental temperature and the required temperature. The output of the ANN was the MF set to the FLC. Inputs into the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) were the error difference between environmental temperature and required temperature (D), and the output was the required power for the fan actuator. The purpose of the ANN was to tune the MFs of the FLC to improve its efficiency. The proposed learning-to-control method along with the conventional fuzzy logic controller method was applied to the data to evaluate the model&rsquo;s performance. The results indicate that the proposed model&rsquo;s performance is far better than that of conventional fuzzy logic techniques.

AB  - Intelligent farming is one of the vast range of applications covered by the Internet of Things concept. Notwithstanding, such applications present specific requirements and constraints that are dependent on their purpose. A practical case on which that is particularly relevant is the SheepIT project, where an automated IoT-based system controls grazing sheep within vineyards, guaranteeing that they do not threaten cultures. Due to its rigid requirements, particularly regarding the deployment of the Wireless Sensor Network, Machine-2-Machine communications and necessary interactions with a computational platform available through the Internet, Internet Protocol-based solutions are not suitable. Consequently, a customized communication stack has been developed, that intends to meet the project requirements, from the physical to the Application Layers. Although it has been developed considering the SheepIT requirements, its use may be extended to more generic intelligent farming applications, since most of the requirements are directly related with the farming environment. This paper reviews the proposed stack and details the recent developments. Particularly, we focused on Internet of Things/Machine-2-Machine interaction, describing the design and deployment of a gateway that addresses the SheepIT service requirements. Additionally, and complementary to previously published results, we evaluate the gateway performance and show its feasibility and scalability in a real scenario.

It is estimated that the number of connected devices to the internet will pass 35 billion by 2020. Further, there has also been a massive escalation in the amount of data collection tools as Internet of Things devices generate data which has big data characteristics known as five V (volume, velocity, variety, variability and value). This article reviews challenges, opportunities and research trends to address the issues related to the data era in three industries including smart cities, healthcare and transportation. All three of these industries could greatly benefit from machine learning and deep learning techniques on big data collected by the Internet of Things, which is named as the internet of everything to emphasise the role of connected devices for data collection.

TI  - Time-Aware Monitoring of Overhead Transmission Line Sag and Temperature with LoRa Communication
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The techniques of Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) for Overhead Transmission Line (OTL)&rsquo;s are currently dynamically developed. DLR systems typically rely on weather, temperature, inclination, and current measurements to calculate tension and sag, where sensors need to be installed directly on wires. Such systems are very reliable and ensure high accuracy in determining maximum allowable current. However, their installation may require switching off the transmission line from the operation. In order to receive precise values regarding the actual operating conditions of the whole transmission line, DLR sensors measuring wire temperature or tension should be installed at many points of OTL. The minimum number of installation points should cover at least each tension section and critical spans, thereby increasing installation costs. The alternative method that allows for the monitoring of OTL is the use of the vision system based on cameras. Installed on the OTLs&rsquo; poles, cameras can take photos which, appropriately processed, can provide data about the sag and temperature of wires, without the necessity of switching OTL from the operation for installation or further maintenance. Such a vision system facilitates also data transmission, because it does not require measurement data to be transmitted from the sensor station installed on the wire to the base station located on the pole (for instance, via radio). This article aims to present the concept of a vision system that monitors sag and temperature of Overhead Transmission Lines (OTLs)&rsquo; using Long Range (LoRa) wireless communication and data transmission. The developed system consists of a camera and a microcomputer equipped with LoRa communication module. The whole system monitors OTLs&rsquo; spans by taking photos, processing images for wire sag-temperature estimation, and sending results to the operator&rsquo;s Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA). The system communication architecture is also proposed and investigated for data transmission time when monitoring the whole OTL.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are becoming a common tool for aerial sensing applications. Nevertheless, sensed data need further processing before becoming useful information. This processing requires large computing power and time before delivery. In this paper, we present a parallel architecture that includes an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a small embedded computer on board, a communication link to the Internet, and a cloud service with the aim to provide useful real-time information directly to the end-users. The potential of parallelism as a solution in remote sensing has not been addressed for a distributed architecture that includes the UAV processors. The architecture is demonstrated for a specific problem: the counting of olive trees in a crop field where the trees are regularly spaced from each other. During the flight, the embedded computer is able to process individual images on board the UAV and provide the total count. The tree counting algorithm obtains an     F 1     score of     99.09 %     for a sequence of ten images with 332 olive trees. The detected trees are geolocated and can be visualized on the Internet seconds after the take-off of the flight, with no further processing required. This is a use case to demonstrate near real-time results obtained from UAS usage. Other more complex UAS applications, such as tree inventories, search and rescue, fire detection, or stock breeding, can potentially benefit from this architecture and obtain faster outcomes, accessible while the UAV is still on flight.

AB  - The automation of the Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) task aims for high levels of understanding of various scenery. In addition, working in unfriendly and complex environments may cause a time delay in the operation and consequently put human lives at stake. In order to address this problem, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which provide potential support to the conventional methods, are used. These vehicles are provided with reliable human detection and tracking algorithms; in order to be able to find and track the bodies of the victims in complex environments, and a robust control system to maintain safe distances from the detected bodies. In this paper, a human detection based on the color and depth data captured from onboard sensors is proposed. Moreover, the proposal of computing data association from the skeleton pose and a visual appearance measurement allows the tracking of multiple people with invariance to the scale, translation and rotation of the point of view with respect to the target objects. The system has been validated with real and simulation experiments, and the obtained results show the ability to track multiple individuals even after long-term disappearances. Furthermore, the simulations present the robustness of the implemented reactive control system as a promising tool for assisting the pilot to perform approaching maneuvers in a safe and smooth manner.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 2
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - The automated process of construction defect detection using non-contact methods provides vital information for quality control and updating building information modelling. The external cladding in modular construction should be regularly controlled in terms of the quality of panels and proper installation because its appearance is very important for clients. However, there are limited computational methods for examining the installation issues of external cladding remotely in an automated manner. These issues could be the incorrect sitting of a panel, unequal joints in an elevation, scratches or cracks on the face of a panel or dimensions of different elements of external cladding. This paper aims to present seven algorithms to detect panel edges and statistically compare their performance through application on two scenarios of buildings in construction sites. Two different scenarios are selected, where the building fa&ccedil;ades are available to the public, and a sample of 100 images is taken using a state-of-the-art 3D camera for edge detection analysis. The experimentation results are validated by using a series of computational error and accuracy analyses and statistical methods including Mean Square Error, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index. The performance of an image processing algorithm depends on the quality of images and the algorithm utilised. The results show better performance of the fuzzy logic algorithm because it detects clear edges for installed panels. The applications of classical operators including Sobel, Canny, LoG, Prewitt and Roberts algorithms give similar results and show similarities in terms of the average of errors and accuracy. In addition, the results show that the minor difference of the average of the error and accuracy indices for Sobel, Canny, LoG, Prewitt and Roberts methods between both scenarios are not statistically significant, while the difference in the average of the error and accuracy indices for RGB-Sobel and Fuzzy methods between both scenarios are statistically significant. The accuracy of the algorithms can be improved by removing unwanted items such as vegetation and clouds in the sky. The evaluated algorithms assist practitioners to analyse their images collected day to day from construction sites, and to update building information modelling and the project digital drawings. Future work may need to focus on the combination of the evaluated algorithms using new data sets including colour edge detection for automatic defect identification using RGB and 360-degree images.

VL  - 8
IS  - 2
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - This paper presents a QoS-aware, content-aware and device-aware nonintrusive medical QoE (m-QoE) prediction model over small cell networks. The proposed prediction model utilises a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to predict m-QoE. It also acts as a platform to maintain and optimise the acceptable diagnostic quality through a device-aware adaptive video streaming mechanism. The proposed model is trained for an unseen dataset of input variables such as QoS, content features and display device characteristics, to produce an output value in the form of m-QoE (i.e. MOS). The efficiency of the proposed model is validated through subjective tests carried by medical experts. The prediction accuracy obtained via the correlation coefficient and Root Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) indicates that the proposed model succeeds in measuring m-QoE closer to the visual perception of the medical experts. Furthermore, we have addressed two main research questions: (1) How significant is ultrasound video content type in determining m-QoE? (2) How much of a role does the screen size and device resolution play in medical experts&rsquo; diagnostic experience? The former is answered through the content classification of ultrasound video sequences based on their spatiotemporal features, by including these features in the proposed prediction model, and validating their significance through medical experts&rsquo; subjective ratings. The latter is answered by conducting a novel subjective experiment of the ultrasound video sequences across multiple devices.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Low-cost air pollution wireless sensors are emerging in densely distributed networks that provide more spatial resolution than typical traditional systems for monitoring ambient air quality. This paper presents an air quality measurement system that is composed of a distributed sensor network connected to a cloud system forming a wireless sensor network (WSN). Sensor nodes are based on low-power ZigBee motes, and transmit field measurement data to the cloud through a gateway. An optimized cloud computing system has been implemented to store, monitor, process, and visualize the data received from the sensor network. Data processing and analysis is performed in the cloud by applying artificial intelligence techniques to optimize the detection of compounds and contaminants. This proposed system is a low-cost, low-size, and low-power consumption method that can greatly enhance the efficiency of air quality measurements, since a great number of nodes could be deployed and provide relevant information for air quality distribution in different areas. Finally, a laboratory case study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed system for the detection of some common volatile organic compounds, including: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. Principal component analysis, a multilayer perceptron with backpropagation learning algorithm, and support vector machine have been applied for data processing. The results obtained suggest good performance in discriminating and quantifying the concentration of the volatile organic compounds.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - This paper focuses on analytics of an extremely large dataset of smart grid electricity price and load, which is difficult to process with conventional computational models. These data are known as energy big data. The analysis of big data divulges the deeper insights that help experts in the improvement of smart grid&rsquo;s (SG) operations. Processing and extracting of meaningful information from data is a challenging task. Electricity load and price are the most influential factors in the electricity market. For improving reliability, control and management of electricity market operations, an exact estimate of the day ahead load is a substantial requirement. Energy market trade is based on price. Accurate price forecast enables energy market participants to make effective and most profitable bidding strategies. This paper proposes a deep learning-based model for the forecast of price and demand for big data using Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM). Due to the adaptive and automatic feature learning mechanism of Deep Neural Network (DNN), the processing of big data is easier with LSTM as compared to the purely data-driven methods. The proposed model was evaluated using well-known real electricity markets&rsquo; data. In this study, day and week ahead forecasting experiments were conducted for all months. Forecast performance was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). The proposed Deep LSTM (DLSTM) method was compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) time series forecasting methods, i.e., Nonlinear Autoregressive network with Exogenous variables (NARX) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). DLSTM outperformed the compared forecasting methods in terms of accuracy. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method for electricity price and load forecasting.

AB  - The traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has evolved towards intelligent IoT applications which exploit knowledge produced by IoT devices using artificial intelligence techniques. Knowledge sharing between IoT devices is a challenging issue in this trend. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge of Things (KoT) framework which enables sharing self-taught knowledge between IoT devices which require similar or identical knowledge without help from the cloud. The proposed KoT framework allows an IoT device to effectively produce, cumulate, and share its self-taught knowledge with other devices at the edge in the vicinity. This framework can alleviate behavioral repetition in users and computational redundancy in systems in intelligent IoT applications. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we examine a smart home case study and build a prototype of the KoT framework-based smart home system. Experimental results show that the proposed KoT framework reduces the response time to use intelligent IoT devices from a user&rsquo;s perspective and the power consumption for compuation from a system&rsquo;s perspective.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Building Automation (BA) is key to encourage the growth of more sustainable cities and smart homes. However, current BA systems are not able to manage new constructions based on Adaptable/Dynamic Building Envelopes (ADBE) achieving near-zero energy-efficiency. The ADBE buildings integrate Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Envelope Retrofitting (ER) that must be managed by new BA systems based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) through secure protocols. This paper presents the PLUG-N-HARVEST architecture based on cloud AI systems and security-by-design IoT networks to manage near-zero ADBE constructions in both residential and commercial buildings. To demonstrate the PLUG-N-HARVEST architecture, three different real-world pilots have been considered in Germany, Greece and Spain. The paper describes the Spain pilot of residential buildings including the deployment of IoT wireless networks (i.e., sensors and actuators) based on Zwave technology to enable plug-and-play installations. The real-world tests showed the high efficiency of security-by-design Internet communications between building equipment and cloud management systems. Moreover, the results of cloud intelligent management demonstrate the improvements in both energy consumption and comfort conditions.

TI  - Towards a Persuasive Recommender for Bike Sharing Systems: A Defeasible Argumentation Approach
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This work proposes a persuasion model based on argumentation theory and users&rsquo; characteristics for improving the use of resources in bike sharing systems, fostering the use of the bicycles and thus contributing to greater energy sustainability by reducing the use of carbon-based fuels. More specifically, it aims to achieve a balanced network of pick-up and drop-off stations in urban areas with the help of the users, thus reducing the dedicated management trucks that redistribute bikes among stations. The proposal aims to persuade users to choose different routes from the shortest route between a start and an end location. This persuasion is carried out when it is not possible to park the bike in the desired station due to the lack of parking slots, or when the user is highly influenceable. Differently to other works, instead of employing a single criteria to recommend alternative stations, the proposed system can incorporate a variety of criteria. This result is achieved by providing a defeasible logic-based persuasion engine that is capable of aggregating the results from multiple recommendation rules. The proposed framework is showcased with an example scenario of a bike sharing system.

AB  - Smart cities (SC) promote economic development, improve the welfare of their citizens, and help in the ability of people to use technologies to build sustainable services. However, computational methods are necessary to assist in the process of creating smart cities because they are fundamental to the decision-making process, assist in policy making, and offer improved services to citizens. As such, the aim of this research is to present a systematic review regarding data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) approaches adopted in the promotion of smart cities. The Methodi Ordinatio was used to find relevant articles and the VOSviewer software was performed for a network analysis. Thirty-nine significant articles were identified for analysis from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, in which we analyzed the DM and ML techniques used, as well as the areas that are most engaged in promoting smart cities. Predictive analytics was the most common technique and the studies focused primarily on the areas of smart mobility and smart environment. This study seeks to encourage approaches that can be used by governmental agencies and companies to develop smart cities, being essential to assist in the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSN) involve large number of sensor nodes distributed at diverse locations. The collected data are prone to be inaccurate and faulty due to internal or external influences, such as, environmental interference or sensor aging. Intelligent failure detection is necessary for the effective functioning of the sensor network. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning method that is named artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN), to predict temperature in a remote location and detect failures in sensors. It allows predicting the temperature and detecting failure in sensor node of remote locations using information from a web service comparing it with field temperature sensors. For experimentation, we implemented a small WSN to test our sensor in order to measure failure detection, identification and accommodation proposal. In our experiments, 94.18% of the testing data were recovered and accommodated allowing of validation our proposed approach that is based on AHN, which detects, identify and accommodate sensor failures accurately.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The improvement of stable, energy-efficient mobile-based clustering and routing protocols in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has become indispensable so as to develop large-scale, versitale, and adaptive applications. Data is gathered more efficiently and the total path length is shortened optimally by means of mobile sink (MS). Two algorithms as bacterial interaction based cluster head (CH) selection and energy and transmission boundary range cognitive routing algorithm with novel approach for heterogeneous mobile networks are proposed in this study. The more reliable and powerful CH selection is made with the greedy approach that is based on the interaction fitness value, energy node degree, and distance to adjacent nodes in a compromised manner. The best trajectories, thanks to intersection edge points of the visited CHs, are obtained in the proposed routing algorithm. In this way, the MS entry to transmission range boundaries of the CH has been a sufficient strategy to collect information. As in energy model, we adopt energy consumption costs of listening and sensing channel as well as transmit and receive costs. Comprehensive performance analyzes have been seriously carried out via the Matlab 2016a environment. We validate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing studies in terms of several performance metrics as simulations.

AB  - The Sensing as a Service is emerging as a new Internet of Things (IoT) business model for sensors and data sharing in the cloud. Under this paradigm, a resource allocation model for the assignment of both sensors and cloud resources to clients/applications is proposed. This model, contrarily to previous approaches, is adequate for emerging IoT Sensing as a Service business models supporting multi-sensing applications and mashups of Things in the cloud. A heuristic algorithm is also proposed having this model as a basis. Results show that the approach is able to incorporate strategies that lead to the allocation of fewer devices, while selecting the most adequate ones for application needs.

AB  - Many researchers and product developers are striving toward achieving ICT-enabled independence of older adults by setting up Enhanced Living Environments (ELEs). Technological solutions, which are often based on the Internet of Things (IoT), show great potential in providing support for Active Aging. To enhance the quality of life for older adults and overcome challenges in enabling individuals to achieve their full potential in terms of physical, social, and mental well-being, numerous proof-of-concept systems have been built. These systems, often labeled as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), vary greatly in targeting different user needs. This paper presents our contribution using SmartHabits, which is an intelligent privacy-aware home care assistance system. The novel system comprising smart home-based and cloud-based parts uses machine-learning technology to provide peace of mind to informal caregivers caring for persons living alone. It does so by learning the user&rsquo;s typical daily activity patterns and automatically issuing warnings if an unusual situation is detected. The system was designed and implemented from scratch, building upon existing practices from IoT reference architecture and microservices. The system was deployed in several homes of real users for six months, and we will be sharing our findings in this paper.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - On-demand shared mobility is increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to address urban transport challenges in large and fast-growing cities. The appeal of this form of transport is largely attributed to its convenience, ease of use, and affordability made possible through digital platforms and innovations. The convergence of the shared economy with a number of established and emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud and Fog computing—is helping to expedite their deployment as a new form of public transport. Recently, this has manifested itself in the form of Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMoD) solutions, aimed at meeting personal travel demands through flexible routing and scheduling. Increasingly, these shared mobility solutions are blurring the boundaries with existing forms of public transport, particularly bus operations. This paper presents an environmental scan and analysis of the technological, social, and economic impacts surrounding disruptive technology-driven shared mobility trends. Specifically, the paper includes an examination of current and anticipated external factors that are of direct relevance to collaborative and low carbon mobility. The paper also outlines how these trends are likely to influence the mobility industries now and into the future. The paper collates information from a wide body of literature and reports on findings from actual ‘use cases’ that exist today which have used these disruptive mobility solutions to deliver substantial benefits to travellers around the world. Finally, the paper provides stakeholders with insight into identifying and responding to the likely needs and impacts of FMoD and informs their policy and strategy positions on the implementation of smart mobility systems in their cities and jurisdictions.

VL  - 12

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In view of the existing verification methods of electric meters, there are problems such as high maintenance cost, poor accuracy, and difficulty in full coverage, etc. Starting from the perspective of analyzing the large-scale measured data collected by user-side electric meters, an online estimation method for the operating error of electric meters was proposed, which uses the recursive least squares (RLS) and introduces a double-parameter method with dynamic forgetting factors &lambda;a and &lambda;b to track the meter parameters changes in real time. Firstly, the obtained measured data are preprocessed, and the abnormal data such as null data and light load data are eliminated by an appropriate clustering method, so as to screen out the measured data of the similar operational states of each user. Then equations relating the head electric meter in the substation and each users&rsquo; electric meter and line loss based on the law of conservation of electric energy are established. Afterwards, the recursive least squares algorithm with double-parameter is used to estimate the parameters of line loss and the electric meter error. Finally, the effects of double dynamic forgetting factors, double constant forgetting factors and single forgetting factor on the accuracy of estimated error of electric meter are discussed. Through the program-controlled load simulation system, the proposed method is verified with higher accuracy and practicality.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recently, vehicular networks have emerged to facilitate intelligent transportation systems (ITS). They enable vehicles to communicate with each other in order to provide various services such as traffic safety, autonomous driving, and entertainments. The vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication channel is doubly selective, where the channel changes within the transmission bandwidth and the frame duration. This necessitates robust algorithms to provide reliable V2V communications. In this paper, we propose a scheme that provides joint adaptive modulation, coding and payload length selection (AMCPLS) for V2V communications. Our AMCPLS scheme selects both the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and the payload length of transmission frames for V2V communication links, according to the V2V channel condition. Our aim is to achieve both reliability and spectrum efficiency. Our proposed AMCPLS scheme improves the V2V effective throughput performance while satisfying a predefined frame error rate (FER). Furthermore, we present a deep learning approach that exploits deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for implementing the proposed AMCPLS. Simulation results reveal that the proposed DCNN-based AMCPLS approach outperforms other competing machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and support vector machines (SVM) in terms of FER, effective throughput, and prediction time.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - To effectively maintain and analyze a large amount of real-time sensor data, one often uses a filtering technique that reflects characteristics of original data well. This paper proposes a novel method for recommending the measurement noise for Kalman filtering, which is one of the most representative filtering techniques. Kalman filtering corrects inaccurate values of input sensor data, and its filtering performance varies depending on the input noise parameters. In particular, if the noise parameters determined based on the user&rsquo;s experience are incorrect, the accuracy of Kalman filtering may be reduced significantly. Based on this observation, this paper addresses how to determine the measurement noise variance, a major input parameter of Kalman filtering, by analyzing past sensor data and how to use the estimated noise to improve the filtering accuracy. More specifically, to estimate the measurement noise variance, two analytical methods are proposed: one a transform-based method using a wavelet transform and the other a learning-based method using a denoising autoencoder. Experimental results show that the proposed methods estimated the measurement noise variance accurately and were superior to the experience-based method in the filtering accuracy.

However, most of them are very expensive or do not have the ideal characteristics for good monitoring of a particular photovoltaic installation. For these reasons, an electronic device connected to the internet of things (IoT) is presented in this paper which manages to measure global radiation in photovoltaic applications. The device developed has been patented in the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office. It presents some features that make it very suitable to measure photovoltaic installations with the advantage of being a low cost and very reliable device.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - In recent years, due to the unnecessary wastage of electrical energy in residential buildings, the requirement of energy optimization and user comfort has gained vital importance. In the literature, various techniques have been proposed addressing the energy optimization problem. The goal of each technique is to maintain a balance between user comfort and energy requirements, such that the user can achieve the desired comfort level with the minimum amount of energy consumption. Researchers have addressed the issue with the help of different optimization algorithms and variations in the parameters to reduce energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved yet due to its challenging nature. The gaps in the literature are due to advancements in technology, the drawbacks of optimization algorithms, and the introduction of new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly proposed optimization algorithms have produced better accuracy on the benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. Detailed discussion has been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort, visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge computing techniques used in smart homes.

TI  - Towards Semantic Sensor Data: An Ontology Approach
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In order to optimize intelligent applications driven by various sensors, it is vital to properly interpret and reuse sensor data from different domains. The construction of semantic maps which illustrate the relationship between heterogeneous domain ontologies plays an important role in knowledge reuse. However, most mapping methods in the literature use the literal meaning of each concept and instance in the ontology to obtain semantic similarity. This is especially the case for domain ontologies which are built for applications with sensor data. At the instance level, there is seldom work to utilize data of the sensor instances when constructing the ontologies&rsquo; mapping relationship. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to achieve the association between sensor data and domain ontology. In our approach, we first classify the sensor data by making them as SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) ontology instances, and map the corresponding instances to the concepts in the domain ontology. Secondly, a multi-strategy similarity calculation method is used to evaluate the similarity of the concept pairs between the domain ontologies at multiple levels. Finally, the set of concept pairs with a high similarity is selected by the analytic hierarchy process to construct the mapping relationship between the domain ontologies, and then the correlation between sensor data and domain ontologies are constructed. Using the method presented in this paper, we perform sensor data correlation experiments with a simulator for a real world scenario. By comparison to other methods, the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Electric Vehicles (EVs) have emerged rapidly across the globe as a powerful eco-friendly initiative that if integrated well with an urban environment could be iconic for the host city&rsquo;s commitment to sustainable mobility and be a key ingredient of the smart city concept. This paper examines ways that will help us to develop a better understanding of how EVs can achieve energy use optimization and be connected with a smart city. As a whole, the present study is based on an original idea that would be useful in informing policy-makers, automotive manufacturers and transport operators of how to improve and embrace better EV technologies in the context of smart cities. The proposed approach is based on vehicles&rsquo; and buildings&rsquo; communication to share some special information related to the vehicles&rsquo; status and to the road conditions. EVs can share their own information related to their energy consumption experience on a specific path. This information can be gathered in a gigantic database and used for managing the power inside these vehicles. In this field, this paper exposes a new approach to power management inside an electric vehicle based on two-way communication between vehicles and buildings. The principle of this method is established in two sections; the first one is related to vehicles&rsquo; classification and the second one is attached to the buildings&rsquo; recommendations, according to the car position. The classification problem is resolved using the support vector classification method. The recommendation phase is resolved using the artificial intelligence principle and a neural network was employed to give the best decision. The optimal decision will be calculated inside the building, according to its position and using the old vehicle&rsquo;s data, and transferred to the coming vehicle, for optimizing its energy consumption method in the corresponding building zone. Different possibilities and situations in this approach were discussed. The proposed power management methodology was tested and validated using Simulink/Matlab tool. Results related to the battery state of charge and to the consumed energy were compared at the end of this work, to show the efficiency of this approach.

TI  - Insights from Self-Organizing Maps for Predicting Accessibility Demand for Healthcare Infrastructure
T2  - Urban Science

VL  - 3

SN  - 2413-8851

AB  - As urban populations grow worldwide, it becomes increasingly important to critically analyse accessibility&mdash;the ease with which residents can reach key places or opportunities. The combination of &lsquo;big data&rsquo; and advances in computational techniques such as machine learning (ML) could be a boon for urban accessibility studies, yet their application in this field remains limited. In this study, we provided detailed predictions of healthcare accessibility across a rapidly growing city and related them to socio-economic factors using a combination of classical and modern data analysis methods. Using the City of Surrey (Canada) as a case study, we clustered high-resolution income data for 2016 and 2022 using principal component analysis (PCA) and a powerful ML clustering tool, the self-organising map (SOM). We then combined this with door-to-door travel times to hospitals and clinics, calculated using a simple open-source tool. Focusing our analysis on senior populations (65+ years), we found that higher income clusters are projected to become more prevalent across Surrey over our study period. Low income clusters have on average better accessibility to healthcare facilities than high income clusters in both 2016 and 2022. Population growth will be the biggest accessibility challenge in neighbourhoods with good existing access to healthcare, whereas income change (both positive and negative) will be most challenging in poorly connected neighbourhoods. A dual accessibility problem may arise in Surrey: first, large senior populations will reside in areas with access to numerous and close-by, clinics, putting pressure on existing facilities for specialised services. Second, lower-income seniors will increasingly reside in areas poorly connected to healthcare services, which may impact accessibility equity. We demonstrate that combining PCA and SOM clustering techniques results in novel insights for predicting accessibility at the neighbourhood level. This allows for robust planning policy recommendations to be drawn from large multivariate datasets.

T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The paper describes the methodology used for developing an electric load microforecasting module to be integrated in the Energy Management System (EMS) architecture designed and tested within the &ldquo;Energy Router&rdquo; (ER) project. This Italian R&amp;D project is aimed at providing non-industrial active customers and prosumers with a monitoring and control device that would enable demand response through optimization of their own distributed energy resources (DERs). The optimal control of resources is organized with a hierarchical control structure and performed in two stages. A cloud-based computation platform provides global control functions based on model predictive control whereas a closed-loop local device manages actual monitoring and control of field components. In this architecture, load forecasts on a small scale (a single residential or tertiary building) are needed as inputs of the predictive control problem. The microforecasting module aimed at providing such inputs was designed to be flexible, adaptive, and able to treat data with low time resolution. The module includes alternative forecasting techniques, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), neural networks, and exponential smoothing, allowing the application of the right forecasting strategy each time. The presented test results are based on a dataset acquired during a monitoring campaign in two pilot systems, installed during the ER Project in public buildings.

AB  - Recent expansion of intelligent gadgets, such as smartphones and smart watches, familiarizes humans with sensing their activities. We have been developing a road accessibility evaluation system inspired by human sensing technologies. This paper introduces our methodology to estimate road accessibility from the three-axis acceleration data obtained by a smart phone attached on a wheelchair seat, such as environmental factors, e.g., curbs and gaps, which directly influence wheelchair bodies, and human factors, e.g., wheelchair users&rsquo; feelings of tiredness and strain. Our goal is to realize a system that provides the road accessibility visualization services to users by online/offline pattern matching using impersonal models, while gradually learning to improve service accuracy using new data provided by users. As the first step, this paper evaluates features acquired by the DCNN (deep convolutional neural network), which learns the state of the road surface from the data in supervised machine learning techniques. The evaluated results show that the features can capture the difference of the road surface condition in more detail than the label attached by us and are effective as the means for quantitatively expressing the road surface condition. This paper developed and evaluated a prototype system that estimated types of ground surfaces focusing on knowledge extraction and visualization.

AB  - In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and its subarea of deep learning have drawn the attention of many researchers. At the same time, advances in technologies enable the generation or collection of large amounts of valuable data (e.g., sensor data) from various sources in different applications, such as those for the Internet of Things (IoT), which in turn aims towards the development of smart cities. With the availability of sensor data from various sources, sensor information fusion is in demand for effective integration of big data. In this article, we present an AI-based sensor-information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of transportation data generated and collected from various types of sensors, including remote sensed imagery for the geographic information system (GIS), accelerometers, as well as sensors for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and global positioning system (GPS). The discovered knowledge and information returned from our system provides analysts with a clearer understanding of trajectories or mobility of citizens, which in turn helps to develop better transportation models to achieve the ultimate goal of smarter cities. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and practicality of our AI-based sensor information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of big transportation data.

AB  - This work is a part of an ongoing study to substitute the identification of waste containers via radio-frequency identification. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method of identification based on computer vision that performs detection using images, video, or real-time video capture to identify different types of waste containers. Compared to the current method of identification, this approach is more agile and does not require as many resources. Two approaches are employed, one using feature detectors/descriptors and other using convolutional neural networks. The former used a vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD); however, it failed to accomplish what was desired. The latter used you only look once (YOLO), a convolutional neural network, and reached an accuracy in the range of 90%, meaning that it correctly identified and classified 90% of the pictures used on the test set.

AB  - Visualization of underground infrastructure in an interactive 3D immersive environment is extremely important for efficient management of city&rsquo;s infrastructure. This paper describes different geometric modelling approaches to illustrate appropriate visualization of such data. A multimodal prototype has been developed by exploiting different algorithms to render these invisible underground objects as part of an urban model. This prototype has been integrated in an immersive geographic information system (GIS), named MultiVis, for handheld iOS and Android devices. As a part of the study, three distinct strategies have been tested; the first is based on the use of transparencies to convey a sense of depth, the second relies on an image-space superposition of &ldquo;ditches&rdquo; on top of the rendered frame and the third is a world-space deformation of the elevation model that exposes the underground elements. Furthermore, a comparative user experience analysis of different techniques aimed to the geometrically accurate visualisation of utility networks and other underground facilities are performed and evaluated. It includes a set of user evaluations for different parameters of these techniques, which gives us an insight on how the proposed methods affect the experience and usability for technical and non-technical users.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - In view of intensified disasters and fatalities caused by natural phenomena and geographical expansion, there is a pressing need for a more effective environment logging for a better management and urban planning. This paper proposes a novel utility computing model (UCM) for structural health monitoring (SHM) that would enable dynamic planning of monitoring systems in an efficient and cost-effective manner in form of a SHM geo-informatics system. The proposed UCM consists of networked SHM systems that send geometrical SHM variables to SHM-UCM gateways. Every gateway is routing the data to SHM-UCM servers running a geo-spatial patch health assessment and prediction algorithm. The inputs of the prediction algorithm are geometrical variables, environmental variables, and payloads. The proposed SHM-UCM is unique in terms of its capability to manage heterogeneous SHM resources. This has been tested in a case study on Qatar University (QU) in Doha Qatar, where it looked at where SHM nodes are distributed along with occupancy density in each building. This information was taken from QU routers and zone calculation models and were then compared to ideal SHM system data. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in logging and dynamically planning SHM.

AB  - Noise pollution is one of the topmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the United States. Continued exposure to high levels of noise has proven effects on health, including acute effects such as sleep disruption, and long-term effects such as hypertension, heart disease, and hearing loss. To investigate and ultimately aid in the mitigation of urban noise, a network of 55 sensor nodes has been deployed across New York City for over two years, collecting sound pressure level (SPL) and audio data. This network has cumulatively amassed over 75 years of calibrated, high-resolution SPL measurements and 35 years of audio data. In addition, high frequency telemetry data have been collected that provides an indication of a sensors&rsquo; health. These telemetry data were analyzed over an 18-month period across 31 of the sensors. It has been used to develop a prototype model for pre-failure detection which has the ability to identify sensors in a prefail state 69.1% of the time. The entire network infrastructure is outlined, including the operation of the sensors, followed by an analysis of its data yield and the development of the fault detection approach and the future system integration plans for this.

AB  - As an emerging class of spatial trajectory data, mobile user trajectory data can be used to analyze individual or group behavioral characteristics, hobbies and interests. Besides, the information extracted from original trajectory data is widely used in smart cities, transportation planning, and anti-terrorism maintenance. In order to identify the important locations of the target user from his trajectory data, a novel division method for preprocessing trajectory data is proposed, the feature points of original trajectory are extracted according to the change of trajectory structural, and then important locations are extracted by clustering the feature points, using an improved density peak clustering algorithm. Finally, in order to predict next location of mobile users, a multi-order fusion Markov model based on the Adaboost algorithm is proposed, the model order k is adaptively determined, and the weight coefficients of the 1~k-order models are given by the Adaboost algorithm according to the importance of various order models, a multi-order fusion Markov model is generated to predict next important location of the user. The experimental results on the real user trajectory dataset Geo-life show that the prediction performance of Adaboost-Markov model is better than the multi-order fusion Markov model with equal coefficient, and the universality and prediction performance of Adaboost-Markov model is better than the first to third order Markov models.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - With growing urbanization, it has become necessary to manage this growth smartly. Specifically, increased electrical energy consumption has become a rapid urbanization trend in China. A building model based on a neural network was proposed to overcome the difficulties of analytical modelling. However, increased amounts of data, repetitive computation, and training time become a limitation of this approach. A simplified model can be used instead of the full order model if the performance is acceptable. In order to select effective data, Mean Impact Value (MIV) has been applied to select meaningful data. To verify this neural network method, we used real electricity consumption data of a shopping mall in China as a case study. In this paper, a Bayesian Regularization Neural Network (BRNN) is utilized to avoid overfitting due to the small amount of data. With the simplified data set, the building model showed reasonable performance. The mean of Root Mean Square Error achieved is around 10% with respect to the actual consumption and the standard deviation is low, which reflects the model&rsquo;s reliability. We also compare the results with our previous approach using the Levenberg&ndash;Marquardt back propagation (LM-BP) method. The main difference is the output reliability of the two methods. LM-BP shows higher error than BRNN due to overfitting. BRNN shows reliable prediction results when the simplified neural network model is applied.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), there are many challenges for outlier detection, such as fault detection, fraud detection, intrusion detection, and so on. In this paper, the participation degree of instances in the hierarchical clustering process infers the relationship between instances. However, most of the existing algorithms ignore such information. Thus, we propose a novel fault detection technique based on the participation degree, called fault detection based on participation degree (FDP). Our algorithm has the following advantages. First, it does not need data training in labeled datasets; in fact, it uses the participation degree to measure the differences between fault points and normal points without setting distance or density parameters. Second, FDP can detect global outliers without local cluster influence. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our approach by applying it to synthetic and real-world datasets and contrasting it with four well-known techniques: isolation forest (IF), local outlier factor (LOF), one-class support vector machine (OCS), and robust covariance (RC).

To meet this need, we propose a new approach based on deep learning that precisely estimates the composition of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats from hyperspectral signals of foods obtained by using low-cost spectrometers. Specifically, we develop a system consisting of multiple deep neural networks for estimating food nutrients followed by detecting and discarding estimation anomalies. Our comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system can maximize estimation accuracy by automatically identifying wrong estimations. As such, if consolidated with the capability of reinforcement learning, it will likely be positioned as a promising means for personalized healthcare in terms of food safety.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In human-centered intelligent building, real-time measurements of human thermal comfort play critical roles and supply feedback control signals for building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Due to the challenges of intra- and inter-individual differences and skin subtleness variations, there has not been any satisfactory solution for thermal comfort measurements until now. In this paper, a contactless measuring method based on a skin sensitivity index and deep learning (NISDL) was proposed to measure real-time skin temperature. A new evaluating index, named the skin sensitivity index (SSI), was defined to overcome individual differences and skin subtleness variations. To illustrate the effectiveness of SSI proposed, a two multi-layers deep learning framework (NISDL method I and II) was designed and the DenseNet201 was used for extracting features from skin images. The partly personal saturation temperature (NIPST) algorithm was use for algorithm comparisons. Another deep learning algorithm without SSI (DL) was also generated for algorithm comparisons. Finally, a total of 1.44 million image data was used for algorithm validation. The results show that 55.62% and 52.25% error values (NISDL method I, II) are scattered at (0 &deg;C, 0.25 &deg;C), and the same error intervals distribution of NIPST is 35.39%.

AB  - Predicted price-to-book value ratios (P/BV) are widely used for the valuation of listed common stocks. However, with the application of automated trading system (ATS), the existing indicators that are applied in the method are losing their effectiveness in the Chinese market. Combining qualitative research with the text mining method, this study explores and validates those ignored factors to improve the accuracy of the stock valuation. On the basis of the principal of the existing valuation method, we clarify the scope of the factors that affects the P/BV ratio prediction. Through semi-structured interviews that are designed with six first-level factors which are taken from the literature, we then excavate some second-level factors. After that, with three corpuses including samples form Sina.com.cn, Xueqiu.com, and CSDN.net, four first-level factors and thirteen second-level factors have been verified step by step through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. In the process, two other new factors and three sub-factors are also found. Furthermore, based on the factor correlation that was found in a data analysis, a factor relationship model was built. The results can be used in a stock valuation in future work as the basis of the indicator system for the prediction of P/BV ratio.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Sustainability is increasingly recognized as a key innovation capability in the organization. However, it is not always evident for manufacturers how sustainability targets shall be &ldquo;mixed and matched&rdquo; with more traditional objectives&mdash;such as quality, time, cost, and performances&mdash;when designing and developing solutions. The emergence of &ldquo;servitization&rdquo; and product-service systems (PSS) further emphasizes the need for making thoughtful trade-offs between technical aspects, business strategies, and environmental benefits of a design. The objective of this paper is to investigate how multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) models shall be applied to down-select PSS concepts from a value perspective, by considering sustainability as one of the attributes of a design contributing to the overall value of a solution. Emerging from the findings of a multiple case study in the aerospace and construction sector, the paper presents a five-step iterative process to support decision making for sustainable PSS design, which was further applied to design an electrical load carrier. The findings show that the proposed approach creates a &ldquo;hub&rdquo; where argumentations related to &ldquo;value&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; of PSS solution concepts can be systematically captured in a way that supports the discussion on the appropriate quantification strategy.

AB  - The advancements in digital communication technology have made communication between humans more accessible and instant. However, personal and sensitive information may be available online through social networks and online services that lack the security measures to protect this information. Communication systems are vulnerable and can easily be penetrated by malicious users through social engineering attacks. These attacks aim at tricking individuals or enterprises into accomplishing actions that benefit attackers or providing them with sensitive data such as social security number, health records, and passwords. Social engineering is one of the biggest challenges facing network security because it exploits the natural human tendency to trust. This paper provides an in-depth survey about the social engineering attacks, their classifications, detection strategies, and prevention procedures.

AB  - Many cities around the world are facing immense pressure due to the expediting growth rates in urban population levels. The notion of &lsquo;smart cities&rsquo; has been proposed as a solution to enhance the sustainability of cities through effective urban management of governance, energy and transportation. The research presented herein examines the applicability of a mathematical framework to enhance the sustainability of decisions involved in zoning, land-use allocation and facility location within smart cities. In particular, a mathematical optimisation framework is proposed, which links through with other platforms in city settings, for optimising the zoning, land-use allocation, location of new buildings and the investment decisions made regarding infrastructure works in smart cities. Multiple objective functions are formulated to optimise social, economic and environmental considerations in the urban space. The impact on underlying traffic of location choices made for the newly introduced buildings is accounted for through optimised assignment of traffic to the underlying network. A case example on urban planning and infrastructure development within a smart city is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.

AB  - This research paper focuses on a water quality prediction model which requires high-quality data. In the process of construction and operation of smart water quality monitoring systems based on Internet of Things (IoT), more and more big data are produced at a high speed, which has made water quality data complicated. Taking advantage of the good performance of long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural networks in time-series prediction, a drinking-water quality model was designed and established to predict water quality big data with the help of the advanced deep learning (DL) theory in this paper. The drinking-water quality data measured by the automatic water quality monitoring station of Guazhou Water Source of the Yangtze River in Yangzhou were utilized to analyze the water quality parameters in detail, and the prediction model was trained and tested with monitoring data from January 2016 to June 2018. The results of the study indicate that the predicted values of the model and the actual values were in good agreement and accurately revealed the future developing trend of water quality, showing the feasibility and effectiveness of using LSTM deep neural networks to predict the quality of drinking water.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Through the Internet of things (IoT), as promoted by smart cities, there is an emergence of big data accentuating the use of artificial intelligence through various components of urban planning, management, and design. One such system is that of artificial neural networks (ANNs), a component of machine learning that boasts similitude with brain neurological networks and its functioning. However, the development of ANN was done in singular fashion, whereby processes are rendered in sequence in a unidimensional perspective, contrasting with the functions of the brain to which ANN boasts similitude, and in particular to the concept of neuroplasticity which encourages unique complex interactions in self-learning fashion, thereby encouraging more inclusive urban processes and render urban coherence. This paper takes inspiration from Christopher Alexander&rsquo;s Nature of Order and dwells in the concept of complexity theory; it also proposes a theoretical model of how ANN can be rendered with the same plastic properties as brain neurological networks with multidimensional interactivity in the context of smart cities through the use of big data and its emerging complex networks. By doing so, this model caters to the creation of stronger, richer, and more complex patterns that support Alexander&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; through the connection of overlapping networks. This paper is aimed toward engineers with interdisciplinary interest looking at creating more complex and intricate ANN models, and toward urban planners and urban theorists working on the emerging contemporary concept of smart cities.

AB  - Citizen safety in modern urban environments is an important aspect of life quality. Implementation of a smart city approach to video surveillance depends heavily on the capability of gathering and processing huge amounts of live urban data. Analyzing data from high bandwidth surveillance video streams provided by large size distributed sensor networks is particularly challenging. We propose here an efficient method for automatic violent behavior detection designed for video sensor networks. Known solutions to real-time violence detection are not suitable for implementation in a resource-constrained environment due to the high processing power requirements. Our algorithm achieves real-time processing on a Raspberry PI-embedded architecture. To ensure separation of temporal and spatial information processing we employ a computationally effective cascaded approach. It consists of a deep neural network followed by a time domain classifier. In contrast with current approaches, the deep neural network input is fed exclusively with motion vector features extracted directly from the MPEG encoded video stream. As proven by results, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, while running on a low computational resources embedded architecture.

AB  - Depth has been a valuable piece of information for perception tasks such as robot grasping, obstacle avoidance, and navigation, which are essential tasks for developing smart homes and smart cities. However, not all applications have the luxury of using depth sensors or multiple cameras to obtain depth information. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the per-pixel depths from a single image. Inspired by the recent works on generative neural network models, we formulate the task of depth estimation as a generative task where we synthesize an image of the depth map from a single Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) input image. We propose a novel generative adversarial network that has an encoder-decoder type generator with residual transposed convolution blocks trained with an adversarial loss. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several depth estimation works.

AB  - With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), applications have become smarter and connected devices give rise to their exploitation in all aspects of a modern city. As the volume of the collected data increases, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are applied to further enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. The field of smart transportation has attracted many researchers and it has been approached with both ML and IoT techniques. In this review, smart transportation is considered to be an umbrella term that covers route optimization, parking, street lights, accident prevention/detection, road anomalies, and infrastructure applications. The purpose of this paper is to make a self-contained review of ML techniques and IoT applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and obtain a clear view of the trends in the aforementioned fields and spot possible coverage needs. From the reviewed articles it becomes profound that there is a possible lack of ML coverage for the Smart Lighting Systems and Smart Parking applications. Additionally, route optimization, parking, and accident/detection tend to be the most popular ITS applications among researchers.

AB  - Ambient Intelligence is currently a lively application domain of Artificial Intelligence and has become the central subject of multiple initiatives worldwide. Several approaches inside this domain make use of knowledge bases or knowledge graphs, both previously existing and ad hoc. This form of representation allows heterogeneous data gathered from diverse sources to be contextualized and combined to create relevant information for intelligent systems, usually following higher level constraints defined by an ontology. In this work, we conduct a systematic review of the existing usages of knowledge bases in intelligent environments, as well as an in-depth study of the predictive and decision-making models employed. Finally, we present a use case for smart homes and illustrate the use and advantages of Knowledge Graph Embeddings in this context.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The paper introduces an artificial neural network ensemble for decentralized control of traffic signals based on data from sensor network. According to the decentralized approach, traffic signals at each intersection are controlled independently using real-time data obtained from sensor nodes installed along traffic lanes. In the proposed ensemble, a neural network, which reflects design of signalized intersection, is combined with fully connected neural networks to enable evaluation of signal group priorities. Based on the evaluated priorities, control decisions are taken about switching traffic signals. A neuroevolution strategy is used to optimize configuration of the introduced neural network ensemble. The proposed solution was compared against state-of-the-art decentralized traffic control algorithms during extensive simulation experiments. The experiments confirmed that the proposed solution provides better results in terms of reduced vehicle delay, shorter travel time, and increased average velocity of vehicles.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 8
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The performance of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based algorithm is subject to the way the feature data is extracted. This is a common issue when applying the ANN to indoor fingerprinting-based localization where the signal is unstable. To date, there is not adequate feature extraction method that can significantly mitigate the influence of the receiver signal strength indicator (RSSI) variation that degrades the performance of the ANN-based indoor fingerprinting algorithm. In this work, a wavelet scattering transform is used to extract reliable features that are stable to small deformation and rotation invariant. The extracted features are used by a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the location. The zeroth and the first layer of decomposition coefficients were used as features data by concatenating different scattering path coefficients. The proposed algorithm has been validated on real measurements and has achieved good performance. The experimentation results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction method is stable to the RSSI variation.

The proposed classifier has a bundle structure based on the enhanced version of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Due to its fast response and easy-to-build architecture, the ELM is an appropriate machine learning model for power quality analysis. The sparse Bayesian ELM and weighted ELM have been embedded into the proposed bundle learning machine. The case study includes real field signals obtained from the Turkish electricity transmission system. Most actual events like voltage sag, voltage swell, interruption, and harmonics have been detected using the proposed algorithm. For validation purposes, the ELM algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art methods such as artificial neural network and least squares support vector machine.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Digital water meters can take Australian water utilities into the world of internet of things (IoT) and big data analytics. The potential is there for them to build more efficient processes, to enable new products and services to be offered, to defer expensive capital works, and for water conservation to be achieved. However, utilities are not mounting business cases with sufficient benefits to cover the project and operational costs. This study undertakes a literature review and interviews of industry experts in the search for unreported benefits that might be considered for inclusion in business cases. It identifies seventy-five possible benefits of which fifty-seven are classified as benefiting the water utility and forty are classified as benefiting customers (twenty-two benefit both). Many benefits may be difficult to monetize. Benefits to customers may have a small monetary benefit to the water utility but provide a significant benefit to customer satisfaction scores. However, for utilities to achieve these potential benefits, eight change enablers were identified as being required in their systems, processes, and resources. Of the seventy-five benefits, approximately half might be considered previously unreported. Finally, a taxonomy is presented into which the benefits are classified, and the enabling business changes for them to be realized are identified. Water utilities might consider the taxonomy, the benefits, and the changes required to enable the benefits when developing their business cases.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - VANET (vehicular ad hoc network) has a main objective to improve driver safety and traffic efficiency. The intermittent exchange of real-time safety message delivery in VANET has become an urgent concern due to DoS (denial of service) and smart and normal intrusions (SNI) attacks. The intermittent communication of VANET generates huge amount of data which requires typical storage and intelligence infrastructure. Fog computing (FC) plays an important role in storage, computation, and communication needs. In this research, fog computing (FC) integrates with hybrid optimization algorithms (OAs) including the Cuckoo search algorithm (CSA), firefly algorithm (FA), firefly neural network, and the key distribution establishment (KDE) for authenticating both the network level and the node level against all attacks for trustworthiness in VANET. The proposed scheme is termed &ldquo;Secure Intelligent Vehicular Network using fog computing&rdquo; (SIVNFC). A feedforward back propagation neural network (FFBP-NN), also termed the firefly neural, is used as a classifier to distinguish between the attacking vehicles and genuine vehicles. The SIVNFC scheme is compared with the Cuckoo, the FA, and the firefly neural network to evaluate the quality of services (QoS) parameters such as jitter and throughput.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) provides a way to acquire detailed energy consumption and appliance operation status through a single sensor, which has been proven to save energy. Further, besides load disaggregation, advanced applications (e.g., demand response) need to recognize on/off events of appliances instantly. In order to shorten the time delay for users to acquire the event information, it is necessary to analyze extremely short period electrical signals. However, the features of those signals are easily submerged in complex background loads, especially in cross-user scenarios. Through experiments and observations, it can be found that the feature of background loads is almost stationary in a short time. On the basis of this result, this paper provides a novel model called the concatenate convolutional neural network to separate the feature of the target load from the load mixed with the background. For the cross-user test on the UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity dataset (UK-DALE), it turns out that the proposed model remarkably improves accuracy, robustness, and generalization of load recognition. In addition, it also provides significant improvements in energy disaggregation compared with the state-of-the-art.

AB  - To achieve the full analytical potential of the streaming data from the internet of things, the interconnection of various data sources is needed. By definition, those sources are heterogeneous and their integration is not a trivial task. A common approach to exploit streaming sensor data potential is to use machine learning techniques for predictive analytics in a way that is agnostic to the domain knowledge. Such an approach can be easily integrated in various use cases. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data fusion of a set of heterogeneous data streams. The proposed framework enriches streaming sensor data with the contextual and historical information relevant for describing the underlying processes. The final result of the framework is a feature vector, ready to be used in a machine learning algorithm. The framework has been applied to a cloud and to an edge device. In the latter case, incremental learning capabilities have been demonstrated. The reported results illustrate a significant improvement of data-driven models, applied to sensor streams. Beside higher accuracy of the models the platform offers easy setup and thus fast prototyping capabilities in real-world applications.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This study investigates combining the property of human vision system and a 2-phase data hiding strategy to improve the visual quality of data-embedded compressed images. The visual Internet of Things (IoT) is indispensable in smart cities, where different sources of visual data are collected for more efficient management. With the transmission through the public network, security issue becomes critical. Moreover, for the sake of increasing transmission efficiency, image compression is widely used. In order to respond to both needs, we present a novel data hiding scheme for image compression with Absolute Moment Block Truncation Coding (AMBTC). Embedding secure data in digital images has broad security uses, e.g., image authentication, prevention of forgery attacks, and intellectual property protection. The proposed method embeds data into an AMBTC block by two phases. In the intra-block embedding phase, a hidden function is proposed, where the five AMBTC parameters are extracted and manipulated to embed the secret data. In the inter-block embedding phase, the relevance of high mean and low mean values between adjacent blocks are exploited to embed additional secret data in a reversible way. Between these two embedding phases, a halftoning scheme called direct binary search is integrated to efficiently improve the image quality without changing the fixed parameters. The modulo operator is used for data extraction. The advantages of this study contain two aspects. First, data hiding is an essential area of research for increasing the IoT security. Second, hiding in compressed images instead of original images can improve the network transmission efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Crowd counting, which is widely used in disaster management, traffic monitoring, and other fields of urban security, is a challenging task that is attracting increasing interest from researchers. For better accuracy, most methods have attempted to handle the scale variation explicitly. which results in huge scale changes of the object size. However, earlier methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have focused primarily on improving accuracy while ignoring the complexity of the model. This paper proposes a novel method based on a lightweight CNN-based network for estimating crowd counting and generating density maps under resource constraints. The network is composed of three components: a basic feature extractor (BFE), a stacked &agrave; trous convolution module (SACM), and a context fusion module (CFM). The BFE encodes basic feature information with reduced spatial resolution for further refining. Various pieces of contextual information are generated through a short pipeline in SACM. To generate a context fusion density map, CFM distills feature maps from the above components. The whole network is trained in an end-to-end fashion and uses a compression factor to restrict its size. Experiments on three highly-challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method delivers attractive performance.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A fire detection system requires accurate and fast mechanisms to make the right decision in a fire situation. Since most commercial fire detection systems use a simple sensor, their fire recognition accuracy is deficient because of the limitations of the detection capability of the sensor. Existing proposals, which use rule-based algorithms or image-based machine learning can hardly adapt to the changes in the environment because of their static features. Since the legacy fire detection systems and network services do not guarantee data transfer latency, the required need for promptness is unmet. In this paper, we propose a new fire detection system with a multifunctional artificial intelligence framework and a data transfer delay minimization mechanism for the safety of smart cities. The framework includes a set of multiple machine learning algorithms and an adaptive fuzzy algorithm. In addition, Direct-MQTT based on SDN is introduced to solve the traffic concentration problems of the traditional MQTT. We verify the performance of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and delay time and found a fire detection accuracy of over 95%. The end-to-end delay, which comprises the transfer and decision delays, is reduced by an average of 72%.

TI  - Forecasting Heating Consumption in Buildings: A Scalable Full-Stack Distributed Engine

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Predicting power demand of building heating systems is a challenging task due to the high variability of their energy profiles. Power demand is characterized by different heating cycles including sequences of various transient and steady-state phases. To effectively perform the predictive task by exploiting the huge amount of fine-grained energy-related data collected through Internet of Things (IoT) devices, innovative and scalable solutions should be devised. This paper presents PHi-CiB, a scalable full-stack distributed engine, addressing all tasks from energy-related data collection, to their integration, storage, analysis, and modeling. Heterogeneous data measurements (e.g., power consumption in buildings, meteorological conditions) are collected through multiple hardware (e.g., IoT devices) and software (e.g., web services) entities. Such data are integrated and analyzed to predict the average power demand of each building for different time horizons. First, the transient and steady-state phases characterizing the heating cycle of each building are automatically identified; then the power-level forecasting is performed for each phase. To this aim, PHi-CiB relies on a pipeline of three algorithms: the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, and the Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent. PHi-CiB&rsquo;s current implementation exploits Apache Spark and MongoDB and supports parallel and scalable processing and analytical tasks. Experimental results, performed on energy-related data collected in a real-world system show the effectiveness of PHi-CiB in predicting heating power consumption of buildings with a limited prediction error and an optimal horizontal scalability.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Air pollution has become a global environmental problem, because it has a great adverse impact on human health and the climate. One way to explore this problem is to monitor and predict air quality index in an economical way. Accurate monitoring and prediction of air quality index (AQI), e.g., PM2.5 concentration, is a challenging task. In order to accurately predict the PM2.5 time series, we propose a supplementary leaky integrator echo state network (SLI-ESN) in this paper. It adds the historical state term of the historical moment to the calculation of leaky integrator reservoir, which improves the influence of historical evolution state on the current state. Considering the redundancy and correlation between multivariable time series, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection method is introduced to reduce redundant and irrelevant information, and increase computation speed. A variety of evaluation indicators are used to assess the overall performance of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by the experiment of Beijing PM2.5 time series prediction. The comparison of learning time also shows the efficiency of the algorithm.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In a smart home linked to a smart grid (SG), demand-side management (DSM) has the potential to reduce electricity costs and carbon/chlorofluorocarbon emissions, which are associated with electricity used in today&rsquo;s modern society. To meet continuously increasing electrical energy demands requested from downstream sectors in an SG, energy management systems (EMS), developed with paradigms of artificial intelligence (AI) across Internet of things (IoT) and conducted in fields of interest, monitor, manage, and analyze industrial, commercial, and residential electrical appliances efficiently in response to demand response (DR) signals as DSM. Usually, a DSM service provided by utilities for consumers in an SG is based on cloud-centered data science analytics. However, such cloud-centered data science analytics service involved for DSM is mostly far away from on-site IoT end devices, such as DR switches/power meters/smart meters, which is usually unacceptable for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications in DSM. This implies that, for instance, IoT end devices deployed on-site for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications in DSM should be aware of immediately analytical, interpretable, and real-time actionable data insights processed on and identified by IoT end devices at IoT sources. Therefore, this work designs and implements a smart edge analytics-empowered power meter prototype considering advanced AI in DSM for smart homes. The prototype in this work works in a cloud analytics-assisted electrical EMS architecture, which is designed and implemented as edge analytics in the architecture described and developed toward a next-generation smart sensing infrastructure for smart homes. Two different types of AI deployed on-site on the prototype are conducted for DSM and compared in this work. The experimentation reported in this work shows the architecture described with the prototype in this work is feasible and workable.

AB  - The increasing development of urban centers brings serious challenges for traffic management. In this paper, we introduce a smart visual sensor, developed for a pilot project taking place in the Australian city of Liverpool (NSW). The project&rsquo;s aim was to design and evaluate an edge-computing device using computer vision and deep neural networks to track in real-time multi-modal transportation while ensuring citizens&rsquo; privacy. The performance of the sensor was evaluated on a town center dataset. We also introduce the interoperable Agnosticity framework designed to collect, store and access data from multiple sensors, with results from two real-world experiments.

AB  - In order to obtain high-accuracy measurements, traditional air quality monitoring and prediction systems adopt high-accuracy sensors. However, high-accuracy sensors are accompanied with high cost, which cannot be widely promoted in Internet of Things (IoT) with many sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a low-cost air quality monitoring and real-time prediction system based on IoT and edge computing, which reduces IoT applications dependence on cloud computing. Raspberry Pi with computing power, as an edge device, runs the Kalman Filter (KF) algorithm, which improves the accuracy of low-cost sensors by 27% on the edge side. Based on the KF algorithm, our proposed system achieves the immediate prediction of the concentration of six air pollutants such as SO2, NO2 and PM2.5 by combining the observations with errors. In the comparison experiments with three common predicted algorithms including Simple Moving Average, Exponentially Weighted Moving Average and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, the KF algorithm can obtain the optimal prediction results, and root-mean-square error decreases by 68.3% on average. Taken together, the results of the study indicate that our proposed system, combining edge computing and IoT, can be promoted in smart agriculture.

TI  - Low-Cost Image Compressive Sensing with Multiple Measurement Rates for Object Detection
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - When measurement rates grow, most Compressive Sensing (CS) methods suffer from an increase in overheads of transmission and storage of CS measurements, while reconstruction quality degrades appreciably when measurement rates reduce. To solve these problems in real scenarios such as large-scale distributed surveillance systems, we propose a low-cost image CS approach called MRCS for object detection. It predicts key objects using the proposed MYOLO3 detector, and then samples the regions of the key objects as well as other regions using multiple measurement rates to reduce the size of sampled CS measurements. It also stores and transmits half-precision CS measurements to further reduce the required transmission bandwidth and storage space. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MYOLO3 is a smaller and improved object detector for resource-limited hardware devices such as surveillance cameras and aerial drones. They also suggest that MRCS significantly reduces the required transmission bandwidth and storage space by declining the size of CS measurements, e.g., mean Compression Ratios (mCR) achieves 1.43&ndash;22.92 on the VOC-pbc dataset. Notably, MRCS further reduces the size of CS measurements by half-precision representations. Subsequently, the required transmission bandwidth and storage space are reduced by one half as compared to the counterparts represented with single-precision floats. Moreover, it also substantially enhances the usability of object detection on reconstructed images with half-precision CS measurements and multiple measurement rates as compared to its counterpart, using a single low measurement rate.

AB  - With the rapid deployment of the Internet of Things and cloud computing, it is necessary to enhance authentication protocols to reduce attacks and security vulnerabilities which affect the correct performance of applications. In 2019 a new lightweight IoT-based authentication scheme in cloud computing circumstances was proposed. According to the authors, their protocol is secure and resists very well-known attacks. However, when we evaluated the protocol we found some security vulnerabilities and drawbacks, making the scheme insecure. Therefore, we propose a new version considering login, mutual authentication and key agreement phases to enhance the security. Moreover, we include a sub-phase called evidence of connection attempt which provides proof about the participation of the user and the server. The new scheme achieves the security requirements and resists very well-known attacks, improving previous works. In addition, the performance evaluation demonstrates that the new scheme requires less communication-cost than previous authentication protocols during the registration and login phases.

AB  - Drivers&rsquo; behaviors and decision making on the road directly affect the safety of themselves, other drivers, and pedestrians. However, as distinct entities, people cannot predict the motions of surrounding vehicles and they have difficulty in performing safe reactionary driving maneuvers in a short time period. To overcome the limitations of making an immediate prediction, in this work, we propose a two-stage data-driven approach: classifying driving patterns of on-road surrounding vehicles using the Gaussian mixture models (GMM); and predicting vehicles&rsquo; short-term lateral motions (i.e., left/right turn and left/right lane change) based on real-world vehicle mobility data, provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation, with different ensemble decision trees. We considered several important kinetic features and higher order kinematic variables. The research results of our proposed approach demonstrate the effectiveness of pattern classification and on-road lateral motion prediction. This methodology framework has the potential to be incorporated into current data-driven collision warning systems, to enable more practical on-road preprocessing in intelligent vehicles, and to be applied in autopilot-driving scenarios.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The exact location of objects, such as infrastructure, is crucial to the systematic understanding of the built environment. The emergence and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) have attracted growing attention to the low-cost location scheme, which can respond to a dramatic increasing amount of public infrastructure in smart cities. Various Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID)-based locating systems and noise mitigation methods have been developed. However, most of them are impractical for built environments in large areas due to their high cost, computational complexity, and low noise detection capability. In this paper, we proposed a novel noise mitigation solution integrating the low-cost localization scheme with one mobile RFID reader. We designed a filter algorithm to remove the influence of abnormal data. Inspired the sampling concept, a more carefully parameters calibration was carried out for noise data sampling to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational complexity. To achieve robust noise detection results, we employed the powerful noise detection capability of the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method for the localization and noise mitigation in a large area. The proposed scheme has potential applications for location-based services in smart cities.

AB  - Urban ecosystem services (UES) is an essential approach to the development of sustainable cities and must be incorporated into urban planning to be able to improve humans&rsquo; life quality. This paper aimed to identify remote sensing (RS) data/techniques used in the literature in five years (2013&ndash;2017) for UES investigation and to analyze the similarity between them. For this purpose, we used the Scopus database of scientific journals, and a set of appropriate filters were applied. A total of 44 studies were selected, being 93.18% of them located in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly in Europe. The most common dataset used was the secondary data, followed by the Landsat family products. Land use and land cover (LULC) was the most common approach utilized, succeeded by radiometric indexes and band related. All four main classes (provision, regulation, supporting, and cultural) of ecosystem services (ES) were identified in the reviewed papers, wherein regulating services were the most popular modality mentioned. Seven different groups were established as having 100% of similarity between methods and ES results. Therefore, RS is identified in the literature as an important technique to reach this goal. However, we highlight the lack of studies in the southern hemisphere.

AB  - Road transportation is the backbone of modern economies, albeit it annually costs     1.25     million deaths and trillions of dollars to the global economy, and damages public health and the environment. Deep learning is among the leading-edge methods used for transportation-related predictions, however, the existing works are in their infancy, and fall short in multiple respects, including the use of datasets with limited sizes and scopes, and insufficient depth of the deep learning studies. This paper provides a novel and comprehensive approach toward large-scale, faster, and real-time traffic prediction by bringing four complementary cutting-edge technologies together: big data, deep learning, in-memory computing, and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). We trained deep networks using over 11 years of data provided by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the largest dataset that has been used in deep learning studies. Several combinations of the input attributes of the data along with various network configurations of the deep learning models were investigated for training and prediction purposes. The use of the pre-trained model for real-time prediction was explored. The paper contributes novel deep learning models, algorithms, implementation, analytics methodology, and software tool for smart cities, big data, high performance computing, and their convergence.

AB  - Sensor technology provides the real-time monitoring of data in several scenarios that contribute to the improved security of life and property. Crowd condition monitoring is an area that has benefited from this. The basic context-aware framework (BCF) uses activity recognition based on emerging intelligent technology and is among the best that has been proposed for this purpose. However, accuracy is low, and the false negative rate (FNR) remains high. Thus, the need for an enhanced framework that offers reduced FNR and higher accuracy becomes necessary. This article reports our work on the development of an enhanced context-aware framework (EHCAF) using smartphone participatory sensing for crowd monitoring, dimensionality reduction of statistical-based time-frequency domain (SBTFD) features, and enhanced individual behavior estimation (IBEenhcaf). The experimental results achieved 99.1% accuracy and an FNR of 2.8%, showing a clear improvement over the 92.0% accuracy, and an FNR of 31.3% of the BCF.

AB  - Rapid transit systems or metros are a popular choice for high-capacity public transport in urban areas due to several advantages including safety, dependability, speed, cost, and lower risk of accidents. Existing studies on metros have not considered appropriate holistic urban transport models and integrated use of cutting-edge technologies. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach toward large-scale and faster prediction of metro system characteristics by employing the integration of four leading-edge technologies: big data, deep learning, in-memory computing, and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Using London Metro as a case study, and the Rolling Origin and Destination Survey (RODS) (real) dataset, we predict the number of passengers for six time intervals (a) using various access transport modes to reach the train stations (buses, walking, etc.); (b) using various egress modes to travel from the metro station to their next points of interest (PoIs); (c) traveling between different origin-destination (OD) pairs of stations; and (d) against the distance between the OD stations. The prediction allows better spatiotemporal planning of the whole urban transport system, including the metro subsystem, and its various access and egress modes. The paper contributes novel deep learning models, algorithms, implementation, analytics methodology, and software tool for analysis of metro systems.

AB  - The constantly increasing amount and availability of urban data derived from varying sources leads to an assortment of challenges that include, among others, the consolidation, visualization, and maximal exploitation prospects of the aforementioned data. A preeminent problem affecting urban planning is the appropriate choice of location to host a particular activity (either commercial or common welfare service) or the correct use of an existing building or empty space. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these challenges availed with machine learning techniques. The proposed system combines, fuses, and merges various types of data from different sources, encodes them using a novel semantic model that can capture and utilize both low-level geometric information and higher level semantic information and subsequently feeds them to the random forests classifier, as well as other supervised machine learning models for comparisons. Our experimental evaluation on multiple real-world data sets comparing the performance of several classifiers (including Feedforward Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Bag of Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Na&iuml;ve Bayes), indicated the superiority of Random Forests in terms of the examined performance metrics (Accuracy, Specificity, Precision, Recall, F-measure and G-mean).

AB  - Measuring financial performance has become an essential topic due to the potential decimating impacts on the corporation itself as well as to whole societies during financial turmoil. In order to provide an overarching description of the multidimensional nature for measuring a corporation&rsquo;s operations, it is preferable to employ data envelopment analysis (DEA). Different from prior research that merely focuses on a singular DEA performance rank, this study extends it to multiple DEA specifications (i.e., it combines inputs and outputs in several different ways) so as to make judgments more complete and robust. We also execute fuzzy visualization technique (i.e., nonlinear fuzzy robust principal component analysis, NFRPCA) to represent the main characteristics of data so that non-specialists can have better access to the results. The analyzed result is then fed into the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to establish a model to forecast a firm&rsquo;s operating performance. Even a fraction of accuracy improvement can result in considerable future savings to a firm and investors. When examined using real cases, the model is a promising alternative for operating performance forecasting and can assist both internal and external market participants.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 7
IS  - 5
SN  - 2227-9717

AB  - An accurate forecast of the electricity consumption is particularly important to both consumers and system operators. The purpose of this study is to develop a forecasting method that provides such an accurate forecast of the month-ahead hourly electricity consumption in the case of medium industrial consumers, therefore assuring an intelligent energy management and an efficient economic scheduling of their resources, having the possibility to negotiate in advance appropriate billing tariffs relying on accurate hourly forecasts, in the same time facilitating an optimal energy management for the dispatch operator. The forecasting method consists of developing first non-linear autoregressive, with exogenous inputs (NARX) artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to forecast an initial daily electricity consumption, a forecast that is being further processed with custom developed long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with exogenous variables support in order to refine the daily forecast as to achieve an accurate hourly forecasted consumed electricity for the whole month-ahead. The obtained experimental results (highlighted also through a very good value of 0.0244 for the root mean square error performance metric, obtained when forecasting the month-ahead hourly electricity consumption and comparing it with the real consumption), the validation of the developed forecasting method, the comparison of the method with other forecasting approaches from the scientific literature substantiate the fact that the proposed approach manages to fill a gap in the current body of knowledge consisting of the need of a high-accuracy forecasting method for the month-ahead hourly electricity consumption in the case of medium industrial consumers. The developed forecasting method targets medium industrial consumers, but, due to its accuracy, it can also be a useful tool for promoting innovative business models with regard to industrial consumers willing to produce a part of their own electricity using renewable energy resources, benefiting from reduced production costs and reliable electricity prices.

AB  - The Canary Islands are a well known tourist destination with generally stable and clement weather conditions. However, occasionally extreme weather conditions occur, which although very unusual, may cause severe damage to the local economy. The ViMetRi-MAC EU funded project has among its goals, managing climate-change-associated risks. The Spanish National Meteorology Agency (AEMET) has a network of weather stations across the eight Canary Islands. Using data from those stations, we propose a novel methodology for the prediction of maximum wind speed in order to trigger an early alert for extreme weather conditions. The methodology proposed has the added value of using an innovative kind of machine learning that is based on the data stream mining paradigm. This type of machine learning system relies on two important features: models are learned incrementally and adaptively. That means the learner tunes the models gradually and endlessly as new observations are received and also modifies it when there is concept drift (statistical instability), in the modeled phenomenon. The results presented seem to prove that this data stream mining approach is a good fit for this kind of problem, clearly improving the results obtained with the accumulative non-adaptive version of the methodology.

TI  - Predicting Station-Level Short-Term Passenger Flow in a Citywide Metro Network Using Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 6
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Predicting the passenger flow of metro networks is of great importance for traffic management and public safety. However, such predictions are very challenging, as passenger flow is affected by complex spatial dependencies (nearby and distant) and temporal dependencies (recent and periodic). In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning-based approach, named STGCNNmetro (spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural networks for metro), to collectively predict two types of passenger flow volumes&mdash;inflow and outflow&mdash;in each metro station of a city. Specifically, instead of representing metro stations by grids and employing conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, STGCNNmetro transforms the city metro network to a graph and makes predictions using graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs). First, we apply stereogram graph convolution operations to seamlessly capture the irregular spatiotemporal dependencies along the metro network. Second, a deep structure composed of GCNNs is constructed to capture the distant spatiotemporal dependencies at the citywide level. Finally, we integrate three temporal patterns (recent, daily, and weekly) and fuse the spatiotemporal dependencies captured from these patterns to form the final prediction values. The STGCNNmetro model is an end-to-end framework which can accept raw passenger flow-volume data, automatically capture the effective features of the citywide metro network, and output predictions. We test this model by predicting the short-term passenger flow volume in the citywide metro network of Shanghai, China. Experiments show that the STGCNNmetro model outperforms seven well-known baseline models (LSVR, PCA-kNN, NMF-kNN, Bayesian, MLR, M-CNN, and LSTM). We additionally explore the sensitivity of the model to its parameters and discuss the distribution of prediction errors.

AB  - Taxi demand can be divided into pick-up demand and drop-off demand, which are firmly related to human&rsquo;s travel habits. Accurately predicting taxi demand is of great significance to passengers, drivers, ride-hailing platforms and urban managers. Most of the existing studies only forecast the taxi demand for pick-up and separate the interaction between spatial correlation and temporal correlation. In this paper, we first analyze the historical data and select three highly relevant parts for each time interval, namely closeness, period and trend. We then construct a multi-task learning component and extract the common spatiotemporal feature by treating the taxi pick-up prediction task and drop-off prediction task as two related tasks. With the aim of fusing spatiotemporal features of historical data, we conduct feature embedding by attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) and capture the correlation between taxi pick-up and drop-off with 3D ResNet. Finally, we combine external factors to simultaneously predict the taxi demand for pick-up and drop-off in the next time interval. Experiments conducted on real datasets in Chengdu present the effectiveness of the proposed method and show better performance in comparison with state-of-the-art models.

AB  - The Internet of Things is a rapidly growing paradigm for smart cities that provides a way of communication, identification, and sensing capabilities among physically distributed devices. With the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoTs), user dependence on smart systems and services, such as smart appliances, smartphone, security, and healthcare applications, has been increased. This demands secure authentication mechanisms to preserve the users&rsquo; privacy when interacting with smart devices. This paper proposes a heterogeneous framework &ldquo;ADLAuth&rdquo; for passive and implicit authentication of the user using either a smartphone&rsquo;s built-in sensor or wearable sensors by analyzing the physical activity patterns of the users. Multiclass machine learning algorithms are applied to users&rsquo; identity verification. Analyses are performed on three different datasets of heterogeneous sensors for a diverse number of activities. A series of experiments have been performed to test the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate the better performance of the proposed scheme compared to existing work for user authentication.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The worldwide utilization of surveillance cameras in smart cities has enabled researchers to analyze a gigantic volume of data to ensure automatic monitoring. An enhanced security system in smart cities, schools, hospitals, and other surveillance domains is mandatory for the detection of violent or abnormal activities to avoid any casualties which could cause social, economic, and ecological damages. Automatic detection of violence for quick actions is very significant and can efficiently assist the concerned departments. In this paper, we propose a triple-staged end-to-end deep learning violence detection framework. First, persons are detected in the surveillance video stream using a light-weight convolutional neural network (CNN) model to reduce and overcome the voluminous processing of useless frames. Second, a sequence of 16 frames with detected persons is passed to 3D CNN, where the spatiotemporal features of these sequences are extracted and fed to the Softmax classifier. Furthermore, we optimized the 3D CNN model using an open visual inference and neural networks optimization toolkit developed by Intel, which converts the trained model into intermediate representation and adjusts it for optimal execution at the end platform for the final prediction of violent activity. After detection of a violent activity, an alert is transmitted to the nearest police station or security department to take prompt preventive actions. We found that our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for different benchmark datasets.

TI  - Machine Learning Prediction Approach to Enhance Congestion Control in 5G IoT Environment

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The 5G network is a next-generation wireless form of communication and the latest mobile technology. In practice, 5G utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) to work in high-traffic networks with multiple nodes/sensors in an attempt to transmit their packets to a destination simultaneously, which is a characteristic of IoT applications. Due to this, 5G offers vast bandwidth, low delay, and extremely high data transfer speed. Thus, 5G presents opportunities and motivations for utilizing next-generation protocols, especially the stream control transmission protocol (SCTP). However, the congestion control mechanisms of the conventional SCTP negatively influence overall performance. Moreover, existing mechanisms contribute to reduce 5G and IoT performance. Thus, a new machine learning model based on a decision tree (DT) algorithm is proposed in this study to predict optimal enhancement of congestion control in the wireless sensors of 5G IoT networks. The model was implemented on a training dataset to determine the optimal parametric setting in a 5G environment. The dataset was used to train the machine learning model and enable the prediction of optimal alternatives that can enhance the performance of the congestion control approach. The DT approach can be used for other functions, especially prediction and classification. DT algorithms provide graphs that can be used by any user to understand the prediction approach. The DT C4.5 provided promising results, with more than 92% precision and recall.

TI  - A WASN-Based Suburban Dataset for Anomalous Noise Event Detection on Dynamic Road-Traffic Noise Mapping

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Traffic noise is presently considered one of the main pollutants in urban and suburban areas. Several recent technological advances have allowed a step forward in the dynamic computation of road-traffic noise levels by means of a Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network (WASN) through the collection of measurements in real-operation environments. In the framework of the LIFE DYNAMAP project, two WASNs have been deployed in two pilot areas: one in the city of Milan, as an urban environment, and another around the city of Rome in a suburban location. For a correct evaluation of the noise level generated by road infrastructures, all Anomalous Noise Events (ANE) unrelated to regular road-traffic noise (e.g., sirens, horns, speech, etc.) should be removed before updating corresponding noise maps. This work presents the production and analysis of a real-operation environmental audio database collected through the 19-node WASN of a suburban area. A total of 156 h and 20 min of labeled audio data has been obtained differentiating among road-traffic noise and ANEs (classified in 16 subcategories). After delimiting their boundaries manually, the acoustic salience of the ANE samples is automatically computed as a contextual Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) together with its impact on the A-weighted equivalent level (    &Delta;  L  A e q      ). The analysis of the real-operation WASN-based environmental database is evaluated with these metrics, and we conclude that the 19 locations of the network present substantial differences in the occurrences of the subcategories of ANE, with a clear predominance of the noise of sirens, trains, and thunder.

AB  - By integrating renewable energy sources (RESs) with electric vehicles (EVs) in microgrids, we are able to reduce carbon emissions as well as alleviate the dependence on fossil fuels. In order to improve the economy of an integrated system and fully exploit the potentiality of EVs&rsquo; mobile energy storage while achieving a reasonable configuration of RESs, a cooperative optimization method is proposed to cooperatively optimize the economic dispatching and capacity allocation of both RESs and EVs in the context of a regional multi-microgrid system. An across-time-and-space energy transmission (ATSET) of the EVs was considered, and the impact of ATSET of EVs on economic dispatching and capacity allocation of multi-microgrid system was analyzed. In order to overcome the difficulty of finding the global optimum of the non-smooth total cost function, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm was used to solve the cooperative optimization problem. Case studies were performed, and the simulation results show that the proposed cooperative optimization method can significantly decrease the total cost of a multi-microgrid system.

AB  - Buildings play a critical role in the stability and resilience of modern smart grids, leading to a refocusing of large-scale energy-management strategies from the supply side to the consumer side. When buildings integrate local renewable-energy generation in the form of renewable-energy resources, they become prosumers, and this adds more complexity to the operation of interconnected complex energy systems. A class of methods of modelling the energy-consumption patterns of the building have recently emerged as black-box input&ndash;output approaches with the ability to capture underlying consumption trends. These make use and require large quantities of quality data produced by nondeterministic processes underlying energy consumption. We present an application of a class of neural networks, namely, deep-learning techniques for time-series sequence modelling, with the goal of accurate and reliable building energy-load forecasting. Recurrent Neural Network implementation uses Long Short-Term Memory layers in increasing density of nodes to quantify prediction accuracy. The case study is illustrated on four university buildings from temperate climates over one year of operation using a reference benchmarking dataset that allows replicable results. The obtained results are discussed in terms of accuracy metrics and computational and network architecture aspects, and are considered suitable for further use in future in situ energy management at the building and neighborhood levels.

In this study, we extract actionable insights from the CDR data and show that there exists a strong spatiotemporal predictability in real network traffic patterns. This knowledge can be leveraged by the mobile operators for effective network planning such as resource management and optimization. Motivated by this, we perform the spatiotemporal analysis of CDR data publicly available from Telecom Italia. Thus, on the basis of spatiotemporal insights, we propose a framework for mobile traffic classification. Experimental results show that the proposed model based on machine learning technique is able to accurately model and classify the network traffic patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of such insights for resource optimisation.

TI  - District Heating Load Prediction Algorithm Based on Feature Fusion LSTM Model
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 11
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The smart district heating system (SDHS) is an important element of the construction of smart cities in Northern China; it plays a significant role in meeting heating requirements and green energy saving in winter. Various Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and wireless transmission technologies are applied to monitor data in real-time and to form a historical database. The accurate prediction of heating loads based on massive historical datasets is the necessary condition and key basis for formulating an optimal heating control strategy in the SDHS, which contributes to the reduction in the consumption of energy and the improvement in the energy dispatching efficiency and accuracy. In order to achieve the high prediction accuracy of SDHS and to improve the representation ability of multi-time-scale features, a novel short-term heating load prediction algorithm based on a feature fusion long short-term memory (LSTM) model (FFLSTM) is proposed. Three characteristics, namely proximity, periodicity, and trend, are found after analyzing the heating load data from the aspect of the hourly time dimension. In order to comprehensively utilize the data&rsquo;s intrinsic characteristics, three LSTM models are employed to make separate predictions, and, then, the prediction results based on internal features and other external features at the corresponding moments are imported into the high-level LSTM model for fusion processing, which brings a more accurate prediction result of the heating load. Detailed comparisons between the proposed FFLSTM algorithm and the-state-of-art algorithms are conducted in this paper. The experimental results show that the proposed FFLSTM algorithm outperforms others and can obtain a higher prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the impact of selecting different parameters of the FFLSTM model is also studied thoroughly.

We explore the prediction approach using past data correlated with weather conditions. This approach will help the driver in the daily use of his electric vehicle, minimizing the problem of range anxiety, provide guidance towards charging spots with a probability value of being available for charging in a context for the app and smart cities. This work handles the uncertainty of the drivers to get a suitable and vacant place at a charging station because missing real-time information from the system and also during the driving process towards the free charging spot can be taken. We introduce a framework to allow collaboration and prediction process using past related data.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 11
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Audio event detection (AED) is a task of recognizing the types of audio events in an audio stream and estimating their temporal positions. AED is typically based on fully supervised approaches, requiring strong labels including both the presence and temporal position of each audio event. However, fully supervised datasets are not easily available due to the heavy cost of human annotation. Recently, weakly supervised approaches for AED have been proposed, utilizing large scale datasets with weak labels including only the occurrence of events in recordings. In this work, we introduce a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model called DSNet based on densely connected convolution networks (DenseNets) and squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) for weakly supervised training of AED. DSNet alleviates the vanishing-gradient problem and strengthens feature propagation and models interdependencies between channels. We also propose a structured prediction method for weakly supervised AED. We apply a recurrent neural network (RNN) based framework and a prediction smoothness cost function to consider long-term contextual information with reduced error propagation. In post-processing, conditional random fields (CRFs) are applied to take into account the dependency between segments and delineate the borders of audio events precisely. We evaluated our proposed models on the DCASE 2017 task 4 dataset and obtained state-of-the-art results on both audio tagging and event detection tasks.

In order to understand the flow of research, we conducted a central analysis, which is widely used in quantitative research relating to social network analysis, and performed cluster analysis to identify relationships with related research. The results of the analysis are represented in the form of network maps, and the role of each keyword was clarified based on these network maps. In addition, the overall flow explained the change of flow through discarded and emerging keywords, and the relationships with related fields were explained through cluster analysis. The findings could serve as a basis for policymakers, urban managers, and researchers seeking a comprehensive understanding of the smart city concept in urban planning areas.

VL  - 10
IS  - 6
SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) using deep neural networks has become a hot topic in human&ndash;computer interaction. Machines can effectively identify human naturalistic activities by learning from a large collection of sensor data. Activity recognition is not only an interesting research problem but also has many real-world practical applications. Based on the success of residual networks in achieving a high level of aesthetic representation of automatic learning, we propose a novel asymmetric residual network, named ARN. ARN is implemented using two identical path frameworks consisting of (1) a short time window, which is used to capture spatial features, and (2) a long time window, which is used to capture fine temporal features. The long time window path can be made very lightweight by reducing its channel capacity, while still being able to learn useful temporal representations for activity recognition. In this paper, we mainly focus on proposing a new model to improve the accuracy of HAR. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ARN model, we carried out extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e., OPPORTUNITY, UniMiB-SHAR) and compared the results with some conventional and state-of-the-art learning-based methods. We discuss the influence of networks parameters on performance to provide insights about its optimization. Results from our experiments show that ARN is effective in recognizing human activities via wearable datasets.

AB  - Big data and business analytics are trends that are positively impacting the business world. Past researches show that data generated in the modern world is huge and growing exponentially. These include structured and unstructured data that flood organizations daily. Unstructured data constitute the majority of the world&rsquo;s digital data and these include text files, web, and social media posts, emails, images, audio, movies, etc. The unstructured data cannot be managed in the traditional relational database management system (RDBMS). Therefore, data proliferation requires a rethinking of techniques for capturing, storing, and processing the data. This is the role big data has come to play. This paper, therefore, is aimed at increasing the attention of organizations and researchers to various applications and benefits of big data technology. The paper reviews and discusses, the recent trends, opportunities and pitfalls of big data and how it has enabled organizations to create successful business strategies and remain competitive, based on available literature. Furthermore, the review presents the various applications of big data and business analytics, data sources generated in these applications and their key characteristics. Finally, the review not only outlines the challenges for successful implementation of big data projects but also highlights the current open research directions of big data analytics that require further consideration. The reviewed areas of big data suggest that good management and manipulation of the large data sets using the techniques and tools of big data can deliver actionable insights that create business values.

AB  - Predicting the diffusion rule of toxic gas plays a distinctly important role in emergency capability assessment and rescue work. Among diffusion prediction models, the traditional artificial neural network has exhibited excellent performance not only in prediction accuracy but also in calculation time. Nevertheless, with the continuous development of deep learning and data science, some new prediction models based on deep learning algorithms have been shown to be more advantageous because their structure can better discover internal laws and external connections between input data and output data. The long short-term memory (LSTM) network is a kind of deep learning neural network that has demonstrated outstanding achievements in many prediction fields. This paper applies the LSTM network directly to the prediction of toxic gas diffusion and uses the Project Prairie Grass dataset to conduct experiments. Compared with the Gaussian diffusion model, support vector machine (SVM) model, and back propagation (BP) network model, the LSTM model of deep learning has higher prediction accuracy (especially for the prediction at the point of high concentration values) while avoiding the occurrence of negative concentration values and overfitting problems found in traditional artificial neural network models.

AB  - Monitoring the thermal behavior of distributed energy resources (DERs) network explores the dualism between thermal effects and electrical power flow. This paper proposes a design concept that monitors thermal conditions of DER grids, using ZigBee/GSM wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for real-time monitoring in rural and remote areas. The concept seeks to improve upon existing designs by integrating composite functions. The functions comprise temperature conditions monitoring, data acquisition, and wireless data transmission including data storage and abnormal conditions alert/notification for control solutions. Thus, the concept determines the thermal impact on the DERs integrated network. WSNs with temperature sensors LM35 are utilized to complement ZigBee and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technologies as a communication assisted link. Temperatures are measured from solar Photovoltaic PV modules, wind turbine, distribution cables, protection control units, and energy storage facilities. The ATMEGA328P microcontroller is assigned for signal and control processing. The circuit performance is coordinated and displayed on an LCD screen for normal conditions, whereas abnormal scenarios communicate through an alert/notification by GSM Short Message Service (SMS) protocol. The development analysis was performed through algorithm and circuit simulations. Proteus software was used for circuit design.

AB  - This study sought to propose a big data analysis and prediction model for transmission line tower outliers to assess when something is wrong with transmission line tower big data based on deep reinforcement learning. The model enables choosing automatic cluster K values based on non-labeled sensor big data. It also allows measuring the distance of action between data inside a cluster with the Q-value representing network output in the altered transmission line tower big data clustering algorithm containing transmission line tower outliers and old Deep Q Network.

It also proposed the A-Deep Q-Learning algorithm altered from the deep Q-Learning algorithm to explore policies based on the experiences of clustered data learning. It can be used to perform transmission line tower outlier data learning based on the distance of data within a cluster. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed model recorded an approximately 2.29%~4.19% higher prediction rate and around 0.8% ~ 4.3% higher accuracy rate compared to the old transmission line tower big data analysis model.

AB  - Celestial tourism, also known as astrotourism, astronomical tourism or, less frequently, star tourism, refers to people&rsquo;s interest in visiting places where celestial phenomena can be clearly observed. Stars, skygazing, meteor showers or comets, among other phenomena, arouse people&rsquo;s interest, however, good night sky conditions are required to observe such phenomena. From an environmental point of view, several organisations have surfaced in defence of the protection of dark night skies against light pollution, while from an economic point of view; the idea also opens new possibilities for development in associated areas. The quality of dark skies for celestial tourism can be measured by night sky brightness (NSB), which is used to quantify the visual perception of the sky, including several light sources at a specific point on earth. The aim of this research is to model the nocturnal sky brightness by training and testing a probabilistic model using real NSB data. ARIMA and artificial neural network models have been applied to open NSB data provided by the Globe at Night international programme, with the results of this first model approach being promising and opening up new possibilities for astrotourism. To the best of the authors&rsquo; knowledge, probabilistic models have not been applied to NSB forecasting.

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The counting of vehicles plays an important role in measuring the behavior patterns of traffic flow in cities, as streets and avenues can get crowded easily. To address this problem, some Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) have been implemented in order to count vehicles with already established video surveillance infrastructure. With this in mind, in this paper, we present an on-line learning methodology for counting vehicles in video sequences based on Incremental Principal Component Analysis (Incremental PCA). This incremental learning method allows us to identify the maximum variability (i.e., motion detection) between a previous block of frames and the actual one by using only the first projected eigenvector. Once the projected image is obtained, we apply dynamic thresholding to perform image binarization. Then, a series of post-processing steps are applied to enhance the binary image containing the objects in motion. Finally, we count the number of vehicles by implementing a virtual detection line in each of the road lanes. These lines determine the instants where the vehicles pass completely through them. Results show that our proposed methodology is able to count vehicles with 96.6% accuracy at 26 frames per second on average&mdash;dealing with both camera jitter and sudden illumination changes caused by the environment and the camera auto exposure.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 13
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - This paper studies the problem of generating cooperative feasible paths for formation rendezvous of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Cooperative path-planning for multi-UAV formation rendezvous is mostly a complicated multi-objective optimization problem with many coupled constraints. In order to satisfy the kinematic constraints, i.e., the maximum curvature constraint and the requirement of continuous curvature of the UAV path, the Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curve is adopted as the parameterized path because of its curvature continuity and rational intrinsic properties. Inspired by the co-evolutionary theory, a distributed cooperative particle swarm optimization (DCPSO) algorithm with an elite keeping strategy is proposed to generate a flyable and safe path for each UAV. This proposed algorithm can meet the kinematic constraints of UAVs and the cooperation requirements among UAVs. Meanwhile, the optimal or sub-optimal paths can be obtained. Finally, numerical simulations in 2-D and 3-D environments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and stability of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the paths generated by the proposed DCPSO can not only meet the kinematic constraints of UAVs and safety requirements, but also achieve the simultaneous arrival and collision avoidance between UAVs for formation rendezvous. Compared with the cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA), the proposed DCPSO has better stability and a higher searching success rate.

AB  - Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.

AB  - Air Conditioners (AC) impact in overall electricity consumption in buildings is very high. Therefore, controlling ACs power consumption is a significant factor for demand response. With the advancement in the area of demand side management techniques implementation and smart grid, precise AC load forecasting for electrical utilities and end-users is required. In this paper, big data analysis and its applications in power systems is introduced. After this, various load forecasting categories and various techniques applied for load forecasting in context of big data analysis in power systems have been explored. Then, Levenberg&ndash;Marquardt Algorithm (LMA)-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for residential AC short-term load forecasting is presented. This forecasting approach utilizes past hourly temperature observations and AC load as input variables for assessment. Different performance assessment indices have also been investigated. Error formulations have shown that LMA-based ANN presents better results in comparison to Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) and statistical regression approach. Furthermore, information of AC load is obtainable for different time horizons like weekly, hourly, and monthly bases due to better prediction accuracy of LMA-based ANN, which is helpful for efficient demand response (DR) implementation.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 13
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In this study, a novel technique to support smart city planning in estimating and controlling the heating load (HL) of buildings, was proposed, namely PSO-XGBoost. Accordingly, the extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost) was developed to estimate HL first; then, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was applied to optimize the performance of the XGBoost model. The classical XGBoost model, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Gaussian process (GP), and classification and regression trees (CART) models were also investigated and developed to predict the HL of building systems, and compared with the proposed PSO-XGBoost model; 837 investigations of buildings were considered and analyzed with many influential factors, such as glazing area distribution (GAD), glazing area (GA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), and relative compactness (RC). Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), variance account for (VAF), mean absolute error (MAE), and determination coefficient (R2), were used as the statistical criteria for evaluating the performance of the above models. The color intensity, as well as the ranking method, were also used to compare and evaluate the models. The results showed that the proposed PSO-XGBoost model was the most robust technique for estimating the HL of building systems. The remaining models (i.e., XGBoost, SVM, RF, GP, and CART) yielded more mediocre performance through RMSE, MAE, R2, VAF, and MAPE metrics. Another finding of this study also indicated that OH, RA, WA, and SA were the most critical parameters for the accuracy of the proposed PSO-XGBoost model. They should be particularly interested in smart city planning as well as the optimization of smart cities.

AB  - Smart cities can effectively improve the quality of urban life. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is an important part of smart cities. The accurate and real-time prediction of traffic flow plays an important role in ITSs. To improve the prediction accuracy, we propose a novel traffic flow prediction method, called AutoEncoder Long Short-Term Memory (AE-LSTM) prediction method. In our method, the AutoEncoder is used to obtain the internal relationship of traffic flow by extracting the characteristics of upstream and downstream traffic flow data. Moreover, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network utilizes the acquired characteristic data and the historical data to predict complex linear traffic flow data. The experimental results show that the AE-LSTM method had higher prediction accuracy. Specifically, the Mean Relative Error (MRE) of the AE-LSTM was reduced by 0.01 compared with the previous prediction methods. In addition, AE-LSTM method also had good stability. For different stations and different dates, the prediction error and fluctuation of the AE-LSTM method was small. Furthermore, the average MRE of AE-LSTM prediction results was 0.06 for six different days.

AB  - In recent years, air pollution has become an important public health concern. The high concentration of fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) is known to be associated with lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and metabolic disease. Predicting PM2.5 concentrations can help governments warn people at high risk, thus mitigating the complications. Although attempts have been made to predict PM2.5 concentrations, the factors influencing PM2.5 prediction have not been investigated. In this work, we study feature importance for PM2.5 prediction in Tehran’s urban area, implementing random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and deep learning machine learning (ML) approaches. We use 23 features, including satellite and meteorological data, ground-measured PM2.5, and geographical data, in the modeling. The best model performance obtained was R2 = 0.81 (R = 0.9), MAE = 9.93 µg/m3, and RMSE = 13.58 µg/m3 using the XGBoost approach, incorporating elimination of unimportant features. However, all three ML methods performed similarly and R2 varied from 0.63 to 0.67, when Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 3 km resolution was included, and 0.77 to 0.81, when AOD at 3 km resolution was excluded. Contrary to the PM2.5 lag data, satellite-derived AODs did not improve model performance.

AB  - Advances in embedded electronic systems, the development of new communication protocols, and the application of artificial intelligence paradigms have enabled the improvement of current automation systems of energy management. Embedded devices integrate different sensors with connectivity, computing resources, and reduced cost. Communication and cloud services increase their performance; however, there are limitations in the implementation of these technologies. If the cloud is used as the main source of services and resources, overload problems will occur. There are no models that facilitate the complete integration and interoperability in the facilities already created. This article proposes a model for the integration of smart energy management systems in new and already created facilities, using local embedded devices, Internet of Things communication protocols and services based on artificial intelligence paradigms. All services are distributed in the new smart grid network using edge and fog computing techniques. The model proposes an architecture both to be used as support for the development of smart services and for energy management control systems adapted to the installation: a group of buildings and/or houses that shares energy management and energy generation. Machine learning to predict consumption and energy generation, electric load classification, energy distribution control, and predictive maintenance are the main utilities integrated. As an experimental case, a facility that incorporates wind and solar generation is used for development and testing. Smart grid facilities, designed with artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented with Internet of Things protocols, and embedded control devices facilitate the development, cost reduction, and the integration of new services. In this work, a method to design, develop, and install smart services in self-consumption facilities is proposed. New smart services with reduced costs are installed and tested, confirming the advantages of the proposed model.

AB  - A new generation of smart meters are called cognitive meters, which are essentially based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and load disaggregation methods for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). Thus, modern NILM may recognize appliances connected to the grid during certain periods, while providing much more information than the traditional monthly consumption. Therefore, this article presents a new load disaggregation methodology with microscopic characteristics collected from current and voltage waveforms. Initially, the novel NILM algorithm&mdash;called the Power Signature Blob (PSB)&mdash;makes use of a state machine to detect when the appliance has been turned on or off. Then, machine learning is used to identify the appliance, for which attributes are extracted from the Conservative Power Theory (CPT), a contemporary power theory that enables comprehensive load modeling. Finally, considering simulation and experimental results, this paper shows that the new method is able to achieve 95% accuracy considering the applied data set.

AB  - The edge platform has evolved to become a part of a distributed computing environment. While typical edges do not have enough processing power to train machine learning models in real time, it is common to generate models in the cloud for use on the edge. The pattern of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) data is dependent on individual circumstances. It is not easy to guarantee prediction performance when a monolithic model is used without considering the spatial characteristics of the space generating those data. In this paper, we propose a collaborative framework using a new method to select the best model for the edge from candidate models of cloud based on sample data correlation. This method lets the edge use the most suitable model without any training tasks on the edge side, and it also minimizes privacy issues. We apply the proposed method to predict future fine particulate matter concentration in an individual space. The results suggest that our method can provide better performance than the previous method.

AB  - Recent innovations in 3D processing and availability of geospatial data have contributed largely to more comprehensive solutions to data visualization. As various data formats are utilized to describe the data, a combination of layers from different sources allow us to represent 3D urban areas, contributing to ideas of emergency management and smart cities. This work focuses on 3D urban environment reconstruction using crowdsourced OpenStreetMap data. Once the data are extracted, the visualization pipeline draws features using coloring for added context. Moreover, by structuring the layers and entities through the addition of simulation parameters, the generated environment is made simulation ready for further use. Results show that urban areas can be properly visualized in 3D using OpenStreetMap data given data availability. The simulation-ready environment was tested using hypothetical flooding scenarios, which demonstrated that the added parameters can be utilized in environmental simulations. Furthermore, an efficient restructuring of data was implemented for viewing the city information once the data are parsed.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - There are few network resources in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs). Compressing media data can reduce the reliance of user&rsquo;s Quality of Experience (QoE) on network resources. Existing video coding software, such as H.264 and H.265, focuses only on spatial and short-term information redundancy. However, video usually contains redundancy over a long period of time. Therefore, compressing video information redundancy with a long period of time without compromising the user experience and adaptive delivery is a challenge in WMSNs. In this paper, a semantic-aware super-resolution transmission for adaptive video streaming system (SASRT) for WMSNs is presented. In the SASRT, some deep learning algorithms are used to extract video semantic information and enrich the video quality. On the multimedia sensor, different bit-rate semantic information and video data are encoded and uploaded to user. Semantic information can also be identified on the user side, further reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred. However, identifying semantic information on the user side may increase the computational cost of the user side. On the user side, video quality is enriched with super-resolution technologies. The major challenges faced by SASRT include where the semantic information is identified, how to choose the bit rates of semantic and video information, and how network resources should be allocated to video and semantic information. The optimization problem is formulated as a complexity-constrained nonlinear NP-hard problem. Three adaptive strategies and a heuristic algorithm are proposed to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that SASRT can compress video information redundancy with a long period of time effectively and enrich the user experience with limited network resources while simultaneously improving the utilization of these network resources.

AB  - Efficient and reliable systems are required to detect and monitor disasters such as wildfires as well as to notify the people in the disaster-affected areas. Internet of Things (IoT) is the key paradigm that can address the multitude problems related to disaster management. In addition, an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled IoT platform connected via cellular network can further enhance the robustness of the disaster management system. The UAV-enabled IoT platform is based on three main research areas: (i) ground IoT network; (ii) communication technologies for ground and aerial connectivity; and (iii) data analytics. In this paper, we provide a holistic view of a UAVs-enabled IoT platform which can provide ubiquitous connectivity to both aerial and ground users in challenging environments such as wildfire management. We then highlight key challenges for the design of an efficient and reliable IoT platform. We detail a case study targeting the design of an efficient ground IoT network that can detect and monitor fire and send notifications to people using named data networking (NDN) architecture. The use of NDN architecture in a sensor network for IoT integrates pull-based communication to enable reliable and efficient message dissemination in the network and to notify the users as soon as possible in case of disastrous situations. The results of the case study show the enormous impact on the performance of IoT platform for wildfire management. Lastly, we draw the conclusion and outline future research directions in this field.

AB  - The ubiquity of smartphones and the growth of computing resources, such as connectivity, processing, portability, and power of sensing, have greatly changed people&rsquo;s lives. Today, many smartphones contain a variety of powerful sensors, including motion, location, network, and direction sensors. Motion or inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer), specifically, have been widely used to recognize users&rsquo; physical activities. This has opened doors for many different and interesting applications in several areas, such as health and transportation. In this perspective, this work provides a comprehensive, state of the art review of the current situation of human activity recognition (HAR) solutions in the context of inertial sensors in smartphones. This article begins by discussing the concepts of human activities along with the complete historical events, focused on smartphones, which shows the evolution of the area in the last two decades. Next, we present a detailed description of the HAR methodology, focusing on the presentation of the steps of HAR solutions in the context of inertial sensors. For each step, we cite the main references that use the best implementation practices suggested by the scientific community.

AB  - The use of UAVs in areas ranging from agriculture over urban services to entertainment or simply as a hobby has rapidly grown over the last years. Regarding serious/commercial applications, UAVs have been considered in the literature, especially as mobile sensing/actuation platforms (i.e., as a delivery platform for an increasingly wide range of sensors and actuators). With regard to timely, cost-effective and very rich data acquisition, both, NEC Research as well as TNO are pursuing investigations into the use of UAVs and swarms of UAVs for scenarios where high-resolution requirements, prohibiting environments or tight time constraints render traditional approaches ineffective. In this review article, we provide a brief overview of safety and security-focused application areas that we identified as main targets for industrial and commercial projects, especially in the context of intelligent autonomous systems and autonomous/semi-autonomously operating swarms. We discuss a number of challenges related to the deployment of UAVs in general and to their deployment within the identified application areas in particular. As such, this article is meant to serve as a review and overview of the literature and the state-of-the-art, but also to offer an outlook over our possible (near-term) future work and the challenges that we will face there.

AB  - Non&ndash;intrusive load monitoring based on power measurements is a promising topic of appliance identification in the research of smart grid; where the key is to avoid the power sub-item measurement in load monitoring. In this paper; a three&ndash;step non&ndash;intrusive load monitoring system (TNILM) is proposed. Firstly; a one dimension convolution neural network (CNN) is constructed based on the structure of GoogLeNet with 2D convolution; which can zoom in on the differences in features between the different appliances; and then effectively extract various transient features of appliances. Secondly; comparing with various classifiers; the Linear Programming boosting with adaptive weights and thresholds (ALPBoost) is proposed and applied to recognize single&ndash;appliance and multiple&ndash;appliance. Thirdly; an update process is adopted to adjust and balance the parameters between the one dimension CNN and ALPBoost on&ndash;line. The TNILM is tested on a real&ndash;world power consumption dataset; which comprises single or multiple appliances potentially operated simultaneously. The experiment result shows the effectiveness of the proposed method in both identification rates.

AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) pedestrian tracking is one of the major issues in computer vision. Mean-shift is a powerful and versatile non-parametric iterative algorithm for finding local maxima in probability distributions. In existing infrared data, and mean-shift-based tracking is generally based on the brightness feature values. Unfortunately, the brightness is distorted by the target and background variations. This paper proposes a novel pedestrian tracking algorithm, thermal infrared mean-shift (TIR-MS), by introducing radiometric temperature data in mean-shift tracking. The thermal brightness image (eight-bits) was distorted by the automatic contrast enhancement of the scene such as hot objects in the background. On the other hand, the temperature data was unaffected directly by the background change, except for variations by the seasonal effect, which is more stable than the brightness. The experimental results showed that the TIR-MS outperformed the original mean-shift-based brightness when tracking a pedestrian head with successive background variations.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now considered one of the best remote sensing techniques for gathering data over large areas. They are now being used in the industry sector as sensing tools for proactively solving or preventing many issues, besides quantifying production and helping to make decisions. UAVs are a highly consistent technological platform for efficient and cost-effective data collection and event monitoring. The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) sends data from systems that monitor and control the physical world to data processing systems that cloud computing has shown to be important tools for meeting processing requirements. In fog computing, the IoT gateway links different objects to the internet. It can operate as a joint interface for different networks and support different communication protocols. A great deal of effort has been put into developing UAVs and multi-UAV systems. This paper introduces a smart IIoT monitoring and control system based on an unmanned aerial vehicle that uses cloud computing services and exploits fog computing as the bridge between IIoT layers. Its novelty lies in the fact that the UAV is automatically integrated into an industrial control system through an IoT gateway platform, while UAV photos are systematically and instantly computed and analyzed in the cloud. Visual supervision of the plant by drones and cloud services is integrated in real-time into the control loop of the industrial control system. As a proof of concept, the platform was used in a case study in an industrial concrete plant. The results obtained clearly illustrate the feasibility of the proposed platform in providing a reliable and efficient system for UAV remote control to improve product quality and reduce waste. For this, we studied the communication latency between the different IIoT layers in different IoT gateways.

Today, there are evidences of an emerging research field, rooted in quantum optics, where the technological trajectories of deep neural networks (DNNs) and nanophotonics are crossing each other. This paper elaborates on these topics and proposes a theoretical architecture for a Complex DNN made from programmable metasurfaces; an example is also provided showing a striking correspondence between the equivariance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the invariance principle of gauge transformations.

VL  - 12

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The pervasive and increasing deployment of smart meters allows collecting a huge amount of fine-grained energy data in different urban scenarios. The analysis of such data is challenging and opening up a variety of interesting and new research issues across energy and computer science research areas. The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches. This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption. SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets. As a case study, SPEC has been tested on real data of an heating distribution network and power consumption data collected in a major Italian city. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SPEC to forecast both fine-grained values and coarse levels of power consumption of buildings.

TI  - Computation of Psycho-Acoustic Annoyance Using Deep Neural Networks

VL  - 9
IS  - 15
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Psycho-acoustic parameters have been extensively used to evaluate the discomfort or pleasure produced by the sounds in our environment. In this context, wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) can be an interesting solution for monitoring subjective annoyance in certain soundscapes, since they can be used to register the evolution of such parameters in time and space. Unfortunately, the calculation of the psycho-acoustic parameters involved in common annoyance models implies a significant computational cost, and makes difficult the acquisition and transmission of these parameters at the nodes. As a result, monitoring psycho-acoustic annoyance becomes an expensive and inefficient task. This paper proposes the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large urban sound dataset capable of efficiently predicting psycho-acoustic annoyance from raw audio signals continuously. We evaluate the proposed regression model and compare the resulting computation times with the ones obtained by the conventional direct calculation approach. The results confirm that the proposed model based on CNN achieves high precision in predicting psycho-acoustic annoyance, predicting annoyance values with an average quadratic error of around 3%. It also achieves a very significant reduction in processing time, which is up to 300 times faster than direct calculation, making CNN designed a clear exponent to work in IoT devices.

AB  - An exemplary paradigm of how an AI can be a disruptive technological paragon via the utilization of blockchain comes straight from the world of deep learning. Data scientists have long struggled to maintain the quality of a dataset for machine learning by an AI entity. Datasets can be very expensive to purchase, as, depending on both the proper selection of the elements and the homogeneity of the data contained within, constructing and maintaining the integrity of a dataset is difficult. Blockchain as a highly secure storage medium presents a technological quantum leap in maintaining data integrity. Furthermore, blockchain&rsquo;s immutability constructs a fruitful environment for creating high quality, permanent and growing datasets for deep learning. The combination of AI and blockchain could impact fields like Internet of things (IoT), identity, financial markets, civil governance, smart cities, small communities, supply chains, personalized medicine and other fields, and thereby deliver benefits to many people.

SN  - 2076-3387

AB  - Social investment programs are designed to provide opportunities to the less privileged so that they can contribute to the socioeconomic development of society. Stakeholders in social safety net programs (SSNPs) target vulnerable groups, such as the urban poor, women, the unemployed, and the elderly, with initiatives that have a transformative impact. Inadequate policy awareness remains a challenge, resulting in low participation rates in SSNPs. To achieve all-inclusive development, deliberate policies and programs that target this population have to be initiated by government, corporate bodies, and public-minded individuals. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques could play an important role in improving the managerial decision support and policy-making process of SSNPs and increasing the social resilience of urban populations. To enhance managerial decision-making in social investment programs, we used a Bayesian network to develop an intelligent decision support system called the Social Safety Net Expert System (SSNES). Using the SSNES, we provide an advisory system to stakeholders who make management decisions, which clearly demonstrates the efficacy of SSNPs and inclusive development.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - The blockchain technique is becoming more and more popular due to its advantages such as stability and dispersed nature. This is an idea based on blockchain activity paradigms. Another important field is machine learning, which is increasingly used in practice. Unfortunately, the training or overtraining artificial neural networks is very time-consuming and requires high computing power. In this paper, we proposed using a blockchain technique to train neural networks. This type of activity is important due to the possible search for initial weights in the network, which affect faster training, due to gradient decrease. We performed the tests with much heavier calculations to indicate that such an action is possible. However, this type of solution can also be used for less demanding calculations, i.e., only a few iterations of training and finding a better configuration of initial weights.

AB  - The IoT describes a development field where new approaches and trends are in constant change. In this scenario, new devices and sensors are offering higher precision in everyday life in an increasingly less invasive way. In this work, we propose the use of spatial-temporal features by means of fuzzy logic as a general descriptor for heterogeneous sensors. This fuzzy sensor representation is highly efficient and enables devices with low computing power to develop learning and evaluation tasks in activity recognition using light and efficient classifiers. To show the methodology&rsquo;s potential in real applications, we deploy an intelligent environment where new UWB location devices, inertial objects, wearable devices, and binary sensors are connected with each other and describe daily human activities. We then apply the proposed fuzzy logic-based methodology to obtain spatial-temporal features to fuse the data from the heterogeneous sensor devices. A case study developed in the UJAmISmart Lab of the University of Jaen (Jaen, Spain) shows the encouraging performance of the methodology when recognizing the activity of an inhabitant using efficient classifiers.

AB  - The market for electric vehicles (EVs) has grown with each year, and EVs are considered to be a proper solution for the mitigation of urban pollution. So far, not much attention has been devoted to the use of EVs for public transportation, such as taxis and buses. However, a massive introduction of electric taxis (ETs) and electric buses (EBs) could generate issues in the grid. The challenges are different from those of private EVs, as their required load is much higher and the related time constraints must be considered with much more attention. These issues have begun to be studied within the last few years. This paper presents a review of the different approaches that have been proposed by various authors, to mitigate the impact of EBs and ETs on the future smart grid. Furthermore, some projects with regard to the integration of ETs and EBs around the world are presented. Some guidelines for future works are also proposed.

AB  - Intelligent infrastructure, including smart cities and intelligent buildings, must learn and adapt to the variable needs and requirements of users, owners and operators in order to be future proof and to provide a return on investment based on Operational Expenditure (OPEX) and Capital Expenditure (CAPEX). To address this challenge, this article presents a biological algorithm based on neural networks and deep reinforcement learning that enables infrastructure to be intelligent by making predictions about its different variables. In addition, the proposed method makes decisions based on real time data. Intelligent infrastructure must be able to proactively monitor, protect and repair itself: this includes independent components and assets working the same way any autonomous biological organisms would. Neurons of artificial neural networks are associated with a prediction or decision layer based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that takes into consideration all of its previous learning. The proposed method was validated against an intelligent infrastructure dataset with outstanding results: the intelligent infrastructure was able to learn, predict and adapt to its variables, and components could make relevant decisions autonomously, emulating a living biological organism in which data flow exhaustively.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - To build sustainable smart energy cities (SECs) around the world, many countries are now combining customized services and businesses within their energy infrastructure and urban environments. Such changes could then promote the development of platforms that ultimately provide benefits for citizens such as convenience, safety, and cost savings. Currently, the development of technologies for SECs focuses on independent products and unit technology. However, this is problematic, as it may not be possible to develop sustainable cities if there is a lack of connectivity between various elements within the SEC. To solve such problems, this paper presents an AI-based physical and virtual platform using a 5-layer architecture to develop a sustainable smart energy city (SSEC). The architecture employs both a top-down and bottom-up approach and the links between each energy element in the SSEC can readily be analyzed. The economic analysis based on return on investment (ROI) is carried out by comparing the economic benefits before and after the application of this system. Deploying the proposed platform will enable the speedy development and application of new services for SSECs and will provide SSECs with measures to ensure sustainable development, such as rapid urban development, and cost reductions.

AB  - Bats have an important role in the ecosystem, and therefore an effective detection of their prevalence can contribute to their conservation. At present, the most commonly methodology used in the study of bats is the analysis of echolocation calls. However, many other ultrasound signals can be simultaneously recorded, and this makes species location and identification a long and difficult task. This field of research could be greatly improved through the use of bioacoustics which provide a more accurate automated detection, identification and count of the wildlife of a particular area. We have analyzed the calls of two bat species&mdash;Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus&mdash;both of which are common types of bats frequently found in the Iberian Peninsula. These two cryptic species are difficult to identify by their morphological features, but are more easily identified by their echolocation calls. The real-life audio files have been obtained by an Echo Meter Touch Pro 1 bat detector. Time-expanded recordings of calls were first classified manually by means of their frequency, duration and interpulse interval. In this paper, we first detail the creation of a dataset with three classes, which are the two bat species but also the silent intervals. This dataset can be useful to work in mixed species environment. Afterwards, two automatic bat detection and identification machine learning approaches are described, in a laboratory environment, which represent the previous step to real-life in an urban scenario. The priority in that approaches design is the identification using short window analysis in order to detect each bat pulse. However, given that we are concerned with the risks of automatic identification, the main aim of the project is to accelerate the manual ID process for the specialists in the field. The dataset provided will help researchers develop automatic recognition systems for a more accurate identification of the bat species in a laboratory environment, and in a near future, in an urban environment, where those two bat species are common.

AB  - This paper presents a potential solution to fill a gap in both research and practice that there are few interactions between transnational industry cooperation (TIC) and transnational university cooperation (TUC) in transnational innovation ecosystems. To strengthen the synergies between TIC and TUC for innovation, the first step is to match suitable industrial firms from two countries for collaboration through their common connections to transnational university/academic partnerships. Our proposed matching solution is based on the integration of social science theories and specific artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. While the insights of social sciences, e.g., innovation studies and social network theory, have potential to answer the question of why TIC and TUC should be looked at as synergetic entities with elaborated conceptualization, the method of machine learning, as one specific technic off AI, can help answer the question of how to realize that synergy. On the way towards a transdisciplinary approach to TIC and TUC synergy building, or creating transnational university-industry co-innovation networks, the paper takes an initial step by examining what the supports and gaps of existing studies on the topic are, and using the context of EU&ndash;China science, technology and innovation cooperation as a testbed. This is followed by the introduction of our proposed approach and our suggestions for future research.

AB  - The accurate measurement of pipeline centerline coordinates is of great significance to the management of oil and gas pipelines and energy transportation security. The main method for pipeline centerline measurement is in-line inspection technology based on multi-sensor data fusion, which combines the inertial measurement unit (IMU), above-ground marker, and odometer. However, the observation of velocity is not accurate because the odometer often slips in the actual inspection, which greatly affects the accuracy of centerline measurement. In this paper, we propose a new compensation method for oil and gas pipeline centerline measurement based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network during the occurrence of odometer slip. The field test results indicated that the mean of absolute position errors reduced from 8.75 to 2.02 m. The proposed method could effectively reduce the errors and improve the accuracy of pipeline centerline measurement during odometer slips.

The main result of this study is the production of a model capable of predicting the bias to act in a specific context. We studied the relationship between emotions and the probability of acting or correcting the system. The main area of interest of these issues is the ability to influence in advance the personnel to make their work more efficient and productive.

AB  - In recent years, the contrast against energy waste and pollution has become mandatory and widely endorsed. Among the many actors at stake, the building sector energy management is one of the most critical. Indeed, buildings are responsible for     40 %     of total energy consumption only in Europe, affecting more than a third of the total pollution produced. Therefore, energy control policies of buildings (for example, forecast-based policies such as Demand Response and Demand Side Management) play a decisive role in reducing energy waste. On these premises, this paper presents an innovative methodology based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology for smart building indoor air-temperature forecasting. In detail, our methodology exploits a specialized Non-linear Autoregressive neural network for short- and medium-term predictions, envisioning two different exploitation: (i) on realistic artificial data and (ii) on real data collected by IoT devices deployed in the building. For this purpose, we designed and optimized four neural models, focusing respectively on three characterizing rooms and on the whole building. Experimental results on both a simulated and a real sensors dataset demonstrate the prediction accuracy and robustness of our proposed models.

AB  - We propose a high-performance algorithm while using a promoted and modified form of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, which is based on the TensorFlow framework, to enhance the real-time monitoring of traffic-flow problems by an intelligent transportation system. Real-time detection and traffic-flow statistics were realized by adjusting the network structure, optimizing the loss function, and introducing weight regularization. This model, which we call YOLO-UA, was initialized based on the weight of a YOLO model pre-trained while using the VOC2007 data set. The UA-CAR data set with complex weather conditions was used for training, and better model parameters were selected through tests and subsequent adjustments. The experimental results showed that, for different weather scenarios, the accuracy of the YOLO-UA was ~22% greater than that of the YOLO model before optimization, and the recall rate increased by about 21%. On both cloudy and sunny days, the accuracy, precision, and recall rate of the YOLO-UA model were more than 94% above the floating rate, which suggested that the precision and recall rate achieved a good balance. When used for video testing, the YOLO-UA model yielded traffic statistics with an accuracy of up to 100%; the time to count the vehicles in each frame was less than 30 ms and it was highly robust in response to changes in scenario and weather.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Urban development in recent decades has had a significant impact on climate change. Cities have implemented traffic monitoring systems to sustain the new building code in meeting the target for environmental indicators. Timisoara is the second city in Romania and manages over 60% of the development and pollution of Timis County. The analysis of large volumes of data provided by local sensors and databases requires big data analytics. In this research, for the first time, we simultaneously developed two parallel scenario-based decision-making support models to assess a CO2 sequestration index. The model is based on a tree inventory for traffic area and car flow using Roegenian processes with borders. The first scenario (dt1) analyzes the real O2-pollution car flows for process streets as receivers of pollution. The second scenario (dt2) analyzes O2-pollution flows for the same streets from the perspective of streets that garage the cars. We modeled the parallel integration of actual O2 production and pollution flows for 160 main streets that account for over 50% of the urban mileage of Timisoara city. The carbon sequestration indexes of the streets are in the range of 0.0000043&ndash;0.437 (dt1) and 0.0000092&ndash;11.78 (dt2). The results can be used to support local decision making regarding the environment CO2-O2 balances by optimizing the local fiscal policies. The research could be extended to secondary streets and separately for the pollution of heating-cooling devices for residential building areas.

VL  - 9
IS  - 18
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The need to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, as well as the use of local renewable heat sources has caused heat meters to be used not only to calculate the consumed energy, but also for the active management of central heating systems. Increasing the reading frequency and the use of measurement data to control the heating system expands the requirements for the reliability of heat meters. The aim of the research is to analyze a large set of meters in the real network and predict their faults to avoid inaccurate readings, incorrect billing, heating system disruption, and unnecessary maintenance. The reliability analysis of heat meters, based on historical data collected over several years, shows some regularities, which cannot be easily described by physics-based models. The failure rate is almost constant and does depend on the past, but is a non-linear combination of state variables. To predict meters&rsquo; failures in the next billing period, three independent machine learning models are implemented and compared with selected metrics, because even the high performance of a single model (87% true positive for neural network) may be insufficient to make a maintenance decision. Additionally, performing hyperparameter optimization boosts the models&rsquo; performance by a few percent. Finally, three improved models are used to build an ensemble classifier, which outperforms the individual models. The proposed procedure ensures the high efficiency of fault detection (&gt;95%), while maintaining overfitting at the minimum level. The methodology is universal and can be utilized to study the reliability and predict faults of other types of meters and different objects with the constant failure rate.

AB  - In realizing the network environment assumed by the Internet-of-Things, network slicing has drawn considerable attention as a way to enhance the utilization of physical networks (PNs). Meanwhile, slicing has been shown to cause interdependence among sliced virtual networks (VNs) by propagating traffic fluctuations from one network to others. However, for interconnected networks with mutual dependencies, known as a network of networks (NoN), finding a reliable design method that can cope with environmental changes is an important issue that is yet to be addressed. Some NoN models exist that describe the behavior of interdependent networks in complex systems, and previous studies have shown that an NoN model based on the functional networks of the brain can achieve high robustness, but its application to dynamic and practical systems is yet to be considered. Consequently, this paper proposes the Physical&ndash;Virtual NoN (PV-NoN) model assuming a network-slicing environment. This model defines an NoN availability state to deal with traffic fluctuations and interdependence among a PN and VNs. Further, we assume three basic types of interdependence among VNs for this model. Simulation experiments confirm that the one applying complementary interdependence inspired by brain functional networks achieves high availability and communication performance while preventing interference among the VNs. Also investigated is a method for designing a reliable network structure for the PV-NoN model. To this end, the deployment of network influencers (i.e., the most influential elements over the entire network) is configured from the perspective of intra/internetwork assortativity. Simulation experiments confirm that availability or communication performance is improved when each VN is formed assortatively or disassortatively, respectively. Regarding internetwork assortativity, both the availability and communication performance are improved when the influencers are deployed disassortatively among the VNs.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 18
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Traffic sign detection and recognition are crucial in the development of intelligent vehicles. An improved traffic sign detection and recognition algorithm for intelligent vehicles is proposed to address problems such as how easily affected traditional traffic sign detection is by the environment, and poor real-time performance of deep learning-based methodologies for traffic sign recognition. Firstly, the HSV color space is used for spatial threshold segmentation, and traffic signs are effectively detected based on the shape features. Secondly, the model is considerably improved on the basis of the classical LeNet-5 convolutional neural network model by using Gabor kernel as the initial convolutional kernel, adding the batch normalization processing after the pooling layer and selecting Adam method as the optimizer algorithm. Finally, the traffic sign classification and recognition experiments are conducted based on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. The favorable prediction and accurate recognition of traffic signs are achieved through the continuous training and testing of the network model. Experimental results show that the accurate recognition rate of traffic signs reaches 99.75%, and the average processing time per frame is 5.4 ms. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm has remarkable accuracy and real-time performance, strong generalization ability and high training efficiency. The accurate recognition rate and average processing time are markedly improved. This improvement is of considerable importance to reduce the accident rate and enhance the road traffic safety situation, providing a strong technical guarantee for the steady development of intelligent vehicle driving assistance.

AB  - The tremendous increase in the urban population highlights the need for more efficient transport systems and techniques to alleviate the increasing number of the resulting traffic-associated problems. Modeling and predicting road traffic flow are a critical part of intelligent transport systems (ITSs). Therefore, their accuracy and efficiency have a direct impact on the overall functioning. In this scope, a new approach for predicting the road traffic flow is proposed that combines the Petri nets model with a dynamic estimation of intersection turning movement counts to ensure a more accurate assessment of its performance. Thus, this manuscript extends our work by introducing a new feature, namely turning movement counts, to attain a better prediction of road traffic flow. A simulation study is conducted to get a better understanding of how predictive models perform in the context of estimating turning movements.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In emergency scenarios service vehicles must identify potential route(s) and use the best available route. However, route identification requires intelligent decision-support systems which generally use non-traditional approaches with tools characterised by flexible non-hierarchical structures. Conventional models using group decision-support systems have been applied; however, when used in smart urban environments, emergency response services have limitations in their ability to identify unobstructed paths (routes) in dynamic operating environments. In this paper we introduce a novel path planning method for autonomous vehicle control in emergency situations. The proposed model uses self-organizing maps in an integrated Spiral STC algorithm termed the: Hybrid SOM-Spiral STC model which uses hedge algebras and Kansei evaluation in group decision-support. The proposed model has been designed to quantify qualitative factors using sensor derived data processed with human sensibilities and preferences in emergency decision support. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves significant improvements in group decision-support under dynamic uncertainty. We posit that our novel approach holds the prospect of improvements in the provision of emergency services.

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach to Bridge-Damage Detection Using Responses Measured on a Passing Vehicle
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 18
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper proposes a new two-stage machine learning approach for bridge damage detection using the responses measured on a passing vehicle. In the first stage, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained using the vehicle responses measured from multiple passes (training data set) over a healthy bridge. The vehicle acceleration or Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) spectrum of the acceleration is used. The vehicle response is predicted from its speed for multiple passes (monitoring data set) over the bridge. Root-mean-square error is used to calculate the prediction error, which indicates the differences between the predicted and measured responses for each passage. In the second stage of the proposed method, a damage indicator is defined using a Gaussian process that detects the changes in the distribution of the prediction errors. It is suggested that if the bridge condition is healthy, the distribution of the prediction errors will remain low. A recognizable change in the distribution might indicate a damage in the bridge. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated using numerical case studies of vehicle&ndash;bridge interaction. It was demonstrated that the approach could successfully detect the damage in the presence of road roughness profile and measurement noise, even for low damage levels.

AB  - It is widely recognized that nanoscience and nanotechnology and their subfields, such as nanophotonics, nanoelectronics, and nanomechanics, have had a tremendous impact on recent advances in sensing, imaging, and communication, with notable developments, including novel transistors and processor architectures. For example, in addition to being supremely fast, optical and photonic components and devices are capable of operating across multiple orders of magnitude length, power, and spectral scales, encompassing the range from macroscopic device sizes and kW energies to atomic domains and single-photon energies. The extreme versatility of the associated electromagnetic phenomena and applications, both classical and quantum, are therefore highly appealing to the rapidly evolving computing and communication realms, where innovations in both hardware and software are necessary to meet the growing speed and memory requirements. Development of all-optical components, photonic chips, interconnects, and processors will bring the speed of light, photon coherence properties, field confinement and enhancement, information-carrying capacity, and the broad spectrum of light into the high-performance computing, the internet of things, and industries related to cloud, fog, and recently edge computing. Conversely, owing to their extraordinary properties, 0D, 1D, and 2D materials are being explored as a physical basis for the next generation of logic components and processors. Carbon nanotubes, for example, have been recently used to create a new processor beyond proof of principle. These developments, in conjunction with neuromorphic and quantum computing, are envisioned to maintain the growth of computing power beyond the projected plateau for silicon technology. We survey the qualitative figures of merit of technologies of current interest for the next generation computing with an emphasis on edge computing.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 19
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Smart sensor nodes can process data collected from sensors, make decisions, and recognize relevant events based on the sensed information before sharing it with other nodes. In wireless sensor networks, the smart sensor nodes are usually grouped in clusters for effective cooperation. One sensor node in each cluster must act as a cluster head. The cluster head depletes its energy resources faster than the other nodes. Thus, the cluster-head role must be periodically reassigned (rotated) to different sensor nodes to achieve a long lifetime of wireless sensor network. This paper introduces a method for extending the lifetime of the wireless sensor networks with smart nodes. The proposed method combines a new algorithm for rotating the cluster-head role among sensor nodes with suppression of unnecessary data transmissions. It enables effective control of the cluster-head rotation based on expected energy consumption of sensor nodes. The energy consumption is estimated using a lightweight model, which takes into account transmission probabilities. This method was implemented in a prototype of wireless sensor network. During experimental evaluation of the new method, detailed measurements of lifetime and energy consumption were conducted for a real wireless sensor network. Results of these realistic experiments have revealed that the lifetime of the sensor network is extended when using the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art cluster-head rotation algorithms.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The core of intelligent virtual geographical environments (VGEs) is the formal expression of geographic knowledge. Its purpose is to transform the data, information, and scenes of a virtual geographic environment into &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; that can be recognized by computer, so that the computer can understand the virtual geographic environment more easily. A geographic knowledge graph (GeoKG) is a large-scale semantic web that stores geographical knowledge in a structured form. Based on a geographic knowledge base and a geospatial database, intelligent interactions with virtual geographical environments can be realized by natural language question answering, entity links, and so on. In this paper, a knowledge-enhanced Virtual geographical environments service framework is proposed. We construct a multi-level semantic parsing model and an enhanced GeoKG for structured geographic information data, such as digital maps, 3D virtual scenes, and unstructured information data. Based on the GeoKG, we propose a bilateral LSTM-CRF (long short-term memory- conditional random field) model to achieve natural language question answering for VGEs and conduct experiments on the method. The results prove that the method of intelligent interaction based on the knowledge graph can bridge the distance between people and virtual environments.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Solar irradiation that is received on a terrestrial surface at minor scale of an hour does not have many records, since the current solar irradiation databases generally only have data recorded on a daily (most) and hourly (some less) scale. For places where there are no records of solar irradiation, there are a lot of methods that are used to synthetically or artificially generate these data, and again they are usually methods that generate data on a daily or hourly scale. Currently, for all types of applications, especially in the field of photovoltaic solar energy, irradiation data are needed at minor scale of an hour. In this case, there are very few methods to generate such data. For this purpose, a new methodology to generate series of solar irradiation at temporal high-resolution. In this paper, it is presented on a 10-min basis. A comparative study with real data has been done and the conclusion, as it will be explained is that the proposed methodology provides very good results.

TI  - AE-GAN-Net: Learning Invariant Feature Descriptor to Match Ground Camera Images and a Large-Scale 3D Image-Based Point Cloud for Outdoor Augmented Reality

VL  - 11
IS  - 19
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Establishing the spatial relationship between 2D images captured by real cameras and 3D models of the environment (2D and 3D space) is one way to achieve the virtual&ndash;real registration for Augmented Reality (AR) in outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose to match the 2D images captured by real cameras and the rendered images from the 3D image-based point cloud to indirectly establish the spatial relationship between 2D and 3D space. We call these two kinds of images as cross-domain images, because their imaging mechanisms and nature are quite different. However, unlike real camera images, the rendered images from the 3D image-based point cloud are inevitably contaminated with image distortion, blurred resolution, and obstructions, which makes image matching with the handcrafted descriptors or existing feature learning neural networks very challenging. Thus, we first propose a novel end-to-end network, AE-GAN-Net, consisting of two AutoEncoders (AEs) with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) embedding, to learn invariant feature descriptors for cross-domain image matching. Second, a domain-consistent loss function, which balances image content and consistency of feature descriptors for cross-domain image pairs, is introduced to optimize AE-GAN-Net. AE-GAN-Net effectively captures domain-specific information, which is embedded into the learned feature descriptors, thus making the learned feature descriptors robust against image distortion, variations in viewpoints, spatial resolutions, rotation, and scaling. Experimental results show that AE-GAN-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance for image patch retrieval with the cross-domain image patch dataset, which is built from real camera images and the rendered images from 3D image-based point cloud. Finally, by evaluating virtual&ndash;real registration for AR on a campus by using the cross-domain image matching results, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying the proposed virtual&ndash;real registration to AR in outdoor environments.

AB  - Pervasive healthcare services have undergone a great evolution in recent years. The technological development of communication networks, including the Internet, sensor networks, and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) have given rise to new architectures, applications, and standards related to addressing almost all current e-health challenges. Among the standards, the importance of OpenEHR has been recognized, since it enables the separation of medical semantics from data representation of electronic health records. However, it does not meet the requirements related to interoperability of e-health devices in M2M networks, or in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Moreover, the lack of interoperability hampers the application of new data-processing techniques, such as data mining and online analytical processing, due to the heterogeneity of the data and the sources. This article proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform for pervasive healthcare that ensures interoperability, quality of the detection process, and scalability in an M2M-based architecture, and provides functionalities for the processing of high volumes of data, knowledge extraction, and common healthcare services. The platform uses the semantics described in OpenEHR for both data quality evaluation and standardization of healthcare data stored by the association of IoMT devices and observations defined in OpenEHR. Moreover, it enables the application of big data techniques and online analytic processing (OLAP) through Hadoop Map/Reduce and content-sharing through fast healthcare interoperability resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs).

TI  - County-Level Soybean Yield Prediction Using Deep CNN-LSTM Model

IS  - 20
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Yield prediction is of great significance for yield mapping, crop market planning, crop insurance, and harvest management. Remote sensing is becoming increasingly important in crop yield prediction. Based on remote sensing data, great progress has been made in this field by using machine learning, especially the Deep Learning (DL) method, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Recent experiments in this area suggested that CNN can explore more spatial features and LSTM has the ability to reveal phenological characteristics, which both play an important role in crop yield prediction. However, very few experiments combining these two models for crop yield prediction have been reported. In this paper, we propose a deep CNN-LSTM model for both end-of-season and in-season soybean yield prediction in CONUS at the county-level. The model was trained by crop growth variables and environment variables, which include weather data, MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, and MODIS Surface Reflectance (SR) data; historical soybean yield data were employed as labels. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), all these training data were combined and transformed into histogram-based tensors for deep learning. The results of the experiment indicate that the prediction performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM model can outperform the pure CNN or LSTM model in both end-of-season and in-season. The proposed method shows great potential in improving the accuracy of yield prediction for other crops like corn, wheat, and potatoes at fine scales in the future.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The electric energy consumption prediction (EECP) is an essential and complex task in intelligent power management system. EECP plays a significant role in drawing up a national energy development policy. Therefore, this study proposes an Electric Energy Consumption Prediction model utilizing the combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) that is named EECP-CBL model to predict electric energy consumption. In this framework, two CNNs in the first module extract the important information from several variables in the individual household electric power consumption (IHEPC) dataset. Then, Bi-LSTM module with two Bi-LSTM layers uses the above information as well as the trends of time series in two directions including the forward and backward states to make predictions. The obtained values in the Bi-LSTM module will be passed to the last module that consists of two fully connected layers for finally predicting the electric energy consumption in the future. The experiments were conducted to compare the prediction performances of the proposed model and the state-of-the-art models for the IHEPC dataset with several variants. The experimental results indicate that EECP-CBL framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of several performance metrics for electric energy consumption prediction on several variations of IHEPC dataset in real-time, short-term, medium-term and long-term timespans.

AB  - The purpose of this descriptive research paper is to initiate discussions on the use of innovative technologies and their potential to support the research and development of pan-Canadian monitoring and surveillance activities associated with environmental impacts on health and within the health system. Its primary aim is to provide a review of disruptive technologies and their current uses in the environment and in healthcare. Drawing on extensive experience in population-level surveillance through the use of technology, knowledge from prior projects in the field, and conducting a review of the technologies, this paper is meant to serve as the initial steps toward a better understanding of the research area. In doing so, we hope to be able to better assess which technologies might best be leveraged to advance this unique intersection of health and environment. This paper first outlines the current use of technologies at the intersection of public health and the environment, in particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The paper provides a description for each of these technologies, along with a summary of their current applications, and a description of the challenges one might face with adopting them. Thereafter, a high-level reference architecture, that addresses the challenges of the described technologies and could potentially be incorporated into the pan-Canadian surveillance system, is conceived and presented.

TI  - An Innovative Fingerprint Location Algorithm for Indoor Positioning Based on Array Pseudolite
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 20
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Since the signals of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) are blocked by buildings, accurate positioning cannot be achieved in an indoor environment. Pseudolite can simulate similar outdoor satellite signals and can be used as a stable and reliable positioning signal source in indoor environments. Therefore, it has been proposed as a good substitute and has become a research hotspot in the field of indoor positioning. There are still some problems in the pseudolite positioning field, such as: Integer ambiguity of carrier phase, initial position determination, and low signal coverage. To avoid the limitation of these factors, an indoor positioning system based on fingerprint database matching of homologous array pseudolite is proposed in this paper, which can achieve higher positioning accuracy. The realization of this positioning system mainly includes the offline phase and the online phase. In the offline phase, the carrier phase data in the indoor environment is first collected, and a fingerprint database is established. Then a variational auto-encoding (VAE) network with location information is used to learn the probability distribution characteristics of the carrier phase difference of pseudolite in the latent space to realize feature clustering. Finally, the deep neural network is constructed by using the hidden features learned to further study the mapping relationship between different carrier phases of pseudolite and different indoor locations. In the online phase, the trained model and real-time carrier phases of pseudolite are used to predict the location of the positioning terminal. In this paper, by a large number of experiments, the performance of the pseudolite positioning system is evaluated under dynamic and static conditions. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated by the comparison experiments, the experimental results show that the average positioning accuracy of the positioning system in a real indoor scene is 0.39 m, and the 95% positioning error is less than 0.85 m, which outperforms the traditional fingerprint positioning algorithms.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 7
IS  - 10
SN  - 2227-9717

AB  - The importance of neural network (NN) modelling is evident from its performance benefits in a myriad of applications, where, unlike conventional techniques, NN modeling provides superior performance without relying on complex filtering and/or time-consuming parameter tuning specific to applications and their wider ranges of conditions. In this paper, we employ NN modelling with training data generation based on sensitivity analysis for the prediction of building energy consumption to improve performance and reliability. Unlike our previous work, where insignificant input variables are successively screened out based on their mean impact values (MIVs) during the training process, we use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot to generate reliable data with a conservative or progressive point of view, which overcomes the issue of data insufficiency of the MIV method: By properly setting boundaries for input variables based on the ROC plot and their statistics, instead of completely screening them out as in the MIV-based method, we can generate new training data that maximize true positive and false negative numbers from the partial data set. Then a NN model is constructed and trained with the generated training data using Levenberg&ndash;Marquardt back propagation (LM-BP) to perform electricity prediction for commercial buildings. The performance of the proposed data generation methods is compared with that of the MIV method through experiments, whose results show that data generation using successive and cross pattern provides satisfactory performance, following energy consumption trends with good phase. Among the two options in data generation, i.e., successive and two data combination, the successive option shows lower root mean square error (RMSE) than the combination one by around 400~900 kWh (i.e., 30%~75%).

AB  - Accurate prediction of mercury content emitted from fossil-fueled power stations is of the utmost importance for environmental pollution assessment and hazard mitigation. In this paper, mercury content in the output gas of power stations’ boilers was predicted using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) method integrated with particle swarm optimization (PSO). The input parameters of the model included coal characteristics and the operational parameters of the boilers. The dataset was collected from 82 sample points in power plants and employed to educate and examine the proposed model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid model of the ANFIS-PSO, the statistical meter of MARE% was implemented, which resulted in 0.003266 and 0.013272 for training and testing, respectively. Furthermore, relative errors between the acquired data and predicted values were between −0.25% and 0.1%, which confirm the accuracy of the model to deal non-linearity and represent the dependency of flue gas mercury content into the specifications of coal and the boiler type.

AB  - Recently, power systems are facing the challenges of growing power demand, depleting fossil fuel and aggravating environmental pollution (caused by carbon emission from fossil fuel based power generation). The incorporation of alternative low carbon energy generation, i.e., Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), becomes crucial for energy systems. Effective Demand Side Management (DSM) and RES incorporation enable power systems to maintain demand, supply balance and optimize energy in an environmentally friendly manner. The wind power is a popular energy source because of its environmental and economical benefits. However, the uncertainty of wind power makes its incorporation in energy systems really difficult. To mitigate the risk of demand-supply imbalance, an accurate estimation of wind power is essential. Recognizing this challenging task, an efficient deep learning based prediction model is proposed for wind power forecasting. The proposed model has two stages. In the first stage, Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) is used to decompose the past wind power signals. Other than decomposed signals and lagged wind power, multiple exogenous inputs (such as, calendar variable and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)) are also used as input to forecast wind power. In the second stage, a new prediction model, Efficient Deep Convolution Neural Network (EDCNN), is employed to forecast wind power. A DSM scheme is formulated based on forecasted wind power, day-ahead demand and price. The proposed forecasting model&rsquo;s performance was evaluated on big data of Maine wind farm ISO NE, USA.

TI  - Algorithmic Decision-Making in AVs: Understanding Ethical and Technical Concerns for Smart Cities

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are increasingly embraced around the world to advance smart mobility and more broadly, smart, and sustainable cities. Algorithms form the basis of decision-making in AVs, allowing them to perform driving tasks autonomously, efficiently, and more safely than human drivers and offering various economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, algorithmic decision-making in AVs can also introduce new issues that create new safety risks and perpetuate discrimination. We identify bias, ethics, and perverse incentives as key ethical issues in the AV algorithms&rsquo; decision-making that can create new safety risks and discriminatory outcomes. Technical issues in the AVs&rsquo; perception, decision-making and control algorithms, limitations of existing AV testing and verification methods, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can also undermine the performance of the AV system. This article investigates the ethical and technical concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making in AVs by exploring how driving decisions can perpetuate discrimination and create new safety risks for the public. We discuss steps taken to address these issues, highlight the existing research gaps and the need to mitigate these issues through the design of AV&rsquo;s algorithms and of policies and regulations to fully realise AVs&rsquo; benefits for smart and sustainable cities.

AB  - The need for more sustainable cities has become a primary objective of urban strategies. The urgency for a radical transition towards sustainability in a long term-vision has brought with it several new concepts, such as smart urbanism, and models, such as smart city, eco-city, sustainable neighborhood, eco-district, etc. While these terms are fascinating and visionary, they often lack a clear definition both in terms of theoretical insight and empirical evidence. In this light, this contribution aims at defining a conceptual framework through which to further substantiate the blurred concept of eco-district and sustainable neighborhood. It does so by reviewing the concepts of smart urbanism and sustainable neighborhood/eco-districts in the literature, including also references to other well-known sustainability-oriented models of urban development. It then explores whether several indicators, emerging from the analysis of exemplary case studies of sustainable neighborhoods in Europe, can be used to clearly identify the characteristics of a sustainable approach at the district scale. The analysis, built on a review of existing literature, allows for both the clarification of several issues related to these fields of inquiry, as well as for the identification of the potential bridges to link these issues.

TI  - Improved Attribute-Based Encryption Using Chaos Synchronization and Its Application to MQTT Security

AB  - In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) has developed rapidly and been widely used in industry, agriculture, e-health, smart cities, and families. As the total amount of data transmission will increase dramatically, security will become a very important issue in data communication in the IoT. There are many communication protocols for Device to Device (D2D) or Machine to Machine (M2M) in IoT. One of them is Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), which is quite prevalent and easy to use. MQTT is designed for resource-constrained devices, so its security is not as strong as other communication protocols. To enhance MQTT security, it needs an additional function to overcome its weakness. However, considering the limited computational abilities of resource-constrained devices, they cannot use too powerful or complicated cryptographic algorithms. Therefore, this paper proposes novel improved attribute-based encryption (ABE) integrated with chaos synchronization to enhance the MQTT security. Finally, a small size of IoT is implemented to simulate resource-constrained devices equipped with a human&ndash;machine interface and monitoring software to show and verify the performance of MQTT communication with this improved ABE algorithm.

TI  - A Cooperative Machine Learning Approach for Pedestrian Navigation in Indoor IoT

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper presents a system based on pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) for localization of networked mobile users, which relies only on sensors embedded in the devices and device- to-device connectivity. The user trajectory is reconstructed by measuring step by step the user displacements. Though step length can be estimated rather accurately, heading evaluation is extremely problematic in indoor environments. Magnetometer is typically used, however measurements are strongly perturbed. To improve the location accuracy, this paper proposes a novel cooperative system to estimate the direction of motion based on a machine learning approach for perturbation detection and filtering, combined with a consensus algorithm for performance augmentation by cooperative data fusion at multiple devices. A first algorithm filters out perturbed magnetometer measurements based on a-priori information on the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. A second algorithm aggregates groups of users walking in the same direction, while a third one combines the measurements of the aggregated users in a distributed way to extract a more accurate heading estimate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that combines machine learning with consensus algorithms for cooperative PDR. Compared to other methods in the literature, the method has the advantage of being infrastructure-free, fully distributed and robust to sensor failures thanks to the pre-filtering of perturbed measurements. Extensive indoor experiments show that the heading error is highly reduced by the proposed approach thus leading to noticeable enhancements in localization performance.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Factories of the future are foreseen to evolve into smart factories with autonomous and adaptive manufacturing processes. However, the increasing complexity of the network of manufacturing processes is expected to complicate the rapid detection of process anomalies in real time. This paper proposes an architecture framework and method for the implementation of the Scalable On-line Anomaly Detection System (SOADS), which can detect process anomalies via real-time processing and analyze large amounts of process execution data in the context of autonomous and adaptive manufacturing processes. The design of this system architecture framework entailed the derivation of standard subsequence patterns using the PrefixSpan algorithm, a sequential pattern algorithm. The anomalies of the real-time event streams and derived subsequence patterns were scored using the Smith-Waterman algorithm, a sequence alignment algorithm. The excellence of the proposed system was verified by measuring the time for deriving subsequence patterns and by obtaining the anomaly scoring time from large event logs. The proposed system succeeded in large-scale data processing and analysis, one of the requirements for a smart factory, by using Apache Spark streaming and Apache Hbase, and is expected to become the basis of anomaly detection systems of smart factories.
