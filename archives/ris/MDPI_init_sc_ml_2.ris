AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a leading trend with numerous opportunities accompanied by advantages as well as disadvantages. Parallel with IoT development, significant privacy and personal data protection challenges are also growing. In this regard, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is often considered the world’s strongest set of data protection rules and has proven to be a catalyst for many countries around the world. The concepts and interaction of the data controller, the joint controllers, and the data processor play a key role in the implementation of the GDPR. Therefore, clarifying the blurred IoT actors’ relationships to determine corresponding responsibilities is necessary. Given the IoT transformation reflected in shifting computing power from cloud to the edge, in this research we have considered how these computing paradigms are affecting IoT actors. In this regard, we have introduced identification of IoT actors according to a new five-computing layer IoT model based on the cloud, fog, edge, mist, and dew computing. Our conclusion is that identifying IoT actors in the light of the corresponding IoT data manager roles could be useful in determining the responsibilities of IoT actors for their compliance with data protection and privacy rules.

AB  - In the context of the ongoing global warming, with environmental concerns regarding the greenhouse gas emissions due to our increasing energy consumption, smart energy management solutions have gained popularity as they have the potential to reduce our impact on the environment and also on our budgets. This paper proposes one of the most affordable designs for an autonomous, microcontroller-based demand-side energy management system to be installed in a home environment where it reduces the standby power consumed by the controlled devices. As a secondary function, it monitors and controls the lights to further save energy. The proposed system is designed to operate independently and also to limit the new wireless sources of electro-magnetic radiation introduced in the home environment. Six homes have been analyzed in terms of the measured energy consumption and to evaluate the energy management capabilities of the system, a prototype was built and tested. Promising results have been obtained and are detailed in the Results and Conclusion sections. A very low purchase price and good performance make this design a viable solution for intelligent home energy management, in today’s economic context.

AB  - This article describes the current landscape in the fields of social media and socio-technical systems. In particular, it analyzes the different ways in which social media are adopted in organizations, workplaces, educational and smart environments. One interesting aspect of this integration, is the use of social media for members’ participation and access to the processes and services of their organization. Those services cover many different types of daily routines and life activities, such as health, education, transports. In this survey, we compare and classify current research works according to multiple features, including: the use of Social Network Analysis and Social Capital models, users’ motivations for participation and organizational costs, adoption of the social media platform from below. Our results show that many of these current systems are developed without taking into proper consideration the social structures and processes, with some notable and positive exceptions.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - With the drastically increasing traffic in the last decades, crucial environmental problems have been caused, such as greenhouse gas emission and traffic noise pollution. These problems have adversely affected our life quality and health conditions. In this paper, modelling of traffic noise employing deep learning is investigated. The goal is to identify the best machine-learning model for predicting traffic noise from real-life traffic data with multivariate traffic features as input. An extensive study on recurrent neural network (RNN) is performed in this work for modelling time series traffic data, which was collected through an experimental campaign at an inner city roundabout, including both video traffic data and audio data. The preprocessing of the data, namely how to generate the appropriate input and output for deep learning model, is detailed in this paper. A selection of different architectures of RNN, such as many-to-one, many-to-many, encoder–decoder architectures, was investigated. Moreover, gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were further discussed. The results revealed that a multivariate bi-directional GRU model with many-to-many architecture achieved the best performance with both high accuracy and computation efficiency. The trained model could be promising for a future smart city concept; with the proposed model, real-time traffic noise predictions can be potentially feasible using only traffic data collected by different sensors in the city, thanks to the generated big data by smart cities. The forecast of excessive noise exposure can help the regulation and policy makers to make early decisions, in order to mitigate the noise level.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The amazing fusion of the internet of things (IoT) into traditional health monitoring systems has produced remarkable advances in the field of e-health. Different wireless body area network devices and sensors are providing real-time health monitoring services. As the number of IoT devices is rapidly booming, technological and security challenges are also rising day by day. The data generated from sensor-based devices need confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and end-to-end security for safe communication over the public network. IoT-based health monitoring systems work in a layered manner, comprising a perception layer, a network layer, and an application layer. Each layer has some security, and privacy concerns that need to be addressed accordingly. A lot of research has been conducted to resolve these security issues in different domains of IoT. Several frameworks for the security of IoT-based e-health systems have also been developed. This paper introduces a security framework for real-time health monitoring systems to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity by using two common IoT protocols, namely constrained application protocol (CoAP) and message query telemetry transports (MQTT). This security framework aims to defend sensor data against the security loopholes while it is continuously transmitting over the layers and uses hypertext transfer protocols (HTTPs) for this purpose. As a result, it shields from the breach with a very low ratio of risk. The methodology of this paper focuses on how the security framework of IoT-based real-time health systems is protected under the tiers of CoAP and HTTPs. CoAP works alongside HTTPs and is responsible for providing end-to-end security solutions.

AB  - The business intelligence (BI) market has grown at a tremendous rate in the past decade due to technological advancements, big data and the availability of open source content. Despite this growth, the use of open government data (OGD) as a source of information is very limited among the private sector due to a lack of knowledge as to its benefits. Scant evidence on the use of OGD by private organizations suggests that it can lead to the creation of innovative ideas as well as assist in making better informed decisions. Given the benefits but lack of use of OGD to generate business intelligence, we extend research in this area by exploring how OGD can be used to generate business intelligence for the identification of market opportunities and strategy formulation; an area of research that is still in its infancy. Using a two-industry case study approach (footwear and lumber), we use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to extract emerging topics in these two industries from OGD, and a data visualization tool (pyLDAVis) to visualize the topics in order to interpret and transform the data into business intelligence. Additionally, we perform an environmental scanning of the environment for the two industries to validate the usability of the information obtained. The results provide evidence that OGD can be a valuable source of information for generating business intelligence and demonstrate how topic modeling and visualization tools can assist organizations in extracting and analyzing information for the identification of market opportunities.

AB  - The increasing population across the globe makes it essential to link smart and sustainable city planning with the logistics of transporting people and goods, which will significantly contribute to how societies will face mobility in the coming years. The concept of smart mobility emerged with the popularity of smart cities and is aligned with the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations. A reduction in traffic congestion and new route optimizations with reduced ecological footprint are some of the essential factors of smart mobility; however, other aspects must also be taken into account, such as the promotion of active mobility and inclusive mobility, encouraging the use of other types of environmentally friendly fuels and engagement with citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Big Data technology will serve as the main entry points and fundamental pillars to promote the rise of new innovative solutions that will change the current paradigm for cities and their citizens. Mobility-as-a-service, traffic flow optimization, the optimization of logistics and autonomous vehicles are some of the services and applications that will encompass several changes in the coming years with the transition of existing cities into smart cities. This paper provides an extensive review of the current trends and solutions presented in the scope of smart mobility and enabling technologies that support it. An overview of how smart mobility fits into smart cities is provided by characterizing its main attributes and the key benefits of using smart mobility in a smart city ecosystem. Further, this paper highlights other various opportunities and challenges related to smart mobility. Lastly, the major services and applications that are expected to arise in the coming years within smart mobility are explored with the prospective future trends and scope.

AB  - This paper summarises a literature review on the applications of Internet of Things (IoT) with the aim of enhancing building energy use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). A detailed assessment of contemporary practical reviews and works was conducted to understand how different IoT systems and technologies are being developed to increase energy efficiencies in both residential and commercial buildings. Most of the reviewed works were invariably related to the dilemma of efficient heating systems in buildings. Several features of the central components of IoT, namely, the hardware and software needed for building controls, are analysed. Common design factors across the many IoT systems comprise the selection of sensors and actuators and their powering techniques, control strategies for collecting information and activating appliances, monitoring of actual data to forecast prospect energy consumption and communication methods amongst IoT components. Some building energy applications using IoT are provided. It was found that each application presented has the potential for significant energy reduction and user comfort improvement. This is confirmed in two case studies summarised, which report the energy savings resulting from implementing IoT systems. Results revealed that a few elements are user-specific that need to be considered in the decision processes. Last, based on the studies reviewed, a few aspects of prospective research were recommended.

TI  - Modeling Small UAV Micro-Doppler Signature Using Millimeter-Wave FMCW Radar

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 6
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - With the increase in small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications in several technology areas, detection and small UAVs classification have become of interest. To cope with small radar cross-sections (RCSs), slow-flying speeds, and low flying altitudes, the micro-Doppler signature provides some of the most distinctive information to identify and classify targets in many radar systems. In this paper, we introduce an effective model for the micro-Doppler effect that is suitable for frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar applications, and exploit it to investigate UAV signatures. The latter depends on the number of UAV motors, which are considered vibrational sources, and their rotation speed. To demonstrate the reliability of the proposed model, it is used to build simulated FMCW radar images, which are compared with experimental data acquired by a 77 GHz FMCW multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cost-effective automotive radar platform. The experimental results confirm the model’s ability to estimate the class of the UAV, namely its number of motors, in different operative scenarios. In addition, the experimental results show that the motors rotation speed does not imprint a significant signature on the classification of the UAV; thus, the estimation of the number of motors represents the only viable parameter for small UAV classification using the micro-Doppler effect.

TI  - Framing Twitter Public Sentiment on Nigerian Government COVID-19 Palliatives Distribution Using Machine Learning
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 6
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Sustainable development plays a vital role in information and communication technology. In times of pandemics such as COVID-19, vulnerable people need help to survive. This help includes the distribution of relief packages and materials by the government with the primary objective of lessening the economic and psychological effects on the citizens affected by disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there has not been an efficient way to monitor public funds’ accountability and transparency, especially in developing countries such as Nigeria. The understanding of public emotions by the government on distributed palliatives is important as it would indicate the reach and impact of the distribution exercise. Although several studies on English emotion classification have been conducted, these studies are not portable to a wider inclusive Nigerian case. This is because Informal Nigerian English (Pidgin), which Nigerians widely speak, has quite a different vocabulary from Standard English, thus limiting the applicability of the emotion classification of Standard English machine learning models. An Informal Nigerian English (Pidgin English) emotions dataset is constructed, pre-processed, and annotated. The dataset is then used to classify five emotion classes (anger, sadness, joy, fear, and disgust) on the COVID-19 palliatives and relief aid distribution in Nigeria using standard machine learning (ML) algorithms. Six ML algorithms are used in this study, and a comparative analysis of their performance is conducted. The algorithms are Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistics Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT). The conducted experiments reveal that Support Vector Machine outperforms the remaining classifiers with the highest accuracy of 88%. The “disgust” emotion class surpassed other emotion classes, i.e., sadness, joy, fear, and anger, with the highest number of counts from the classification conducted on the constructed dataset. Additionally, the conducted correlation analysis shows a significant relationship between the emotion classes of “Joy” and “Fear”, which implies that the public is excited about the palliatives’ distribution but afraid of inequality and transparency in the distribution process due to reasons such as corruption. Conclusively, the results from this experiment clearly show that the public emotions on COVID-19 support and relief aid packages’ distribution in Nigeria were not satisfactory, considering that the negative emotions from the public outnumbered the public happiness.

This research addresses this need with a proposal for a model of working environment monitoring in smart manufacturing, based on emerging wireless sensor technologies and the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. In accordance with the proposed model, a testing platform was developed. The testing platform was built on open-source hardware and software components. The testing platform was used for the validation of the model within the presented experimental environment. The results showed that the proposed model could be developed by mainly using open-source components, which can then be used to simulate different scenarios, applications, and target systems. Furthermore, the presented stable and functional platform proved to be applicable in the process of rapid prototyping, and software development for the targeted systems, as well as for student teaching as part of the engineering education process.

AB  - How to operate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) safely and efficiently in an interactive environment is challenging. A large amount of research has been devoted to improve the intelligence of a UAV while performing a mission, where finding an optimal maneuver decision-making policy of the UAV has become one of the key issues when we attempt to enable the UAV autonomy. In this paper, we propose a maneuver decision-making algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which generates efficient maneuvers for a UAV agent to execute the airdrop mission autonomously in an interactive environment. Particularly, the training set of the learning algorithm by the Prioritized Experience Replay is constructed, that can accelerate the convergence speed of decision network training in the algorithm. It is shown that a desirable and effective maneuver decision-making policy can be found by extensive experimental results.

AB  - As photovoltaics technologies have emerged as one of the most promising renewable energy resources in urban environments, monitoring and maintaining of such systems have gained significance. In order to support reliable system operation during the projected in-field operation lifetime, effective strategies for identifying potential problems in photovoltaic systems operation are needed. In this paper, novel methods for the identification of degrading effects in the operation of neighboring photovoltaic systems are presented. The proposed methods are applicable for identifying panel aging properties, soiling effects, and the operation of photovoltaic systems under different shading scenarios. Since the proposed methods are based on the cross-correlation of the operation of neighboring systems, they are particularly suitable performance assessment in urban environments. The proposed identification methods are integrated according to the adopted fog computing model, providing a scalable solution capable of uniform integration into the distributed applications for monitoring and maintenance of photovoltaic systems in urban areas. The details regarding the implementation of the identification methods in the form of data processing services and service operation and dependencies are also provided in this paper. The identification methods, integration concept, and related service operation are verified through the presented case study.

AB  - The knowledge embodied in cognitive models of smart environments, such as machine learning models, is commonly associated with time-consuming and costly processes such as large-scale data collection, data labeling, network training, and fine-tuning of models. Sharing and reuse of these elaborated resources between intelligent systems of different environments, which is known as transfer learning, would facilitate the adoption of cognitive services for the users and accelerate the uptake of intelligent systems in smart building and smart city applications. Currently, machine learning processes are commonly built for intra-organization purposes and tailored towards specific use cases with the assumption of integrated model repositories and feature pools. Transferring such services and models beyond organization boundaries is a challenging task that requires human intervention to find the matching models and evaluate them. This paper investigates the potential of communication and transfer learning between smart environments in order to empower a decentralized and peer-to-peer ecosystem for seamless and automatic transfer of services and machine learning models. To this end, we explore different knowledge types in the context of smart built environments and propose a collaboration framework based on knowledge graph principles for describing the machine learning models and their corresponding dependencies.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recent studies have applied the superior performance of deep learning to mobile devices, and these studies have enabled the running of the deep learning model on a mobile device with limited computing power. However, there is performance degradation of the deep learning model when it is deployed in mobile devices, due to the different sensors of each device. To solve this issue, it is necessary to train a network model specific to each mobile device. Therefore, herein, we propose an acceleration method for on-device learning to mitigate the device heterogeneity. The proposed method efficiently utilizes unified memory for reducing the latency of data transfer during network model training. In addition, we propose the layer-wise processor selection method to consider the latency generated by the difference in the processor performing the forward propagation step and the backpropagation step in the same layer. The experiments were performed on an ODROID-XU4 with the ResNet-18 model, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed method reduces the latency by at most 28.4% compared to the central processing unit (CPU) and at most 21.8% compared to the graphics processing unit (GPU). Through experiments using various batch sizes to measure the average power consumption, we confirmed that device heterogeneity is alleviated by performing on-device learning using the proposed method.

In this study, we predict highway speed using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network. Based on statistical models, previous approaches suffer from the inherited features of traffic data, such as nonlinear problems. The proposed method predicts highway speed based on the GRU method after training on digital tachograph data (DTG). The DTG data were recorded in one month, giving approximately 300 million records. These data included the velocity and locations of vehicles on the highway. Experimental results demonstrate that the GRU-based deep learning approach outperformed the state-of-the-art alternatives, the autoregressive integrated moving average model, and the long short-term neural network (LSTM) model, in terms of prediction accuracy. Further, the computational cost of the GRU model was lower than that of the LSTM. The proposed method can be applied to traffic prediction and intelligent transportation systems.

TI  - iResponse: An AI and IoT-Enabled Framework for Autonomous COVID-19 Pandemic Management
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, a tiny virus, is severely affecting the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of our planet, causing infections and deaths (2,674,151 deaths, as of 17 March 2021), relationship breakdowns, depression, economic downturn, riots, and much more. The lessons that have been learned from good practices by various countries include containing the virus rapidly; enforcing containment measures; growing COVID-19 testing capability; discovering cures; providing stimulus packages to the affected; easing monetary policies; developing new pandemic-related industries; support plans for controlling unemployment; and overcoming inequalities. Coordination and multi-term planning have been found to be the key among the successful national and global endeavors to fight the pandemic. The current research and practice have mainly focused on specific aspects of COVID-19 response. There is a need to automate the learning process such that we can learn from good and bad practices during pandemics and normal times. To this end, this paper proposes a technology-driven framework, iResponse, for coordinated and autonomous pandemic management, allowing pandemic-related monitoring and policy enforcement, resource planning and provisioning, and data-driven planning and decision-making. The framework consists of five modules: Monitoring and Break-the-Chain, Cure Development and Treatment, Resource Planner, Data Analytics and Decision Making, and Data Storage and Management. All modules collaborate dynamically to make coordinated and informed decisions. We provide the technical system architecture of a system based on the proposed iResponse framework along with the design details of each of its five components. The challenges related to the design of the individual modules and the whole system are discussed. We provide six case studies in the paper to elaborate on the different functionalities of the iResponse framework and how the framework can be implemented. These include a sentiment analysis case study, a case study on the recognition of human activities, and four case studies using deep learning and other data-driven methods to show how to develop sustainability-related optimal strategies for pandemic management using seven real-world datasets. A number of important findings are extracted from these case studies.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Extracting financial events from numerous financial announcements is very important for investors to make right decisions. However, it is still challenging that event arguments always scatter in multiple sentences in a financial announcement, while most existing event extraction models only work in sentence-level scenarios. To address this problem, this paper proposes a relation-aware Transformer-based Document-level Joint Event Extraction model (TDJEE), which encodes relations between words into the context and leverages modified Transformer to capture document-level information to fill event arguments. Meanwhile, the absence of labeled data in financial domain could lead models be unstable in extraction results, which is known as the cold start problem. Furthermore, a Fonduer-based knowledge base combined with the distant supervision method is proposed to simplify the event labeling and provide high quality labeled training corpus for model training and evaluating. Experimental results on real-world Chinese financial announcement show that, compared with other models, TDJEE achieves competitive results and can effectively extract event arguments across multiple sentences.

VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Weather change such as raining is a crucial factor to cause traffic congestion, especially in metropolises with the limited sewer system infrastructures. Identifying the roads which are sensitive to weather changes, defined as weather-sensitive roads (WSR), can facilitate the infrastructure development. In the literature, little research focused on studying weather factors of developing countries that might have deficient infrastructures. In this research, to fill the gap, the real-world data associating with Jakarta, Indonesia, was studied to identify WSR based on smartphone sensor data, real-time weather information, and road characteristics datasets. A spatial-temporal congestion speed matrix (STC) was proposed to illustrate traffic speed changes over time. Under the proposed STC, a sequential clustering and classification framework was applied to identify the WSR in terms of traffic speed. In this work, the causes of WSR were evaluated based on the variables’ importance of the classification method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can cluster the roads according to the pattern changes in the traffic speed caused by weather change. Based on the results, we found that the distances to shopping malls, mosques, schools, and the roads’ altitude, length, width, and the number of lanes are highly correlated to WSR in Jakarta.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1660-4601

AB  - To reduce the spread of the virus, authorities have imposed restrictive measures, such as limiting movement of individuals, shutting down non-essential stores, imposing a general or local quarantine, along with physical distancing and isolation of vulnerable people. Remote working has become the ‘new normal’ for many organizations, engendering further challenges for employees, who have started experiencing anxiety, technostress caused by digitalization and lack of social interaction, frustration, occupational burden, counterproductive work behavior, exhaustion, burnout, depersonalization, and increased turnover intention. All these factors, corroborated by prolonged restrictions, have contributed to a decrease in employee satisfaction, diminishing performance and generating a counterproductive behavior. Based on Social Exchange Theory, this research plans to investigate the influence of internal marketing on job satisfaction, task performance, and counterproductive work behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in an emerging market, namely Romania. Based on a quantitative research study among 850 employees, we show that internal marketing strongly and significantly impacts job satisfaction, while insignificantly impacting task performance and counterproductive work behavior. Job satisfaction actuates task performance in a significant and positive manner, contributing to a reduction in counterproductive work behaviors. This paper highlights the effects of internal marketing orientation on job satisfaction, and the effects of job satisfaction on job performance and counterproductive work behaviors.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in companies is advancing rapidly. Consequently, multidisciplinary research on AI in business has developed dramatically during the last decade, moving from the focus on technological objectives towards an interest in human users’ perspective. In this article, we investigate the notion of employees’ trust in AI at the workplace (in the company), following a human-centered approach that considers AI integration in business from the employees’ perspective, taking into account the elements that facilitate human trust in AI. While employees’ trust in AI at the workplace seems critical, so far, few studies have systematically investigated its determinants. Therefore, this study is an attempt to fill the existing research gap. The research objective of the article is to examine links between employees’ trust in AI in the company and three other latent variables (general trust in technology, intra-organizational trust, and individual competence trust). A quantitative study conducted on a sample of 428 employees from companies of the energy and chemical industries in Poland allowed the hypotheses to be verified. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate the existence of a positive relationship between general trust in technology and employees’ trust in AI in the company as well as between intra-organizational trust and employees’ trust in AI in the company in the surveyed firms.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The importance of building information is highly attached to the ability of conventional storing to provide professional analysis. The Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices offer a vast amount of live data stored in heterogeneous repositories, and hence the need for smart methodologies to facilitate IoT–BIM integration is very crucial. The first step to better integrating IoT and Building Information Modeling (BIM) can be performed by implementing the Service-Oriented-Architecture (SOA) to combining software and other services by replacing the sematic information that was failed to display elements of indoor conditions. The other development is to create link that able to update static models towards real-time models using SOA approach. The existing approach relies on one-way interaction; however, developing two-way communication to mimic human cognitive has become very crucial. The high-tech approach requires highly involving Cloud computations to better connect IoT devices throughout Internet infrastructure. This approach is based on the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) with real-time data from IoT devices aiming at improving construction and operational efficiencies and to provide high-fidelity BIM models for numerous applications. The paper discusses challenges, limitations, and barriers that face BIM–IoT integration and simultaneously solves interoperability issues and Cloud computing. The paper provides a comprehensive review that explores and identifies common emerging areas of application and common design patterns of the traditional BIM-IoT integration followed by devising better methodologies to integrate IoT in BIM.

TI  - Security Vulnerabilities in LPWANs—An Attack Vector Analysis for the IoT Ecosystem
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 7
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Due to its pervasive nature, the Internet of Things (IoT) is demanding for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) since wirelessly connected devices need battery-efficient and long-range communications. Due to its low-cost and high availability (regional/city level scale), this type of network has been widely used in several IoT applications, such as Smart Metering, Smart Grids, Smart Buildings, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), SCADA Systems. By using LPWAN technologies, the IoT devices are less dependent on common and existing infrastructure, can operate using small, inexpensive, and long-lasting batteries (up to 10 years), and can be easily deployed within wide areas, typically above 2 km in urban zones. The starting point of this work was an overview of the security vulnerabilities that exist in LPWANs, followed by a literature review with the main goal of substantiating an attack vector analysis specifically designed for the IoT ecosystem. This methodological approach resulted in three main contributions: (i) a systematic review regarding cybersecurity in LPWANs with a focus on vulnerabilities, threats, and typical defense strategies; (ii) a state-of-the-art review on the most prominent results that have been found in the systematic review, with focus on the last three years; (iii) a security analysis on the recent attack vectors regarding IoT applications using LPWANs. Results have shown that LPWANs communication technologies contain security vulnerabilities that can lead to irreversible harm in critical and non-critical IoT application domains. Also, the conception and implementation of up-to-date defenses are relevant to protect systems, networks, and data.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications are becoming popular among many users nowadays, as it makes their life easier. Because of its popularity, attacks that target these devices have increased dramatically, which might cause the entire system to be unavailable. Some of these attacks are denial of service attack, sybil attack, man in the middle attack, and replay attack. Therefore, as the attacks have increased, the detection solutions to detect malware in the IoT have also increased. Most of the current solutions often have very serious limitations, and malware is becoming more apt in taking advantage of them. Therefore, it is important to develop a tool to overcome the existing limitations of current detection systems. This paper presents CoLL-IoT, a CoLLaborative intruder detection system that detects malicious activities in IoT devices. CoLL-IoT consists of the following four main layers: IoT layer, network layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. All of the layers work collaboratively by monitoring and analyzing all of the network traffic generated and received by IoT devices. CoLL-IoT brings the detection system close to the IoT devices by taking the advantage of edge computing and fog computing paradigms. The proposed system was evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset that has more than 175,000 records and achieved an accuracy of up to 98% with low type II error rate of 0.01. The evaluation results showed that CoLL-IoT outperformed the other existing tools, such as Dendron, which was also evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) plays a pivotal role in the vision of Industry 4.0. The idea is that the real product and its virtual counterpart are twins that travel a parallel journey from design and development to production and service life. The intelligence that comes from DTs’ operational data supports the interactions between the DTs to pave the way for the cyber-physical integration of smart manufacturing. This paper presents a conceptual framework for digital twins collaboration to provide an auto-detection of erratic operational data by utilizing operational data intelligence in the manufacturing systems. The proposed framework provide an interaction mechanism to understand the DT status, interact with other DTs, learn from each other DTs, and share common semantic knowledge. In addition, it can detect the anomalies and understand the overall picture and conditions of the operational environments. Furthermore, the proposed framework is described in the workflow model, which breaks down into four phases: information extraction, change detection, synchronization, and notification. A use case of Energy 4.0 fault diagnosis for wind turbines is described to present the use of the proposed framework and DTs collaboration to identify and diagnose the potential failure, e.g., malfunctioning nodes within the energy industry.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - The evolution of low-cost sensors (LCSs) has made the spatio-temporal mapping of indoor air quality (IAQ) possible in real-time but the availability of a diverse set of LCSs make their selection challenging. Converting individual sensors into a sensing network requires the knowledge of diverse research disciplines, which we aim to bring together by making IAQ an advanced feature of smart homes. The aim of this review is to discuss the advanced home automation technologies for the monitoring and control of IAQ through networked air pollution LCSs. The key steps that can allow transforming conventional homes into smart homes are sensor selection, deployment strategies, data processing, and development of predictive models. A detailed synthesis of air pollution LCSs allowed us to summarise their advantages and drawbacks for spatio-temporal mapping of IAQ. We concluded that the performance evaluation of LCSs under controlled laboratory conditions prior to deployment is recommended for quality assurance/control (QA/QC), however, routine calibration or implementing statistical techniques during operational times, especially during long-term monitoring, is required for a network of sensors. The deployment height of sensors could vary purposefully as per location and exposure height of the occupants inside home environments for a spatio-temporal mapping. Appropriate data processing tools are needed to handle a huge amount of multivariate data to automate pre-/post-processing tasks, leading to more scalable, reliable and adaptable solutions. The review also showed the potential of using machine learning technique for predicting spatio-temporal IAQ in LCS networked-systems.

AB  - Construction projects and cities account for over 50% of carbon emissions and energy consumption. Industry 4.0 and digital transformation may increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. A digital twin (DT) is a key enabler in implementing Industry 4.0 in the areas of construction and smart cities. It is an emerging technology that connects different objects by utilising the advanced Internet of Things (IoT). As a technology, it is in high demand in various industries, and its literature is growing exponentially. Previous digital modeling practices, the use of data acquisition tools, human–computer–machine interfaces, programmable cities, and infrastructure, as well as Building Information Modeling (BIM), have provided digital data for construction, monitoring, or controlling physical objects. However, a DT is supposed to offer much more than digital representation. Characteristics such as bi-directional data exchange and real-time self-management (e.g., self-awareness or self-optimisation) distinguish a DT from other information modeling systems. The need to develop and implement DT is rising because it could be a core technology in many industrial sectors post-COVID-19. This paper aims to clarify the DT concept and differentiate it from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, digital shadows, and information systems. It also intends to review the state of play in DT development and offer research directions for future investigation. It recommends the development of DT applications that offer rapid and accurate data analysis platforms for real-time decisions, self-operation, and remote supervision requirements post-COVID-19. The discussion in this paper mainly focuses on the Smart City, Engineering and Construction (SCEC) sectors.

AB  - The article is devoted to cybersecurity risk assessment of the dynamic device-to-device networks of a smart city. Analysis of the modern security threats at the IoT/IIoT, VANET, and WSN inter-device infrastructures demonstrates that the main concern is a set of network security threats targeted at the functional sustainability of smart urban infrastructure, the most common use case of smart networks. As a result of our study, systematization of the existing cybersecurity risk assessment methods has been provided. Expert-based risk assessment and active human participation cannot be provided for the huge, complex, and permanently changing digital environment of the smart city. The methods of scenario analysis and functional analysis are specific to industrial risk management and are hardly adaptable to solving cybersecurity tasks. The statistical risk evaluation methods force us to collect statistical data for the calculation of the security indicators for the self-organizing networks, and the accuracy of this method depends on the number of calculating iterations. In our work, we have proposed a new approach for cybersecurity risk management based on object typing, data mining, and quantitative risk assessment for the smart city infrastructure. The experimental study has shown us that the artificial neural network allows us to automatically, unambiguously, and reasonably assess the cyber risk for various object types in the dynamic digital infrastructures of the smart city.

AB  - The inclusion of Internet of Things (IoT) for building smart cities, smart health, smart grids, and other smart concepts has driven data-driven decision making by managers and automation in each domain. However, the hyper-connectivity generated by IoT networks coupled with limited default security in IoT devices increases security risks that can jeopardize the operations of cities, hospitals, and organizations. Strengthening the security aspects of IoT devices prior to their use in different systems can contribute to minimize the attack surface. This study aimed to model a sequence of seven steps to minimize the attack surface by executing hardening processes. Conducted a systematic literature review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) techniques. In this way, we were able to define a proposed methodology to evaluate the security level of an IoT solution by means of a checklist that considers the security aspects in the three layers of the IoT architecture. A risk matrix adapted to IoT is established to evaluate the attack surface. Finally, a process of hardening and vulnerability analysis is proposed to reduce the attack surface and improve the security level of the IoT solution.

SN  - 2227-7390

AB  - We used a large sample of 188,652 properties, which represented 4.88% of the total housing stock in Catalonia from 1994 to 2013, to make a comparison between different real estate valuation methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), quantile regressions (QRs) and semi-log regressions (SLRs). A literature gap in regard to the comparison between ANN and QR modelling of hedonic prices in housing was identified, with this article being the first paper to include this comparison. Therefore, this study aimed to answer (1) whether QR valuation modelling of hedonic prices in the housing market is an alternative to ANNs, (2) whether it is confirmed that ANNs produce better results than SLRs when assessing housing in Catalonia, and (3) which of the three mass appraisal models should be used by Spanish banks to assess real estate. The results suggested that the ANNs and SLRs obtained similar and better performances than the QRs and that the SLRs performed better when the datasets were smaller. Therefore, (1) QRs were not found to be an alternative to ANNs, (2) it could not be confirmed whether ANNs performed better than SLRs when assessing properties in Catalonia and (3) whereas small and medium banks should use SLRs, large banks should use either SLRs or ANNs in real estate mass appraisal.

AB  - Today’s smart devices come equipped with powerful hard- and software-enabling professional use cases. The latest hardware by Apple utilizes LiDAR and TrueDepth, which offer the capability of 3D scanning. Devices equipped with these camera systems allow manufacturers to obtain 3D data from their customers at low costs, which potentially enables time-efficient mass customization and product differentiation strategies. However, the utilization is limited by the scanning accuracy. To determine the potential application of LiDAR and TrueDepth as a 3D scanning solution, in this paper an evaluation was performed. For this purpose, different Lego bricks were scanned with the technologies and an industrial 3D scanner. The results were compared according to shape and position tolerances. Even though the industrial 3D scanner consistently delivered more accurate results, the accuracy of the smart device technologies may already be sufficient, depending on the application.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - In real estate, there are various variables for the forecasting of future land prices, in addition to the macro and micro perspectives used in the current research. Examples of such variables are the economic growth rate, unemployment rate, regional development and important locations, and transportation. Therefore, in this paper, data on real estate and national price fluctuation rates were used to predict the ways in which future land prices will fluctuate, and macro and micro perspective variables were actively utilized in order to conduct land analysis based on Big Data analysis. We sought to understand what kinds of variables directly affect the fluctuation of the land, and to use this for future land price analysis. In addition to the two variables mentioned above, the factor of the landscape was also confirmed to be closely related to the real estate market. Therefore, in order to check the correlation between the landscape and the real estate market, we will examine the factors which change the land price in the landscape district, and then discuss how the landscape and real estate can interact. As a result, re-explaining the previous contents, the future land price is predicted by actively utilizing macro and micro variables in real estate land price prediction. Through this method, we want to increase the accuracy of the real estate market, which is difficult to predict, and we hope that it will be useful in the real estate market in the future.

AB  - In recent years, rapid development has been made to the Internet of Things communication technologies, infrastructure, and physical resources management. These developments and research trends address challenges such as heterogeneous communication, quality of service requirements, unpredictable network conditions, and a massive influx of data. One major contribution to the research world is in the form of software-defined networking applications, which aim to deploy rule-based management to control and add intelligence to the network using high-level policies to have integral control of the network without knowing issues related to low-level configurations. Machine learning techniques coupled with software-defined networking can make the networking decision more intelligent and robust. The Internet of Things application has recently adopted virtualization of resources and network control with software-defined networking policies to make the traffic more controlled and maintainable. However, the requirements of software-defined networking and the Internet of Things must be aligned to make the adaptations possible. This paper aims to discuss the possible ways to make software-defined networking enabled Internet of Things application and discusses the challenges solved using the Internet of Things leveraging the software-defined network. We provide a topical survey of the application and impact of software-defined networking on the Internet of things networks. We also study the impact of machine learning techniques applied to software-defined networking and its application perspective. The study is carried out from the different perspectives of software-based Internet of Things networks, including wide-area networks, edge networks, and access networks. Machine learning techniques are presented from the perspective of network resources management, security, classification of traffic, quality of experience, and quality of service prediction. Finally, we discuss challenges and issues in adopting machine learning and software-defined networking for the Internet of Things applications.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) has rapidly become one of the key enabling technologies for the development of Internet of Things (IoT) architectures. A wide range of different solutions relying on this communication technology can be found in the literature: nevertheless, the most part of these architectures focus on single task systems. Conversely, the aim of this paper is to present the architecture of a LoRaWAN infrastructure gathering under the same network different typologies of services within one of the most significant sub-systems of the Smart City ecosystem (i.e., the Smart Waste Management). The proposed architecture exploits the whole range of different LoRaWAN classes, integrating nodes of growing complexity according to the different functions. The lowest level of this architecture is occupied by smart bins that simply collect data about their status. Moving on to upper levels, smart drop-off containers allow the interaction with users as well as the implementation of asynchronous downlink queries. At the top level, Video Surveillance Units (VSUs) are provided with machine learning capabilities for the detection of the presence of fire nearby bins or drop-off containers, thus fully implementing the Edge Computing paradigm. The proposed network infrastructure and its subsystems have been tested in a laboratory and in the field. This study has enhanced the readiness level of the proposed technology to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - CNN is particularly effective in extracting spatial features. However, the single-layer classifier constructed by activation function in CNN is easily interfered by image noise, resulting in reduced classification accuracy. To solve the problem, the advanced ensemble model XGBoost is used to overcome the deficiency of a single classifier to classify image features. To further distinguish the extracted image features, a CNN-XGBoost image classification model optimized by APSO is proposed, where APSO optimizes the hyper-parameters on the overall architecture to promote the fusion of the two-stage model. The model is mainly composed of two parts: feature extractor CNN, which is used to automatically extract spatial features from images; feature classifier XGBoost is applied to classify features extracted after convolution. In the process of parameter optimization, to overcome the shortcoming that traditional PSO algorithm easily falls into a local optimal, the improved APSO guide the particles to search for optimization in space by two different strategies, which improves the diversity of particle population and prevents the algorithm from becoming trapped in local optima. The results on the image set show that the proposed model gets better results in image classification. Moreover, the APSO-XGBoost model performs well on the credit data, which indicates that the model has a good ability of credit scoring.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 8
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Unlike most of the existing neural network-based fall detection methods, which only detect fall at the time range, the algorithm proposed in this paper detect fall in both spatial and temporal dimension. A movement tube detection network integrating 3D CNN and object detection framework such as SSD is proposed to detect human fall with constrained movement tubes. The constrained movement tube, which encapsulates the person with a sequence of bounding boxes, has the merits of encapsulating the person closely and avoiding peripheral interference. A 3D convolutional neural network is used to encode the motion and appearance features of a video clip, which are fed into the tube anchors generation layer, softmax classification, and movement tube regression layer. The movement tube regression layer fine tunes the tube anchors to the constrained movement tubes. A large-scale spatio-temporal (LSST) fall dataset is constructed using self-collected data to evaluate the fall detection in both spatial and temporal dimensions. LSST has three characteristics of large scale, annotation, and posture and viewpoint diversities. Furthermore, the comparative experiments on a public dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieved sensitivity, specificity an accuracy of 100%, 97.04%, and 97.23%, respectively, outperforms the existing methods.

AB  - In an Internet of Things (IoT) environment, a large volume of potentially confidential data might be leaked from sensors installed everywhere. To ensure the authenticity of such sensitive data, it is important to initially verify the source of data and its identity. Practically, IoT device identification is the primary step toward a secure IoT system. An appropriate device identification approach can counteract malicious activities such as sending false data that trigger irreparable security issues in vital or emergency situations. Recent research indicates that primary identity metrics such as Internet Protocol (IP) or Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are insufficient due to their instability or easy accessibility. Thus, to identify an IoT device, analysis of the header information of packets by the sensors is of imperative consideration. This paper proposes a combination of sensor measurement and statistical feature sets in addition to a header feature set using a classification-based device identification framework. Various machine Learning algorithms have been adopted to identify different combinations of these feature sets to provide enhanced security in IoT devices. The proposed method has been evaluated through normal and under-attack circumstances by collecting real-time data from IoT devices connected in a lab setting to show the system robustness.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The proliferation of distributed renewable energy resources (RESs) poses major challenges to the operation of microgrids due to uncertainty. Traditional online scheduling approaches relying on accurate forecasts become difficult to implement due to the increase of uncertain RESs. Although several data-driven methods have been proposed recently to overcome the challenge, they generally suffer from a scalability issue due to the limited ability to optimize high-dimensional continuous control variables. To address these issues, we propose a data-driven online scheduling method for microgrid energy optimization based on continuous-control deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We formulate the online scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). The objective is to minimize the operating cost of the microgrid considering the uncertainty of RESs generation, load demand, and electricity prices. To learn the optimal scheduling strategy, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based network is designed to extract temporal features of uncertainty and generate the optimal scheduling decisions in an end-to-end manner. To optimize the policy with high-dimensional and continuous actions, proximal policy optimization (PPO) is employed to train the neural network-based policy in a data-driven fashion. The proposed method does not require any forecasting information on the uncertainty or a prior knowledge of the physical model of the microgrid. Simulation results using realistic power system data of California Independent System Operator (CAISO) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - With the rapid increase in the world’s population, there is an ever-growing need for a sustainable food supply. Agriculture is one of the pillars for worldwide food provisioning, with fruits and vegetables being essential for a healthy diet. However, in the last few years the worldwide dispersion of virulent plant pests and diseases has caused significant decreases in the yield and quality of crops, in particular fruit, cereal and vegetables. Climate change and the intensification of global trade flows further accentuate the issue. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an approach to pest control that aims at maintaining pest insects at tolerable levels, keeping pest populations below an economic injury level. Under these circumstances, the early identification of pests and diseases becomes crucial. In this work, we present the first step towards a fully fledged, semantically enhanced decision support system for IPM. The ultimate goal is to build a complete agricultural knowledge base by gathering data from multiple, heterogeneous sources and to develop a system to assist farmers in decision making concerning the control of pests and diseases. The pest classifier framework has been evaluated in a simulated environment, obtaining an aggregated accuracy of 98.8%.

In order to improve the durability and efficiency of the road-embedded monitoring system, a pavement vibration monitoring system is developed based on the Internet of things (IoT). The system includes multi-acceleration sensing nodes, a gateway, and a cloud platform. The key design principles and technologies of each part of the system are proposed, which provides valuable experience for the application of IoT monitoring technology in road infrastructures. Characterized by low power consumption, distributed computing, and high extensibility properties, the pavement vibration IoT monitoring system can realize the monitoring, transmission, and analysis of pavement vibration signal, and acquires the real-time traffic information. This road-embedded system improves the intellectual capacity of road infrastructure and is conducive to the construction of a new generation of smart roads.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 8
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With constantly increasing demand in connected society Internet of Things (IoT) network is frequently becoming congested. IoT sensor devices lose more power while transmitting data through congested IoT networks. Currently, in most scenarios, the distributed IoT devices in use have no effective spectrum based power management, and have no guarantee of a long term battery life while transmitting data through congested IoT networks. This puts user information at risk, which could lead to loss of important information in communication. In this paper, we studied the extra power consumed due to retransmission of IoT data packet and bad communication channel management in a congested IoT network. We propose a spectrum based power management solution that scans channel conditions when needed and utilizes the lowest congested channel for IoT packet routing. It also effectively measured power consumed in idle, connected, paging and synchronization status of a standard IoT device in a congested IoT network. In our proposed solution, a Freescale Freedom Development Board (FREDEVPLA) is used for managing channel related parameters. While supervising the congestion level and coordinating channel allocation at the FREDEVPLA level, our system configures MAC and Physical layer of IoT devices such that it provides the outstanding power utilization based on the operating network in connected mode compared to the basic IoT standard. A model has been set up and tested using freescale launchpads. Test data show that battery life of IoT devices using proposed spectrum based power management increases by at least 30% more than non-spectrum based power management methods embedded within IoT devices itself. Finally, we compared our results with the basic IoT standard, IEEE802.15.4. Furthermore, the proposed system saves lot of memory for IoT devices, improves overall IoT network performance, and above all, decrease the risk of losing data packets in communication. The detail analysis in this paper also opens up multiple avenues for further research in future use of channel scanning by FREDEVPLA board.

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT) is the third evolution of the traditional Internet that enables interaction and communication among machines. Many IoT platforms and networks have been developed, and recently, market sectors have started to develop specific IoT applications and services. Integrating heterogeneous IoT networks with the existing ones, mainly with the cellular networks, is a great demand. IoT represents one of the main use cases of the fifth-generation (5G) cellular system as announced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Integrating IoT networks with 5G networks face many challenges related to dense deployment and a massive number of expected connected devices. Thus, IoT network availability and scalability are the main requirements that should be achieved. To this end, this work provides a framework for integrating heterogeneous IoT networks with the 5G networks. The proposed system considers dense deployment and system scalability and availability requirements as announced by ITU and 3GPP. Our proposed structure deploys three main communication paradigms; mobile edge computing (MEC), device-to-device communications (D2D), and software-defined networking (SDN). Our proposed system is evaluated over a reliable environment for various deployment scenarios, and the results validate the proposed structure. The proposed IoT/5G reduces the percentage of blocked tasks by an average of 30% than other traditional IoT networks. This increases the overall system availability and scalability since IoT networks can have more devices and tasks than existing IoT networks. Furthermore, our proposed structure reduces the overall consumed energy by an average of 20% than existing IoT networks, which is an effective metric for IoT networks.

AB  - Currently, private universities, as a result of the pandemic that the world is facing, are going through very delicate moments in several areas, both academic and financial. Academically, there are learning problems and these are directly related to the dropout rate, which brings financial problems. Added to this are the economic problems caused by the pandemic, where the rates of students who want to access a private education have dropped considerably. For this reason, it is necessary for all private universities to have support to improve their student income and avoid cuts in budgets and resources. However, the academic part represents a great effort to fulfill their academic activities, which are the priority, with attention on those interested in pursuing a training programs. To solve these problems, it is important to integrate technologies such as Chatbots, which use artificial intelligence in such a way that tasks such as providing information on an academic courses are addressed by them, reducing the administrative burden and improving the user experience. At the same time, this encourages people to be a part of the college.

However, many countries around the world are still in the pilot phase promoted and regulated by government agencies. This is the case in Colombia, where the assignment of the first 5G band is planned for the third quarter of 2021. By analyzing the results of the pilot phase and the roadmap of the Colombian Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies (MinTIC), we can determine the main issues, which contribute to the deployment of 5G mobile technology as well as the plans to achieve a 5G stand-alone network from 4G networks. This is applicable to other countries in Latin America and the world. Then, our objective is to synthesize and share the most important concepts of 5G mobile technology such as the MIMO (multiple input/multiple output) antenna, RAN (Radio Access Network), C-RAN (Centralised-RAN), and frequency bands, and evaluate the current stage of its introduction in Colombia.

AB  - In recent years, blockchains systems have seen massive adoption in retail and enterprise environments. Cryptocurrencies become more widely adopted, and many online businesses have decided to add the most popular ones, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, next to Visa or Mastercard payments. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain-based systems, there is no possible way to revert confirmed transactions. It may result in losses caused by human error or poor design of the user interface. We created a cryptocurrency wallet with a full on-chain solution for aliasing accounts and tokens to improve user experience and avoid unnecessary errors. The aliasing system consists of a number of smart contracts deployed on top of the blockchain network that give the ability to register aliases to accounts and tokens and use them instead of opaque addresses. Our solution shows how performant modern blockchains are and presents a way of building fully decentralized applications that can compete with centralized ones in terms of performance.

AB  - Over the last decade, hundreds of thousands of volunteers have contributed to science by collecting or analyzing data. This public participation in science, also known as citizen science, has contributed to significant discoveries and led to publications in major scientific journals. However, little attention has been paid to data quality issues. In this work we argue that being able to determine the accuracy of data obtained by crowdsourcing is a fundamental question and we point out that, for many real-life scenarios, mathematical tools and processes for the evaluation of data quality are missing. We propose a probabilistic methodology for the evaluation of the accuracy of labeling data obtained by crowdsourcing in citizen science. The methodology builds on an abstract probabilistic graphical model formalism, which is shown to generalize some already existing label aggregation models. We show how to make practical use of the methodology through a comparison of data obtained from different citizen science communities analyzing the earthquake that took place in Albania in 2019.

AB  - Infrastructure is a fundamental sector for sustainable development and Earth observation has great potentials for sustainable infrastructure development (SID). However, implementations of the timely, large–scale and multi–source Earth observation are still limited in satisfying the huge global requirements of SID. This study presents a systematical literature review to identify trends of Earth observation for sustainable infrastructure (EOSI), investigate the relationship between EOSI and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and explore challenges and future directions of EOSI. Results reveal the close associations of infrastructure, urban development, ecosystems, climate, Earth observation and GIS in EOSI, and indicate their relationships. In addition, from the perspective of EOSI–SDGs relationship, the huge potentials of EOSI are demonstrated from the 70% of the infrastructure influenced targets that can be directly or indirectly derived from Earth observation data, but have not been included in current SDG indicators. Finally, typical EOSI cases are presented to indicate challenges and future research directions. This review emphasizes the contributions and potentials of Earth observation to SID and EOSI is a powerful pathway to deliver on SDGs.

AB  - Whereas the use of specific smart technologies in various sectors of the tourism industry has been under greater scrutiny in recent years, research that investigates tourists’ acceptance of smart technologies applied as a whole to hotels is largely underexplored. To address this shortfall, a study with a focus on tourists’ acceptance of experience-enhancement smart technologies has been conducted. A technology acceptance model based conceptual framework was developed, followed by a series of interviews with the managerial staff of ten hotels in Hong Kong that adopt experience-enhancement smart technologies. Based on the interview findings, a questionnaire was designed for use in a survey in which data were collected face-to-face from 312 tourists. Structural equation modelling was utilised to reveal the interrelationships between nine technology acceptance parameters.

AB  - The field of electric vehicle charging load modelling has been growing rapidly in the last decade. In light of the Paris Agreement, it is crucial to keep encouraging better modelling techniques for successful electric vehicle adoption. Additionally, numerous papers highlight the lack of charging station data available in order to build models that are consistent with reality. In this context, the purpose of this article is threefold. First, to provide the reader with an overview of the open datasets available and ready to be used in order to foster reproducible research in the field. Second, to review electric vehicle charging load models with their strengths and weaknesses. Third, to provide suggestions on matching the models reviewed to six datasets found in this research that have not previously been explored in the literature. The open data search covered more than 860 repositories and yielded around 60 datasets that are relevant for modelling electric vehicle charging load. These datasets include information on charging point locations, historical and real-time charging sessions, traffic counts, travel surveys and registered vehicles. The models reviewed range from statistical characterization to stochastic processes and machine learning and the context of their application is assessed.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral remote sensing is an important monitoring technology for the soil moisture content (SMC) of agroecological systems in arid regions. This technology develops precision farming and agricultural informatization. However, hyperspectral data are generally used in data mining. In this study, UAV-based hyperspectral imaging data with a resolution o 4 cm and totaling 70 soil samples (0–10 cm) were collected from farmland (2.5 × 104 m2) near Fukang City, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Four estimation strategies were tested: the original image (strategy I), first- and second-order derivative methods (strategy II), the fractional-order derivative (FOD) technique (strategy III), and the optimal fractional order combined with the optimal multiband indices (strategy IV). These strategies were based on the eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) algorithm, with the aim of building the best estimation model for agricultural SMC in arid regions. The results demonstrated that FOD technology could effectively mine information (with an absolute maximum correlation coefficient of 0.768). By comparison, strategy IV yielded the best estimates out of the methods tested (R2val = 0.921, RMSEP = 1.943, and RPD = 2.736) for the SMC. The model derived from the order of 0.4 within strategy IV worked relatively well among the different derivative methods (strategy I, II, and III). In conclusion, the combination of FOD technology and the optimal multiband indices generated a highly accurate model within the XGBoost algorithm for SMC estimation. This research provided a promising data mining approach for UAV-based hyperspectral imaging data.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The demand for multimedia content over the Internet protocol network is growing exponentially with Internet users’ growth. Despite high reliability and well-defined infrastructure for Internet protocol communication, Quality of Experience (QoE) is the primary focus of multimedia users while getting multimedia contents with flawless or smooth video streaming in less time with high availability. Failure to provide satisfactory QoE results in the churning of the viewers. QoE depends on various factors, such as those related to the network infrastructure that significantly affects perceived quality. Furthermore, the video delivery’s impact also plays an essential role in the overall QoE that can be made efficient by delivering content through specialized content delivery architectures called Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). This article proposes a design that enables effective and efficient streaming, distribution, and caching multimedia content. Moreover, experiments are carried out for the factors impacting QoE, and their behavior is evaluated. The statistical data is taken from real architecture and analysis. Likewise, we have compared the response time and throughput with the varying segment size in adaptive bitrate video streaming. Moreover, resource usage is also analyzed by incorporating the effect of CPU consumption and energy consumption over segment size, which will be counted as effective efforts for sustainable development of multimedia systems. The proposed architecture is validated and indulged as a core component for video streaming based on the use case of a Mobile IPTV solution for 4G/LTE Users.

AB  - Currently, universities are going through a critical moment due to the coronavirus disease in 2019. To prevent its spread, countries have declared quarantines and isolation in all sectors of society. This has caused many problems in the learning of students, since, when moving from a face-to-face educational model to a remote model, several academic factors such as psychological, financial, and methodological have been overlooked. To exactly identify the variables and causes that affect learning, in this work a data analysis model using a Hadoop framework is proposed. By processing the data, it is possible to identify and classify students to determine the problems they present in different learning activities. The results are used by an artificial intelligence system that takes student information and converts it into knowledge, evaluates the academic performance problems they present, and determines what type of activity aligns with the students. The artificial intelligence system processes the information and recommends activities that focus on each student’s abilities and needs. The integration of these systems to universities creates an adaptive educational model that responds to the new challenges of society.

AB  - Over the last few years, the increasing level of cyber risks derived from the growing connectedness of Industry 4.0 has led to the emergence of blockchain technology as a major innovation in supply chain cybersecurity. The main purpose of this study is to identify and rank the significant barriers affecting the implementation of blockchain technology as a key component of cyber supply chain risk management (CSCRM). This research relied on the “interpretive structural modeling (ISM)” technique in the structure of a hierarchical model to investigate the contextual relationships of identified challenges for blockchain adoption in CSCRM; it also classifies the influential challenges based on their driving and dependence powers. The results highlight that “cryptocurrency volatility” is the challenge at the top level of the hierarchy, implying weak driving power but it is strongly dependent on the other challenges. “Poor regulatory provisions”, “technology immaturity”, “dependent on input information from external oracles”, “scalability and bandwidth issues”, and “smart contract issues” are significant challenges for the adoption of blockchain in cyber supply chain risk management and are located at the bottom level of the hierarchy with higher driving power. The implications for theory and practice of the research are also highlighted.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have huge potential to efficiently manage the automated operation of the internet of things (IoT) nodes deployed in smart cities. In smart cities, the major IoT applications are smart traffic monitoring, smart waste management, smart buildings and patient healthcare monitoring. The small size IoT nodes based on low power Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) standard and wireless sensor networks (WSN) (IEEE 802.15.4) standard are generally used for transmission of data to a remote location using gateways. The WSN based IoT (WSN-IoT) design problems include network coverage and connectivity issues, energy consumption, bandwidth requirement, network lifetime maximization, communication protocols and state of the art infrastructure. In this paper, the authors propose machine learning methods as an optimization tool for regular WSN-IoT nodes deployed in smart city applications. As per the author’s knowledge, this is the first in-depth literature survey of all ML techniques in the field of low power consumption WSN-IoT for smart cities. The results of this unique survey article show that the supervised learning algorithms have been most widely used (61%) as compared to reinforcement learning (27%) and unsupervised learning (12%) for smart city applications.

AB  - Year after year, mobile malware attacks grow in both sophistication and diffusion. As the open source Android platform continues to dominate the market, malware writers consider it as their preferred target. Almost strictly, state-of-the-art mobile malware detection solutions in the literature capitalize on machine learning to detect pieces of malware. Nevertheless, our findings clearly indicate that the majority of existing works utilize different metrics and models and employ diverse datasets and classification features stemming from disparate analysis techniques, i.e., static, dynamic, or hybrid. This complicates the cross-comparison of the various proposed detection schemes and may also raise doubts about the derived results. To address this problem, spanning a period of the last seven years, this work attempts to schematize the so far ML-powered malware detection approaches and techniques by organizing them under four axes, namely, the age of the selected dataset, the analysis type used, the employed ML techniques, and the chosen performance metrics. Moreover, based on these axes, we introduce a converging scheme which can guide future Android malware detection techniques and provide a solid baseline to machine learning practices in this field.

Since 2011, 700 Chinese universities and institutions have established IoT Engineering undergraduate programs. We surveyed the history, status, curriculum, and problems of IoT undergraduate degree programs in China. Based on data collected from faculties, students, and graduates, we found that the IoT Engineering curriculum was an unsystematic patchwork and was deficient in practical platforms. We then provide suggestions for further development and exploration of IoT education by presenting a Technical Knowledge Map of IoT Engineering. This survey work on Chinese IoT education can prompt Chinese educators to reflect on its achievements and problems, which will contribute to IoT talent cultivation worldwide.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a topic of intense interest among the research and industrial community as it has had a revolutionary impact on human life. The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart devices, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart city, smart grid, among others. IoT devices’ security has become a serious concern nowadays, especially for the healthcare domain, where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security solutions are well established. However, due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the context-aware IoT security solutions, especially for a sensitive use case like IoT healthcare environment.

AB  - Technologies and services towards smart-vehicles and Intelligent-Transportation-Systems (ITS), continues to revolutionize many aspects of human life. This paper presents a detailed survey of current techniques and advancements in Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition (ANPR) systems, with a comprehensive performance comparison of various real-time tested and simulated algorithms, including those involving computer vision (CV). ANPR technology has the ability to detect and recognize vehicles by their number-plates using recognition techniques. Even with the best algorithms, a successful ANPR system deployment may require additional hardware to maximize its accuracy. The number plate condition, non-standardized formats, complex scenes, camera quality, camera mount position, tolerance to distortion, motion-blur, contrast problems, reflections, processing and memory limitations, environmental conditions, indoor/outdoor or day/night shots, software-tools or other hardware-based constraint may undermine its performance. This inconsistency, challenging environments and other complexities make ANPR an interesting field for researchers. The Internet-of-Things is beginning to shape future of many industries and is paving new ways for ITS. ANPR can be well utilized by integrating with RFID-systems, GPS, Android platforms and other similar technologies. Deep-Learning techniques are widely utilized in CV field for better detection rates. This research aims to advance the state-of-knowledge in ITS (ANPR) built on CV algorithms; by citing relevant prior work, analyzing and presenting a survey of extraction, segmentation and recognition techniques whilst providing guidelines on future trends in this area.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - This work discusses recent developments in sharing economy concepts and collaborative co-design technology platforms applied in districts and cities. These developments are being driven both by new technological advances and by increased environmental awareness. The paper begins by outlining the state of the art in smart technology platforms for collaborative urban design, highlighting a number of recent examples. The case of peer-to-peer trading platforms applied in the energy sector is then used to illustrate how sharing economy concepts and their enabling technologies can accelerate efforts towards more sustainable urban environments. It was found that smart technology platforms can encourage peer-to-peer and collaborative activity, and may have a profound influence on the future development of cities. Many of the research and development projects in this area to date have focused on demonstrations at the building, neighbourhood, and local community scales. Scaling these sharing economy platforms up to the city scale and beyond has the potential to provide a number of positive environment impacts. However, significant technical and regulatory barriers to wider implementation exist, and realising this potential will require radical new approaches to the ownership and governance of urban infrastructure. This paper provides a concise overview of the state of the art in this emerging field, with the aim of identifying the most promising areas for further research.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UAVs) are dramatically evolving and promoting several civil applications. However, they are still prone to many security issues that threaten public safety. Security becomes even more challenging when they are connected to the Internet as their data stream is exposed to attacks. Unmanned traffic management (UTM) represents one of the most important topics for small unmanned aerial systems for beyond-line-of-sight operations in controlled low-altitude airspace. However, without securing the flight path exchanges between drones and ground stations or control centers, serious security threats may lead to disastrous situations. For example, a predefined flight path could be easily altered to make the drone perform illegal operations. Motivated by these facts, this paper discusses the security issues for UTM’s components and addresses the security requirements for such systems. Moreover, we propose UTM-Chain, a lightweight blockchain-based security solution using hyperledger fabric for UTM of low-altitude UAVs which fits the computational and storage resources limitations of UAVs. Moreover, UTM-Chain provides secure and unalterable traffic data between the UAVs and their ground control stations. The performance of the proposed system related to transaction latency and resource utilization is analyzed by using cAdvisor. Finally, the analysis of security aspects demonstrates that the proposed UTM-Chain scheme is feasible and extensible for the secure sharing of UAV data.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In the last decade, sentiment analysis has been widely applied in many domains, including business, social networks and education. Particularly in the education domain, where dealing with and processing students’ opinions is a complicated task due to the nature of the language used by students and the large volume of information, the application of sentiment analysis is growing yet remains challenging. Several literature reviews reveal the state of the application of sentiment analysis in this domain from different perspectives and contexts. However, the body of literature is lacking a review that systematically classifies the research and results of the application of natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) solutions for sentiment analysis in the education domain. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping study to structure the published information available. We used a stepwise PRISMA framework to guide the search process and searched for studies conducted between 2015 and 2020 in the electronic research databases of the scientific literature. We identified 92 relevant studies out of 612 that were initially found on the sentiment analysis of students’ feedback in learning platform environments. The mapping results showed that, despite the identified challenges, the field is rapidly growing, especially regarding the application of DL, which is the most recent trend. We identified various aspects that need to be considered in order to contribute to the maturity of research and development in the field. Among these aspects, we highlighted the need of having structured datasets, standardized solutions and increased focus on emotional expression and detection.

AB  - Capacity to remotely monitor and control systems for waste-water treatment and to provide real time and trustworthy data of system’s behavior to various stakeholders is of high relevance. SCADA systems are used to undertake this job. SCADA solutions are usually conceptualized and designed with a major focus on technological integrability and functionality. Very little contributions are brought to optimize these systems with respect to a mix of target functions, especially considering a lifecycle perspective. In this paper, we propose a structured methodology for optimizing SCADA systems from a lifecycle perspective for the specific case of waste-water treatment units. The methodology embeds techniques for handling entropy in the design process and to assist engineers in designing effective solutions in a space with multiple constrains and conflicts. Evolutionary multiple optimization algorithms are used to handle this challenge. After the foundation of the theoretical model calibrated for the specific case of waste-water treatment units, a practical example illustrates its applicability. It is shown how the model can lead to a disruptive solution, which integrates cloud computing, IoT, and data analytics in the SCADA system, with some competitive advantages in terms of flexibility, cost effectiveness, and increased value added for both integrators and beneficiaries.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has come of age, and complex solutions can now be implemented seamlessly within urban governance and management frameworks and processes. For cities, growing rates of car ownership are rendering parking availability a challenge and lowering the quality of life through increased carbon emissions. The development of smart parking solutions is thus necessary to reduce the time spent looking for parking and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The principal role of this research paper is to analyze smart parking solutions from a technical perspective, underlining the systems and sensors that are available, as documented in the literature. The review seeks to provide comprehensive insights into the building of smart parking solutions. A holistic survey of the current state of smart parking systems should incorporate the classification of such systems as big vehicular detection technologies. Finally, communication modules are presented with clarity.

AB  - Intersection management is a sophisticated event in the intelligent transportation system due to a variety of behavior for traffic participants. This paper primarily overviews recent studies on the scenes of intersection, aiming at improving the efficiency or guaranteeing the safety when vehicles pass the crossing. These studies are respectively surveyed from the perspectives of efficiency and safety. Firstly, recent contributions to efficiency-oriented, intersection management overviews from four scenes, including congestion avoidance, green light optimized speed advisory (GLOSA), trajectory planning, and emergency vehicle priority preemption control. Furthermore, the studies on intersection collision detection and abnormal information warning are surveyed in the safety category. The corresponding algorithms for velocity and route management presented in the surveyed works are discussed.

AB  - Sharing data and services in the Internet of Things (IoT) can give rise to significant security concerns with information being sensitive and vulnerable to attacks. In such an environment, objects can be either public resources or owned by humans. For this reason, the need of monitoring the reliability of all involved actors, both persons and smart objects, assuring that they really are who they claim to be, is becoming an essential property of the IoT, with the increase in the pervasive adoption of such a paradigm. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a new framework, called H2O (Human to Object). Our solution is able to continuously authenticate an entity in the network, providing a reliability assessment mechanism based on behavioral fingerprinting. A detailed security analysis evaluates the robustness of the proposed protocol; furthermore, a performance analysis shows the feasibility of our approach.

AB  - Many algorithms use clustering to improve vehicular ad hoc network performance. The expected points of many of these approaches support multiple rounds of data to the roadside unit and constantly include clustering in every round of single-hop data transmission towards the road side unit; however, the clustering in every round maximizes the number of control messages and there could be the possibility of collision and decreases in network energy. Multi-hop transmission prolongs the cluster head node’s lifetime and boosts the network’s efficiency. Accordingly, this article proposes a new fuzzy-clustering-based routing algorithm to benefit from multi-hop transmission clustering simultaneously. This research has analyzed the limitation of clustering in each round, different algorithms were used to perform the clustering, and multi-hop routing was used to transfer the data of every cluster to the road side unit. The fuzzy logic was used to choose the head node of each cluster. Three parameters, (1) distance of each node, (2) remaining energy, and (3) number of neighbors of every node, were considered as fuzzy criteria. The results of this research were compared to various other algorithms in relation to parameters like dead node in every round, first node expire, half node expire, last node expire, and the network lifetime. The simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other methods. On the other hand, the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) environment is vulnerable at the time of data transmission. The NS-2 software tool was used to simulate and evaluate the proposed fuzzy logic opportunistic routing’s performance results concerning end-to-end delay, packet delivery, and network throughput. We compare to the existing protocols, such as fuzzy Internet of Things (IoT), two fuzzy, and Fuzzy-Based Driver Monitoring System (FDMS). The performance comparison also emphasizes an effective utilization of the resources. Simulations on the highway environment show that the suggested protocol has an improved Quality of Service (QoS) efficiency compared to the above published methods in the literature.

AB  - Traffic congestion in expressway networks has a strong negative influence on regional development. Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of traffic congestion in expressway networks is critical for improving the exchange of products in regional production and promoting regional economic development. Nevertheless, existing studies pay less attention to these spatiotemporal patterns of traffic congestion. Considering that Origin–Destination (OD) data are available for the recorded spatial movements of vehicles in expressways, this study proposes a method with which to explore traffic congestion at the level of road segments in the regional expressway network, the mainstream of driving behaviors, and traffic regulations. Methods for analyzing spatial disparity and temporal changes in traffic congestion in expressway networks are also put forward in this paper. The empirical results show that the proposed methods could detect road segments where traffic congestion happens, and then uncover temporal patterns of several congested locations and spatial patterns of road segments with frequent congestion. These spatiotemporal patterns of traffic congestion could be in accord with the actual situation. This study provides a new approach to investigating traffic congestion in expressway networks based on low-cost data, which might be helpful for optimizing expressway network planning and promoting balanced regional development.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Solar Photovoltaic (PV) energy has experienced an important growth and prospect during the last decade due to the constant development of the technology and its high reliability, together with a drastic reduction in costs. This fact has favored both its large-scale implementation and small-scale Distributed Generation (DG). PV systems integrated into local distribution systems are considered to be one of the keys to a sustainable future built environment in Smart Cities (SC). Advanced Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of solar PV plants is necessary. Powerful and accurate data are usually obtained on-site by means of current-voltage (I-V) curves or electroluminescence (EL) images, with new equipment and methodologies recently proposed. In this work, authors present a comparison between five AI-based models to classify PV solar cells according to their state, using EL images at the PV solar cell level, while the cell I-V curves are used in the training phase to be able to classify the cells based on its production efficiency. This automatic classification of defective cells enormously facilitates the identification of defects for PV plant operators, decreasing the human labor and optimizing the defect location. In addition, this work presents a methodology for the selection of important variables for the training of a defective cell classifier.

AB  - In the present computational scenario, one can perceive the emergence of cryptocurrencies and the increased utilization of IoT devices, which are pushing to new challenges, opportunities, and behavior changes. It is still not known how these technologies will impact the current business and economic models. In this regard, this study proposes an economy of things architecture and an approach comparing several cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the proposed architecture aims to use these new opportunities to enable device-to-device (D2D) interaction based on this novel paradigm, called the Economy of Things (EoT). An experimental environment was conducted to compare characteristics of the cryptocurrencies Ripple, Iota, and Ethereum. The initial results show several interesting differences related to transaction costs, errors, speeds, and threads.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT)-based target tracking system is required for applications such as smart farm, smart factory, and smart city where many sensor devices are jointly connected to collect the moving target positions. Each sensor device continuously runs on battery-operated power, consuming energy while perceiving target information in a particular environment. To reduce sensor device energy consumption in real-time IoT tracking applications, many traditional methods such as clustering, information-driven, and other approaches have previously been utilized to select the best sensor. However, applying machine learning methods, particularly deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL), to address the problem of sensor selection in tracking applications is quite demanding because of the limited sensor node battery lifetime. In this study, we proposed a long short-term memory deep Q-network (DQN)-based Deep RL target tracking model to overcome the problem of energy consumption in IoT target applications. The proposed method is utilized to select the energy-efficient best sensor while tracking the target. The best sensor is defined by the minimum distance function (i.e., derived as the state), which leads to lower energy consumption. The simulation results show favorable features in terms of the best sensor selection and energy consumption.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - In the digital era, almost every system is connected to a digital platform to enhance efficiency. Although life is thus improved, security issues remain important, especially in the healthcare sector. The privacy and security of healthcare records is paramount; data leakage is socially unacceptable. Therefore, technology that protects data but does not compromise efficiency is essential. Blockchain technology has gained increasing attention as it ensures transparency, trust, privacy, and security. However, the critical factors affecting efficiency require further study. Here, we define the critical factors that affect blockchain implementation in the healthcare industry. We extracted such factors from the literature and from experts, then used interpretive structural modeling to define the interrelationships among these factors and classify them according to driving and dependence forces. This identified key drivers of the desired objectives. Regulatory clarity and governance (F2), immature technology (F3), high investment cost (F6), blockchain developers (F9), and trust among stakeholders (F12) are key factors to consider when seeking to implement blockchain technology in healthcare. Our analysis will allow managers to understand the requirements for successful implementation.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In the digital transformation era in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry, Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT) are introduced as part of the next level of process automation and control towards Construction 4.0. CDT incorporates cognitive abilities to detect complex and unpredictable actions and reason about dynamic process optimization strategies to support decision-making in building lifecycle management (BLM). Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of the real impact of CDT integration, Machine Learning (ML), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT), all connected to self-learning hybrid models with proactive cognitive capabilities for different phases of the building asset lifecycle. This study investigates the applicability, interoperability, and integrability of an adapted model of CDT for BLM to identify and close this gap. Surveys of industry experts were performed focusing on life cycle-centric applicability, interoperability, and the CDT model’s integration in practice besides decision support capabilities and AEC industry insights. The evaluation of the adapted model of CDT model support approaching the development of CDT for process optimization and decision-making purposes, as well as integrability enablers confirms progression towards Construction 4.0.

AB  - With the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) around the world, debates have arisen with regard to their impacts on people’s lifestyles and urban space. Mining spatio-temporal patterns from increasingly smart city sensors and personal mobile devices have become an important approach in understanding the interaction between human activity and urban space. In this study, we used location-based service data to identify EV owners and capture the distribution of home and charging stations. The research goal was to investigate that how the urban form in regions under rapid urbanization is driven by EV use, from a geographical perspective. Using a case study of the expanding metropolis of Beijing, GIS-based spatial statistical analysis was conducted to characterize the spatial-pattern of the homes of EV owners as well as their charging preferences. Our results indicate that the spatial clustering of the homes of EV owners in non-urban central areas—suburban areas—is significantly higher than that in urban central areas. According to the records of visits to charging stations, the spatial interaction distance between the dwellings of EV owners and their visits to charging stations exhibits significant distance attenuation characteristics. 88% of EV owners in this research travels within 40 km (Euclidean distance) between housing and charging stations. At the same time, there were significant differences in the spatial patterns between working days and non-working days which are affected by commuting activities. The three types of urban spatial interaction patterns were identified and categorized by visualization. This transformation to EV use in the city influences several aspects of people’s decisions and behaviors in life. Understanding the impacts will provide valuable information for the development of EVs and their implications in the electrification of transportation, smart planning, and sustainable urbanization.

AB  - In Internet of Things (IoT) environments, privacy and security are among some of the significant challenges. Recently, several studies have attempted to apply blockchain technology to increase IoT network security. However, the lightweight feature of IoT devices commonly fails to meet computational intensive requirements for blockchain-based security models. In this work, we propose a mechanism to address this issue. We design an IoT blockchain architecture to store device identity information in a distributed ledger. We propose a Blockchain of Things (BCoT) Gateway to facilitate the recording of authentication transactions in a blockchain network without modifying existing device hardware or applications. Furthermore, we introduce a new device recognition model that is suitable for blockchain-based identity authentication, where we employ a novel feature selection method for device traffic flow. Finally, we develop the BCoT Sentry framework as a reference implementation of our proposed method. Experiment results verify the feasibility of our proposed framework.

AB  - The use of digital technologies such as Internet of Things and advanced data analytics are central in digitally transforming manufacturing companies towards Industry 4.0. Success cases are frequently reported, and there is clear evidence of technology interventions conducted by industry. However, measuring the impact and effect of such interventions on digital maturity and on the organizational adoption can be challenging. Therefore, the research aim of this paper is to explore how the combination of the different methods of Industrial Internet Playground (IIP) pilots, Shadow Infrastructure (SI) and digital maturity assessment can assist in conducting and documenting the technical, as well as organisational, impact of digital interventions. Through an elaborate literature review of existing digital maturity assessment tools and key dimensions in digital transformation, we have developed a digital maturity assessment tool (DMAT), which is presented and applied in the paper to identify digital development areas and to evaluate and document the effects of digital interventions. Thus, the paper contributes with new knowledge of how the IIP pilot and SI combined with digital maturity assessment can support effective, transparent and documented digital transformation throughout an organisation, as explored through theory and a practice case.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - This article proposes a new framework for a Cloud-based eHealth platform concept focused on Cloud computing environments, since current and emerging approaches using digital clinical history increasingly demonstrate their potential in maintaining the quality of the benefits in medical care services, especially in computer-assisted clinical diagnosis within the field of infectious diseases and due to the worsening of chronic pathologies. Our objective is to evaluate and contrast the performance of the architectural patterns most commonly used for developing eHealth applications (i.e., service-oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices architecture (MSA)), using as reference the quantitative values obtained from the various performance tests and their ability to adapt to the required software attribute (i.e., versatile high-performance). Therefore, it was necessary to modify our platform to fit two architectural variants. As a follow-up to this activity, corresponding tests were performed that showed that the MSA variant functions better in terms of performance and response time compared to the SOA variant; however, it consumed significantly more bandwidth than SOA, and scalability in SOA is generally not possible or requires significant effort to be achieved. We conclude that the implementation of SOA and MSA depends on the nature and needs of organizations (e.g., performance or interoperability).

AB  - Studies on human mobility have a long history with increasingly strong interdisciplinary connections across social science, environmental science, information and technology, computer science, engineering, and health science. However, what is lacking in the current research is a synthesis of the studies to identify the evolutional pathways and future research directions. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic review of human mobility-related studies published from 1990 to 2020. Drawing on the selected publications retrieved from the Web of Science, we provide a bibliometric analysis and network visualisation using CiteSpace and VOSviewer on the number of publications and year published, authors and their countries and afflictions, citations, topics, abstracts, keywords, and journals. Our findings show that human mobility-related studies have become increasingly interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional, which have been strengthened by the use of the so-called ‘big data’ from multiple sources, the development of computer technologies, the innovation of modelling approaches, and the novel applications in various areas. Based on our synthesis of the work by top cited authors we identify four directions for future research relating to data sources, modelling methods, applications, and technologies. We advocate for more in-depth research on human mobility using multi-source big data, improving modelling methods and integrating advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, and machine and deep learning to address real-world problems and contribute to social good.

AB  - A smart city represents an improvement of today’s cities, both functionally and structurally, that strategically utilizes several smart factors, capitalizing on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to increase the city’s sustainable growth and strengthen the city’s functions, while ensuring the citizens’ enhanced quality of life and health. Cities can be viewed as a microcosm of interconnected “objects” with which citizens interact daily, which represents an extremely interesting example of a cyber physical system (CPS), where the continuous monitoring of a city’s status occurs through sensors and processors applied within the real-world infrastructure. Each object in a city can be both the collector and distributor of information regarding mobility, energy consumption, air pollution as well as potentially offering cultural and tourist information. As a consequence, the cyber and real worlds are strongly linked and interdependent in a smart city. New services can be deployed when needed, and evaluation mechanisms can be set up to assess the health and success of a smart city. In particular, the objectives of creating ICT-enabled smart city environments target (but are not limited to) improved city services; optimized decision-making; the creation of smart urban infrastructures; the orchestration of cyber and physical resources; addressing challenging urban issues, such as environmental pollution, transportation management, energy usage and public health; the optimization of the use and benefits of next generation (5G and beyond) communication; the capitalization of social networks and their analysis; support for tactile internet applications; and the inspiration of urban citizens to improve their quality of life. However, the large scale deployment of cyber-physical-social systems faces a series of challenges and issues (e.g., energy efficiency requirements, architecture, protocol stack design, implementation, and security), which requires more smart sensing and computing methods as well as advanced networking and communications technologies to provide more pervasive cyber-physical-social services. In this paper, we discuss the challenges, the state-of-the-art, and the solutions to a set of currently unresolved key questions related to CPSs and smart cities.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) technology has advanced in recent years, leading to improvements of manufacturing processes. As a result of such improvements, environmental sustainability assessments for technologies have been requested by international control agencies. Although various assessment approaches are widely applied, IoT technology requires effective assessment methods to support the decision-making process and that incorporate qualitative measures to create quantifiable values. In this paper, a new environmental sustainability assessment method is developed to assess radio frequency identification (RFID) and wireless sensors networks (WSN). This integrated assessment method incorporates a modified and redesigned conceptual methodology based on technical project evaluation (IMATOV) and an extension of conventional lifecycle measures. The results shows the most and least important metrics. The most important metrics are the categories “electronic devices disposed of completely” and “decrease in stocks”, with the greatest GWFs (20% and 19%, respectively) and IAVs (127% and 117%, respectively) and moderate consolidated degrees of fulfillment. Relatively low degrees of fulfillment are achieved by categories such as “decrease in numbers of assets”, “supply chain echelons benefiting RFID”, and “tag lifecycle duration”, with IAVs below 10%. This study promotes an integrated method to support decision-making processes in the context of environmental sustainability assessments based on lifecycle measures.

AB  - District heating and cooling (DHC) systems play an important role under the new European Union (EU) energy transition strategy. Thermal energy networks are helping to stimulate the development of alternative technologies based on a broad range of renewable energy sources. The present study analysed the current situation of DHC systems in Spain and provides an overview of the challenges and future opportunities that their use will entail. Its objective is to assess thermal energy conversion and management from a holistic perspective, including a study of existing energy infrastructures. The focus of this study lies on Spain given the country’s abundance of natural resources such as renewable energy sources including solar energy, biomass and geothermal energy, among others, as well as its strategic location on the map of the EU. Based on the analysis of the three factors for energy conversion in a district heating system, namely resources, technology, and management, the methodology provided an assessment of the different factors involved in running a DHC system. The results show an estimated total production for DHC networks of 1448 MWth, of which 72% is supplied purely by renewable energy sources.

AB  - The digital transformation supports many cities on the way to becoming smarter cities, enabling them to enhance digital processes, care about climate-friendly goals, or improve the quality of life of their citizens. However, such changes usually take place step by step and not in a big-bang approach. In order for the direction of the digital transformation to be defined, it is necessary to know and understand the needs and requirements of all relevant stakeholders who will be affected or are intended to use the new digital solutions. As our environment, a smart city district, is currently under construction, we do not know most of the future stakeholders yet. Therefore, we had to find new ways of eliciting the needs and requirements for digital solutions without knowing, e.g., the citizens who will live in the future district. We show a framework of the procedures we followed, classified into (a) vision and concepts, (b) smart city district digital ecosystem, and (c) dissemination and events. We substantiate the processes with example results and provide a discussion on how we evaluate our solutions with respect to future applicability. Because evaluations are only very limited in our setting right now, we focus on four lead questions to argue why the procedures and results are adequate and share the lessons we learned on this path towards a digital smart city district.

AB  - The emerging paradigm of the cognitive city, which augments smart cities with learning and behavioral change capabilities, is gaining increasing attention as a promising solution to the challenges of future mega-cities. Cognitive cities are built upon artificial learning and behavioral analysis techniques founded on the exploitation of human-machine collective intelligence. Hence, cognitive cities rely on the sharing of citizens’ daily-life data, which might be considered sensitive personal data. In this context, privacy and security of the shared information become critical issues that have to be addressed to guarantee the proper deployment of cognitive cities and the fundamental rights of people. This article provides a thorough literature review using the recommendations for systematic reviews proposed by Vom Brocke et al. and the PRISMA statement. We analyze peer-reviewed publications indexed in ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science until July 2020. We identify the main challenges on privacy and information security within cognitive cities, and the proposals described in the literature to address them. We conclude that many challenges remain open and we suggest several research lines that will require further examination in the years to come.

AB  - With growing evidence of the operational performance of cyber-physical manufacturing systems, there is a pivotal need for comprehending sustainable, smart, and sensing technologies underpinning data-driven decision-making processes. In this research, previous findings were cumulated showing that cyber-physical production networks operate automatically and smoothly with artificial intelligence-based decision-making algorithms in a sustainable manner and contribute to the literature by indicating that sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing systems function in an automated, robust, and flexible manner. Throughout October 2020 and April 2021, a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases was performed, with search terms including “Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics”, “sustainable smart manufacturing”, “cyber-physical production system”, “industrial big data”, “sustainable organizational performance”, “cyber-physical smart manufacturing system”, and “sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing system”. As research published between 2018 and 2021 was inspected, and only 426 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. By taking out controversial or ambiguous findings (insufficient/irrelevant data), outcomes unsubstantiated by replication, too general material, or studies with nearly identical titles, we selected 174 mainly empirical sources. Further developments should entail how cyber-physical production networks and Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics, by use of cognitive decision-making algorithms, enable the advancement of data-driven sustainable smart manufacturing.

AB  - Since architect Nicholas Negroponte first proposed a vision of responsive architecture smart environments have been widely investigated, especially in the fields of computer science and engineering. Despite growing interest in the topic, a comprehensive review of research about smart environments from the architectural perspective is largely missing. In order to provide a formal understanding of smart environments in architecture, this paper conducts a systematic literature review of scholarly sources over the last decade, focusing on four related subjects: (1) responsive architecture, (2) kinetic architecture, (3) adaptive architecture and (4) intelligent buildings. Through this review, the paper identifies and examines interactive and collective behaviors in smart environments, thereby contributing to defining the properties of creative, smart spaces in the contemporary digital ecosystem. In addition, this research offers a means of systematically characterizing and constructing smart environments as interactive and collective platforms, enabling occupants to sense, experience and understand smart spaces.

AB  - Nowadays, many urban areas are developing projects that are included within the area of smart cities. These systems tend to be highly heterogeneous and involve a large number of different technologies and participants. In general, cities deploy systems to integrate data and to provide protocols to ease interconnectivity between different subsystems. However, this is not enough to build a completely interoperable smart city, where control fully belongs to city administrators and citizens. Currently, in most cases, subsystems tend to be deployed and operated by providers creating silos. Furthermore, citizens, who should be the center of these systems, are often relegated to being just another participant. In this article, we study how smart cities can move towards decentralized and user-centric systems relying on distributed ledger technologies (DLT). For this, we define a conceptual framework that describes the interaction between smart city components, their participants, and the DLT ecosystem. We analyze the trust models that are created between the participants in the most relevant use cases, and we study the suitability of the different DLT types.

AB  - The increasing interconnections of city services, the explosion of available urban data, and the need for multidisciplinary analysis and decision making for city sustainability require new technological solutions to cope with such complexity. Ontologies have become viable and effective tools to practitioners for developing applications requiring data and process interoperability, big data management, and automated reasoning on knowledge. We investigate how and to what extent ontologies have been used to support smart city services and we provide a comprehensive reference on what problems have been addressed and what has been achieved so far with ontology-based applications. To this purpose, we conducted a systematic literature review finalized to presenting the ontologies, and the methods and technological systems where ontologies play a relevant role in shaping current smart cities. Based on the result of the review process, we also propose a classification of the sub-domains of the city addressed by the ontologies we found, and the research issues that have been considered so far by the scientific community. We highlight those for which semantic technologies have been mostly demonstrated to be effective to enhance the smart city concept and, finally, discuss in more details about some open problems.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used extensively for search and rescue operations, surveillance, disaster monitoring, attacking terrorists, etc. due to their growing advantages of low-cost, high maneuverability, and easy deployability. This study proposes a mixed-integer programming model under a multi-objective optimization framework to design trajectories that enable a set of UAVs to execute surveillance tasks. The first objective maximizes the cumulative probability of target detection to aim for mission planning success. The second objective ensures minimization of cumulative path length to provide a higher resource utilization goal. A two-step variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is offered, which addresses the combinatorial optimization issue for determining the near-optimal sequence for cell visiting to reach the target. Numerical experiments and simulation results are evaluated in numerous benchmark instances. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach can favorably support practical deployability purposes.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Smart cities use digital technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things, or open data in order to overcome limitations of traditional representation and exchange of geospatial data. This concept ensures a significant increase in the use of data to establish new services that contribute to better sustainable development and monitoring of all phenomena that occur in urban areas. The use of the modern geoinformation technologies, such as sensors for collecting different geospatial and related data, requires adequate storage options for further data analysis. In this paper, we suggest the biG dAta sMart cIty maNagEment SyStem (GAMINESS) that is based on the Apache Spark big data framework. The model of the GAMINESS management system is based on the principles of the big data modeling, which differs greatly from standard databases. This approach provides the ability to store and manage huge amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in real time. System performance is increasing to a higher level by using the process parallelization explained through the five V principles of the big data paradigm. The existing solutions based on the five V principles are focused only on the data visualization, not the data themselves. Such solutions are often limited by different storage mechanisms and by the ability to perform complex analyses on large amounts of data with expected performance. The GAMINESS management system overcomes these disadvantages by conversion of smart city data to a big data structure without limitations related to data formats or use standards. The suggested model contains two components: a geospatial component and a sensor component that are based on the CityGML and the SensorThings standards. The developed model has the ability to exchange data regardless of the used standard or the data format into proposed Apache Spark data framework schema. The verification of the proposed model is done within the case study for the part of the city of Novi Sad.

VL  - 13
IS  - 10
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The use of a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) in an urban traffic network allows for controlling the infrastructure of a traffic network and errors in its operations. In this research, a novel, stable predictive controller for urban traffic is proposed and state-space dynamics are used to estimate the number of vehicles at an isolated intersection and the length of its queue. This is a novel control strategy based on the type of traffic light and on the duration of the green-light phase and aims to achieve an optimal balance at intersections. This balance should be adaptable to the unchanging behavior of time and to the randomness of traffic situations. The proposed method reduces traffic volumes and the number of crashes involving cars by controlling traffic on an urban road using model predictive control. A single intersection in Tehran, the capital city of Iran, was considered in our study to control traffic signal timing, and model predictive control was used to reduce traffic. A model of traffic systems was extracted at the intersection, and the state-space parameters of the intersection were designed using the model predictive controller to control traffic signals based on the length of the vehicle queue and on the number of inbound and outbound vehicles, which were used as inputs. This process demonstrates that this method is able to reduce traffic volumes at each leg of an intersection and to optimize flow in a road network compared to the fixed-time method.

AB  - Smart cities and communities (SCC) constitute a new paradigm in urban development. SCC ideate a data-centered society aimed at improving efficiency by automating and optimizing activities and utilities. Information and communication technology along with Internet of Things enables data collection and with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) situation awareness can be obtained to feed the SCC actors with enriched knowledge. This paper describes AI perspectives in SCC and gives an overview of AI-based technologies used in traffic to enable road vehicle automation and smart traffic control. Perception, smart traffic control and driver modeling are described along with open research challenges and standardization to help introduce advanced driver assistance systems and automated vehicle functionality in traffic. To fully realize the potential of SCC, to create a holistic view on a city level, availability of data from different stakeholders is necessary. Further, though AI technologies provide accurate predictions and classifications, there is an ambiguity regarding the correctness of their outputs. This can make it difficult for the human operator to trust the system. Today there are no methods that can be used to match function requirements with the level of detail in data annotation in order to train an accurate model. Another challenge related to trust is explainability: models can have difficulty explaining how they came to certain conclusions, so it is difficult for humans to trust them.

AB  - As low-cost sensors have become ubiquitous in air quality measurements, there is a need for more efficient calibration and quantification practices. Here, we deploy stationary low-cost monitors in Colorado and Southern California near oil and gas facilities, focusing our analysis on methane and ozone concentration measurement using metal oxide sensors. In comparing different sensor signal normalization techniques, we propose a z-scoring standardization approach to normalize all sensor signals, making our calibration results more easily transferable among sensor packages. We also attempt several different physical co-location schemes, and explore several calibration models in which only one sensor system needs to be co-located with a reference instrument, and can be used to calibrate the rest of the fleet of sensor systems. This approach greatly reduces the time and effort involved in field normalization without compromising goodness of fit of the calibration model to a significant extent. We also explore other factors affecting the performance of the sensor system quantification method, including the use of different reference instruments, duration of co-location, time averaging, transferability between different physical environments, and the age of metal oxide sensors. Our focus on methane and stationary monitors, in addition to the z-scoring standardization approach, has broad applications in low-cost sensor calibration and utility.

AB  - The small commercial stores opening in housing structures in Seoul have been soaring since the beginning of this century. While commercialization generally increases urban vitality and achieves land use mix, cafés and restaurants in low-rise residential areas may attract numerous passenger populations, with increased noise and crimes, in the residential area. The urban commercialization is so fast and prevalent that neither urban researchers nor policymakers can respond to it timely without a practical prediction tool. Focusing on cafés and restaurants, we propose an XGBoost machine learning model that can predict commercial store openings in urban residential areas and further play the role of an early warning system. Our findings highlight a large degree of difference in the predictor importance between the variables used in our machine learning model. The most important predictor relates to land price, indicating that economic motivation leads to the conversion of urban housing to small cafés and restaurants. The Mapo neighborhood is predicted to be the most prone to the commercialization of urban housing, therefore, its urgency to be prepared against expected commercialization deserves underscoring. Overall, our results show that the machine learning approach can be applied to predict changes in land uses and contribute to timely policy designs in rapidly changing urban context.

AB  - The smart city concept, in which data from different systems are available, contains a multitude of critical infrastructures. This data availability opens new research opportunities in the study of the interdependency between those critical infrastructures and cascading effects solutions and focuses on the smart city as a network of critical infrastructures. This paper proposes an integrated resilience system linking interconnected critical infrastructures in a smart city to improve disaster resilience. A data-driven approach is considered, using artificial intelligence and methods to minimize cascading effects and the destruction of failing critical infrastructures and their components (at a city level). The proposed approach allows rapid recovery of infrastructures’ service performance levels after disasters while keeping the coverage of the assessment of risks, prevention, detection, response, and mitigation of consequences. The proposed approach has the originality and the practical implication of providing a decision support system that handles the infrastructures that will support the city disaster management system—make the city prepare, adapt, absorb, respond, and recover from disasters by taking advantage of the interconnections between its various critical infrastructures to increase the overall resilience capacity. The city of Lisbon (Portugal) is used as a case to show the practical application of the approach.

AB  - Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has attracted enormous interests due to its wide applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), smart homes and healthcare. In this paper, a low-resolution infrared array sensor-based HAR approach is proposed using the deep learning framework. The device-free sensing system leverages the infrared array sensor of 8×8 pixels to collect the infrared signals, which can ensure users’ privacy and effectively reduce the deployment cost of the network. To reduce the influence of temperature variations, a combination of the J-filter noise reduction method and the Butterworth filter is performed to preprocess the infrared signals. Long short-term memory (LSTM), a representative recurrent neural network, is utilized to automatically extract characteristics from the infrared signal and build the recognition model. In addition, the real-time HAR interface is designed by embedding the LSTM model. Experimental results show that the typical daily activities can be classified with the recognition accuracy of 98.287%. The proposed approach yields a better result compared to the existing machine learning methods, and it provides a low-cost yet promising solution for privacy-preserving scenarios.

AB  - In this era of big data, the amount of video content has dramatically increased with an exponential broadening of video streaming services. Hence, it has become very strenuous for end-users to search for their desired videos. Therefore, to attain an accurate and robust clustering of information, a hybrid algorithm was used to introduce a recommender engine with collaborative filtering using Apache Spark and machine learning (ML) libraries. In this study, we implemented a movie recommendation system based on a collaborative filtering approach using the alternating least squared (ALS) model to predict the best-rated movies. Our proposed system uses the last search data of a user regarding movie category and references this to instruct the recommender engine, thereby making a list of predictions for top ratings. The proposed study used a model-based approach of matrix factorization, the ALS algorithm along with a collaborative filtering technique, which solved the cold start, sparse, and scalability problems. In particular, we performed experimental analysis and successfully obtained minimum root mean squared errors (oRMSEs) of 0.8959 to 0.97613, approximately. Moreover, our proposed movie recommendation system showed an accuracy of 97% and predicted the top 1000 ratings for movies.

IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Internet of Things technologies are spurring new types of instructional games, namely reality-enhanced serious games (RESGs), that support training directly in the field. This paper investigates a key feature of RESGs, i.e., user performance evaluation using real data, and studies an application of RESGs for promoting fuel-efficient driving, using fuel consumption as an indicator of driver performance. In particular, we propose a reference model for supporting a novel smart sensing dataflow involving the combination of two modules, based on machine learning, to be employed in RESGs in parallel and in real-time. The first module concerns quantitative performance assessment, while the second one targets verbal recommendation. For the assessment module, we compared the performance of three well-established machine learning algorithms: support vector regression, random forest and artificial neural networks. The experiments show that random forest achieves a slightly better performance assessment correlation than the others but requires a higher inference time. The instant recommendation module, implemented using fuzzy logic, triggers advice when inefficient driving patterns are detected. The dataflow has been tested with data from the enviroCar public dataset, exploiting on board diagnostic II (OBD II) standard vehicular interface information. The data covers various driving environments and vehicle models, which makes the system robust for real-world conditions. The results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, attaining a high estimation correlation (R2 = 0.99, with random forest) and punctual verbal feedback to the driver. An important word of caution concerns users’ privacy, as the modules rely on sensitive personal data, and provide information that by no means should be misused.

AB  - The recent development and deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) present new ways to address urban acoustic challenges in a smart city context. A focus on improving quality of life forms the core of smart-city design paradigms and cannot be limited to simply measuring objective environmental factors, but should also consider the perceptual, psychological and health impacts on citizens. This study therefore makes use of short (1–2.7 s) recordings sourced from a WASN in Milan which were grouped into various environmental sound source types and given an annoyance rating via an online survey with N=100 participants. A multilevel psychoacoustic model was found to achieve an overall R2=0.64 which incorporates Sharpness as a fixed effect regardless of the sound source type and Roughness, Impulsiveness and Tonality as random effects whose coefficients vary depending on the sound source. These results present a promising step toward implementing an on-sensor annoyance model which incorporates psychoacoustic features and sound source type, and is ultimately not dependent on sound level.

Due to the constant environmental, social, and economic transformations of cities, UGSs pose new challenges for management, particularly in fast-growing metropolitan areas. With technological advancement and the evolution of deep learning, it is possible to optimize the acquisition of UGS inventories through the detection of geometric patterns present in satellite imagery. This research evaluates two deep learning model techniques for semantic segmentation of UGS polygons with the use of different convolutional neural network encoders on the U-Net architecture and very high resolution (VHR) imagery to obtain updated information on UGS polygons at the metropolitan area level. The best model yielded a Dice coefficient of 0.57, IoU of 0.75, recall of 0.80, and kappa coefficient of 0.94 with an overall accuracy of 0.97, which reflects a reliable performance of the network in detecting patterns that make up the varied geometry of UGSs. A complete database of UGS polygons was quantified and categorized by types with location and delimited by municipality, allowing for the standardization of the information at the metropolitan level, which will be useful for comparative analysis with a homogenized and updated database. This is of particular interest to urban planners and UGS decision-makers.

AB  - University campuses consists of many buildings within a large area managed by a single organization. Like 3D city modeling, a 3D model of campuses can be utilized to provide a better foundation for planning, navigation and management of buildings. This study approaches 3D modeling of the UTM campus by utilizing data from aerial photos and site observations. The 3D models of buildings were drawn from building footprints in SketchUp and converted to CityGML using FME software. The CityGML models were imported into a geodatabase using 3DCityDB and visualized in Cesium. The resulting 3D model of buildings was in CityGML format level of detail 2, consisting of ground, wall and roof surfaces. The 3D models were positioned with real-world coordinates using the geolocation function in SketchUp. The non-spatial attributes of the 3D models were also stored in a database managed by PostgreSQL. While the methodology demonstrated in this study was found to be able to create LoD2 building models. However, issues of accuracy arose in terms of building details and positioning. Therefore, higher accuracy data, such as point cloud data, should produce higher LoD models and accurate positioning.

AB  - With the increase in the number of users on social networks, sentiment analysis has been gaining attention. Sentiment analysis establishes the aggregation of these opinions to inform researchers about attitudes towards products or topics. Social network data commonly contain authors’ opinions about specific subjects, such as people’s opinions towards steps taken to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Usually, people use dialectal language in their posts on social networks. Dialectal language has obstacles that make opinion analysis a challenging process compared to working with standard language. For the Arabic language, Modern Standard Arabic tools (MSA) cannot be employed with social network data that contain dialectal language. Another challenge of the dialectal Arabic language is the polarity of opinionated words affected by inverters, such as negation, that tend to change the word’s polarity from positive to negative and vice versa. This work analyzes the effect of inverters on sentiment analysis of social network dialectal Arabic posts. It discusses the different reasons that hinder the trivial resolution of inverters. An experiment is conducted on a corpus of data collected from Facebook. However, the same work can be applied to other social network posts. The results show the impact that resolution of negation may have on the classification accuracy. The results show that the F1 score increases by 20% if negation is treated in the text.

AB  - Currently, education is going through a critical moment due to the 2019 coronavirus disease that has been declared a pandemic. This has forced many organizations to undergo a significant transformation, rethinking key elements of their processes and the use of technology to maintain operations. The continuity of education has become dependent on technological tools, as well as on the ability of universities to cope with a precipitous transition to a remote educational model. That has generated problems that affect student learning. This work proposes the implementation of a Big Data framework to identify the factors that affect student performance and decision-making to improve learning. Similar works cover two main research topics under Big Data in education, the modeling and storage of educational data. However, they do not consider issues such as student performance and the improvement of the educational system with the integration of Big Data. In addition, this work provides a guide for future studies and highlights new insights and directions for the successful use of Big Data in education. Real-world data were collected for the evaluation of the proposed framework, the collection of these being the existing limitation in all research due to generalized rejection of data consent.

AB  - The trash disposal system, using standard trash bags, has been adopted by the government of the Republic of Korea (ROK) for more than two decades. This has caused a sanitary problem, as well as some secondary pollution. It is possible to solve this problem by deploying more manpower, but considering the manpower and maintenance costs that impose a heavy burden on the local governments who are experiencing tight financial situations, it would not be feasible. Thus, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based Smart Trash Separation Bin model that can reduce the cost of trash separation work has been proposed in this paper. The three efficient designs that respectively use a sensor, image processing, or spectroscope technology are presented. These IoT-based designs can bring significant merit to reducing the manpower costs, as well as the administrative cost involved.

AB  - Smart Agriculture or Agricultural Internet of things, consists of integrating advanced technologies (e.g., NFV, SDN, 5G/6G, Blockchain, IoT, Fog, Edge, and AI) into existing farm operations to improve the quality and productivity of agricultural products. The convergence of Industry 4.0 and Intelligent Agriculture provides new opportunities for migration from factory agriculture to the future generation, known as Agriculture 4.0. However, since the deployment of thousands of IoT based devices is in an open field, there are many new threats in Agriculture 4.0. Security researchers are involved in this topic to ensure the safety of the system since an adversary can initiate many cyber attacks, such as DDoS attacks to making a service unavailable and then injecting false data to tell us that the agricultural equipment is safe but in reality, it has been theft. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based intrusion detection system for DDoS attacks based on three models, namely, convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Each model’s performance is studied within two classification types (binary and multiclass) using two new real traffic datasets, namely, CIC-DDoS2019 dataset and TON_IoT dataset, which contain different types of DDoS attacks.

SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - This paper describes an innovative and sophisticated approach for improving learner-computer interaction in the tutoring of Java programming through the delivery of adequate learning material to learners. To achieve this, an instructional theory and intelligent techniques are combined, namely the Component Display Theory along with content-based filtering and multiple-criteria decision analysis, with the intention of providing personalized learning material and thus, improving student interaction. Until now, the majority of the research efforts mainly focus on adapting the presentation of learning material based on students’ characteristics. As such, there is free space for researching issues like delivering the appropriate type of learning material, in order to maintain the pedagogical affordance of the educational software. The blending of instructional design theories and sophisticated techniques can offer a more personalized and adaptive learning experience to learners of computer programming. The paper presents a fully operating intelligent educational software. It merges pedagogical and technological approaches for sophisticated learning material delivery to students. Moreover, it was used by undergraduate university students to learn Java programming for a semester during the COVID-19 lockdown. The findings of the evaluation showed that the presented way for delivering the Java learning material surpassed other approaches incorporating merely instructional models or intelligent tools, in terms of satisfaction and knowledge acquisition.

AB  - Irregularities in electron density usually correlate with ionospheric plasma perturbations. These variations causing radio signal fluctuations, in response, generate ionospheric scintillations that frequently occur in low-latitude regions. In this research, the combination of an artificial neural network (ANN) with the genetic algorithm (GA) was implemented to predict ionospheric scintillations. The GA method was considered for obtaining the ANN model’s initial weights. This procedure was applied to GNSS observations at GUAM (13.58°E, 144.86°N, 201.922H) station for the daily prediction of ionospheric amplitude scintillations via predicting the signal-to-noise ratio (S4) or via prediction of the rate of TEC index (ROTI). Thirty-day modeling was carried out for three months in January, March, and July, representing different seasons of the winter solstice, equinox, and summer solstice during three different years, 2015, 2017, and 2020, with different solar activities. The models, along with ionospheric physical data, were used for the daily prediction of ionospheric scintillations for the consequent day after the modeling. The prediction results were evaluated using S4 derived from GNSS observations at GUAM station. The designed model has the ability to predict daily ionospheric scintillations with an accuracy of about 81% for the S4 and about 80% for the ROTI.

AB  - The building stock accounts for a significant portion of worldwide energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. While the majority of the existing building stock has poor energy performance, deep renovation efforts are stymied by a wide range of human, technological, organisational and external environment factors across the value chain. A key challenge is integrating appropriate human resources, materials, fabrication, information and automation systems and knowledge management in a proper manner to achieve the required outcomes and meet the relevant regulatory standards, while satisfying a wide range of stakeholders with differing, often conflicting, motivations. RINNO is a Horizon 2020 project that aims to deliver a set of processes that, when working together, provide a system, repository, marketplace and enabling workflow process for managing deep renovation projects from inception to implementation. This paper presents a roadmap for an open renovation platform for managing and delivering deep renovation projects for residential buildings based on seven design principles. We illustrate a preliminary stepwise framework for applying the platform across the full-lifecycle of a deep renovation project. Based on this work, RINNO will develop a new open renovation software platform that will be implemented and evaluated at four pilot sites with varying construction, regulatory, market and climate contexts.

AB  - Digital technologies engaged in urban metabolism for efficiency provide policymakers, urban managers, and planners with useful instruments to collect, monitor, analyze, and evaluate the circularity of environmental, social, and economic resources to improve their effectiveness and quality. At present, the digital technology-based approach is strategic for circular cities engaged in the development of smart and sustainable actions in the fields of mobility, energy, environment, waste, telecommunications, and security. Through the ‘Circular Resource Efficiency Management Framework’ developed by the European Commission, this paper generates insights into the digitalization practices of the circularity of urban metabolism by analyzing the initiatives implemented by the municipalities of Kaunas, Flanders region, Porto, Prato, The Hague, and Oslo, which constitute the Partnership on Circular Economy (PCE) of the Urban Agenda of the European Union. The results of the analysis provide a wide range of practices such as real-time monitoring stations for water and energy consumption, digital cameras for controlling vehicle flows, web platforms for sharing goods and services, and tracking sensors for public transport, which aim to optimize the efficiency of the circularity of urban metabolic flows. This study increases the understanding and awareness of digital technologies in this paradigm shift.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Facial emotion recognition (FER) is the procedure of identifying human emotions from facial expressions. It is often difficult to identify the stress and anxiety levels of an individual through the visuals captured from computer vision. However, the technology enhancements on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have yielded impressive results from gathering various forms of emotional and physical health-related data. The novel deep learning (DL) algorithms are allowing to perform application in a resource-constrained edge environment, encouraging data from IoMT devices to be processed locally at the edge. This article presents an IoMT based facial emotion detection and recognition system that has been implemented in real-time by utilizing a small, powerful, and resource-constrained device known as Raspberry-Pi with the assistance of deep convolution neural networks. For this purpose, we have conducted one empirical study on the facial emotions of human beings along with the emotional state of human beings using physiological sensors. It then proposes a model for the detection of emotions in real-time on a resource-constrained device, i.e., Raspberry-Pi, along with a co-processor, i.e., Intel Movidius NCS2. The facial emotion detection test accuracy ranged from 56% to 73% using various models, and the accuracy has become 73% performed very well with the FER 2013 dataset in comparison to the state of art results mentioned as 64% maximum. A t-test is performed for extracting the significant difference in systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and the heart rate of an individual watching three different subjects (angry, happy, and neutral).

This study depicted an attempt to develop an appropriate method by introducing a novel forecasting model based on the idea to use the Pareto fronts as a tool to select data in the forecasting process. The proposed model was implemented to forecast short-term electric energy demand in Poland using historical hourly demand values from Polish TSO. The study rather intended on implementing the range of different approaches—scenarios of Pareto fronts usage than on a complex evaluation of the obtained results. However, performance of proposed models was compared with a few benchmark forecasting models, including naïve approach, SARIMAX, kNN, and regression. For two scenarios, it has outperformed all other models by minimum 7.7%.

AB  - The article presents the issue of designing a network of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) for servicing passenger and commercial vehicles and taking into account the already existing locations. The authors propose a five-stage multicriteria- and GIS-based EVCS location methodology (5MAGISEV) for designing the EVCS network that includes defining potential EVCS locations (stage 1), constructing a family of evaluation criteria (stage 2), generating alternatives (stage 3), selecting an appropriate multiple criteria decision aid method (stage 4) and conducting a multicriteria evaluation of alternatives (stage 5). The methodology was verified by its experimental application for solving the problem of EVCS location in Poznan, Poland. As a result of its application, a set of over 155,000 alternatives was generated in view of different EVCS location determination policies. A family of eight criteria with subcriteria was proposed to assess the solutions, including the evaluation of the degree of integration of the considered EVCSs with such issues as public transport (C1); urbanized areas (C2); main road network (C3); industrial areas (C4); and the location with respect to transport areas (C5), shops of various types (C6), address points (C7) and DYI stores (C8). Based on the selected method of multiple criteria decision aid (LBS), a solution was selected that constitutes a compromise design of the EVCS network.

AB  - With the rapid development of the autonomous world, local decision making between devices is becoming important. This article provides a new paradigm (Rock-Paper-Scissors-Hammer: RPSH) that can reduce the number of conflicts or decision draws and thus increase the throughput of autonomous devices while reducing the kept number of records or transactions. The paradigm requires a sealed envelope protocol and sequential message passing between both parties to decide unanimously a winner between the two participants without a third-party mediation. The message passing proposes a detailed record in a blockchain-like format that is not corruptible and is verifiable for conflict resolution. A simulated IoT environment is created to show the advantage of the proposed protocol and it shows significant reduction in mean efforts due to the elimination of draws or undecided situations. Autonomous devices, such as cars, need to maintain meticulous, lightweight, but blockchain-like record keeping for insurance settlements or conflict resolutions; that archival data size is significantly reduced by the RPSH protocol.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The spatial pattern of music venues is one of the key decision-making factors for urban planning and development strategies. Understanding the current configurations and future demands of music venues is fundamental to scholars, planners, and designers. There is an urgent need to discover the spatial pattern of music venues nationwide with high precision. This paper aims at an open data solution to discover the hidden hierarchical structure of the for-profit music venues and their dynamic relationship with urban economies. Data collected from the largest two public ticketing websites are used for clustering-based ranking modeling and spatial pattern discovery of music venues in 28 cities as recorded. The model is based on a multi-stage hierarchical clustering algorithm to level those cities into four groups according to the website records which can be used to describe the total music industry scale and activity vitality of cities. Data collected from the 2018 China City Statistical Year Book, including the GDP per capita, disposable income per capita, the permanent population, and the number of patent applications, are used as socio-economic indicators for the city-level potential capability of music industry development ranking. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and the Kendall rank correlation coefficient are applied to test the consistency of the above city-level rankings. The results are 0.782 and 0.744 respectively, which means there is a relatively significant correlation between the scale level of current music venue configuration and the potential to develop the music industry. Average nearest neighbor index (ANNI), quadrate analysis, and Moran’s I are used to identify the spatial patterns of music venues of individual cities. The results indicate that music venues in urban centers show more spatial aggregation, where the spatial accessibility of music activity services takes the lead significantly, while a certain amount of venues with high service capacity distribute in suburban areas. The findings can provide decision support for urban planners to formulate effective policies and rational site-selection schemes on urban cultural facilities, leading to smart city rational construction and sustainable economic benefit.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Wildlife monitoring is carried out for diverse reasons, and monitoring methods have gradually advanced through technological development. Direct field investigations have been replaced by remote monitoring methods, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become the most important tool for wildlife monitoring. Many previous studies on detecting wild animals have used RGB images acquired from UAVs, with most of the analyses depending on machine learning–deep learning (ML–DL) methods. These methods provide relatively accurate results, and when thermal sensors are used as a supplement, even more accurate detection results can be obtained through complementation with RGB images. However, because most previous analyses were based on ML–DL methods, a lot of time was required to generate training data and train detection models. This drawback makes ML–DL methods unsuitable for real-time detection in the field. To compensate for the disadvantages of the previous methods, this paper proposes a real-time animal detection method that generates a total of six applicable input images depending on the context and uses them for detection. The proposed method is based on the Sobel edge algorithm, which is simple but can detect edges quickly based on change values. The method can detect animals in a single image without training data. The fastest detection time per image was 0.033 s, and all frames of a thermal video could be analyzed. Furthermore, because of the synchronization of the properties of the thermal and RGB images, the performance of the method was above average in comparison with previous studies. With target images acquired at heights below 100 m, the maximum detection precision and detection recall of the most accurate input image were 0.804 and 0.699, respectively. However, the low resolution of the thermal sensor and its shooting height limitation were hindrances to wildlife detection. The aim of future research will be to develop a detection method that can improve these shortcomings.

AB  - Digital technology is instrumental in designing e-government services to achieve environmental sustainability. This study aims to implicate essential human values for designing a Digital Government Collaborative Platform (DGCP), which seeks to enhance the collaboration between citizens and government officers to address environmental issues in Sri Lanka. The study adopts a value sensitive design (VSD) approach to identify human values to conceptualize the design. The results reveal 15 human values shared by citizens and officers of environmental authorities: transparency, safety, universal usability, feedback, authenticity, fairness, representativeness, accountability, legitimacy, informed consent, autonomy, awareness, human welfare, attitude, and trust. In addition to the identified human values, four system feature categories have been proposed from interviews. Thus, the study advances knowledge in designing an e-government system for collaboration between citizens and government officers, especially in tackling environmental problems in developing countries. Further, the study contributes knowledge to VSD for digital collaboration for improving environmental sustainability.

AB  - In this paper, the publicly available dataset for the Combined Diesel-Electric and Gas (CODLAG) propulsion system was used to obtain symbolic expressions for estimation of fuel flow, ship speed, starboard propeller torque, port propeller torque, and total propeller torque using genetic programming (GP) algorithm. The dataset consists of 11,934 samples that were divided into training and testing portions in an 80:20 ratio. The training portion of the dataset which consisted of 9548 samples was used to train the GP algorithm to obtain symbolic expressions for estimation of fuel flow, ship speed, starboard propeller, port propeller, and total propeller torque, respectively. After the symbolic expressions were obtained the testing portion of the dataset which consisted of 2386 samples was used to measure estimation performance in terms of coefficient of correlation (R2) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric, respectively. Based on the estimation performance in each case three best symbolic expressions were selected with and without decay state coefficients. From the conducted investigation, the highest R2 and lowest MAE values were achieved with symbolic expressions for the estimation of fuel flow, ship speed, starboard propeller torque, port propeller torque, and total propeller torque without decay state coefficients while symbolic expressions with decay state coefficients have slightly lower estimation performance.

AB  - This study proposes a new logical model for intelligent software architecture devoted to improving the efficiency of automated text understanding and text generation in industrial applications. The presented approach introduces a few patterns that provide a possibility to build adaptable and extensible solutions using machine learning technologies. The main idea is formalized by the concept of expounder hybridization. It summarizes an experience of document analysis and generation solutions development and social media analysis based on artificial neural networks’ practical use. The results of solving the task by the best expounder were improved using the method of aggregating multiple expounders. The quality of expounders’ combination can be further improved by introducing the pro-active competition between them on the basis of, e.g., auctioning algorithm, using several parameters including precision, solution performance and score. Analysis of the proposed approach was carried out using a dataset of legal documents including joint-stock company decision record sheets and protocols. The solution is implemented in an enterprise content management system and illustrated by an example of processing of legal documentation.

AB  - Estimating the number of people present in a given venue in real-time is extremely useful from a security, management, and resource optimization perspective. This article presents the architecture of a system based on the use of Wi-Fi sensor devices that allows estimating, almost in real-time, the number of people attending an event that is taking place in a venue. The estimate is based on the analysis of the “probe request” messages periodically transmitted by smartphones to determine the existence of Wi-Fi access points in the vicinity. The method considers the MAC address randomization mechanisms introduced in recent years in smartphones, which prevents the estimation of the number of devices by simply counting different MAC addresses. To solve this difficulty, our Wi-Fi sensors analyze other fields present in the header of the IEEE 802.11 frames, the information elements, to extract a unique fingerprint from each smartphone. The designed system was tested in a set of real scenarios, obtaining an estimate of attendance at different public events with an accuracy close to 95%.

AB  - This paper presents the development of technologies to support the decision-making of local government executives and smart city concept managers in selecting and evaluating the competencies of new members for advisory groups for solving problems that are implemented in safe times in individual areas or in crises, such as pandemics. The reason for developing effective urban transformation strategies and for the transparent selection of independent experts (non-politicians) for policymaking, decision-making, and implementation teams is not only the heterogeneity of smart city dimensions together with the necessary complexity and systems approach, but also the nature of the capacities and tools needed for smart city concepts. The innovative hybrid competency assessment model is based on fuzzy logic and a network for neuro-fuzzy assessment. It is a technological model for evaluating the competencies of specialists, taking into account the influence of human factors on the processes of personnel selection and system management. An innovative web platform named “Smart City Concept Personnel Selection” has been designed, which can be adapted to various users of municipalities or regional institutions for the transparent selection of qualified personnel for effective decision-making and the use of public funds during safe times or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - A smart city describes an urban setting which aims to effectively apply ICT technologies to help improve the well-being of its citizens and reduce the negative impacts of urbanization. The priority areas considered in the Global Smart City Index (SCI) by the Institute for Management Development’s (IMD) World Competitiveness Centre were key infrastructures and technologies in (1) health and safety, (2) mobility, (3) activities (e.g., recreational spaces), (4) opportunities (work and school), and (5) governance. A smart region is a term used to extend the concept of a smart city into both urban and rural settings to promote a sustainable planning approach at the regional level. A direction that must be considered is the adoption of a “Smart Region Mobility Framework” to effectively transform our urban and rural regional transportation networks. This research study focused on the development of the smart region mobility framework for an island region group in the Philippines. The smart region goal is to integrate intelligent transportation system (ITS) platforms such as advanced public transportation system (APTS), advanced traveler information system (ATIS), and advanced rural transportation system (ARTS) to the local public transportation route plans (LPTRP) of the region. The activities include the data collection, analysis, and evaluation of multimodal regional transportation networks and social services infrastructure. The transportation network modeling process follows the four-step transportation planning process of trip generation, trip distribution, modal-split analysis, and trip assignment. Based on the analysis of 6 provinces, 16 cities, and 114 municipalities included in the study, there are two cities identified as smart city candidates. One of the smart city candidates is designated as the smart city regional center. In the context of a smart region, the available social services (e.g., employment opportunities, education, and health services) in the designated smart cities can also be made accessible to connected cities/municipalities through ease of transportation and mobility services in the region. Lastly, the study presented the implementation of data flow architecture of the smart region mobility framework, and the regional traveler information system using mobile and web application services.

AB  - Integration of digital technologies and public health (or digital healthcare) helps us to fight the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is the biggest public health crisis humanity has faced since the 1918 Influenza Pandemic. In order to better understand the digital healthcare, this work conducted a systematic and comprehensive review of digital healthcare, with the purpose of helping us combat the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper covers the background information and research overview of digital healthcare, summarizes its applications and challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally puts forward the prospects of digital healthcare. First, main concepts, key development processes, and common application scenarios of integrating digital technologies and digital healthcare were offered in the part of background information. Second, the bibliometric techniques were used to analyze the research output, geographic distribution, discipline distribution, collaboration network, and hot topics of digital healthcare before and after COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated research on the integration of digital technologies and healthcare. Third, application cases of China, EU and U.S using digital technologies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and analyzed. Among these digital technologies, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 5G are most effective weapons to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Applications cases show that these technologies play an irreplaceable role in controlling the spread of the COVID-19. By comparing the application cases in these three regions, we contend that the key to China’s success in avoiding the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is to integrate digital technologies and public health on a large scale without hesitation. Fourth, the application challenges of digital technologies in the public health field are summarized. These challenges mainly come from four aspects: data delays, data fragmentation, privacy security, and data security vulnerabilities. Finally, this study provides the future application prospects of digital healthcare. In addition, we also provide policy recommendations for other countries that use digital technology to combat COVID-19.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of vehicles (IoV) is a rapidly emerging technological evolution of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). This paper proposes SafeDrive, a dynamic driver profile (DDP) using a hybrid recommendation system. DDP is a set of functional modules, to analyses individual driver’s behaviors, using prior violation and accident records, to identify driving risk patterns. In this paper, we have considered three synthetic data-sets for 1500 drivers based on their profile information, risk parameters information, and risk likelihood. In addition, we have also considered the driver’s historical violation/accident data-set records based on four risk-score levels such as high-risk, medium-risk, low-risk, and no-risk to predict current and future driver risk scores. Several error calculation methods have been applied in this study to analyze our proposed hybrid recommendation systems’ performance to classify the driver’s data with higher accuracy based on various criteria. The evaluated results help to improve the driving behavior and broadcast early warning alarm to the other vehicles in IoV environment for the overall road safety. Moreover, the propoed model helps to provide a safe and predicted environment for vehicles, pedestrians, and road objects, with the help of regular monitoring of vehicle motion, driver behavior, and road conditions. It also enables accurate prediction of accidents beforehand, and also minimizes the complexity of on-road vehicles and latency due to fog/cloud computing servers.

SN  - 2673-2688

AB  - This paper analyses the contribution of residual network (ResNet) based convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture employed in two tasks related to plant phenotyping. Among the contemporary works for species recognition (SR) and infection detection of plants, the majority of them have performed experiments on balanced datasets and used accuracy as the evaluation parameter. However, this work used an imbalanced dataset having an unequal number of images, applied data augmentation to increase accuracy, organised data as multiple test cases and classes, and, most importantly, employed multiclass classifier evaluation parameters useful for asymmetric class distribution. Additionally, the work addresses typical issues faced such as selecting the size of the dataset, depth of classifiers, training time needed, and analysing the classifier’s performance if various test cases are deployed. In this work, ResNet 20 (V2) architecture has performed significantly well in the tasks of Species Recognition (SR) and Identification of Healthy and Infected Leaves (IHIL) with a Precision of 91.84% and 84.00%, Recall of 91.67% and 83.14% and F1 Score of 91.49% and 83.19%, respectively.

AB  - Contemporary higher education is gradually transforming. Meetings of teachers and students from lecture halls are increasingly moving into the digital space of the Internet, adopting the formula of distance learning. The advent of Society 5.0 and Economy 5.0 will imply further changes. The necessity to integrate the real and virtual world, increased demand for information, limited time resources, and the need to combine professional work with education will cause higher education, in order to prepare future citizens to function in the area of sharing resources, to be forced to further adaptive transformations. The subject of this article is the analysis of the impact of technology on changes in higher education with an indication of the model of future paths of education in the Economy 5.0 trend. The source of the article was exploratory research of secondary sources, including books, articles, and reports, which were subjected to a critical analysis of the content. The obtained results made it possible to design and implement an explanatory study among students based on the CAWI methodology. The collected material became the basis for the authors to prepare a proposal for a model of future educational paths in accordance with the Economy 5.0 trend in which the flexibility of place and time, customization of the offer, cooperation, adaptability of teaching methods and instruments, and the proactive role of the teacher as a mentor and trainer constitute a set of set guidelines in the teaching model of the future. This model will be able to be used by universities and training institutions in the field of professionalization of the management of teaching and organizational processes.

AB  - Over the decades, robotics technology has acquired sufficient advancement through the progression of 5G Internet, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, and Edge Computing. Though nowadays, Cobot and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) supported robots with edge computing paradigms have achieved remarkable performances in diverse applications, the existing SOA robotics technology fails to develop a multi-domain expert with high performing robots and demands improvement to Service-Oriented Brain, SOB (including AI model, driving service application and metadata) enabling robot for deploying brain and a new computing model with more scalability and flexibility. In this paper, instead of focusing on SOA and Robot as a Service (RaaS) model, we propose a novel computing architecture, addressed as Brainware Computing, for driving multiple domain-specific brains one-at-a-time in a single hardware robot according to the service, addressed as Brain as a Service (BaaS). In Brainware Computing, each robot can install and remove the virtual machine, which contains SOB and operating applications from the nearest edge cloud. Secondly, we provide an extensive explanation of the scope and possibilities of Brainware Computing. Finally, we demonstrate several challenges and opportunities and then concluded with future research directions in the field of Brainware Computing.

AB  - Anomaly detection has gained considerable attention in the past couple of years. Emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), are known to be among the most critical sources of data streams that produce massive amounts of data continuously from numerous applications. Examining these collected data to detect suspicious events can reduce functional threats and avoid unseen issues that cause downtime in the applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the data stream characteristics, many unresolved problems persist. In the existing literature, methods have been designed and developed to evaluate certain anomalous behaviors in IoT data stream sources. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that discuss all the aspects of IoT data processing. Thus, this paper attempts to fill this gap by providing a complete image of various state-of-the-art techniques on the major problems and core challenges in IoT data. The nature of data, anomaly types, learning mode, window model, datasets, and evaluation criteria are also presented. Research challenges related to data evolving, feature-evolving, windowing, ensemble approaches, nature of input data, data complexity and noise, parameters selection, data visualizations, heterogeneity of data, accuracy, and large-scale and high-dimensional data are investigated. Finally, the challenges that require substantial research efforts and future directions are summarized.

AB  - The emergence of smart technologies in homes comes with various services and functions for everyday life. While a smart home (SH) is associated with great potential in terms of comfort and risk treatment, it also introduces new and alters existing risks. Despite a growing number of academic studies on SH risks, research is fragmented with regard to its focus on certain disciplines and is still rather technology-focused. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a comprehensive understanding of relevant risks through a systematic literature review. Following the guidelines of the PRISMA reporting protocol, we search 1196 academic and practitioners’ publications related to household risks or risk perceptions of SH users. A final set of 59 records results in three main themes. They include (1) a synthesis of pre-existing and emerging risks sketching the new risk landscape of SH households, (2) a discussion of the prevailing risk evaluation methods, and (3) a presentation of SH-related risk treatment options with a particular emphasis on insurance. We specify the influence of SH on risks and risk perception, and highlight the relevance of analyzing the interconnection of risks in complex systems, such as SH. Our review lays the basis for assessing SH risks and for enabling more comprehensive and effective risk management optimization.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Web security plays a very crucial role in the Security of Things (SoT) paradigm for smart healthcare and will continue to be impactful in medical infrastructures in the near future. This paper addressed a key component of security-intrusion detection systems due to the number of web security attacks, which have increased dramatically in recent years in healthcare, as well as the privacy issues. Various intrusion-detection systems have been proposed in different works to detect cyber threats in smart healthcare and to identify network-based attacks and privacy violations. This study was carried out as a result of the limitations of the intrusion detection systems in responding to attacks and challenges and in implementing privacy control and attacks in the smart healthcare industry. The research proposed a machine learning support system that combined a Random Forest (RF) and a genetic algorithm: a feature optimization method that built new intrusion detection systems with a high detection rate and a more accurate false alarm rate. To optimize the functionality of our approach, a weighted genetic algorithm and RF were combined to generate the best subset of functionality that achieved a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. This study used the NSL-KDD dataset to simultaneously classify RF, Naive Bayes (NB) and logistic regression classifiers for machine learning. The results confirmed the importance of optimizing functionality, which gave better results in terms of the false alarm rate, precision, detection rate, recall and F1 metrics. The combination of our genetic algorithm and RF models achieved a detection rate of 98.81% and a false alarm rate of 0.8%. This research raised awareness of privacy and authentication in the smart healthcare domain, wireless communications and privacy control and developed the necessary intelligent and efficient web system. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm was applied to examine the F1-score and precisionperformance as compared to the NSL-KDD and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets using different scaling factors. The results showed that the proposed GA was greatly optimized, for which the average precision was optimized by 5.65% and the average F1-score by 8.2%.

AB  - Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications are being used more and more frequently. Data collected by various sensors can be used to provide innovative digital services supporting increasing efficiency or cost reduction. The implementation of such applications requires the integration and analysis of heterogeneous data coming from a broad variety of sensors. To support these steps, this paper introduces OPAL, a software toolbox consolidating several software components for the semantically annotated integration and analysis of IoT-data. Data storage is realized in a standardized and INSPIRE-compliant way utilizing the SensorThings API. Supporting a broad variety of use cases, OPAL provides several import adapters to access data sources with various protocols (e.g., the OPC UA protocol, which is often used in industrial environments). In addition, a unified management and execution environment, called PERMA, is introduced to allow the programming language independent integration of algorithms.

AB  - The evolution of Mobile Networks and Internet of Things (IoT) architectures allows one to rethink the way smart cities infrastructures are designed and managed, and solve a number of problems in terms of human mobility. The territories that adopt the sensoring era can take advantage of this disruptive technology to improve the quality of mobility of their citizens and the rationalization of their resources. However, with this rapid development of smart terminals and infrastructures, as well as the proliferation of diversified applications, even current networks may not be able to completely meet quickly rising human mobility demands. Thus, they are facing many challenges and to cope with these challenges, different standards and projects have been proposed so far. Accordingly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been utilized as a new paradigm for the design and optimization of mobile networks with a high level of intelligence. The objective of this work is to identify and discuss the challenges of mobile networks, alongside IoT and AI, to characterize smart human mobility and to discuss some workable solutions to these challenges. Finally, based on this discussion, we propose paths for future smart human mobility researches.

AB  - In terms of sustainable growth, Malaysia’s construction industry faces significant challenges, such as construction costs and lack of awareness. To meet these challenges, it is essential to integrate building information modeling (BIM) and sustainable development. As a result, this study aimed to establish strategies for adopting BIM in sustainable building projects. A systematic literature review was performed to classify the strategies to accomplish this aim, followed by a questionnaire survey of 129 construction project stakeholders. Mean score and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were conducted to explore the detailed influence of BIM adoption strategies in sustainable building projects. The results revealed that “workshops, lectures, and conference events are used to enhance public awareness” and “better information on the costs and benefits of sustainable materials” and “strengthened sustainable development” were the most essential strategies to boost sustainable growth in building projects. Furthermore, EFA was conducted to undertake the group analysis, namely, to identify the standardization-related strategy, economic-related strategy, awareness-related strategy, and environment-related strategy. This study paves the way for future scholars, policymakers, and practitioners to investigate the limitations of future studies.

AB  - Autonomy is the core capability of future systems, and architecture design is one of the critical issues in system development and implementation. To discuss the architecture of autonomous systems in the future, this paper reviews the developing progress of architectures from automation systems to autonomous systems. Firstly, the autonomy and autonomous systems in different fields are summarized. The article classifies and summarizes the architecture of typical automated systems and infer three suggestions for building an autonomous system architecture: extensibility, evolvability, and collaborability. Accordingly, this paper builds an autonomous waterborne transportation system, and the architecture is composed of the object layer, cyberspace layer, cognition layer, and application layer, the proposed suggestions made in the construction of the architecture are reflected in the inter-relationships at all layers. Through the cooperation of four layers, the autonomous waterborne transportation system can autonomously complete the system functions, such as system control and transportation service. In the end, the characteristics of autonomous systems are concluded, from which the future primary research directions and the challenges of autonomous systems are provided.

AB  - With the development of technological innovations, Big Data is transforming the socio-economic world, impacting almost every organization and person. The transformations associated with the development of Big Data have important consequences for the sustainability of organizations, regions, and the society as a whole, and as such, they have been specifically addressed by the academic literature focusing on sustainability. Despite its importance, and perhaps because of its rapid emergence, there is a lack of studies dealing with the analysis of this body of literature and its trends. The current research attempts to fill this gap. The study develops a bibliometric and visualization analysis of the literature on the nexus between Big Data and Sustainability. The research analyzes 726 documents on this topic, published until the end of 2020, in the Web of Science Core Collection database through the VOSviewer software. The results indicate the main trends and developments on the topic related to the most cited papers, authors, publications, institutions, and countries. The visualized frameworks, structures and trends are useful for both researchers and practitioners, as they can help them understand the current situation, issues to consider, and main developments on the topic.

AB  - Wastewater treatment (WWT) is a foremost challenge for maintaining the health of ecosystems and human beings; the waste products of the water-treatment process can be a problem or an opportunity. The sewage sludge (SS) produced during sewage treatment can be considered a waste to be disposed of in a landfill or as a source for obtaining raw material to be used as a fertilizer, building material, or alternative fuel source suitable for co-incineration in a high-temperature furnace. To this concern, this study’s purpose consisted of developing a decision model, supported by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN model), allowing us to identify the most effective sludge management strategy in economic terms. Consistent with the aim of the work, the suitable SS treatment was identified, selecting for each phase of the SS treatment, an alternative available on the market ensuring energy and/or matter recovery, in line with the circular water value chain. Results show that the ANN model identifies the suitable SS treatments on multiple factors, thus supporting the decision-making and identifying the solution as per user requirements.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - The risk of theft of goods is certainly an important source of negative influence in human psychology. This article focuses on the development of a scheme that, despite its low cost, acts as a smart antitheft system that achieves small property detection. Specifically, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based participatory platform was developed in order to allow asset-tracking tasks to be crowd-sourced to a community. Stolen objects are traced by using a prototype Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based system, which sends signals, thus becoming a beacon. Once such an item (e.g., a bicycle) is stolen, the owner informs the authorities, which, in turn, broadcast an alert signal to activate the BLE sensor. To trace the asset with the antitheft tag, participants use their GPS-enabled smart phones to scan BLE tags through a specific smartphone client application and report the location of the asset to an operation center so that owners can locate their assets. A stolen item tracking simulator was created to support and optimize the aforementioned tracking process and to produce the best possible outcome, evaluating the impact of different parameters and strategies regarding the selection of how many and which users to activate when searching for a stolen item within a given area.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Sustainable development was defined by the UN in 1987 as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, and this is a core concept in this paper. This work acknowledges the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., economic, social, and environmental, but its focus is on this last one. A digital twin (DT) is frequently described as a physical entity with a virtual counterpart, and the data, connections between the two, implying the existence of connectors and blocks for efficient and effective data communication. This paper provides a meta systematic literature review (SLR) (i.e., an SLR of SLRs) regarding the sustainability requirements of DT-based systems. Numerous papers on the subject of DT were also selected because they cited the analyzed SLRs and were considered relevant to the purposes of this research. From the selection and analysis of 29 papers, several limitations and challenges were identified: the perceived benefits of DTs are not clearly understood; DTs across the product life cycle or the DT life cycle are not sufficiently studied; it is not clear how DTs can contribute to reducing costs or supporting decision-making; technical implementation of DTs must be improved and better integrated in the context of the IoT; the level of fidelity of DTs is not entirely evaluated in terms of their parameters, accuracy, and level of abstraction; and the ownership of data stored within DTs should be better understood. Furthermore, from our research, it was not possible to find a paper discussing DTs only in regard to environmental sustainability.

TI  - An Imbalanced Image Classification Method for the Cell Cycle Phase
T2  - Information

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - The cell cycle is an important process in cellular life. In recent years, some image processing methods have been developed to determine the cell cycle stages of individual cells. However, in most of these methods, cells have to be segmented, and their features need to be extracted. During feature extraction, some important information may be lost, resulting in lower classification accuracy. Thus, we used a deep learning method to retain all cell features. In order to solve the problems surrounding insufficient numbers of original images and the imbalanced distribution of original images, we used the Wasserstein generative adversarial network-gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for data augmentation. At the same time, a residual network (ResNet) was used for image classification. ResNet is one of the most used deep learning classification networks. The classification accuracy of cell cycle images was achieved more effectively with our method, reaching 83.88%. Compared with an accuracy of 79.40% in previous experiments, our accuracy increased by 4.48%. Another dataset was used to verify the effect of our model and, compared with the accuracy from previous results, our accuracy increased by 12.52%. The results showed that our new cell cycle image classification system based on WGAN-GP and ResNet is useful for the classification of imbalanced images. Moreover, our method could potentially solve the low classification accuracy in biomedical images caused by insufficient numbers of original images and the imbalanced distribution of original images.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Many countries are facing significant challenges in relation to providing adequate care for their elderly citizens. The roots of these issues are manifold, but include changing demographics, changing behaviours, and a shortage of resources. As has been witnessed in the health sector and many others in society, technology has much to offer in terms of supporting people’s needs. This paper explores the potential for ambient intelligence to address this challenge by creating a system that is able to passively monitor the home environment, detecting abnormal situations which may indicate that the inhabitant needs help. There are many ways that this might be achieved, but in this paper, we will describe our investigation into an approach involving unobtrusively ’listening’ to sound patterns within the home, which classifies these as either normal daily activities, or abnormal situations. The experimental system we built was composed of an innovative combination of acoustic sensing, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), which we argue in the paper that it provides a cost-effective approach to alerting care providers when an elderly person in their charge needs help. The majority of the innovation in our work concerns the AI in which we employ Machine Learning to classify the sound profiles, analyse the data for abnormal events, and to make decisions for raising alerts with carers. A Neural Network classifier was used to train and identify the sound profiles associated with normal daily routines within a given person’s home, signalling departures from the daily routines that were then used as templates to measure deviations from normality, which were used to make weighted decisions regarding calling for assistance. A practical experimental system was then designed and deployed to evaluate the methods advocated by this research. The methodology involved gathering pre-design and post-design data from both a professionally run residential home and a domestic home. The pre-design data gathered the views on the system design from 11 members of the residential home, using survey questionnaires and focus groups. These data were used to inform the design of the experimental system, which was then deployed in a domestic home setting to gather post-design experimental data. The experimental results revealed that the system was able to detect 84% of abnormal events, and advocated several refinements which would improve the performance of the system. Thus, the research concludes that the system represents an important advancement to the state-of-the-art and, when taken together with the refinements, represents a line of research which has the potential to deliver significant improvements to care provision for the elderly.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - We confirm that energy dissipation weighting provides the most accurate approach to determining the effective hydraulic conductivity (Keff) of a binary K grid. A deep learning algorithm (UNET) can infer Keff with extremely high accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.99). The UNET architecture could be trained to infer the energy dissipation weighting pattern from an image of the K distribution, although it was less accurate for cases with highly localized structures that controlled flow. Furthermore, the UNET architecture learned to infer the energy dissipation weighting even if it was not trained directly on this information. However, the weights were represented within the UNET in a way that was not immediately interpretable by a human user. This reiterates the idea that even if ML/DL algorithms are trained to make some hydrologic predictions accurately, they must be designed and trained to provide each user-required output if their results are to be used to improve our understanding of hydrologic systems.

SN  - 2504-2289

AB  - Many activities and sectors have come to a halt due to the COVID-19 crisis. People and workers’ habits and behaviors have changed dramatically, as the use of technologies and connections, virtual reality, and remote support have been enhanced. Businesses and cities have been forced to quickly adapt to the new challenges. Digital technologies have allowed people to have better access to public services due to improved use of resources. Smart cities have significant potential for linking people to work and services as never done before. Additionally, the technological convergence produces data that can enhance interactions and decisions toward the “new normal”. In this paper, the aim is to assess how Portugal is prepared to respond to the accelerated process that this context demands from cities. Portuguese SMEs have developed a good capacity for entrepreneurship and innovation; however, they are still behind in converting the knowledge acquired in sales and exports and there is still limited collaboration at the public-private level. The acceleration of smart cities through the Internet of Things (IoT) may encourage changes in these issues. A more assertive alignment between the emergent technologies and the digitization goals of companies is required. This paper opens a discussion around major needs and trends of IoT (and related technologies) since the pandemic has leveraged them. The relationship between innovation and city smartness is approached to assess main contributing and limiting variables (through the European Innovation Scoreboard), to clarify future directions toward smarter services. The tourism sector, as the largest export economic activity in the country, is addressed in this matter. An analytical framework (using, for example, Power BI and Azure IoT Hub) around this approach can choose and support the most suitable areas of development in the country.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - The wide application of encryption technology has made traffic classification gradually become a major challenge in the field of network security. Traditional methods such as machine learning, which rely heavily on feature engineering and others, can no longer fully meet the needs of encrypted traffic classification. Therefore, we propose an Inception-LSTM(ICLSTM) traffic classification method in this paper to achieve encrypted traffic service identification. This method converts traffic data into common gray images, and then uses the constructed ICLSTM neural network to extract key features and perform effective traffic classification. To alleviate the problem of category imbalance, different weight parameters are set for each category separately in the training phase to make it more symmetrical for different categories of encrypted traffic, and the identification effect is more balanced and reasonable. The method is validated on the public ISCX 2016 dataset, and the results of five classification experiments show that the accuracy of the method exceeds 98% for both regular encrypted traffic service identification and VPN encrypted traffic service identification. At the same time, this deep learning-based classification method also greatly simplifies the difficulty of traffic feature extraction work.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 12
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Currently, the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) generate a large amount of sensor data at a very high pace, making it a challenge to collect and store the data. This scenario brings about the need for effective data compression algorithms to make the data manageable among tiny and battery-powered devices and, more importantly, shareable across the network. Additionally, considering that, very often, wireless communications (e.g., low-power wide-area networks) are adopted to connect field devices, user payload compression can also provide benefits derived from better spectrum usage, which in turn can result in advantages for high-density application scenarios. As a result of this increase in the number of connected devices, a new concept has emerged, called TinyML. It enables the use of machine learning on tiny, computationally restrained devices. This allows intelligent devices to analyze and interpret data locally and in real time. Therefore, this work presents a new data compression solution (algorithm) for the IoT that leverages the TinyML perspective. The new approach is called the Tiny Anomaly Compressor (TAC) and is based on data eccentricity. TAC does not require previously established mathematical models or any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed solution and validate it, a comparative analysis was performed on two real-world datasets with two other algorithms from the literature (namely Swing Door Trending (SDT) and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)). It was found that the TAC algorithm showed promising results, achieving a maximum compression rate of 98.33%. Additionally, it also surpassed the two other models regarding the compression error and peak signal-to-noise ratio in all cases.

TI  - Graph Convolutional Networks: Application to Database Completion of Wastewater Networks

VL  - 13

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Wastewater networks are mandatory for urbanisation. Their management, including the prediction and planning of repairs and expansion operations, requires precise information on their underground components (manhole covers, equipment, nodes, and pipes). However, due to their years of service and to the increasing number of maintenance operations they may have undergone over time, the attributes and characteristics associated with the various objects constituting a network are not all available at a given time. This is partly because (i) the multiple actors that carry out repairs and extensions are not necessarily the operators who ensure the continuous functioning of the network, and (ii) the undertaken changes are not properly tracked and reported. Therefore, databases related to wastewater networks may suffer from missing data. To overcome this problem, we aim to exploit the structure of wastewater networks in the learning process of machine learning approaches, using topology and the relationship between components, to complete the missing values of pipes. Our results show that Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models yield better results than classical methods and represent a useful tool for missing data completion.

The paper presents a draft of a possible detection and classification system of vehicle propulsion systems working with thermal analyses. The differences in thermal features of different vehicle categories were found out and statistically proved. The thermal images were obtained using an infrared thermography camera. They were utilized to design a database of vehicle class images of passenger vehicles (PVs), vans, and buses. The results confirmed the hypothesis that infrared thermography might be used for categorizing the vehicle type according to the thermal features of vehicle exteriors and machine learning methods for vehicle type recognition.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the problem of channel identification by using eight algorithms. The first three algorithms are based on higher-order cumulants, the next three algorithms are based on binary output measurement, and the last two algorithms are based on reproducing kernels. The principal objective of this paper is to study the performance of the presented algorithms in different situations, such as with different sizes of the data input or different signal-to-noise ratios. The presented algorithms are applied to the estimation of the channel parameters of the broadband radio access network (BRAN). The simulation results confirm that the presented algorithms are able to estimate the channel parameters with different accuracies, and each algorithm has its advantages and disadvantages for a given situation, such as for a given SNR and data input. Finally, this study provides an idea of which algorithms can be selected in a given situation. The study presented in this paper demonstrates that the cumulant-based algorithms are more adequate if the data inputs are not available (blind identification), but the kernel- and binary-measurement-based methods are more adequate if the noise is not important (SNR≥16 dB).

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In recent years the ever-expanding internet of things (IoT) is becoming more empowered to revolutionize our world with the advent of cutting-edge features and intelligence in an IoT ecosystem. Thanks to the development of the IoT, researchers have devoted themselves to technologies that convert a conventional home into an intelligent occupants-aware place to manage electric resources with autonomous devices to deal with excess energy consumption and providing a comfortable living environment. There are studies to supplement the innate shortcomings of the IoT and improve intelligence by using cloud computing and machine learning. However, the machine learning-based autonomous control devices lack flexibility, and cloud computing is challenging with latency and security. In this paper, we propose a rule-based optimization mechanism on an embedded edge platform to provide dynamic home appliance control and advanced intelligence in a smart home. To provide actional control ability, we design and developed a rule-based objective function in the EdgeX edge computing platform to control the temperature states of the smart home. Compared to cloud computing, edge computing can provide faster response and higher quality of services. The edge computing paradigm provides better analysis, processing, and storage abilities to the data generated from the IoT sensors to enhance the capability of IoT devices concerning computing, storage, and network resources. In order to satisfy the paradigm of distributed edge computing, all the services are implemented as microservices. The microservices are connected to each other through REST APIs based on the constrained IoT devices to provide all the functionalities that accomplish a trade-off between energy consumption and occupant-desired environment setting for the smart home appliances. We simulated our proposed system to control the temperature of a smart home; through experimental findings, we investigated the application against the delay time and overall memory consumption by the embedded edge system of EdgeX. The result of this research work suggests that the implemented services operated efficiently in the raspberry pi 3 hardware of IoT devices.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Significance and popularity of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is inevitable; however, its application is highly challenging in multi-domain collaborative smart city environments. The reason is its limitations in adapting the dynamically changing information of users, tasks, access policies and resources in such applications. It also does not incorporate semantically meaningful business roles, which could have a diverse impact upon access decisions in such multi-domain collaborative business environments. We propose an Intelligent Role-based Access Control (I-RBAC) model that uses intelligent software agents for achieving intelligent access control in such highly dynamic multi-domain environments. The novelty of this model lies in using a core I-RBAC ontology that is developed using real-world semantic business roles as occupational roles provided by Standard Occupational Classification (SOC), USA. It contains around 1400 business roles, from nearly all domains, along with their detailed task descriptions as well as hierarchical relationships among them. The semantic role mining process is performed through intelligent agents that use word embedding and a bidirectional LSTM deep neural network for automated population of organizational ontology from its unstructured text policy and, subsequently, matching this ontology with core I-RBAC ontology to extract unified business roles. The experimentation was performed on a large number of collaboration case scenarios of five multi-domain organizations and promising results were obtained regarding the accuracy of automatically derived RDF triples (Subject, Predicate, Object) from organizational text policies as well as the accuracy of extracted semantically meaningful roles.

AB  - Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI) and social media can provide information about real-time perceptions, attitudes and behaviours in urban green space (UGS). This paper reviews the use of VGI and social media data in research examining UGS. The current state of the art is described through the analysis of 177 papers to (1) summarise the characteristics and usage of data from different platforms, (2) provide an overview of the research topics using such data sources, and (3) characterise the research approaches based on data pre-processing, data quality assessment and improvement, data analysis and modelling. A number of important limitations and priorities for future research are identified. The limitations include issues of data acquisition and representativeness, data quality, as well as differences across social media platforms in different study areas such as urban and rural areas. The research priorities include a focus on investigating factors related to physical activities in UGS areas, urban park use and accessibility, the use of data from multiple sources and, where appropriate, making more effective use of personal information. In addition, analysis approaches can be extended to examine the network suggested by social media posts that are shared, re-posted or reacted to and by being combined with textual, image and geographical data to extract more representative information for UGS analysis.

AB  - The current trend towards living in big cities contributes to an increased demand for efficient and sustainable space and resource allocation in urban environments. This leads to enormous pressure for resource minimization in city planning. One pillar of efficient city management is a smart intermodal traffic system. Planning and organizing the various kinds of modes of transport in a complex and dynamically adaptive system such as a city is inherently challenging. By deliberately simplifying reality, models can help decision-makers shape the traffic systems of tomorrow. Meanwhile, Smart City initiatives are investing in sensors to observe and manage many kinds of urban resources, making up a part of the Internet of Things (IoT) that produces massive amounts of data relevant for urban planning and monitoring. We use these new data sources of smart cities by integrating real-time data of IoT sensors in an ongoing simulation. In this sense, the model is a digital twin of its real-world counterpart, being augmented with real-world data. To our knowledge, this is a novel instance of real-time correction during simulation of an agent-based model. The process of creating a valid mapping between model components and real-world objects posed several challenges and offered valuable insights, particularly when studying the interaction between humans and their environment. As a proof-of-concept for our implementation, we designed a showcase with bike rental stations in Hamburg-Harburg, a southern district of Hamburg, Germany. Our objective was to investigate the concept of real-time data correction in agent-based modeling, which we consider to hold great potential for improving the predictive capabilities of models. In particular, we hope that the chosen proof-of-concept informs the ongoing politically supported trends in mobility—away from individual and private transport and towards—in Hamburg.

AB  - The increasing demand for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging is putting pressure on the power grids and capacities of charging stations. This work focuses on how to use indirect control through price signals to level out the load curve in order to avoid the power consumption from exceeding these capacities. We propose mathematical programming models for the indirect control of EV charging that aim at finding an optimal set of price signals to be sent to the drivers based on price elasticities. The objective is to satisfy the demand for a given price structure, or minimize the curtailment of loads, when there is a shortage of capacity. The key contribution is the use of elasticity matrices through which it is possible to estimate the EV drivers’ reactions to the price signals. As real-world data on relating the elasticity values to the EV driver’s behaviour are currently non-existent, we concentrate on sensitivity analysis to test how different assumptions on elasticities affect the optimal price structure. In particular, we study how market segments of drivers with different elasticities may affect the ability of the operator to both handle a capacity problem and properly satisfy the charging needs.

TI  - A Driving Behavior Distribution Fitting Method Based on Two-Stage Hybrid User Classification
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 13
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Determining the distribution fitting of traditional private vehicle user driving behavior is an effective way to understand the differences between different users and provides valuable information on user travel demands. The classification of users is significant to product improvement, precision marketing, and driving recommendations. This study proposed a method which includes four aspects: (1) data collection; (2) data preprocessing; (3) data analysis—a two-stage hybrid user classification, and (4) distribution fitting method. A two-stage hybrid user classification method is used to cluster traditional vehicle users. First, the first-stage classification of the classification method extracts the daily typical time–mileage-series travel patterns (TMTP) to obtain user driving time characteristics. This first-stage classification also extracts the mean and standard deviation of the daily vehicle mileage traveled (DVMT) to express user driving demands. Next, users are divided by K-means based on the driving time characteristics and driving demands from the first stage. Finally, a three-parameter log-normal distribution is used to fit the DVMT of different user types. Comparison with traditional clustering based on the mean and standard deviation and the proportion of each vehicle’s time series in the TMTP types, this study reveals that the new methods provide significant advantages in analyzing driving behavior and high reference value for enterprises making electric vehicle driving range recommendations, car market segmentation, and policy making decisions.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The construction and operation of wind turbines have become an important part of the development of smart cities. However, the fault of the main drive chain often causes the outage of wind turbines, which has a serious impact on the normal operation of wind turbines in smart cities. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the commonly used main drive chain fault diagnosis method that only uses a single data source, a fault feature extraction and fault diagnosis approach based on data source fusion is proposed. By fusing two data sources, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) real-time monitoring system data and the main drive chain vibration monitoring data, the fault features of the main drive chain are jointly extracted, and an intelligent fault diagnosis model for the main drive chain in wind turbine based on data fusion is established. The diagnosis results of actual cases certify that the fault diagnosis model based on the fusion of two data sources is able to locate faults of the main drive chain in the wind turbine accurately and provide solid technical support for the high-efficient operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

AB  - The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (also referred to as drones) has transformed the digital landscape of surveillance and supply chain logistics, especially in terrains where such was previously deemed unattainable. Moreover, the adoption of drones has further led to the proliferation of diverse drone types and drone-related criminality, which has introduced a myriad of security and forensics-related concerns. As a step towards understanding the state-of-the-art research into these challenges and potential approaches to mitigation, this study provides a detailed review of existing digital forensic models using the Design Science Research method. The outcome of this study generated in-depth knowledge of the research challenges and opportunities through which an effective investigation can be carried out on drone-related incidents. Furthermore, a potential generic investigation model has been proposed. The findings presented in this study are essentially relevant to forensic researchers and practitioners towards a guided methodology for drone-related event investigation. Ultimately, it is important to mention that this study presents a background for the development of international standardization for drone forensics.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Mining ubiquitous sensing data is important but also challenging, due to many factors, such as heterogeneous large-scale data that is often at various levels of abstraction. This also relates particularly to the important aspects of the explainability and interpretability of the applied models and their results, and thus ultimately to the outcome of the data mining process. With this, in general, the inclusion of domain knowledge leading towards semantic data mining approaches is an emerging and important research direction. This article aims to survey relevant works in these areas, focusing on semantic data mining approaches and methods, but also on selected applications of ubiquitous sensing in some of the most prominent current application areas. Here, we consider in particular: (1) environmental sensing; (2) ubiquitous sensing in industrial applications of artificial intelligence; and (3) social sensing relating to human interactions and the respective individual and collective behaviors. We discuss these in detail and conclude with a summary of this emerging field of research. In addition, we provide an outlook on future directions for semantic data mining in ubiquitous sensing contexts.

AB  - The quality of the user-generated content of citizen science platforms has been discussed widely among researchers. Content is categorized into data and information: data is content stored in a database of a citizen science platform, while information is context-dependent content generated by users. Understanding data and information quality characteristics and utilizing them during design improves citizen science platforms’ overall quality. This research investigates the integration of data and information quality characteristics into a citizen science platform for collecting information from the general public with no scientific training in the area where content is collected. The primary goal is to provide a framework for selecting and integrating data and information quality characteristics into the design for improving the content quality on platforms. The design and implementation of a citizen science platform that collects walking path conditions are presented, and the resulting implication is evaluated. The results show that the platform’s content quality can be improved by introducing quality characteristics during the design stage of the citizen science platform.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The concept of smart cities has gained significant momentum in science and policy circles over the past decade. This study aims to provide an overview of the structure and trends in the literature on smart cities. Bibliometric analysis and science mapping techniques using VOSviewer and CiteSpace are used to identify the thematic focus of over 5000 articles indexed in the Web of Science since 1991. In addition to providing insights into the thematic evolution of the field, the three-decade study period is divided into two sub-periods (1991–2015 and 2016–2021). While splitting the dataset into more sub-periods would have been desirable, we decided to only examine two sub-periods as only very few papers have been published until 2010. The annual number of publications has progressively increased since then, with a surge in the annual number of publications observable from 2015 onwards. The thematic analysis showed that the intellectual base of the field has been very limited during the first period, but has expanded significantly since 2015. Over time, some thematic evolutions, such as further attention to linkages to climate change and resilience, and more emphasis on security and privacy issues, have been made. The thematic analysis shows that existing research on smart cities is dominated by either conceptual issues or underlying technical aspects. It is, therefore, essential to do more research on the implementation of smart cities and actual and/or potential contributions of smart cities to solving societal issues. In addition to elaborating on thematic focus, the study also highlights major authors, journals, references, countries, and institutions that have contributed to the development of the smart cities literature.

AB  - District heating networks make up an important public energy service, in which leakage is the main problem affecting the safety of pipeline network operation. This paper proposes a Leakage Fault Detection (LFD) method based on the Linear Upper Confidence Bound (LinUCB) which is used for arm selection in the Contextual Bandit (CB) algorithm. With data collected from end-users’ pressure and flow information in the simulation model, the LinUCB method is adopted to locate the leakage faults. Firstly, we use a hydraulic simulation model to simulate all failure conditions that can occur in the network, and these change rate vectors of observed data form a dataset. Secondly, the LinUCB method is used to train an agent for the arm selection, and the outcome of arm selection is the leaking pipe label. Thirdly, the experiment results show that this method can detect the leaking pipe accurately and effectively. Furthermore, it allows operators to evaluate the system performance, supports troubleshooting of decision mechanisms, and provides guidance in the arrangement of maintenance.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - It is well known that many chronic diseases are associated with unhealthy diet. Although improving diet is critical, adopting a healthy diet is difficult despite its benefits being well understood. Technology is needed to allow an assessment of dietary intake accurately and easily in real-world settings so that effective intervention to manage being overweight, obesity, and related chronic diseases can be developed. In recent years, new wearable imaging and computational technologies have emerged. These technologies are capable of performing objective and passive dietary assessments with a much simplified procedure than traditional questionnaires. However, a critical task is required to estimate the portion size (in this case, the food volume) from a digital image. Currently, this task is very challenging because the volumetric information in the two-dimensional images is incomplete, and the estimation involves a great deal of imagination, beyond the capacity of the traditional image processing algorithms. In this work, we present a novel Artificial Intelligent (AI) system to mimic the thinking of dietitians who use a set of common objects as gauges (e.g., a teaspoon, a golf ball, a cup, and so on) to estimate the portion size. Specifically, our human-mimetic system “mentally” gauges the volume of food using a set of internal reference volumes that have been learned previously. At the output, our system produces a vector of probabilities of the food with respect to the internal reference volumes. The estimation is then completed by an “intelligent guess”, implemented by an inner product between the probability vector and the reference volume vector. Our experiments using both virtual and real food datasets have shown accurate volume estimation results.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the construction process of smart cities, more and more video surveillance systems have been deployed for traffic, office buildings, shopping malls, and families. Thus, the security of video surveillance systems has attracted more attention. At present, many researchers focus on how to select the region of interest (RoI) accurately and then realize privacy protection in videos by selective encryption. However, relatively few researchers focus on building a security framework by analyzing the security of a video surveillance system from the system and data life cycle. By analyzing the surveillance video protection and the attack surface of a video surveillance system in a smart city, we constructed a secure surveillance framework in this manuscript. In the secure framework, a secure video surveillance model is proposed, and a secure authentication protocol that can resist man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM) and replay attacks is implemented. For the management of the video encryption key, we introduced the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) on the basis of group key management to provide an efficient and secure key update. In addition, we built a decryption suite based on transparent encryption to ensure the security of the decryption environment. The security analysis proved that our system can guarantee the forward and backward security of the key update. In the experiment environment, the average decryption speed of our system can reach 91.47 Mb/s, which can meet the real-time requirement of practical applications.

AB  - Energy consumption is a crucial domain in energy system management. Recently, it was observed that there has been a rapid rise in the consumption of energy throughout the world. Thus, almost every nation devises its strategies and models to limit energy usage in various areas, ranging from large buildings to industrial firms and vehicles. With technological advancements, computational intelligence models have been successfully contributing to the prediction of the consumption of energy. Machine learning and deep learning-based models enhance the precision and robustness compared to traditional approaches, making it more reliable. This article performs a review analysis of the various computational intelligence approaches currently being utilized to predict energy consumption. An extensive survey procedure is conducted and presented in this study, and relevant works are discussed. Different criteria are considered during the aggregation of the relevant studies relating to the work. The author’s perspective, future trends and various novel approaches are also presented as a part of the discussion.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - In view of the problem of e-commerce scams and the absence of haptic interaction, this research aims to introduce and create a tele-weight device for e-commerce shopping in smart cities. The objective is to use the proposed prototype to provide a brief overview of the possible technological advancements. When the tele-weight device is affixed over the head-mounted display, it allows the user to feel the item’s weight while shopping in the virtual store. Addressing the problem of having no physical interaction between the user (player) and a series game scene in virtual reality (VR) headsets, this research approach focuses on creating a prototype device that has two parts, a sending part and a receiving part. The sending part measures the weight of the object and transmits it over the cellular network to the receiver side. The virtual store user at the receiving side can thus realize the weight of the ordered object. The findings from this work include a visual display of the item’s weight to the virtual store e-commerce user. By introducing sustainability, this haptic technology-assisted technique can help the customer realize the weight of an object and thus have a better immersive experience. In the device, the load cell measures the weight of the object and amplifies it using the HX711 amplifier. However, some delay in the demonstration of the weight was observed during experimentation, and this indirectly altered the performance of the system. One set of the device is sited at the virtual store user premises while the sending end of the device is positioned at the warehouse. The sending end hardware includes an Arduino Uno device, an HX711 amplifier chip to amplify the weight from the load cell, and a cellular module (Sim900A chip-based) to transmit the weight in the form of an encoded message. The receiving end hardware includes a cellular module and an actuator involving a motor gear arrangement to demonstrate the weight of the object. Combining the fields of e-commerce, embedded systems, VR, and haptic sensing, this research can help create a more secure marketplace to attain a higher level of customer satisfaction.

VL  - 11

AB  - Automatic crack identification for pipeline analysis utilizes three-dimensional (3D) image technology to improve the accuracy and reliability of crack identification. A new technique that integrates a deep learning algorithm and 3D shadow modeling (3D-SM) is proposed for the automatic identification of corrosion cracks in pipelines. Since the depth of a corrosion crack is below the surrounding area of the crack, a shadow of the crack is projected when the crack is exposed under light sources. In this study, we analyze the shadow areas of cracks through 3D shadow modeling (3D-SM) and identify the evolving cracks through the shape analysis of the shadows. To denoise the 3D images, the connected domain analysis is implemented so that the shadow groups of the evolving cracks can be retained and the scattered shadow groups that occur due to insignificant defects can be eliminated. Moreover, a novel deep neural network is developed to process the 3D images. The proposed automatic crack identification method successfully processes the 3D images efficiently and accurately diagnoses the corrosion cracks. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves satisfactory performance with 93.53% accuracy and a 92.04% regression rate.

AB  - A single Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) is a disturbance source of modern wireless systems depending on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Satellite Communication (SatCom). In particular, significant applications such as aeronautics and satellite communication can be severely affected by intentional and unintentional interference, which are unmitigated. The matter requires finding a radical and effective solution to overcome this problem. The methods used for overcoming the RFI include interference detection, interference classification, interference geolocation, tracking and interference mitigation. RFI source geolocation and tracking methodology gained universal attention from numerous researchers, specialists, and scientists. In the last decade, various conventional techniques and algorithms have been adopted in geolocation and target tracking in civil and military operations. Previous conventional techniques did not address the challenges and demand for novel algorithms. Hence there is a necessity for focussing on the issues associated with this. This survey introduces a review of various conventional geolocation techniques, current orientations, and state-of-the-art techniques and highlights some approaches and algorithms employed in wireless and satellite systems for geolocation and target tracking that may be extremely beneficial. In addition, a comparison between different conventional geolocation techniques has been revealed, and the comparisons between various approaches and algorithms of geolocation and target tracking have been addressed, including H∞ and Kalman Filtering versions that have been implemented and investigated by authors.

These frameworks in this domain are promising, yet not reliable for several reasons, including but not limited to the site-specific design of the methods, the lack of transparency in the AI-model, the lack of quality in the labelled image, and the use of irrelevant descriptor features in building the AI-model. Using explainable AI (XAI) can lead us to gain insight into identifying these limitations and therefore, to modify the training dataset and the model accordingly. This paper proposes the use of SHAP (Shapley additive explanation) to interpret the outputs of a multilayer perceptron (MLP)—a machine learning model—and analyse the impact of each feature descriptor included in the model for building-damage assessment to examine the reliability of the model. In this study, a post-event satellite image from the 2018 Palu earthquake was used. The results show that MLP can classify the collapsed and non-collapsed buildings with an overall accuracy of 84% after removing the redundant features. Further, spectral features are found to be more important than texture features in distinguishing the collapsed and non-collapsed buildings. Finally, we argue that constructing an explainable model would help to understand the model’s decision to classify the buildings as collapsed and non-collapsed and open avenues to build a transferable AI model.

AB  - The district heating (DH) industry is facing an important transformation towards more efficient networks that utilise significantly lower water temperatures to distribute the heat. This change requires taking advantage of new technologies, and Machine Learning (ML) is a popular direction. In the last decade, we have witnessed an extreme growth in the number of published research papers that focus on applying ML techniques to the DH domain. However, based on our experience in the field, and an extensive review of the state-of-the-art, we perceive a mismatch between the most popular research directions, such as forecasting, and the challenges faced by the DH industry. In this work, we present our findings, explain and demonstrate the key gaps between the two communities and suggest a road-map ahead towards increasing the impact of ML research in the DH industry.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a key and growing technology for many critical real-life applications, where it can be used to improve decision making. The existence of several sources of uncertainty in the IoT infrastructure, however, can lead decision makers into taking inappropriate actions. The present work focuses on proposing a risk-based IoT decision-making framework in order to effectively manage uncertainties in addition to integrating domain knowledge in the decision-making process. A structured literature review of the risks and sources of uncertainty in IoT decision-making systems is the basis for the development of the framework and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) case studies. More specifically, as one of the main targeted challenges, the potential sources of uncertainties in an IoT framework, at different levels of abstraction, are firstly reviewed and then summarized. The modules included in the framework are detailed, with the main focus given to a novel risk-based analytics module, where an ensemble-based data analytic approach, called Calibrated Random Forest (CRF), is proposed to extract useful information while quantifying and managing the uncertainty associated with predictions, by using confidence scores. Its output is subsequently integrated with domain knowledge-based action rules to perform decision making in a cost-sensitive and rational manner. The proposed CRF method is firstly evaluated and demonstrated on a HAR scenario in a Smart Home environment in case study I and is further evaluated and illustrated with a remote health monitoring scenario for a diabetes use case in case study II. The experimental results indicate that using the framework’s raw sensor data can be converted into meaningful actions despite several sources of uncertainty. The comparison of the proposed framework to existing approaches highlights the key metrics that make decision making more rational and transparent.

AB  - For the last decade the Smart City concept has been under development, fostered by the growing urbanization of the world’s population and the need to handle the challenges that such a scenario raises. During this time many Smart City projects have been executed–some as proof-of-concept, but a growing number resulting in permanent, production-level deployments, improving the operation of the city and the quality of life of its citizens. Thus, Smart Cities are still a highly relevant paradigm which needs further development before it reaches its full potential and provides robust and resilient solutions. In this paper, the focus is set on the Internet of Things (IoT) as an enabling technology for the Smart City. In this sense, the paper reviews the current landscape of IoT-enabled Smart Cities, surveying relevant experiences and city initiatives that have embedded IoT within their city services and how they have generated an impact. The paper discusses the key technologies that have been developed and how they are contributing to the realization of the Smart City. Moreover, it presents some challenges that remain open ahead of us and which are the initiatives and technologies that are under development to tackle them.

AB  - This study focuses on a modeling framework to support mobility planners and energy providers in the sustainable development of electric mobility in urban areas. Specifically, models are provided to simulate measures for the optimal management of energy demand and thoughtful planning of charging infrastructures in order to avoid congestion on the power grid. The measures, and consequently the models, are classified according to short-term initiatives based on multimodality between electric vehicles and public transport (Park and Ride), as well as medium to long-term initiatives based on the development of an energy-oriented land use of the city. All the models are data-driven, and different sets of floating car data available for the city of Rome (Italy) have been exploited for this aim. The models are currently being implemented in an agent-based simulator for electric urban mobility adopted by the National Agency for Energy and Environment in Italy (ENEA).

AB  - Open public places, such as pedestrian streets, parks, and squares, are vulnerable when the pedestrians thronged into the sidewalks. The crowd count changes dynamically over time with various external factors, such as surroundings, weekends, and peak hours, so it is essential to predict the accurate and timely crowd count. To address this issue, this study introduces graph convolutional network (GCN), a network-based model, to predict the crowd flow in a walking street. Compared with other grid-based methods, the model is capable of directly processing road network graphs. Experiments show the GCN model and its extension STGCN consistently and significantly outperform other five baseline models, namely HA, ARIMA, SVM, CNN and LSTM, in terms of RMSE, MAE and R2. Considering the computation efficiency, the standard GCN model was selected to predict the crowd. The results showed that the model obtains superior performances with higher prediction precision on weekends and peak hours, of which R2 are above 0.9, indicating the GCN model can capture the pedestrian features in the road network effectively, especially during the periods with massive crowds. The results will provide practical references for city managers to alleviate road congestion and help pedestrians make smarter planning and save travel time.

AB  - In this study, based on multi-access edge computing (MEC), we provided the possibility of cooperating manufacturing processes. We tried to solve the job shop scheduling problem by applying DQN (deep Q-network), a reinforcement learning model, to this method. Here, to alleviate the overload of computing resources, an efficient DQN was used for the experiments using transfer learning data. Additionally, we conducted scheduling studies in the edge computing ecosystem of our manufacturing processes without the help of cloud centers. Cloud computing, an environment in which scheduling processing is performed, has issues sensitive to the manufacturing process in general, such as security issues and communication delay time, and research is being conducted in various fields, such as the introduction of an edge computing system that can replace them. We proposed a method of independently performing scheduling at the edge of the network through cooperative scheduling between edge devices within a multi-access edge computing structure. The proposed framework was evaluated, analyzed, and compared with existing frameworks in terms of providing solutions and services.

TI  - Federated Compressed Learning Edge Computing Framework with Ensuring Data Privacy for PM2.5 Prediction in Smart City Sensing Applications
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 13
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The sparse data in PM2.5 air quality monitoring systems is frequently happened on large-scale smart city sensing applications, which is collected via massive sensors. Moreover, it could be affected by inefficient node deployment, insufficient communication, and fragmented records, which is the main challenge of the high-resolution prediction system. In addition, data privacy in the existing centralized air quality prediction system cannot be ensured because the data which are mined from end sensory nodes constantly exposed to the network. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel edge computing framework, named Federated Compressed Learning (FCL), which provides efficient data generation while ensuring data privacy for PM2.5 predictions in the application of smart city sensing. The proposed scheme inherits the basic ideas of the compression technique, regional joint learning, and considers a secure data exchange. Thus, it could reduce the data quantity while preserving data privacy. This study would like to develop a green energy-based wireless sensing network system by using FCL edge computing framework. It is also one of key technologies of software and hardware co-design for reconfigurable and customized sensing devices application. Consequently, the prototypes are developed in order to validate the performances of the proposed framework. The results show that the data consumption is reduced by more than 95% with an error rate below 5%. Finally, the prediction results based on the FCL will generate slightly lower accuracy compared with centralized training. However, the data could be heavily compacted and securely transmitted in WSNs.

AB  - The innovative Eye Movement Modelling Examples (EMMEs) method can be used in medicine as an educational training tool for the assessment and verification of students and professionals. Our work was intended to analyse the possibility of using eye tracking tools to verify the skills and training of people engaged in laboratory medicine on the example of parasitological diagnostics. Professionally active laboratory diagnosticians working in a multi-profile laboratory (non-parasitological) (n = 16), laboratory diagnosticians no longer working in this profession (n = 10), and medical analyst students (n = 56), participated in the study. The studied group analysed microscopic images of parasitological preparations made with the cellSens Dimension Software (Olympus) system. Eye activity parameters were obtained using a stationary, video-based eye tracker Tobii TX300 which has a 3-ms temporal resolution. Eye movement activity parameters were analysed along with time parameters. The results of our studies have shown that the eye tracking method is a valuable tool for the analysis of parasitological preparations. Detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis confirmed that the EMMEs method may facilitate learning of the correct microscopic image scanning path. The analysis of the results of our studies allows us to conclude that the EMMEs method may be a valuable tool in the preparation of teaching materials in virtual microscopy. These teaching materials generated with the use of eye tracking, prepared by experienced professionals in the field of laboratory medicine, can be used during various training, simulations and courses in medical parasitology and contribute to the verification of education results, professional skills, and elimination of errors in parasitological diagnostics.

AB  - With the increasing use of mobile devices, malware attacks are rising, especially on Android phones, which account for 72.2% of the total market share. Hackers try to attack smartphones with various methods such as credential theft, surveillance, and malicious advertising. Among numerous countermeasures, machine learning (ML)-based methods have proven to be an effective means of detecting these attacks, as they are able to derive a classifier from a set of training examples, thus eliminating the need for an explicit definition of the signatures when developing malware detectors. This paper provides a systematic review of ML-based Android malware detection techniques. It critically evaluates 106 carefully selected articles and highlights their strengths and weaknesses as well as potential improvements. Finally, the ML-based methods for detecting source code vulnerabilities are discussed, because it might be more difficult to add security after the app is deployed. Therefore, this paper aims to enable researchers to acquire in-depth knowledge in the field and to identify potential future research and development directions.

AB  - Short-term load forecasting (STLF) is fundamental for the proper operation of power systems, as it finds its use in various basic processes. Therefore, advanced calculation techniques are needed to obtain accurate results of the consumption prediction, taking into account the numerous exogenous factors that influence the results’ precision. The purpose of this study is to integrate, additionally to the conventional factors (weather, holidays, etc.), the current aspects regarding the global COVID-19 pandemic in solving the STLF problem, using a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model. To evaluate and validate the impact of the new variables considered in the model, the simulations are conducted using publicly available data from the Romanian power system. A comparison study is further carried out to assess the performance of the proposed model, using the multiple linear regression method and load forecasting results provided by the Romanian Transmission System Operator (TSO). In this regard, the Mean Squared Error (MSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are used as evaluation indexes. The proposed methodology shows great potential, as the results reveal better error values compared to the TSO results, despite the limited historical data.

AB  - Remote monitoring sensor systems play a significant role in the evaluation and minimization of natural disasters and risk. This article presents a sustainable and real-time early warning system of sensors employed in flash flood prediction by using a rolling forecast model based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Golden Ratio Optimization (GROM) methods. This Early Flood Warning System (EFWS) aims to support decision makers by providing reliable and accurate information and warning about any possible flood events within an efficient lead-time to reduce any damages due to flash floods. In this work, to improve the performance of the EFWS, an ANN forecast model based on a new optimization method, GROM, is developed and compared to the traditional ANN model. Furthermore, due to the lack of literature regarding the optimal ANN structural model for forecasting the flash flood, this paper is one of the first extensive investigations into the impact of using different exogenous variables and parameters on the ANN structure. The effect of using a rolling forecast model compared to fixed model on the accuracy of the forecasts is investigated as well. The results indicate that the rolling ANN forecast model based on GROM successfully improved the model accuracy by 40% compared to the traditional ANN model and by 93.5% compared to the fixed forecast model.

AB  - Social distancing (SD) is an effective measure to prevent the spread of the infectious Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, a lack of spatial awareness may cause unintentional violations of this new measure. Against this backdrop, we propose an active surveillance system to slow the spread of COVID-19 by warning individuals in a region-of-interest. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a vision-based real-time system that can detect SD violations and send non-intrusive audio-visual cues using state-of-the-art deep-learning models. Second, we define a novel critical social density value and show that the chance of SD violation occurrence can be held near zero if the pedestrian density is kept under this value. The proposed system is also ethically fair: it does not record data nor target individuals, and no human supervisor is present during the operation. The proposed system was evaluated across real-world datasets.

AB  - The evolution in knowledge management and crowdsourcing research provides new data-processing capabilities. The availability of both structured and unstructured open data formats offers unforeseen opportunities for analytics processing and advanced decision-making. However, social sciences research is facing advanced, complicated social challenges and problems. The focus of this study is to analyze the contribution of crowdsourcing techniques to the promotion of advanced social sciences research, exploiting open data available from the geographical positioning system (GPS) to analyze human behavior. In our study, we present the conceptual design of a device that, with the help of a global positioning system-data collection device (GPS-DCD), associates behavioral aspects of human life with place. The main contribution of this study is to integrate research in computer science and information systems with that in social science. The prototype system summarized in this work, proves the capacity of crowdsourcing and big data research to facilitate aggregation of microcontent related to human behavior toward improved quality of life and well-being in modern smart cities. Various ethical issues are also discussed to promote the scientific debate on this matter. Our study shows the capacity of emerging technologies to deal with social challenges. This kind of research will gain increased momentum in the future due to the availability of big data and new business models for social platforms.

AB  - More and more digital 3D city models might evolve into spatiotemporal instruments with time as the 4th dimension. For digitizing the current situation, 3D scanning and photography are suitable tools. The spatial future could be integrated using 3D drawings by public space designers and architects. The digital spatial reconstruction of lost historical environments is more complex, expensive and rarely done. Three-dimensional co-creative digital drawing with citizens’ collaboration could be a solution. In 2016, the City of Ghent (Belgium) launched the “3D city game Ghent” project with time as one of the topics, focusing on the reconstruction of disappeared environments. Ghent inhabitants modelled in open-source 3D software and added animated 3D gamification and Transmedia Storytelling, resulting in a 4D web environment and VR/AR/XR applications. This study analyses this low-cost interdisciplinary 3D co-creative process and offers a framework to enable other cities and municipalities to realise a parallel virtual universe (an animated digital twin bringing the past to life). The result of this co-creation is the start of an “Animated Spatial Time Machine” (AniSTMa), a term that was, to the best of our knowledge, never used before. This research ultimately introduces a conceptual 4D space–time diagram with a relation between the current physical situation and a growing number of 3D animated models over time.

AB  - Floods have been a major cause of destruction, instigating fatalities and massive damage to the infrastructure and overall economy of the affected country. Flood-related devastation results in the loss of homes, buildings, and critical infrastructure, leaving no means of communication or travel for the people stuck in such disasters. Thus, it is essential to develop systems that can detect floods in a region to provide timely aid and relief to stranded people, save their livelihoods, homes, and buildings, and protect key city infrastructure. Flood prediction and warning systems have been implemented in developed countries, but the manufacturing cost of such systems is too high for developing countries. Remote sensing, satellite imagery, global positioning system, and geographical information systems are currently used for flood detection to assess the flood-related damages. These techniques use neural networks, machine learning, or deep learning methods. However, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) coupled with convolution neural networks have not been explored in these contexts to instigate a swift disaster management response to minimize damage to infrastructure. Accordingly, this paper uses UAV-based aerial imagery as a flood detection method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract flood-related features from the images of the disaster zone. This method is effective in assessing the damage to local infrastructures in the disaster zones. The study area is based on a flood-prone region of the Indus River in Pakistan, where both pre-and post-disaster images are collected through UAVs. For the training phase, 2150 image patches are created by resizing and cropping the source images. These patches in the training dataset train the CNN model to detect and extract the regions where a flood-related change has occurred. The model is tested against both pre-and post-disaster images to validate it, which has positive flood detection results with an accuracy of 91%. Disaster management organizations can use this model to assess the damages to critical city infrastructure and other assets worldwide to instigate proper disaster responses and minimize the damages. This can help with the smart governance of the cities where all emergent disasters are addressed promptly.

AB  - Low power wide area networks (LPWAN) are comprised of small devices having restricted processing resources and limited energy budget. These devices are connected with each other using communication protocols. Considering their available resources, these devices can be used in a number of different Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Another interesting paradigm is machine learning, which can also be integrated with LPWAN technology to embed intelligence into these IoT applications. These machine learning-based applications combine intelligence with LPWAN and prove to be a useful tool. One such IoT application is in the medical field, where they can be used to provide multiple services. In the scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of LPWAN-based medical services has gained particular attention. This article describes various COVID-19-related healthcare services, using the the applications of machine learning and LPWAN in improving the medical domain during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We validate our idea with the help of a case study that describes a way to reduce the spread of any pandemic using LPWAN technology and machine learning. The case study compares k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and trust-based algorithms for mitigating the flow of virus spread. The simulation results show the effectiveness of KNN for curtailing the COVID-19 spread.

AB  - Purpose: the purpose of this study was to assess the evolution of computed tomography (CT) findings and lung residue in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, via quantified evaluation of the disease, using a computer aided tool. Materials and methods: we retrospectively evaluated 341 CT examinations of 140 patients (68 years of median age) infected with COVID-19 (confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)), who were hospitalized, and who received clinical and CT examinations. All CTs were evaluated by two expert radiologists, in consensus, at the same reading session, using a computer-aided tool for quantification of the pulmonary disease. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included the healthy residual parenchyma, ground glass opacity, consolidation, and total lung volume. Results: statistically significant differences (p value ≤ 0.05) were found among quantified volumes of healthy residual parenchyma, ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and total lung volume, considering different clinical conditions (stable, improved, and worsened). Statistically significant differences were found among quantified volumes for healthy residual parenchyma, GGO, and consolidation (p value ≤ 0.05) between dead patients and discharged patients. CT was not performed on cadavers; the death was an outcome, which was retrospectively included to differentiate findings of patients who survived vs. patients who died during hospitalization. Among discharged patients, complete disease resolutions on CT scans were observed in 62/129 patients with lung disease involvement ≤5%; lung disease involvement from 5% to 15% was found in 40/129 patients, while 27/129 patients had lung disease involvement between 16 and 30%. Moreover, 8–21 days (after hospital admission) was an “advanced period” with the most severe lung disease involvement. After the extent of involvement started to decrease—particularly after 21 days—the absorption was more obvious. Conclusions: a complete disease resolution on chest CT scans was observed in 48.1% of discharged patients using a computer-aided tool to quantify the GGO and consolidation volumes; after 16 days of hospital admission, the abnormalities identified by chest CT began to improve; in particular, the absorption was more obvious after 21 days.

AB  - Research on SARS-CoV-2 and its social implications have become a major focus to interdisciplinary teams worldwide. As interest in more direct solutions, such as mass testing and vaccination grows, several studies appear to be dedicated to the operationalization of those solutions, leveraging both traditional and new methodologies, and, increasingly, the combination of both. This research examines the challenges anticipated for preventative testing of SARS-CoV-2 in schools and proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agent-based model crafted specifically for school scenarios. This research shows that in the absence of real data, simulation-based data can be used to develop an artificial intelligence model for the application of rapid assessment of school testing policies.

AB  - In the last decade, technological advancements in the cyber-physical system have set the basis for real-time and context-aware services to ease human lives. The citizens, especially travelers, want to experience a safe, healthy, and timely journey to their destination. Smart and on-ground real-time traffic analysis helps authorities further improve decision-making to ensure safe and convenient traveling. In this paper, we proposed a transport-control model that exploits cyber-physical systems (CPS) and sensor-technology to continuously monitor and mine the big city data for smart decision-making. The system makes use of travel-time, traffic intensity, vehicle’s speed, and current road conditions to construct a weighted city graph representing the road network. Traditional graph algorithms with efficient implementation technologies are employed to respond to commuters’ and authorities’ needs in order to achieve a smart and optimum transportation system. To efficiently process the incoming big data streams, the proposed architecture uses the Apache GraphX tool with several parallel processing nodes, along with Spark and Hadoop that ultimately provide better performance against various state-of-the-art solutions. The system is thoroughly evaluated in terms of system throughput and processing time, revealing that the proposed system is efficient, robust, and scalable.

AB  - Smart city networks involve many applications that impose specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, thus representing a challenging scenario for network management. Solutions aiming to guarantee QoS support have not been deployed in large-scale networks. Traffic classification is a mechanism used to manage different aspects, including QoS requirements. However, conventional traffic classification methods, such as the port-based method, are inefficient because of their inability to handle dynamic port allocation and encryption. Traffic classification using machine learning has gained research interest as an alternative method to achieve high performance. In fact, machine learning embeds intelligence into network functions, thus improving network management. In this study, we apply machine learning algorithms to predict network traffic classification. We apply four supervised learning algorithms: support vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and decision tree. We also apply a port-based method of traffic classification based on applications’ popular assigned port numbers. Then, we compare the results of this method to those obtained from the machine learning algorithms. The evaluation results indicate that the decision tree algorithm provides the highest average accuracy among the evaluated algorithms, at 99.18%. Moreover, network traffic classification using machine learning provides more accurate results and higher performance than the port-based method.
