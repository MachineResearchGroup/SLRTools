AB  - Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications are being used more and more frequently. Data collected by various sensors can be used to provide innovative digital services supporting increasing efficiency or cost reduction. The implementation of such applications requires the integration and analysis of heterogeneous data coming from a broad variety of sensors. To support these steps, this paper introduces OPAL, a software toolbox consolidating several software components for the semantically annotated integration and analysis of IoT-data. Data storage is realized in a standardized and INSPIRE-compliant way utilizing the SensorThings API. Supporting a broad variety of use cases, OPAL provides several import adapters to access data sources with various protocols (e.g., the OPC UA protocol, which is often used in industrial environments). In addition, a unified management and execution environment, called PERMA, is introduced to allow the programming language independent integration of algorithms.

AB  - The evolution of Mobile Networks and Internet of Things (IoT) architectures allows one to rethink the way smart cities infrastructures are designed and managed, and solve a number of problems in terms of human mobility. The territories that adopt the sensoring era can take advantage of this disruptive technology to improve the quality of mobility of their citizens and the rationalization of their resources. However, with this rapid development of smart terminals and infrastructures, as well as the proliferation of diversified applications, even current networks may not be able to completely meet quickly rising human mobility demands. Thus, they are facing many challenges and to cope with these challenges, different standards and projects have been proposed so far. Accordingly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been utilized as a new paradigm for the design and optimization of mobile networks with a high level of intelligence. The objective of this work is to identify and discuss the challenges of mobile networks, alongside IoT and AI, to characterize smart human mobility and to discuss some workable solutions to these challenges. Finally, based on this discussion, we propose paths for future smart human mobility researches.

AB  - Forecasting future driving conditions such as acceleration, velocity, and driver behaviors can greatly contribute to safety, mobility, and sustainability issues in the development of new energy vehicles (NEVs). In this brief, a review of existing velocity prediction techniques is studied from the perspective of traffic flow and vehicle lateral dynamics for the first time. A classification framework for velocity prediction in NEVs is presented where various state-of-the-art approaches are put forward. Firstly, we investigate road traffic flow models, under which a driving-scenario-based assessment is introduced. Secondly, vehicle speed prediction methods for NEVs are given where an extensive discussion on traffic flow model classification based on traffic big data and artificial intelligence is carried out. Thirdly, the influence of vehicle lateral dynamics and correlation control methods for vehicle speed prediction are reviewed. Suitable applications of each approach are presented according to their characteristics. Future trends and questions in the development of NEVs from different angles are discussed. Finally, different from existing review papers, we introduce application examples, demonstrating the potential applications of the highlighted concepts in next-generation intelligent transportation systems. To sum up, this review not only gives the first comprehensive analysis and review of road traffic network, vehicle handling stability, and velocity prediction strategies, but also indicates possible applications of each method to prospective designers, where researchers and scholars can better choose the right method on velocity prediction in the development of NEVs.

AB  - With the development of technological innovations, Big Data is transforming the socio-economic world, impacting almost every organization and person. The transformations associated with the development of Big Data have important consequences for the sustainability of organizations, regions, and the society as a whole, and as such, they have been specifically addressed by the academic literature focusing on sustainability. Despite its importance, and perhaps because of its rapid emergence, there is a lack of studies dealing with the analysis of this body of literature and its trends. The current research attempts to fill this gap. The study develops a bibliometric and visualization analysis of the literature on the nexus between Big Data and Sustainability. The research analyzes 726 documents on this topic, published until the end of 2020, in the Web of Science Core Collection database through the VOSviewer software. The results indicate the main trends and developments on the topic related to the most cited papers, authors, publications, institutions, and countries. The visualized frameworks, structures and trends are useful for both researchers and practitioners, as they can help them understand the current situation, issues to consider, and main developments on the topic.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Nowadays, the growth in the consumption of energy and the need to face pollution resulting from its generation are causing concern for consumers and providers. Energy consumption in residential buildings and houses is about 22% of total energy production. Cutting-edge energy managers aim to optimize electrical devices in homes, taking into account users’ patterns, goals, and needs, by creating energy consumption awareness and helping current change habits. In this way, energy manager systems (EMSs) monitor and manage electrical appliances, automate and schedule actions, and make suggestions regarding electrical consumption. Furthermore, gamification strategies may change energy consumption patterns through energy managers, which are seen as an option to save energy and money. Therefore, this paper proposes a personalized gamification strategy for an EMS through an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) decision-making engine to classify the level of electrical consumption and persuade the end-user to reduce and modify consumption patterns, saving energy and money with gamified motivations. These strategies have proven to be effective in changing consumer behavior with intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. The interfaces consider three cases for summer and winter periods to calculate the saving-energy potentials: (1) for a type of user that is interested in home-improvement efforts while helping to save energy; (2) for a type of user that is advocating to save energy; (3) for a type of user that is not interested in saving energy. Hence, each interface considers the end-user’s current consumption and the possibility to modify their consumption habits using their current electrical devices. Finally, an interface displaying the electrical consumption for each case exemplifies its linkage with EMSs.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things world is in need of practical solutions for its security. Existing security mechanisms for IoT are mostly not implemented due to complexity, budget, and energy-saving issues. This is especially true for IoT devices that are battery powered, and they should be cost effective to be deployed extensively in the field. In this work, we propose a new cross-layer approach combining existing authentication protocols and existing Physical Layer Radio Frequency Fingerprinting technologies to provide hybrid authentication mechanisms that are practically proved efficient in the field. Even though several Radio Frequency Fingerprinting methods have been proposed so far, as a support for multi-factor authentication or even on their own, practical solutions are still a challenge. The accuracy results achieved with even the best systems using expensive equipment are still not sufficient on real-life systems. Our approach proposes a hybrid protocol that can save energy and computation time on the IoT devices side, proportionally to the accuracy of the Radio Frequency Fingerprinting used, which has a measurable benefit while keeping an acceptable security level. We implemented a full system operating in real time and achieved an accuracy of 99.8% for the additional cost of energy, leading to a decrease of only ~20% in battery life.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - The risk of theft of goods is certainly an important source of negative influence in human psychology. This article focuses on the development of a scheme that, despite its low cost, acts as a smart antitheft system that achieves small property detection. Specifically, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based participatory platform was developed in order to allow asset-tracking tasks to be crowd-sourced to a community. Stolen objects are traced by using a prototype Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based system, which sends signals, thus becoming a beacon. Once such an item (e.g., a bicycle) is stolen, the owner informs the authorities, which, in turn, broadcast an alert signal to activate the BLE sensor. To trace the asset with the antitheft tag, participants use their GPS-enabled smart phones to scan BLE tags through a specific smartphone client application and report the location of the asset to an operation center so that owners can locate their assets. A stolen item tracking simulator was created to support and optimize the aforementioned tracking process and to produce the best possible outcome, evaluating the impact of different parameters and strategies regarding the selection of how many and which users to activate when searching for a stolen item within a given area.

AB  - The global economy is now under threat due to the ongoing domestic and international lockdown for COVID-19. Many have already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the Corona era. Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and agriculture, there are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The roles of modern technology, the Internet of things, and artificial intelligence are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic prosperity in the post-COVID-19 economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by 2050 to meet global food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving food production and distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and addressing the double burden of malnutrition. As the world’s population is growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods, technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced. The urban smart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production, which can be introduced at any adaptive reuse, retrofit, or new buildings in vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity as well as its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and benefits. This review has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations in the development of the system, vertical farming management, and modern technologies approach.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Jamming attacks in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) scenarios are detrimental to the performance of these networks and affect the security and stability of the service perceived by users. Therefore, the evaluation of the effectiveness of smart environment platforms based on WSNs has to consider the system performance when data collection is executed under jamming attacks. In this work, we propose an experimental testbed to analyze the performance of a WSN using the IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA unslotted mode under jamming attacks in terms of goodput, packet receive rate (PRR), and energy consumption to assess the risk for users and the network in the smart scenario. The experimental results show that constant and reactive jamming strategies severely impact the evaluated performance metrics and the variance’ of the received signal strength (RSS) for some signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) ranges. The measurements obtained using the experimental testbed were correlated with analytical models. The results show that in the presence of one interferer, for SINR values higher than 4.5 dB, the PRR is almost 0.99, and the goodput 3.05 Kbps, but the system performance is significantly degraded when the amount of interferers increases. Additionally, the energy efficiency associated with reactive strategies is superior to the constant attack strategy. Finally, based on the evaluated metrics and with the proposed experimental testbed, our findings offer a better understanding of jamming attacks on the sensor devices in real smart scenarios.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Sustainable development was defined by the UN in 1987 as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, and this is a core concept in this paper. This work acknowledges the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., economic, social, and environmental, but its focus is on this last one. A digital twin (DT) is frequently described as a physical entity with a virtual counterpart, and the data, connections between the two, implying the existence of connectors and blocks for efficient and effective data communication. This paper provides a meta systematic literature review (SLR) (i.e., an SLR of SLRs) regarding the sustainability requirements of DT-based systems. Numerous papers on the subject of DT were also selected because they cited the analyzed SLRs and were considered relevant to the purposes of this research. From the selection and analysis of 29 papers, several limitations and challenges were identified: the perceived benefits of DTs are not clearly understood; DTs across the product life cycle or the DT life cycle are not sufficiently studied; it is not clear how DTs can contribute to reducing costs or supporting decision-making; technical implementation of DTs must be improved and better integrated in the context of the IoT; the level of fidelity of DTs is not entirely evaluated in terms of their parameters, accuracy, and level of abstraction; and the ownership of data stored within DTs should be better understood. Furthermore, from our research, it was not possible to find a paper discussing DTs only in regard to environmental sustainability.

AB  - Many activities and sectors have come to a halt due to the COVID-19 crisis. People and workers’ habits and behaviors have changed dramatically, as the use of technologies and connections, virtual reality, and remote support have been enhanced. Businesses and cities have been forced to quickly adapt to the new challenges. Digital technologies have allowed people to have better access to public services due to improved use of resources. Smart cities have significant potential for linking people to work and services as never done before. Additionally, the technological convergence produces data that can enhance interactions and decisions toward the “new normal”. In this paper, the aim is to assess how Portugal is prepared to respond to the accelerated process that this context demands from cities. Portuguese SMEs have developed a good capacity for entrepreneurship and innovation; however, they are still behind in converting the knowledge acquired in sales and exports and there is still limited collaboration at the public-private level. The acceleration of smart cities through the Internet of Things (IoT) may encourage changes in these issues. A more assertive alignment between the emergent technologies and the digitization goals of companies is required. This paper opens a discussion around major needs and trends of IoT (and related technologies) since the pandemic has leveraged them. The relationship between innovation and city smartness is approached to assess main contributing and limiting variables (through the European Innovation Scoreboard), to clarify future directions toward smarter services. The tourism sector, as the largest export economic activity in the country, is addressed in this matter. An analytical framework (using, for example, Power BI and Azure IoT Hub) around this approach can choose and support the most suitable areas of development in the country.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Machine vision has been thoroughly studied in the past, but research thus far has lacked an engineering perspective on human vision. This paper addresses the observed and hypothetical neural behavior of the brain in relation to the visual system. In a human vision system, visual data are collected by photoreceptors in the eye, and these data are then transmitted to the rear of the brain for processing. There are millions of retinal photoreceptors of various types, and their signals must be unscrambled by the brain after they are carried through the optic nerves. This work is a forward step toward explaining how the photoreceptor locations and proximities are resolved by the brain. It is illustrated here that unlike in digital image sensors, there is no one-to-one sensor-to-processor identifier in the human vision system. Instead, the brain must go through an iterative learning process to identify the spatial locations of the photosensors in the retina. This involves a process called synaptic pruning, which can be simulated by a memristor-like component in a learning circuit model. The simulations and proposed mathematical models in this study provide a technique that can be extrapolated to create spatial distributions of networked sensors without a central observer or location knowledge base. Through the mapping technique, the retinal space with known configuration generates signals as scrambled data-feed to the logical space in the brain. This scrambled response is then reverse-engineered to map the logical space’s connectivity with the retinal space locations.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative condition that affects a patient’s everyday life. Authors have proposed that a machine learning and sensor-based approach that continuously monitors patients in naturalistic settings can provide constant evaluation of PD and objectively analyse its progression. In this paper, we make progress toward such PD evaluation by presenting a multimodal deep learning approach for discriminating between people with PD and without PD. Specifically, our proposed architecture, named MCPD-Net, uses two data modalities, acquired from vision and accelerometer sensors in a home environment to train variational autoencoder (VAE) models. These are modality-specific VAEs that predict effective representations of human movements to be fused and given to a classification module. During our end-to-end training, we minimise the difference between the latent spaces corresponding to the two data modalities. This makes our method capable of dealing with missing modalities during inference. We show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal and other multimodal approaches by an average increase in F1-score of 0.25 and 0.09, respectively, on a data set with real patients. We also show that our method still outperforms other approaches by an average increase in F1-score of 0.17 when a modality is missing during inference, demonstrating the benefit of training on multiple modalities.

TI  - Pixel-Level Fatigue Crack Segmentation in Large-Scale Images of Steel Structures Using an Encoder–Decoder Network
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 12
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Fatigue cracks are critical types of damage in steel structures due to repeated loads and distortion effects. Fatigue crack growth may lead to further structural failure and even induce collapse. Efficient and timely fatigue crack detection and segmentation can support condition assessment, asset maintenance, and management of existing structures and prevent the early permit post and improve life cycles. In current research and engineering practices, visual inspection is the most widely implemented approach for fatigue crack inspection. However, the inspection accuracy of this method highly relies on the subjective judgment of the inspectors. Furthermore, it needs large amounts of cost, time, and labor force. Non-destructive testing methods can provide accurate detection results, but the cost is very high. To overcome the limitations of current fatigue crack detection methods, this study presents a pixel-level fatigue crack segmentation framework for large-scale images with complicated backgrounds taken from steel structures by using an encoder-decoder network, which is modified from the U-net structure. To effectively train and test the images with large resolutions such as 4928 × 3264 pixels or larger, the large images were cropped into small images for training and testing. The final segmentation results of the original images are obtained by assembling the segment results in the small images. Additionally, image post-processing including opening and closing operations were implemented to reduce the noises in the segmentation maps. The proposed method achieved an acceptable accuracy of automatic fatigue crack segmentation in terms of average intersection over union (mIOU). A comparative study with an FCN model that implements ResNet34 as backbone indicates that the proposed method using U-net could give better fatigue crack segmentation performance with fewer training epochs and simpler model structure. Furthermore, this study also provides helpful considerations and recommendations for researchers and practitioners in civil infrastructure engineering to apply image-based fatigue crack detection.

TI  - An Evolving TinyML Compression Algorithm for IoT Environments Based on Data Eccentricity
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 12
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Currently, the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) generate a large amount of sensor data at a very high pace, making it a challenge to collect and store the data. This scenario brings about the need for effective data compression algorithms to make the data manageable among tiny and battery-powered devices and, more importantly, shareable across the network. Additionally, considering that, very often, wireless communications (e.g., low-power wide-area networks) are adopted to connect field devices, user payload compression can also provide benefits derived from better spectrum usage, which in turn can result in advantages for high-density application scenarios. As a result of this increase in the number of connected devices, a new concept has emerged, called TinyML. It enables the use of machine learning on tiny, computationally restrained devices. This allows intelligent devices to analyze and interpret data locally and in real time. Therefore, this work presents a new data compression solution (algorithm) for the IoT that leverages the TinyML perspective. The new approach is called the Tiny Anomaly Compressor (TAC) and is based on data eccentricity. TAC does not require previously established mathematical models or any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed solution and validate it, a comparative analysis was performed on two real-world datasets with two other algorithms from the literature (namely Swing Door Trending (SDT) and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)). It was found that the TAC algorithm showed promising results, achieving a maximum compression rate of 98.33%. Additionally, it also surpassed the two other models regarding the compression error and peak signal-to-noise ratio in all cases.

AB  - The dissemination of disinformation and fabricated content on social media is growing. Yet little is known of what the functional Twitter data analysis methods are for languages (such as Finnish) that include word formation with endings and word stems together with derivation and compounding. Furthermore, there is a need to understand which themes linked with misinformation—and the concepts related to it—manifest in different countries and language areas in Twitter discourse. To address this issue, this study explores misinformation and its related concepts: disinformation, fake news, and propaganda in Finnish language tweets. We utilized (1) word cloud clustering, (2) topic modeling, and (3) word count analysis and clustering to detect and analyze misinformation-related concepts and themes connected to those concepts in Finnish language Twitter discussions. Our results are two-fold: (1) those concerning the functional data analysis methods and (2) those about the themes connected in discourse to the misinformation-related concepts. We noticed that each utilized method individually has critical limitations, especially all the automated analysis methods processing for the Finnish language, yet when combined they bring value to the analysis. Moreover, we discovered that politics, both internal and external, are prominent in the Twitter discussions in connection with misinformation and its related concepts of disinformation, fake news, and propaganda.

AB  - Wastewater networks are mandatory for urbanisation. Their management, including the prediction and planning of repairs and expansion operations, requires precise information on their underground components (manhole covers, equipment, nodes, and pipes). However, due to their years of service and to the increasing number of maintenance operations they may have undergone over time, the attributes and characteristics associated with the various objects constituting a network are not all available at a given time. This is partly because (i) the multiple actors that carry out repairs and extensions are not necessarily the operators who ensure the continuous functioning of the network, and (ii) the undertaken changes are not properly tracked and reported. Therefore, databases related to wastewater networks may suffer from missing data. To overcome this problem, we aim to exploit the structure of wastewater networks in the learning process of machine learning approaches, using topology and the relationship between components, to complete the missing values of pipes. Our results show that Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models yield better results than classical methods and represent a useful tool for missing data completion.

AB  - Excessive traffic pollutant emissions in high-density cities result in thermal discomfort and are associated with devastating health impacts. In this study, an improved data analytic framework that combines geo-processing techniques, social habits of local citizens like traffic patterns and working schedule and district-wise building morphologies was established to retrieve street-level traffic NOx and PM2.5 emissions in all 18 districts of Hong Kong. The identification of possible human activity regions further visualizes the intersection between emission sources and human mobility. The updated spatial distribution of traffic emission could serve as good indicators for better air quality management, as well as the planning of social infrastructures in the neighborhood environment. Further, geo-processed traffic emission figures can systematically be distributed to respective districts via mathematical means, while the correlations of NOx and mortality within different case studies range from 0.371 to 0.783, while varying from 0.509 to 0.754 for PM2.5, with some assumptions imposed in our study. Outlying districts and good practices of maintaining an environmentally friendly transportation network were also identified and analyzed via statistical means. This newly developed data-driven framework of allocating and quantifying traffic emission could possibly be extended to other dense and heavily polluted cities, with the aim of enhancing health monitoring campaigns and relevant policy implementations.

AB  - The race for the 6th generation of wireless networks (6G) has begun. Researchers around the world have started to explore the best solutions for the challenges that the previous generations have experienced. To provide the readers with a clear map of the current developments, several review papers shared their vision and critically evaluated the state of the art. However, most of the work is based on general observations and the big picture vision, and lack the practical implementation challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. This paper takes a novel approach in the review, as we present a sample of IoT use cases that are representative of a wide variety of its implementations. The chosen use cases are from the most research-active sectors that can benefit from 6G and its enabling technologies. These sectors are healthcare, smart grid, transport, and Industry 4.0. Additionally, we identified some of the practical challenges and the lessons learned in the implementation of these use cases. The review highlights the cases’ main requirements and how they overlap with the key drivers for the future generation of wireless networks.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In recent years the ever-expanding internet of things (IoT) is becoming more empowered to revolutionize our world with the advent of cutting-edge features and intelligence in an IoT ecosystem. Thanks to the development of the IoT, researchers have devoted themselves to technologies that convert a conventional home into an intelligent occupants-aware place to manage electric resources with autonomous devices to deal with excess energy consumption and providing a comfortable living environment. There are studies to supplement the innate shortcomings of the IoT and improve intelligence by using cloud computing and machine learning. However, the machine learning-based autonomous control devices lack flexibility, and cloud computing is challenging with latency and security. In this paper, we propose a rule-based optimization mechanism on an embedded edge platform to provide dynamic home appliance control and advanced intelligence in a smart home. To provide actional control ability, we design and developed a rule-based objective function in the EdgeX edge computing platform to control the temperature states of the smart home. Compared to cloud computing, edge computing can provide faster response and higher quality of services. The edge computing paradigm provides better analysis, processing, and storage abilities to the data generated from the IoT sensors to enhance the capability of IoT devices concerning computing, storage, and network resources. In order to satisfy the paradigm of distributed edge computing, all the services are implemented as microservices. The microservices are connected to each other through REST APIs based on the constrained IoT devices to provide all the functionalities that accomplish a trade-off between energy consumption and occupant-desired environment setting for the smart home appliances. We simulated our proposed system to control the temperature of a smart home; through experimental findings, we investigated the application against the delay time and overall memory consumption by the embedded edge system of EdgeX. The result of this research work suggests that the implemented services operated efficiently in the raspberry pi 3 hardware of IoT devices.

AB  - Since awareness of the influence of home energy management services (HEMS) with Internet of things (IoT) has grown, the study on the acceptance of IoT services has been expanded. Previous studies, however, have not paid attention to the acceptance itself, focusing only on factors affecting the acceptance. This study attempts to draw meaningful implications by exploring the relationships between the acceptance and the factors affecting it with distinctions between passive acceptance and active acceptance. This study analyzed the ordinal logistic regression models based on a survey of 909 adults 19 years of age and older in Korea on HEMS with IoT. In addition, we attempt the ordinal forest to increase the reliability of the research results. As a result, this study showed that consumers’ perception of usefulness was noticeably important to enhance active acceptance and that those who had high sensitivity to new technology acceptance showed high active acceptance, and older women had higher active acceptance. This study might contribute to the research on IoT acceptance in the energy management sector by classifying the acceptance into active acceptance and passive acceptance beyond the framework of setting the acceptance as a single variable.

AB  - Developing a responsive pavement-management infrastructure system is of paramount importance, accentuated by the quest for sustainability through adoption of the Road Traffic Management System. Technological advances have been witnessed in developed countries concerning the development of smart, sustainable transportation infrastructure. However, the same cannot be said of developing countries. In this study, the development of a pavement management system at network level was examined to contribute towards a framework for evaluating a Pavement Quality Index and service life capacity. Environmental surface response models in the form of temperature and moisture variations within the pavement were applied, using sensor devices connected to a data cloud system to carry out mathematical analysis using a distinctive mesh analysis deformation model. The results indicated variation in the Resilient Modulus of the pavement, with increasing moisture content. Increase in moisture propagation increased saturation of the unbound granular base which reduced the elastic modulus of the sub-base and base layer and reduced the strength of the pavement, resulting in bottom-up cracks and cracking failure. The horizontal deformation reduced, indicating that the material was experiencing work hardening and further stress would not result in significant damage. Increasing temperature gradient resulted in reduced stiffness of the asphalt layer. In tropical regions, this can result in rutting failure which, over time, results in top-down cracks and potholes, coupled with increasing moisture content.

AB  - Estimating the height of buildings and vegetation in single aerial images is a challenging problem. A task-focused Deep Learning (DL) model that combines architectural features from successful DL models (U-NET and Residual Networks) and learns the mapping from a single aerial imagery to a normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) was proposed. The model was trained on aerial images whose corresponding DSM and Digital Terrain Models (DTM) were available and was then used to infer the nDSM of images with no elevation information. The model was evaluated with a dataset covering a large area of Manchester, UK, as well as the 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest LiDAR dataset. The results suggest that the proposed DL architecture is suitable for the task and surpasses other state-of-the-art DL approaches by a large margin.

AB  - The need for studies connecting machine explainability with human behavior is essential, especially for a detailed understanding of a human’s perspective, thoughts, and sensations according to a context. A novel system called RYEL was developed based on Subject-Matter Experts (SME) to investigate new techniques for acquiring higher-order thinking, the perception, the use of new computational explanatory techniques, support decision-making, and the judge’s cognition and behavior. Thus, a new spectrum is covered and promises to be a new area of study called Interpretation-Assessment/Assessment-Interpretation (IA-AI), consisting of explaining machine inferences and the interpretation and assessment from a human. It allows expressing a semantic, ontological, and hermeneutical meaning related to the psyche of a human (judge). The system has an interpretative and explanatory nature, and in the future, could be used in other domains of discourse. More than 33 experts in Law and Artificial Intelligence validated the functional design. More than 26 judges, most of them specializing in psychology and criminology from Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Spain, Argentina, and Costa Rica, participated in the experiments. The results of the experimentation have been very positive. As a challenge, this research represents a paradigm shift in legal data processing.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 13
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Significance and popularity of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is inevitable; however, its application is highly challenging in multi-domain collaborative smart city environments. The reason is its limitations in adapting the dynamically changing information of users, tasks, access policies and resources in such applications. It also does not incorporate semantically meaningful business roles, which could have a diverse impact upon access decisions in such multi-domain collaborative business environments. We propose an Intelligent Role-based Access Control (I-RBAC) model that uses intelligent software agents for achieving intelligent access control in such highly dynamic multi-domain environments. The novelty of this model lies in using a core I-RBAC ontology that is developed using real-world semantic business roles as occupational roles provided by Standard Occupational Classification (SOC), USA. It contains around 1400 business roles, from nearly all domains, along with their detailed task descriptions as well as hierarchical relationships among them. The semantic role mining process is performed through intelligent agents that use word embedding and a bidirectional LSTM deep neural network for automated population of organizational ontology from its unstructured text policy and, subsequently, matching this ontology with core I-RBAC ontology to extract unified business roles. The experimentation was performed on a large number of collaboration case scenarios of five multi-domain organizations and promising results were obtained regarding the accuracy of automatically derived RDF triples (Subject, Predicate, Object) from organizational text policies as well as the accuracy of extracted semantically meaningful roles.

AB  - Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI) and social media can provide information about real-time perceptions, attitudes and behaviours in urban green space (UGS). This paper reviews the use of VGI and social media data in research examining UGS. The current state of the art is described through the analysis of 177 papers to (1) summarise the characteristics and usage of data from different platforms, (2) provide an overview of the research topics using such data sources, and (3) characterise the research approaches based on data pre-processing, data quality assessment and improvement, data analysis and modelling. A number of important limitations and priorities for future research are identified. The limitations include issues of data acquisition and representativeness, data quality, as well as differences across social media platforms in different study areas such as urban and rural areas. The research priorities include a focus on investigating factors related to physical activities in UGS areas, urban park use and accessibility, the use of data from multiple sources and, where appropriate, making more effective use of personal information. In addition, analysis approaches can be extended to examine the network suggested by social media posts that are shared, re-posted or reacted to and by being combined with textual, image and geographical data to extract more representative information for UGS analysis.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The current trend towards living in big cities contributes to an increased demand for efficient and sustainable space and resource allocation in urban environments. This leads to enormous pressure for resource minimization in city planning. One pillar of efficient city management is a smart intermodal traffic system. Planning and organizing the various kinds of modes of transport in a complex and dynamically adaptive system such as a city is inherently challenging. By deliberately simplifying reality, models can help decision-makers shape the traffic systems of tomorrow. Meanwhile, Smart City initiatives are investing in sensors to observe and manage many kinds of urban resources, making up a part of the Internet of Things (IoT) that produces massive amounts of data relevant for urban planning and monitoring. We use these new data sources of smart cities by integrating real-time data of IoT sensors in an ongoing simulation. In this sense, the model is a digital twin of its real-world counterpart, being augmented with real-world data. To our knowledge, this is a novel instance of real-time correction during simulation of an agent-based model. The process of creating a valid mapping between model components and real-world objects posed several challenges and offered valuable insights, particularly when studying the interaction between humans and their environment. As a proof-of-concept for our implementation, we designed a showcase with bike rental stations in Hamburg-Harburg, a southern district of Hamburg, Germany. Our objective was to investigate the concept of real-time data correction in agent-based modeling, which we consider to hold great potential for improving the predictive capabilities of models. In particular, we hope that the chosen proof-of-concept informs the ongoing politically supported trends in mobility—away from individual and private transport and towards—in Hamburg.

IS  - 3
SN  - 2571-9394

AB  - Day-ahead electricity price forecasting plays a critical role in balancing energy consumption and generation, optimizing the decisions of electricity market participants, formulating energy trading strategies, and dispatching independent system operators. Despite the fact that much research on price forecasting has been published in recent years, it remains a difficult task because of the challenging nature of electricity prices that includes seasonality, sharp fluctuations in price, and high volatility. This study presents a three-stage short-term electricity price forecasting model by employing ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and extreme learning machine (ELM). In the proposed model, the EEMD is employed to decompose the actual price signals to overcome the non-linear and non-stationary components in the electricity price data. Then, a day-ahead forecasting is performed using the ELM model. We conduct several experiments on real-time data obtained from three different states of the electricity market in Australia, i.e., Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. We also implement various deep learning approaches as benchmark methods, i.e., recurrent neural network, multi-layer perception, support vector machine, and ELM. In order to affirm the performance of our proposed and benchmark approaches, this study performs several performance evaluation metric, including the Diebold–Mariano (DM) test. The results from the experiments show the productiveness of our developed model (in terms of higher accuracy) over its counterparts.

AB  - The construction and operation of wind turbines have become an important part of the development of smart cities. However, the fault of the main drive chain often causes the outage of wind turbines, which has a serious impact on the normal operation of wind turbines in smart cities. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the commonly used main drive chain fault diagnosis method that only uses a single data source, a fault feature extraction and fault diagnosis approach based on data source fusion is proposed. By fusing two data sources, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) real-time monitoring system data and the main drive chain vibration monitoring data, the fault features of the main drive chain are jointly extracted, and an intelligent fault diagnosis model for the main drive chain in wind turbine based on data fusion is established. The diagnosis results of actual cases certify that the fault diagnosis model based on the fusion of two data sources is able to locate faults of the main drive chain in the wind turbine accurately and provide solid technical support for the high-efficient operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

PY  - 2021

SN  - 2411-5134

AB  - Background: According to the renowned and Oscar award-winning American actor and film director Marlon Brando, “privacy is not something that I am merely entitled to, it is an absolute prerequisite.” Privacy threats and data breaches occur daily, and countries are mitigating the consequences caused by privacy and data breaches. The Indian healthcare industry is one of the largest and rapidly developing industry. Overall, healthcare management is changing from disease-centric into patient-centric systems. Healthcare data analysis also plays a crucial role in healthcare management, and the privacy of patient records must receive equal attention. Purpose: This paper mainly presents the utility and privacy factors of the Indian healthcare data and discusses the utility aspect and privacy problems concerning Indian healthcare systems. It defines policies that reform Indian healthcare systems. The case study of the NITI Aayog report is presented to explain how reformation occurs in Indian healthcare systems. Findings: It is found that there have been numerous research studies conducted on Indian healthcare data across all dimensions; however, privacy problems in healthcare, specifically in India, are caused by prevalent complacency, culture, politics, budget limitations, large population, and existing infrastructures. This paper reviews the Indian healthcare system and the applications that drive it. Additionally, the paper also maps that how privacy issues are happening in every healthcare sector in India. Originality/Value: To understand these factors and gain insights, understanding Indian healthcare systems first is crucial. To the best of our knowledge, we found no recent papers that thoroughly reviewed the Indian healthcare system and its privacy issues. The paper is original in terms of its overview of the healthcare system and privacy issues. Social Implications: Privacy has been the most ignored part of the Indian healthcare system. With India being a country with a population of 130 billion, much healthcare data are generated every day. The chances of data breaches and other privacy violations on such sensitive data cannot be avoided as they cause severe concerns for individuals. This paper segregates the healthcare system’s advances and lists the privacy that needs to be addressed first.

AB  - The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (also referred to as drones) has transformed the digital landscape of surveillance and supply chain logistics, especially in terrains where such was previously deemed unattainable. Moreover, the adoption of drones has further led to the proliferation of diverse drone types and drone-related criminality, which has introduced a myriad of security and forensics-related concerns. As a step towards understanding the state-of-the-art research into these challenges and potential approaches to mitigation, this study provides a detailed review of existing digital forensic models using the Design Science Research method. The outcome of this study generated in-depth knowledge of the research challenges and opportunities through which an effective investigation can be carried out on drone-related incidents. Furthermore, a potential generic investigation model has been proposed. The findings presented in this study are essentially relevant to forensic researchers and practitioners towards a guided methodology for drone-related event investigation. Ultimately, it is important to mention that this study presents a background for the development of international standardization for drone forensics.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The output of a deep-learning model delivers different predictions depending on the input of the deep learning model. In particular, the input characteristics might affect the output of a deep learning model. When predicting data that are measured with sensors in multiple locations, it is necessary to train a deep learning model with spatiotemporal characteristics of the data. Additionally, since not all of the data measured together result in increasing the accuracy of the deep learning model, we need to utilize the correlation characteristics between the data features. However, it is difficult to interpret the deep learning output, depending on the input characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze how the input characteristics affect prediction results to interpret deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a visualization system to analyze deep learning models with air pollution data. The proposed system visualizes the predictions according to the input characteristics. The input characteristics include space-time and data features, and we apply temporal prediction networks, including gated recurrent units (GRU), long short term memory (LSTM), and spatiotemporal prediction networks (convolutional LSTM) as deep learning models. We interpret the output according to the characteristics of input to show the effectiveness of the system.

AB  - Existing megawatt-scale photovoltaic (PV) power plant producers must understand that simple and low-cost Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) practices, even executed by their own personal and supported by a comparison of field data with simulated ones, play a key role in improving the energy outputs of the plant. Based on a currently operating 18 MW PV plant located in an under-developing South-Asia country, we show in this paper that comparing real field data collected with simulated results allows a central vision concerning plant underperformance and valuable indications about the most important predictive maintenances actions for the plant in analysis. Simulations using the globally recognized software PVSyst were first performed to attest to the overall power plant performance. Then, its energy output was predicted using existing ground weather data located at the power plant. Compared with the actual plant’s annual energy output, it was found that it was underperforming by −4.13%, leading to a potential monetary loss of almost 175,000 (EUR)/year. Besides, an analysis of the O&amp;M power plant reports was performed and compared to the best global practices. It was assessed that the tracker systems’ major issues are the forerunner of the most significant PV power plant underperformance. In addition, issues in inverters and combiner boxes were also reported, leading to internal shutdowns. In this case, predictive maintenance and automated plant diagnosis with a bottom-up approach using low-cost data acquisition and processing systems, starting from the strings level, were recommended.

AB  - Mining ubiquitous sensing data is important but also challenging, due to many factors, such as heterogeneous large-scale data that is often at various levels of abstraction. This also relates particularly to the important aspects of the explainability and interpretability of the applied models and their results, and thus ultimately to the outcome of the data mining process. With this, in general, the inclusion of domain knowledge leading towards semantic data mining approaches is an emerging and important research direction. This article aims to survey relevant works in these areas, focusing on semantic data mining approaches and methods, but also on selected applications of ubiquitous sensing in some of the most prominent current application areas. Here, we consider in particular: (1) environmental sensing; (2) ubiquitous sensing in industrial applications of artificial intelligence; and (3) social sensing relating to human interactions and the respective individual and collective behaviors. We discuss these in detail and conclude with a summary of this emerging field of research. In addition, we provide an outlook on future directions for semantic data mining in ubiquitous sensing contexts.

TI  - Big Data Analytics in Sustainable Supply Chain Management: A Focus on Manufacturing Supply Chains
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Sustainable supply chain management has been an important research issue for the last two decades due to climate change. From a global perspective, the United Nations have introduced sustainable development goals, which point towards sustainability. Manufacturing supply chains are among those that produce harmful effluents into the environment in addition to social issues that impact societies and economies where they operate. New developments in information and communication technologies, especially big data analytics (BDA), can help create new insights that can detect parts and members of a supply chain whose activities are unsustainable and take corrective action. While many studies have addressed sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), studies on the effect of BDA on SSCM in the context of manufacturing supply chains are limited. This conceptual paper applies Toulmin’s argumentation model to review relevant literature and draw conclusions. The study identifies the elements of big data analytics as data processing, analytics, reporting, integration, security and economic. The aspects of sustainable SCM are transparency, sustainability culture, corporate goals and risk management. It is established that BDA enhances SSCM of manufacturing supply chains. Cyberattacks and information technology skills gap are some of the challenges impeding BDA implementation. The paper makes a conceptual and methodological contribution to supply chain management literature by linking big data analytics and SSCM in manufacturing supply chains by using the rarely used Toulmin’s argumentation model in management studies.

AB  - Statistical traffic analysis has absolutely exposed the privacy of supposedly secure network traffic, proving that encryption is not effective anymore. In this work, we present an optimal countermeasure to prevent an adversary from inferring users’ online activities, using traffic analysis. First, we formulate analytically a constrained optimization problem to maximize network traffic obfuscation while minimizing overhead costs. Then, we provide OPriv, a practical and efficient algorithm to solve dynamically the non-linear programming (NLP) problem, using Cplex optimization. Our heuristic algorithm selects target applications to mutate to and the corresponding packet length, and subsequently decreases the security risks of statistical traffic analysis attacks. Furthermore, we develop an analytical model to measure the obfuscation system’s resilience to traffic analysis attacks. We suggest information theoretic metrics for quantitative privacy measurement, using entropy. The full privacy protection of OPriv is assessed through our new metrics, and then through extensive simulations on real-world data traces. We show that our algorithm achieves strong privacy protection in terms of traffic flow information without impacting the network performance. We are able to reduce the accuracy of a classifier from 91.1% to 1.42% with only 0.17% padding overhead.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The quality of the user-generated content of citizen science platforms has been discussed widely among researchers. Content is categorized into data and information: data is content stored in a database of a citizen science platform, while information is context-dependent content generated by users. Understanding data and information quality characteristics and utilizing them during design improves citizen science platforms’ overall quality. This research investigates the integration of data and information quality characteristics into a citizen science platform for collecting information from the general public with no scientific training in the area where content is collected. The primary goal is to provide a framework for selecting and integrating data and information quality characteristics into the design for improving the content quality on platforms. The design and implementation of a citizen science platform that collects walking path conditions are presented, and the resulting implication is evaluated. The results show that the platform’s content quality can be improved by introducing quality characteristics during the design stage of the citizen science platform.

TI  - Three Decades of Research on Smart Cities: Mapping Knowledge Structure and Trends
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 13
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The concept of smart cities has gained significant momentum in science and policy circles over the past decade. This study aims to provide an overview of the structure and trends in the literature on smart cities. Bibliometric analysis and science mapping techniques using VOSviewer and CiteSpace are used to identify the thematic focus of over 5000 articles indexed in the Web of Science since 1991. In addition to providing insights into the thematic evolution of the field, the three-decade study period is divided into two sub-periods (1991–2015 and 2016–2021). While splitting the dataset into more sub-periods would have been desirable, we decided to only examine two sub-periods as only very few papers have been published until 2010. The annual number of publications has progressively increased since then, with a surge in the annual number of publications observable from 2015 onwards. The thematic analysis showed that the intellectual base of the field has been very limited during the first period, but has expanded significantly since 2015. Over time, some thematic evolutions, such as further attention to linkages to climate change and resilience, and more emphasis on security and privacy issues, have been made. The thematic analysis shows that existing research on smart cities is dominated by either conceptual issues or underlying technical aspects. It is, therefore, essential to do more research on the implementation of smart cities and actual and/or potential contributions of smart cities to solving societal issues. In addition to elaborating on thematic focus, the study also highlights major authors, journals, references, countries, and institutions that have contributed to the development of the smart cities literature.

AB  - Timely and reliable information about crop management, production, and yield is considered of great utility by stakeholders (e.g., national and international authorities, farmers, commercial units, etc.) to ensure food safety and security. By 2050, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, around 70% more production of agricultural products will be needed to fulfil the demands of the world population. Likewise, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the second goal of “zero hunger”, potential technologies like remote sensing (RS) need to be efficiently integrated into agriculture. The application of RS is indispensable today for a highly productive and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the present study draws a general overview of RS technology with a special focus on the principal platforms of this technology, i.e., satellites and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), and the sensors used, in relation to the 5th industrial revolution. Nevertheless, since 1957, RS technology has found applications, through the use of satellite imagery, in agriculture, which was later enriched by the incorporation of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), which is further pushing the boundaries of proficiency through the upgrading of sensors capable of higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. More prominently, wireless sensor technologies (WST) have streamlined real time information acquisition and programming for respective measures. Improved algorithms and sensors can, not only add significant value to crop data acquisition, but can also devise simulations on yield, harvesting and irrigation periods, metrological data, etc., by making use of cloud computing. The RS technology generates huge sets of data that necessitate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to extract useful products, thereby augmenting the adeptness and efficiency of agriculture to ensure its sustainability. These technologies have made the orientation of current research towards the estimation of plant physiological traits rather than the structural parameters possible. Futuristic approaches for benefiting from these cutting-edge technologies are discussed in this study. This study can be helpful for researchers, academics, and young students aspiring to play a role in the achievement of sustainable agriculture.

SN  - 0718-1876

AB  - The startup business ecosystem in India has experienced exponential growth. The amount of investment in Indian startups in the last decade demonstrates the strong interest of the technology industry to these business models based on innovation. In this context, the present study aims to identify investment opportunities for investors in Indian startups by identifying key indicators that characterize the startup ecosystem in India. To this end, a three steps data mining method is developed using data mining techniques. First, a sentiment analysis (SA), a machine learning approach that classifies the topics into groups expressing feelings, is applied to a dataset. Next, we develop a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, a topic-modeling technique that divides the sample of n = 14.531 tweets from Twitter into topics, using user-generated content (UGC) as data. Finally, in order to identify the characteristics of each topic we apply textual analysis (TA) to identify key indicators. The originality of the present study lies in the methodological process used for data analysis. Our results also contribute to the literature on startups. The results demonstrate that the Indian startup ecosystem is influenced by areas such as fintech, innovation, crowdfunding, hardware, funds, competition, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and electronic commerce. Of note, in view of the exploratory approach of the present study, the results and implications should be taken as descriptive, rather than determining for future investments in the Indian startup ecosystem.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a modular unmanned aerial vehicle for the detection and eradication of weeds on farmland. Precision agriculture entails solving the problem of poor agricultural yield due to competition for nutrients by weeds and provides a faster approach to eliminating the problematic weeds using emerging technologies. This research has addressed the aforementioned problem. A quadcopter was built, and components were assembled with light-weight materials. The system consists of the electric motor, electronic speed controller, propellers, frame, lithium polymer (li-po) battery, flight controller, a global positioning system (GPS), and receiver. A sprayer module which consists of a relay, Raspberry Pi 3, spray pump, 12 V DC source, water hose, and the tank was built. It operated in such a way that when a weed is detected based on the deep learning algorithms deployed on the Raspberry Pi, general purpose input/output (GPIO) 17 or GPIO 18 (of the Raspberry Pi) were activated to supply 3.3 V, which turned on a DC relay to spray herbicides accordingly. The sprayer module was mounted on the quadcopter and from the test-running operation conducted, broadleaf and grass weeds were accurately detected and the spraying of herbicides according to the weed type occurred in less than a second.

AB  - In the construction process of smart cities, more and more video surveillance systems have been deployed for traffic, office buildings, shopping malls, and families. Thus, the security of video surveillance systems has attracted more attention. At present, many researchers focus on how to select the region of interest (RoI) accurately and then realize privacy protection in videos by selective encryption. However, relatively few researchers focus on building a security framework by analyzing the security of a video surveillance system from the system and data life cycle. By analyzing the surveillance video protection and the attack surface of a video surveillance system in a smart city, we constructed a secure surveillance framework in this manuscript. In the secure framework, a secure video surveillance model is proposed, and a secure authentication protocol that can resist man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM) and replay attacks is implemented. For the management of the video encryption key, we introduced the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) on the basis of group key management to provide an efficient and secure key update. In addition, we built a decryption suite based on transparent encryption to ensure the security of the decryption environment. The security analysis proved that our system can guarantee the forward and backward security of the key update. In the experiment environment, the average decryption speed of our system can reach 91.47 Mb/s, which can meet the real-time requirement of practical applications.

AB  - Energy consumption is a crucial domain in energy system management. Recently, it was observed that there has been a rapid rise in the consumption of energy throughout the world. Thus, almost every nation devises its strategies and models to limit energy usage in various areas, ranging from large buildings to industrial firms and vehicles. With technological advancements, computational intelligence models have been successfully contributing to the prediction of the consumption of energy. Machine learning and deep learning-based models enhance the precision and robustness compared to traditional approaches, making it more reliable. This article performs a review analysis of the various computational intelligence approaches currently being utilized to predict energy consumption. An extensive survey procedure is conducted and presented in this study, and relevant works are discussed. Different criteria are considered during the aggregation of the relevant studies relating to the work. The author’s perspective, future trends and various novel approaches are also presented as a part of the discussion. This article thereby lays a foundation stone for further research works to be undertaken for energy prediction.

TI  - Overview and Exploitation of Haptic Tele-Weight Device in Virtual Shopping Stores

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 13
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - In view of the problem of e-commerce scams and the absence of haptic interaction, this research aims to introduce and create a tele-weight device for e-commerce shopping in smart cities. The objective is to use the proposed prototype to provide a brief overview of the possible technological advancements. When the tele-weight device is affixed over the head-mounted display, it allows the user to feel the item’s weight while shopping in the virtual store. Addressing the problem of having no physical interaction between the user (player) and a series game scene in virtual reality (VR) headsets, this research approach focuses on creating a prototype device that has two parts, a sending part and a receiving part. The sending part measures the weight of the object and transmits it over the cellular network to the receiver side. The virtual store user at the receiving side can thus realize the weight of the ordered object. The findings from this work include a visual display of the item’s weight to the virtual store e-commerce user. By introducing sustainability, this haptic technology-assisted technique can help the customer realize the weight of an object and thus have a better immersive experience. In the device, the load cell measures the weight of the object and amplifies it using the HX711 amplifier. However, some delay in the demonstration of the weight was observed during experimentation, and this indirectly altered the performance of the system. One set of the device is sited at the virtual store user premises while the sending end of the device is positioned at the warehouse. The sending end hardware includes an Arduino Uno device, an HX711 amplifier chip to amplify the weight from the load cell, and a cellular module (Sim900A chip-based) to transmit the weight in the form of an encoded message. The receiving end hardware includes a cellular module and an actuator involving a motor gear arrangement to demonstrate the weight of the object. Combining the fields of e-commerce, embedded systems, VR, and haptic sensing, this research can help create a more secure marketplace to attain a higher level of customer satisfaction.

With the majority actively embracing smart technologies and their benefits, the journey of human digitalisation has begun. Will human beings continue to remain solitary unaffected beings in the middle of the whirlpool—a gateway to the completely digitalised future? This journey of human digitalisation probably started much earlier, before we even realised. This paper, in the format of an objective review and discussion, aims to investigate the journey of human digitalisation, explore the reality of domination between technology and humans, provide a better understanding of the human value and human vulnerability in this fast transforming digital era, so as to achieve valuable and insightful suggestion on the future direction of the human digitalisation journey.

VL  - 21
IS  - 13
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Building-damage mapping using remote sensing images plays a critical role in providing quick and accurate information for the first responders after major earthquakes. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in generating post-earthquake building-damage maps automatically using different artificial intelligence (AI)-based frameworks. These frameworks in this domain are promising, yet not reliable for several reasons, including but not limited to the site-specific design of the methods, the lack of transparency in the AI-model, the lack of quality in the labelled image, and the use of irrelevant descriptor features in building the AI-model. Using explainable AI (XAI) can lead us to gain insight into identifying these limitations and therefore, to modify the training dataset and the model accordingly. This paper proposes the use of SHAP (Shapley additive explanation) to interpret the outputs of a multilayer perceptron (MLP)—a machine learning model—and analyse the impact of each feature descriptor included in the model for building-damage assessment to examine the reliability of the model. In this study, a post-event satellite image from the 2018 Palu earthquake was used. The results show that MLP can classify the collapsed and non-collapsed buildings with an overall accuracy of 84% after removing the redundant features. Further, spectral features are found to be more important than texture features in distinguishing the collapsed and non-collapsed buildings. Finally, we argue that constructing an explainable model would help to understand the model’s decision to classify the buildings as collapsed and non-collapsed and open avenues to build a transferable AI model.

AB  - The district heating (DH) industry is facing an important transformation towards more efficient networks that utilise significantly lower water temperatures to distribute the heat. This change requires taking advantage of new technologies, and Machine Learning (ML) is a popular direction. In the last decade, we have witnessed an extreme growth in the number of published research papers that focus on applying ML techniques to the DH domain. However, based on our experience in the field, and an extensive review of the state-of-the-art, we perceive a mismatch between the most popular research directions, such as forecasting, and the challenges faced by the DH industry. In this work, we present our findings, explain and demonstrate the key gaps between the two communities and suggest a road-map ahead towards increasing the impact of ML research in the DH industry.

AB  - For the last decade the Smart City concept has been under development, fostered by the growing urbanization of the world’s population and the need to handle the challenges that such a scenario raises. During this time many Smart City projects have been executed–some as proof-of-concept, but a growing number resulting in permanent, production-level deployments, improving the operation of the city and the quality of life of its citizens. Thus, Smart Cities are still a highly relevant paradigm which needs further development before it reaches its full potential and provides robust and resilient solutions. In this paper, the focus is set on the Internet of Things (IoT) as an enabling technology for the Smart City. In this sense, the paper reviews the current landscape of IoT-enabled Smart Cities, surveying relevant experiences and city initiatives that have embedded IoT within their city services and how they have generated an impact. The paper discusses the key technologies that have been developed and how they are contributing to the realization of the Smart City. Moreover, it presents some challenges that remain open ahead of us and which are the initiatives and technologies that are under development to tackle them.

TI  - Design of a Spark Big Data Framework for PM2.5 Air Pollution Forecasting
T2  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health

PY  - 2021
VL  - 18
IS  - 13
SN  - 1660-4601

AB  - In recent years, with rapid economic development, air pollution has become extremely serious, causing many negative effects on health, environment and medical costs. PM2.5 is one of the main components of air pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to know the PM2.5 air quality in advance for health. Many studies on air quality are based on the government’s official air quality monitoring stations, which cannot be widely deployed due to high cost constraints. Furthermore, the update frequency of government monitoring stations is once an hour, and it is hard to capture short-term PM2.5 concentration peaks with little warning. Nevertheless, dealing with short-term data with many stations, the volume of data is huge and is calculated, analyzed and predicted in a complex way. This alleviates the high computational requirements of the original predictor, thus making Spark suitable for the considered problem. This study proposes a PM2.5 instant prediction architecture based on the Spark big data framework to handle the huge data from the LASS community. The Spark big data framework proposed in this study is divided into three modules. It collects real time PM2.5 data and performs ensemble learning through three machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) to predict the PM2.5 concentration value in the next 30 to 180 min with accompanying visualization graph. The experimental results show that our proposed Spark big data ensemble prediction model in next 30-min prediction has the best performance (R2 up to 0.96), and the ensemble model has better performance than any single machine learning model. Taiwan has been suffering from a situation of relatively poor air pollution quality for a long time. Air pollutant monitoring data from LASS community can provide a wide broader monitoring, however the data is large and difficult to integrate or analyze. The proposed Spark big data framework system can provide short-term PM2.5 forecasts and help the decision-maker to take proper action immediately.

AB  - In this study, based on multi-access edge computing (MEC), we provided the possibility of cooperating manufacturing processes. We tried to solve the job shop scheduling problem by applying DQN (deep Q-network), a reinforcement learning model, to this method. Here, to alleviate the overload of computing resources, an efficient DQN was used for the experiments using transfer learning data. Additionally, we conducted scheduling studies in the edge computing ecosystem of our manufacturing processes without the help of cloud centers. Cloud computing, an environment in which scheduling processing is performed, has issues sensitive to the manufacturing process in general, such as security issues and communication delay time, and research is being conducted in various fields, such as the introduction of an edge computing system that can replace them. We proposed a method of independently performing scheduling at the edge of the network through cooperative scheduling between edge devices within a multi-access edge computing structure. The proposed framework was evaluated, analyzed, and compared with existing frameworks in terms of providing solutions and services.

AB  - Urban areas can be considered high-potential energy producers alongside their notable portion of energy consumption. Solar energy is the most promising sustainable energy in which urban environments can produce electricity by using rooftop-mounted photovoltaic systems. While the precise knowledge of electricity production from solar energy resources as well as the needed parameters to define the optimal locations require an adequate study, effective guidelines for optimal installation of solar photovoltaics remain a challenge. This paper aims to make a complete systematic review and states the vital steps with their data resources to find the urban rooftop PV potential. Organizing the methodologies is another novelty of this paper to create a complete global basis for future studies and improve a more detailed degree in this particular field.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In spite of excellent performance of deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, they are not suitable for real-time surveillance to detect abnormal behavior because of very high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a real-time surveillance system for abnormal behavior analysis in a closed-circuit television (CCTV) environment by constructing an algorithm and system optimized for a CCTV environment. The proposed method combines pedestrian detection and tracking to extract pedestrian information in real-time, and detects abnormal behaviors such as intrusion, loitering, fall-down, and violence. To analyze an abnormal behavior, it first determines intrusion/loitering through the coordinates of an object and then determines fall-down/violence based on the behavior pattern of the object. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using an intelligent CCTV data set distributed by Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA).

TI  - Federated Compressed Learning Edge Computing Framework with Ensuring Data Privacy for PM2.5 Prediction in Smart City Sensing Applications

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The sparse data in PM2.5 air quality monitoring systems is frequently happened on large-scale smart city sensing applications, which is collected via massive sensors. Moreover, it could be affected by inefficient node deployment, insufficient communication, and fragmented records, which is the main challenge of the high-resolution prediction system. In addition, data privacy in the existing centralized air quality prediction system cannot be ensured because the data which are mined from end sensory nodes constantly exposed to the network. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel edge computing framework, named Federated Compressed Learning (FCL), which provides efficient data generation while ensuring data privacy for PM2.5 predictions in the application of smart city sensing. The proposed scheme inherits the basic ideas of the compression technique, regional joint learning, and considers a secure data exchange. Thus, it could reduce the data quantity while preserving data privacy. This study would like to develop a green energy-based wireless sensing network system by using FCL edge computing framework. It is also one of key technologies of software and hardware co-design for reconfigurable and customized sensing devices application. Consequently, the prototypes are developed in order to validate the performances of the proposed framework. The results show that the data consumption is reduced by more than 95% with an error rate below 5%. Finally, the prediction results based on the FCL will generate slightly lower accuracy compared with centralized training. However, the data could be heavily compacted and securely transmitted in WSNs.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Thanks to advances in smart metering devices (SM), the electricity sector is undergoing a series of changes, among which it is worth highlighting the ability to control the response to all events that occur in the electricity grid with the intention of making it more smart. Predicting electricity consumption data is a key factor for the energy sector in order to create a completely intelligent electricity grid that optimizes consumption and forecasts future energy needs. However, it is currently not enough to give a prediction of energy consumption (EC), but it is also necessary to give the prediction as fast as possible so that the grid can operate in the shortest possible time. An approach for developing EC prediction systems is introduced here by the use of artificial neural networks (ANN). Differently from other research studies on the subject, a divide-and-conquer strategy is used so that the target system’s execution switches from one to another specialized small models that forecast the EC of a building within the time range of one hour. By simultaneously processing a large amount of data and models, a consequence of implementing them in parallel with TensorFlow on GPUs, the training procedure proposed here increases the performance of the classic time series prediction methods, which are based on ANN. Leveraging the latest generation of ANN techniques and new GPU-based architectures, correct EC predictions can be obtained and, as the experimentation carried out in this work shows, such predictions can be obtained quickly. The obtained results in this study show a promising way for speeding up big data processing of building’s monitoring data to achieve energy efficiency.

AB  - With the increasing use of mobile devices, malware attacks are rising, especially on Android phones, which account for 72.2% of the total market share. Hackers try to attack smartphones with various methods such as credential theft, surveillance, and malicious advertising. Among numerous countermeasures, machine learning (ML)-based methods have proven to be an effective means of detecting these attacks, as they are able to derive a classifier from a set of training examples, thus eliminating the need for an explicit definition of the signatures when developing malware detectors. This paper provides a systematic review of ML-based Android malware detection techniques. It critically evaluates 106 carefully selected articles and highlights their strengths and weaknesses as well as potential improvements. Finally, the ML-based methods for detecting source code vulnerabilities are discussed, because it might be more difficult to add security after the app is deployed. Therefore, this paper aims to enable researchers to acquire in-depth knowledge in the field and to identify potential future research and development directions.

AB  - Remote monitoring sensor systems play a significant role in the evaluation and minimization of natural disasters and risk. This article presents a sustainable and real-time early warning system of sensors employed in flash flood prediction by using a rolling forecast model based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Golden Ratio Optimization (GROM) methods. This Early Flood Warning System (EFWS) aims to support decision makers by providing reliable and accurate information and warning about any possible flood events within an efficient lead-time to reduce any damages due to flash floods. In this work, to improve the performance of the EFWS, an ANN forecast model based on a new optimization method, GROM, is developed and compared to the traditional ANN model. Furthermore, due to the lack of literature regarding the optimal ANN structural model for forecasting the flash flood, this paper is one of the first extensive investigations into the impact of using different exogenous variables and parameters on the ANN structure. The effect of using a rolling forecast model compared to fixed model on the accuracy of the forecasts is investigated as well. The results indicate that the rolling ANN forecast model based on GROM successfully improved the model accuracy by 40% compared to the traditional ANN model and by 93.5% compared to the fixed forecast model.

AB  - Social distancing (SD) is an effective measure to prevent the spread of the infectious Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, a lack of spatial awareness may cause unintentional violations of this new measure. Against this backdrop, we propose an active surveillance system to slow the spread of COVID-19 by warning individuals in a region-of-interest. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a vision-based real-time system that can detect SD violations and send non-intrusive audio-visual cues using state-of-the-art deep-learning models. Second, we define a novel critical social density value and show that the chance of SD violation occurrence can be held near zero if the pedestrian density is kept under this value. The proposed system is also ethically fair: it does not record data nor target individuals, and no human supervisor is present during the operation. The proposed system was evaluated across real-world datasets.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution has significantly changed the traditional way of managing supply chains. The applications of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different processes of supply chains have assisted companies to improve their performance. Procurement can be considered a critical process in supply chain management since it can provide novel opportunities for supply chains to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. However, I4.0 applications can be costly and may not be reasonably affordable. Therefore, the benefits of implementing these technologies should be clarified for procurement managers before investing in the digitalization of the procurement process. Despite the importance of this issue, few papers have attempted to address the effects of I4.0 technologies and smart systems in procurement. To fill this gap, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the applications of I4.0 technologies in procurement has been used in this study. By reviewing 70 papers through appropriate keywords, a conceptual framework is developed to classify different value propositions provided by the different applications of I4.0 technologies in procurement processes. Results reveal nine value propositions that can provide a better understanding for the procurement department to analyze the benefits of implementing the related I4.0 technologies in different activities. Finally, findings and future study opportunities are concluded.

VL  - 14

SN  - 1996-1944

AB  - Wood is one of the most fully renewable building materials, so wood instead of non-renewable materials produced from organic energy sources significantly reduces the environmental impact. Construction products can be replenished at the end of their working life and their elements and components deconstructed in a closed-loop manner to act as a material for potential construction. Materials passports (MPs) are instruments for incorporating circular economy principles (CEP) into structures. Material passports (MPs) consider all the building’s life cycle (BLC) steps to ensure that it can be reused and transformed several times. The number of reuse times and the operating life of the commodity greatly influence the environmental effects incorporated. For a new generation of buildings, the developing of an elegant kinetic wooden façade has become a necessity. It represents a multidisciplinary region with different climatic, fiscal, constructional materials, equipment, and programs, and ecology-influencing design processes and decisions. Based on an overview of the material’s environmental profile (MEP) and material passport (MP) definition in the design phase, this article attempts to establish and formulate an analytical analysis of the wood selection process used to produce a kinetic façade. The paper will analyze the importance of environmentally sustainable construction and a harmonious architectural environment to reduce harmful human intervention on the environment. It will examine the use of wooden panels on buildings’ façades as one solution to building impact on the environment. It will show the features of the formation of the wooden exterior of the building. It will also examine modern architecture that enters into a dialogue with the environment, giving unique flexibility to adapt a building. The study finds that new buildings can be easily created today. The concept of building materials passport and the environmental selection of the kinetic wooden façade can be incorporated into the building design process. This will improve the economic and environmental impact of the building on human life.

AB  - Radiative (or far-field) energy replenishment for devices such as smartphones, laptops, robots, and small electric appliances paves the way to autonomous and continuous devices functioning, thus bypassing the need of operation interruptions, human maintenance activities, and replenishment by wired transformers. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using a properly engineered antenna array able to deliver radiative power to devices in need of energy replenishment during their normal and unsupervised activity, whose locations are unknown. Both the case of single and multiple devices needing energy replenishment are addressed. A quantitative proof-of-concept study is carried out to validate the proposed approach. A 3D scenario is simulated to study the case of devices in need of energy replenishment within a standard office environment. Different antenna array configurations are investigated and the corresponding performances benchmarked against a standard installation of recharging antennas. Results confirm the outstanding capability of the proposed approach in terms of confinement and maximization of power transfer. Finally, in this framework, we also propose an efficient communication protocol that is able to manage multiple recharge demand given different operational rules.

AB  - The evolution in knowledge management and crowdsourcing research provides new data-processing capabilities. The availability of both structured and unstructured open data formats offers unforeseen opportunities for analytics processing and advanced decision-making. However, social sciences research is facing advanced, complicated social challenges and problems. The focus of this study is to analyze the contribution of crowdsourcing techniques to the promotion of advanced social sciences research, exploiting open data available from the geographical positioning system (GPS) to analyze human behavior. In our study, we present the conceptual design of a device that, with the help of a global positioning system-data collection device (GPS-DCD), associates behavioral aspects of human life with place. The main contribution of this study is to integrate research in computer science and information systems with that in social science. The prototype system summarized in this work, proves the capacity of crowdsourcing and big data research to facilitate aggregation of microcontent related to human behavior toward improved quality of life and well-being in modern smart cities. Various ethical issues are also discussed to promote the scientific debate on this matter. Our study shows the capacity of emerging technologies to deal with social challenges. This kind of research will gain increased momentum in the future due to the availability of big data and new business models for social platforms.

AB  - More and more digital 3D city models might evolve into spatiotemporal instruments with time as the 4th dimension. For digitizing the current situation, 3D scanning and photography are suitable tools. The spatial future could be integrated using 3D drawings by public space designers and architects. The digital spatial reconstruction of lost historical environments is more complex, expensive and rarely done. Three-dimensional co-creative digital drawing with citizens’ collaboration could be a solution. In 2016, the City of Ghent (Belgium) launched the “3D city game Ghent” project with time as one of the topics, focusing on the reconstruction of disappeared environments. Ghent inhabitants modelled in open-source 3D software and added animated 3D gamification and Transmedia Storytelling, resulting in a 4D web environment and VR/AR/XR applications. This study analyses this low-cost interdisciplinary 3D co-creative process and offers a framework to enable other cities and municipalities to realise a parallel virtual universe (an animated digital twin bringing the past to life). The result of this co-creation is the start of an “Animated Spatial Time Machine” (AniSTMa), a term that was, to the best of our knowledge, never used before. This research ultimately introduces a conceptual 4D space–time diagram with a relation between the current physical situation and a growing number of 3D animated models over time.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Floods have been a major cause of destruction, instigating fatalities and massive damage to the infrastructure and overall economy of the affected country. Flood-related devastation results in the loss of homes, buildings, and critical infrastructure, leaving no means of communication or travel for the people stuck in such disasters. Thus, it is essential to develop systems that can detect floods in a region to provide timely aid and relief to stranded people, save their livelihoods, homes, and buildings, and protect key city infrastructure. Flood prediction and warning systems have been implemented in developed countries, but the manufacturing cost of such systems is too high for developing countries. Remote sensing, satellite imagery, global positioning system, and geographical information systems are currently used for flood detection to assess the flood-related damages. These techniques use neural networks, machine learning, or deep learning methods. However, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) coupled with convolution neural networks have not been explored in these contexts to instigate a swift disaster management response to minimize damage to infrastructure. Accordingly, this paper uses UAV-based aerial imagery as a flood detection method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract flood-related features from the images of the disaster zone. This method is effective in assessing the damage to local infrastructures in the disaster zones. The study area is based on a flood-prone region of the Indus River in Pakistan, where both pre-and post-disaster images are collected through UAVs. For the training phase, 2150 image patches are created by resizing and cropping the source images. These patches in the training dataset train the CNN model to detect and extract the regions where a flood-related change has occurred. The model is tested against both pre-and post-disaster images to validate it, which has positive flood detection results with an accuracy of 91%. Disaster management organizations can use this model to assess the damages to critical city infrastructure and other assets worldwide to instigate proper disaster responses and minimize the damages. This can help with the smart governance of the cities where all emergent disasters are addressed promptly.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The decarbonisation of heating in the United Kingdom is likely to entail both the mass adoption of heat pumps and widespread development of district heating infrastructure. Estimation of the spatially disaggregated heat demand is needed for both electrical distribution network with electrified heating and for the development of district heating. The temporal variation of heat demand is important when considering the operation of district heating, thermal energy storage and electrical grid storage. The difference between the national and urban heat demands profiles will vary due to the type and occupancy of buildings leading to temporal variations which have not been widely surveyed. This paper develops a high-resolution spatiotemporal heat load model for Great Britain (GB: England, Scotland a Wales) by identifying the appropriate datasets, archetype segmentation and characterisation for the domestic and nondomestic building stock. This is applied to a thermal model and calibrated on the local scale using gas consumption statistics. The annual GB heat demand was in close agreement with other estimates and the peak demand was 219 GWth. The urban heat demand was found to have a lower peak to trough ratio than the average national demand profile. This will have important implications for the uptake of heating technologies and design of district heating.

TI  - Optimal Scheduling of Dynamic Pricing Based V2G and G2V Operation in Microgrid Using Improved Elephant Herding Optimization

VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The unpredictable nature of the loads and non-linearity of the components of microgrid systems make optimal scheduling more complex. In this paper, a deterministic optimal load-scheduling problem is developed for microgrids operating in both islanding and grid-connected mode under different energy scenarios. Various cases are considered in this research, based on the interaction and dynamic behavior of the microgrid, considering electric vehicles (EVs) in the scenario. The aim of this research is to minimize the overall cost of microgrid operations. The concept of dynamic pricing has also been introduced in order to optimize the energy cost for the consumers. For ensuring the stability of the microgrids, a load variance index has been considered, and the fuzzy-based approach has been used for cost and load variance minimization to reduce the operation cost without compromising the stability of the microgrid. The grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations of EVs are integrated into the microgrid, which would help in valley filling and peak shaving of the loads during the off-peak and peak hours, respectively. In order to solve the proposed complex combinatorial optimization problem, elephant herding optimization (EHO) is modified and implemented. The performance of the proposed improved EHO (IEHO) is first tested on the latest CEC test functions. The results obtained by IEHO after 100 different trials are compared with the latest published methods and are found to be better based on the average value and the standard deviation for different CEC test functions. In addition, the simulation results obtained by particle swarm optimization (PSO), EHO, and proposed IEHO on a microgrid test system for different scenarios with all cases reveal that the proposed model with a mix of energy resources in the dynamic load dispatch environment bring the maximum benefits of microgrid systems. Furthermore, the results obtained from the simulation verifies that if free trade of power is allowed between the microgrids and the main grid, the process of power generation can be more economical, and further introduction of dynamic pricing into the scenario proves to be even cheaper. The implementation of the G2V and V2G operations of EVs operations in the proposed scenario not only helped in cost minimization but also helped in stabilizing the grid.

AB  - Substantial research is required to ensure that micro-mobility ride sharing provides a better fulfilment of user needs. This study proposes a novel crowdsourcing model for the ride-sharing system where light vehicles such as scooters and bikes are crowdsourced. The proposed model is expected to solve the problem of charging and maintaining a large number of light vehicles where these efforts will be the responsibility of the crowd of suppliers. The proposed model consists of three entities: suppliers, customers, and a management party responsible for receiving, renting, booking, and demand matching with offered resources. It can allow suppliers to define the location of their private e-scooters/e-bikes and the period of time they are available for rent. Using a dataset of over 9 million e-scooter trips in Austin, Texas, we ran an agent-based simulation six times using three maximum battery ranges (i.e., 35, 45, and 60 km) and different numbers of e-scooters (e.g., 50 and 100) at each origin. Computational results show that the proposed model is promising and might be advantageous to shift the charging and maintenance efforts to a crowd of suppliers.

TI  - Workflow for Off-Site Bridge Inspection Using Automatic Damage Detection-Case Study of the Pahtajokk Bridge

VL  - 13
IS  - 14
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - For the inspection of structures, particularly bridges, it is becoming common to replace humans with autonomous systems that use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). In this paper, a framework for autonomous bridge inspection using a UAV is proposed with a four-step workflow: (a) data acquisition with an efficient UAV flight path, (b) computer vision comprising training, testing and validation of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), (c) point cloud generation using intelligent hierarchical dense structure from motion (DSfM), and (d) damage quantification. This workflow starts with planning the most efficient flight path that allows for capturing of the minimum number of images required to achieve the maximum accuracy for the desired defect size, then followed by bridge and damage recognition. Three types of autonomous detection are used: masking the background of the images, detecting areas of potential damage, and pixel-wise damage segmentation. Detection of bridge components by masking extraneous parts of the image, such as vegetation, sky, roads or rivers, can improve the 3D reconstruction in the feature detection and matching stages. In addition, detecting damaged areas involves the UAV capturing close-range images of these critical regions, and damage segmentation facilitates damage quantification using 2D images. By application of DSfM, a denser and more accurate point cloud can be generated for these detected areas, and aligned to the overall point cloud to create a digital model of the bridge. Then, this generated point cloud is evaluated in terms of outlier noise, and surface deviation. Finally, damage that has been detected is quantified and verified, based on the point cloud generated using the Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) method. The results indicate this workflow for autonomous bridge inspection has potential.

AB  - In the last decade, technological advancements in the cyber-physical system have set the basis for real-time and context-aware services to ease human lives. The citizens, especially travelers, want to experience a safe, healthy, and timely journey to their destination. Smart and on-ground real-time traffic analysis helps authorities further improve decision-making to ensure safe and convenient traveling. In this paper, we proposed a transport-control model that exploits cyber-physical systems (CPS) and sensor-technology to continuously monitor and mine the big city data for smart decision-making. The system makes use of travel-time, traffic intensity, vehicle’s speed, and current road conditions to construct a weighted city graph representing the road network. Traditional graph algorithms with efficient implementation technologies are employed to respond to commuters’ and authorities’ needs in order to achieve a smart and optimum transportation system. To efficiently process the incoming big data streams, the proposed architecture uses the Apache GraphX tool with several parallel processing nodes, along with Spark and Hadoop that ultimately provide better performance against various state-of-the-art solutions. The system is thoroughly evaluated in terms of system throughput and processing time, revealing that the proposed system is efficient, robust, and scalable.

AB  - Over the years, and with the emergence of various technological innovations, the relevance of automatic learning methods has increased exponentially, and they now play a key role in society. More specifically, Deep Learning (DL), with the ability to recognize audio, image, and time series predictions, has helped to solve various types of problems. This paper aims to introduce a new theory, Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), that applies to stock market prediction. HTM is based on the biological functions of the brain as well as its learning mechanism. The results are of significant relevance and show a low percentage of errors in the predictions made over time. It can be noted that the learning curve of the algorithm is fast, identifying trends in the stock market for all seven data universes using the same network. Although the algorithm suffered at the time a pandemic was declared, it was able to adapt and return to good predictions. HTM proved to be a good continuous learning method for predicting time series datasets.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Smart city networks involve many applications that impose specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, thus representing a challenging scenario for network management. Solutions aiming to guarantee QoS support have not been deployed in large-scale networks. Traffic classification is a mechanism used to manage different aspects, including QoS requirements. However, conventional traffic classification methods, such as the port-based method, are inefficient because of their inability to handle dynamic port allocation and encryption. Traffic classification using machine learning has gained research interest as an alternative method to achieve high performance. In fact, machine learning embeds intelligence into network functions, thus improving network management. In this study, we apply machine learning algorithms to predict network traffic classification. We apply four supervised learning algorithms: support vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and decision tree. We also apply a port-based method of traffic classification based on applications’ popular assigned port numbers. Then, we compare the results of this method to those obtained from the machine learning algorithms. The evaluation results indicate that the decision tree algorithm provides the highest average accuracy among the evaluated algorithms, at 99.18%. Moreover, network traffic classification using machine learning provides more accurate results and higher performance than the port-based method.

SN  - 2412-3811

AB  - Smart cities aim to integrate technological development with different functions/components such as mobility, management of energy, natural resources, water, and the waste cycle, air quality, land use, service network, construction, but also the economy, social participation, increased employment, and citizen safety. It includes a series of coordinated and integrated social, environmental and economic interventions to enhance human capital, reduce environmental impacts and solve ecological emergencies. The holistic approach is particular to smart cities, including several mobility aspects in the main European classifications. In particular, the development of smart cities depends on several factors related to transport supply (i.e., mobility service, infrastructure details, ICT) and demand (socio-demographic aspects), and the size of the city. This paper provides an overview of the development of smart cities by defining a methodology that allows the identification of criteria for determining the optimisation of urban mobility with a particular interest in the development of future autonomous mobility. The analysis of current literature on the concept of smart cities and new mobility technologies made it possible to analyse the compatibility between them and possible criticalities. The definition of criteria lays the groundwork for future research steps focused on the application of multicriteria analysis.

IS  - 14
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Citizens are expected to require the growth of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) -based applications to improve public and private services. According to their concept, smart cities seek to improve the efficiency, reliability, and resilience of these services. Consequently, this paper searches for a new vision for resolving problems related to the quick deployment of a wireless sensor network (WSN) by using a sizing model and considering the capacity and coverage of the concentrators. Additionally, three different routing models of these technology resources are presented as alternatives for each WSN deployment to ensure connectivity between smart meters and hubs required for smart metering. On the other hand, these solutions must reduce costs when this type of wireless communication network is deployed. The present work proposes various optimization models that consider the physical and network layers in order to integrate different wireless communication technologies, thus reducing costs in terms of the minimum number of data aggregation points. Using a heterogeneous wireless network can reduce resource costs and energy consumption in comparison to a single cellular technology, as proposed in previous works. This work proposes a sizing model and three different models for routing wireless networks. In each case, constraints are evaluated and can be associated with different real-world scenarios. This document provides an optimization model that encompasses all of the proposed constraints; due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, this would require a heuristic technique.

SN  - 2305-6290

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to present what the Industry 5.0 phenomenon means in the supply chain context. A systematic literature review method was used to get evidence from the current knowledge linked to this theme. The results have evidenced a strong gap related to Industry 5.0 approaches for the supply chain field. Forty-one (41) publications, including conference and journal papers, have been found in the literature. Nineteen (19) words, which were grouped in four (4) clusters, have been identified in the data analysis. This was the basis to form the four (4) constructs of Industry 5.0: Industry Strategy, Innovation and Technologies, Society and Sustainability, and Transition Issues. Then, an alignment with the supply chain context was proposed, being the basis for the incipient Supply Chain 5.0 framework and its research agenda. Industry 5.0 is still in an embryonic and ideal stage. The literature is scarce and many other concepts and discoveries are going to emerge. Although this literature review is based on few available sources, it provides insightful and novel concepts related to Industry 5.0 in the supply chain context. Moreover, it presents a clear set of constructs and a structured research agenda to encourage researchers in deploying further conceptual and empirical works linked to the subject herein explored. Organizations’ leadership, policymakers, and other practitioners involved in supply chains, and mainly those currently working with Industry 4.0 initiatives, can benefit from this research by having clear guidance regarding the dimensions needed to structurally design and implement an Industry 5.0 strategy. This article adds valuable insights to researchers and practitioners, by approaching the newest and revolutionary concept of the Industry 5.0 phenomenon in the supply chain context, which is still an unexplored theme.

TI  - Applying the FFP Approach to Wider Land Management Functions
T2  - Land

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 7
SN  - 2073-445X

AB  - The initial focus of implementing the Fit-for-Purpose Land Administration (FFPLA) methodology was to address the significant, global security of tenure divide. We argue that this land tenure methodology is proving successful in scaling up the provision of security of tenure for developing countries. The increasing adoption of the FFPLA methodology has also opened opportunities and provided flexibility for the innovative use of emerging technologies to accelerate the global roll out of security of tenure, such as the use of autonomous drones and machine learning techniques applied to image analysis. Despite wider adoption of participatory approaches to the recording of land tenure, similar FFP solutions for the other components of land administration services (land value, land use and land development) and land management functions are still evolving. This article therefore explores how the FFP approach can be applied to this wider set of land administration services and land management functions. A case study methodology, using three case studies, is used to determine if the case study approaches meet the FFP criteria. The focus is on the urban environment, drawing mostly from experiences and case studies in the Urban, Disaster Risk Management, Resilience &amp; Land Global Practice of the World Bank. These opportunities for the wider application of the FFP approach and associated principles are being triggered by the innovative use of emerging new data capture technology developments. The paper examines the innovative use of these emerging technologies to identify a common set of data capture techniques and geospatial data that can be shared across a range of urban land administration and management activities. Finally, the paper discusses how individual land projects could be integrated into a more holistic land administration and management program approach and deliver a significant set of socio-economic benefits more quickly. It is found that the FFP approach can be more widely adopted across land administration and land management and in many cases can share a common set of geospatial data. The authors argue that the wider adoption and integration of these new, innovative FFP urban management approaches will require a significant cultural, professional, and institutional change from all stakeholders. Future work will explore more deeply these institutional weaknesses, which will provide a basis for guidance to the World Bank and similar institutions.

AB  - The scope of blockchain technology, initially associated with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, is greater due to the multiple applications in various disciplines. Its use in accounting lies mainly in the fact that it reduces risks and the eventuality of fraud, eliminates human error, promotes efficiency, and increases transparency and reliability. This means that different economic sectors assume it as a recording and management instrument. The aim is to examine current and emerging research lines at a global level on blockchain technology for secure accounting management. The evolution of the publication of the number of articles between 2016 and 2020 was analyzed. Statistical and mathematical techniques were applied to a sample of 1130 records from the Scopus database. The data uncovered a polynomial trend in this period. The seven main lines of work were identified: blockchain, network security, information management, digital storage, edge computing, commerce, and the Internet of Things. The ten most outstanding emerging research lines are detected. This study provides the past and future thematic axes on this incipient field of knowledge, which is a tool for decision-making by academics, researchers, and directors of research investment programs.

AB  - This study aimed to identify: (i) the relevant applications based on information technologies and requiring smart cities’ infrastructure to facilitate the mobility of older adults in URBAN SPACES; (ii) the type of data being used by the proposed applications; (iii) the maturity level of these applications; and (iv) the barriers TO their dissemination. An electronic search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases, combining relevant keywords. Then, titles and abstracts were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the full texts of the eligible articles were retrieved and screened for inclusion. A total of 28 articles were included. These articles report smart cities’ applications to facilitate the mobility of older adults using different types of sensing devices. The number of included articles is reduced when compared with the total number of articles related to smart cities, which means that the mobility of older adults it is still a not significant topic within the research on smart cities’. Although most of the included studies aimed the implementation of specific applications, these were still in an early stage of development, without the assessment of potential end-users. This is an important research gap since it makes difficult the creation of market-oriented solutions. Another research gap is the integration of knowledge generated by other research topics related to smart cities and smart mobility. Consequently, important issues (e.g., user privacy, data standardization and integration, Internet of Things implementation, and sensors’ characteristics) were poorly addressed by the included studies.

AB  - A preventive maintenance embedded for the fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing technique is proposed. A monitoring and control integrated system is developed to reduce the risk of having thermal degradation on the fabricated products and prevent printing failure; nozzle clogging. As for the monitoring program, the proposed temporal neural network with a two-stage sliding window strategy (TCN-TS-SW) is utilized to accurately provide the predicted thermal values of the nozzle tip. These estimated thermal values are utilized to be the stimulus of the control system that performs countermeasures to prevent the anomaly that is bound to happen. The performance of the proposed TCN-TS-SW is presented in three case studies. The first scenario is when the proposed system outperforms the other existing machine learning algorithms namely multi-look back LSTM, GRU, LSTM, and the generic TCN architecture in terms of obtaining the highest training accuracy and lowest training loss. TCN-TS-SW also outperformed the mentioned algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy measured by the performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R2 scores. In the second case, the effect of varying the window length and the changing length of the forecasting horizon. This experiment reveals the optimized parameters for the network to produce an accurate nozzle thermal estimation.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Reducing energy waste is one of the primary concerns facing Remote Industrial Plants (RIP) and, in particular, the accommodations and operational plants located in remote areas. With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to attack the health of workforce, managing the balance between energy efficiency and Occupation Health and Safety (OHS) in the workplace becomes another great challenge for the RIP. Maintaining this balance is difficult mainly because a full awareness of the OHS will generally consume more energy while reducing the energy cost may lead to a less effective OHS, and the existing literature has not seen a system that is designed for the RIPs to conserve energy usage and improve workforce OHS simultaneously. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose an AI Empowered Cyber Physical Ecosystem (AECPE) solution for the RIPs, which integrates Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), artificial intelligence, and mobile networks. The preliminary results of lab experiments and field tests proved that the AECPE was able to help industries reduce the corporate annual energy cost that is worth millions of dollars, optimise the environmental conditions, and improve OHS for all workers and stakeholders. The implementation of the AECPE can result in efficient energy usage, reduced wastage and emissions, environment-friendly operations, and improved social reputation of the industries.

AB  - A repeatable and deterministic non-random weight initialization method in convolutional layers of neural networks examined with the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FSGM). Using the FSGM approach as a technique to measure the initialization effect with controlled distortions in transferred learning, varying the dataset numerical similarity. The focus is on convolutional layers with induced earlier learning through the use of striped forms for image classification. Which provided a higher performing accuracy in the first epoch, with improvements of between 3–5% in a well known benchmark model, and also ~10% in a color image dataset (MTARSI2), using a dissimilar model architecture. The proposed method is robust to limit optimization approaches like Glorot/Xavier and He initialization. Arguably the approach is within a new category of weight initialization methods, as a number sequence substitution of random numbers, without a tether to the dataset. When examined under the FGSM approach with transferred learning, the proposed method when used with higher distortions (numerically dissimilar datasets), is less compromised against the original cross-validation dataset, at ~31% accuracy instead of ~9%. This is an indication of higher retention of the original fitting in transferred learning.

PY  - 2021

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) was amplified, during the past decades, in order to tackle the challenges related to energy demands and CO2 increases. Recently, many initiatives have been taken by promoting the deployment and the usage of micro-grids (MG) in buildings, as decentralized systems, for energy production. However, the variable nature of RESs and the limited size of energy storage systems require the deployment of adaptive control strategies for efficient energy balance. In this paper, a generalized predictive control (GPC) strategy is introduced for energy management (EM) in MG systems. Its main objective is to efficiently connect the electricity generators and consumers in order to predict the most suitable actions for energy flow management. In fact, based on energy production and consumption profiles as well as the availability of energy storage systems, the proposed EM will be able to select the best suitable energy source for supplying the building’s loads. It will efficiently manage the usage of energy storage and the utility grid while maximizing RESs power generation. Simulations have been conducted, using real-sitting scenarios, and results are presented to validate the proposed predictive control approach by showing its effectiveness for MG systems control.

TI  - IoT-Enabled Solid Waste Management in Smart Cities

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm plays a vital role for improving smart city applications by tracking and managing city processes in real-time. One of the most significant issues associated with smart city applications is solid waste management, which has a negative impact on our society’s health and the environment. The traditional waste management process begins with waste created by city residents and disposed of in garbage bins at the source. Municipal department trucks collect garbage and move it to recycling centers on a fixed schedule. Municipalities and waste management companies fail to keep up with outdoor containers, making it impossible to determine when to clean them or when they are full. This work proposes an IoT-enabled solid waste management system for smart cities to overcome the limitations of the traditional waste management systems. The proposed architecture consists of two types of end sensor nodes: PBLMU (Public Bin Level Monitoring Unit) and HBLMU (Home Bin Level Monitoring Unit), which are used to track bins in public and residential areas, respectively. The PBLMUs and HBLMUs measure the unfilled level of the trash bin and its location data, process it, and transmit it to a central monitoring station for storage and analysis. An intelligent Graphical User Interface (GUI) enables the waste collection authority to view and evaluate the unfilled status of each trash bin. To validate the proposed system architecture, the following significant experiments were conducted: (a) Eight trash bins were equipped with PBLMUs and connected to a LoRaWAN network and another eight trash bins were equipped with HBLMUs and connected to a Wi-Fi network. The trash bins were filled with wastes at different levels and the corresponding unfilled levels of every trash bin were monitored through the intelligent GUI. (b) An experimental setup was arranged to measure the sleep current and active current contributions of a PBLMU to estimate its average current consumption. (c) The life expectancy of a PBLMU was estimated as approximately 70 days under hypothetical conditions.

AB  - Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for remote sensing has the advantages of high flexibility, convenient operation, low cost, and wide application range. It fills the need for rapid acquisition of high-resolution aerial images in modern photogrammetry applications. Due to the insufficient parallaxes and the computation-intensive process, dense real-time reconstruction for large terrain scenes is a considerable challenge. To address these problems, we proposed a novel SLAM-based MVS (Multi-View-Stereo) approach, which can incrementally generate a dense 3D (three-dimensional) model of the terrain by using the continuous image stream during the flight. The pipeline of the proposed methodology starts with pose estimation based on SLAM algorithm. The tracked frames were then selected by a novel scene-adaptive keyframe selection method to construct a sliding window frame-set. This was followed by depth estimation using a flexible search domain approach, which can improve accuracy without increasing the iterate time or memory consumption. The whole system proposed in this study was implemented on the embedded GPU based on an UAV platform. We proposed a highly parallel and memory-efficient CUDA-based depth computing architecture, enabling the system to achieve good real-time performance. The evaluation experiments were carried out in both simulation and real-world environments. A virtual large terrain scene was built using the Gazebo simulator. The simulated UAV equipped with an RGB-D camera was used to obtain synthetic evaluation datasets, which were divided by flight altitudes (800-, 1000-, 1200 m) and terrain height difference (100-, 200-, 300 m). In addition, the system has been extensively tested on various types of real scenes. Comparison with commercial 3D reconstruction software is carried out to evaluate the precision in real-world data. According to the results on the synthetic datasets, over 93.462% of the estimation with absolute error distance of less then 0.9%. In the real-world dataset captured at 800 m flight height, more than 81.27% of our estimated point cloud are less then 5 m difference with the results of Photoscan. All evaluation experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

AB  - The sewerage system is a primary element of a city and is responsible for the congestion of both rain and gray water from homes and industries. It is essential to have a monitoring system and a plan to perform prior expansion in the sewerage management system, to avoid massive disruption. However, there is no monitoring system in several overpopulated cities in the world, and the expansion process faces myriad difficulties and takes much time. This paper presents a model for an intelligent sewerage management system that provides real-time monitoring without any major changes to the previous system, using water sensors, a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) module, and a micro-controller. The condition of the sewerage acts as an input through the sensors; then, the microcontroller stores the value in the cloud and performs waste collection depending on the current situation. Meanwhile, after processing, the information reaches the monitoring system. Various trial installations of the proposed system have shown that it enables real-time monitoring to observe live conditions and helps to prevent sewerage blockage caused by solid waste. Considering a deficient cost model, this system can intensify the performance of poorly managed sewerage systems.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Despite an improvement in worldwide numbers, road traffic crashes still cause social, psychological, and financial damage and cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. However, none of the current commercial or open-source navigation systems contain spatial information about road traffic crash hot spots. By developing an algorithm that can adequately predict such spatial patterns, we can bridge these still existing gaps in road traffic safety. To that end, geographically weighted regression and regression tree models were fitted with five uncorrelated (environmental and socioeconomic) road traffic crash predictor variables. Significant regional differences in adverse weather conditions were identified; Slovenia lies at the conjunction of different climatic zones characterized by differences in weather phenomena, which further modify traffic safety. Thus, more attention to speed limits, safety distance, and other vehicles entering and leaving the system could be expected. In order to further improve road safety and better implement globally sustainable development goals, studies with applicative solutions are urgently needed. Modern vehicle-to-vehicle communication technologies could soon support drivers with real-time traffic data and thus potentially prevent road network crashes.

AB  - Many countries are contemplating a smart sustainable approach to the next generation of cities. However, there are many obstacles to achieve this objective, such as planning and implementing sustainable dimensions. The aim of this study is to (1) investigate the level of importance of the different sustainable dimensions in Riyadh and (2) distinguish the effect of two proposed solutions on dimensions for a smart approach to rank the proposed solutions based on their level of impact in Riyadh. In this study, the sustainability dimensions are six main measurable criteria that include Smart Economy, Smart Mobility, Smart Environment, Smart People, Smart Governance, and Smart Living. The research also utilized a multi-step methodology that involved an expert-based survey and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) to assess the performance indices of components for a smart method in Riyadh and evaluate the proposed solutions, namely, the construction of a metro network to link all of Riyadh to align with the government objective for 2030, and encouraging the construction of smart buildings through Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. The results show that Smart People, Smart Mobility, and Smart Living were the three most important sustainable indices for Riyadh. Furthermore, the results of the proposed construction projects illustrate that both projects had the same impact on five of the six sustainable indices, but that the metro project had a significantly higher impact on one of the indices. The study is also envisaged to aid decision-makers in prioritizing the upcoming public construction projects. Finally, this is the first study of its kind to address ranking real public construction projects in terms of sustainable development.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - As Internet of Things (IoT) networks expand globally with an annual increase of active devices, providing better safeguards to threats is becoming more prominent. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is the most viable solution that mitigates the threats of cyberattacks. Given the many constraints of the ever-changing network environment of IoT devices, an effective yet lightweight IDS is required to detect cyber anomalies and categorize various cyberattacks. Additionally, most publicly available datasets used for research do not reflect the recent network behaviors, nor are they made from IoT networks. To address these issues, in this paper, we have the following contributions: (1) we create a dataset from IoT networks, namely, the Center for Cyber Defense (CCD) IoT Network Intrusion Dataset V1 (CCD-INID-V1); (2) we propose a hybrid lightweight form of IDS—an embedded model (EM) for feature selection and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for attack detection and classification. The proposed method has two models: (a) RCNN: Random Forest (RF) is combined with CNN and (b) XCNN: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is combined with CNN. RF and XGBoost are the embedded models to reduce less impactful features. (3) We attempt anomaly (binary) classifications and attack-based (multiclass) classifications on CCD-INID-V1 and two other IoT datasets, the detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT dataset (Balot) and the CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 dataset (DoH20), to explore the effectiveness of these learning-based security models. Using RCNN, we achieved an Area under the Receiver Characteristic Operator (ROC) Curve (AUC) score of 0.956 with a runtime of 32.28 s on CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 71.46 s on Balot, and 0.986 with a runtime of 35.45 s on DoH20. Using XCNN, we achieved an AUC score of 0.998 with a runtime of 51.38 s for CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 72.12 s for Balot, and 0.999 with a runtime of 72.91 s for DoH20. Compared to KNN, XCNN required 86.98% less computational time, and RCNN required 91.74% less computational time to achieve equal or better accurate anomaly detections. We find XCNN and RCNN are consistently efficient and handle scalability well; in particular, 1000 times faster than KNN when dealing with a relatively larger dataset-Balot. Finally, we highlight RCNN and XCNN’s ability to accurately detect anomalies with a significant reduction in computational time. This advantage grants flexibility for the IDS placement strategy. Our IDS can be placed at a central server as well as resource-constrained edge devices. Our lightweight IDS requires low train time and hence decreases reaction time to zero-day attacks.

SN  - 2073-431X

AB  - With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, more and more smart devices are connected to the Internet. Since these devices were designed for better connections with each other, very limited security mechanisms have been considered. It would be costly to develop separate security mechanisms for the diverse behaviors in different devices. Given new and changing devices and attacks, it would be helpful if the characteristics of diverse device types could be dynamically learned for better protection. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to device type identification through network traffic analysis for anomaly detection in IoT. Firstly, the characteristics of different device types are learned from their generated network packets using supervised learning methods. Secondly, by learning important features from selected device types, we further compare the effects of unsupervised learning methods including One-class SVM, Isolation forest, and autoencoders for dimensionality reduction. Finally, we evaluate the performance of anomaly detection by transfer learning with autoencoders. In our experiments on real data in the target factory, the best performance of device type identification can be achieved by XGBoost with an accuracy of 97.6%. When adopting autoencoders for learning features from the network packets in Modbus TCP protocol, the best F1 score of 98.36% can be achieved. Comparable performance of anomaly detection can be achieved when using autoencoders for transfer learning from the reference dataset in the literature to our target site. This shows the potential of the proposed approach for automatic anomaly detection in smart factories. Further investigation is needed to verify the proposed approach using different types of devices in different IoT environments.

AB  - Rapid advances that improve flood management have facilitated the disaster response by providing first aid services, finding safe routes, maintaining communication and developing flood maps. Different technologies such as image processing, satellite imagery, synthetic imagery and integrated approaches have been extensively analysed in the literature for disaster operations. There is a need to review cutting-edge technologies for flood management. This paper presents a review of the latest advancements in the flood management domain based on image processing, artificial intelligence and integrated approaches with a focus on post-disaster. It answers the following research questions: (1) What are the latest developments in image processing for flood management in a post-disaster scenario? (2) What are the latest techniques for flood management based on artificial intelligence in a post-disaster scenario? (3) What are the existing gaps in the selected technologies for post-disaster? (4) How can the authorities improve the existing post-disaster management operation with cutting-edge technologies? A novel framework has been proposed to optimise flood management with the application of a holistic approach.

PY  - 2021

IS  - 14
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being extensively tested on public roads in several states in the USA, such as California, Florida, Nevada, and Texas. AV utilization is expected to increase into the future, given rapid advancement and development in sensing and navigation technologies. This will eventually lead to a decline in human driving. AVs are generally believed to mitigate crash frequency, although the repercussion of AVs on crash severity is ambiguous. For the data-driven and transparent deployment of AVs in California, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (CA DMV) commissioned AV manufacturers to draft and publish reports on disengagements and crashes. This study performed a comprehensive assessment of CA DMV data from 2014 to 2019 from a safety standpoint, and some trends were discerned. The results show that decrement in automated disengagements does not necessarily imply an improvement in AV technology. Contributing factors to the crash severity of an AV are not clearly defined. To further understand crash severity in AVs, the features and issues with data are identified and discussed using different machine learning techniques. The CA DMV accident report data were utilized to develop a variety of crash AV severity models focusing on the injury for all crash typologies. Performance metrics were discussed, and the bagging classifier model exhibited the best performance among different candidate models. Additionally, the study identified potential issues with the CA DMV data reporting protocol, which is imperative to share with the research community. Recommendations are provided to enhance the existing reports and append new domains.

AB  - Over recent years, massive open online courses (MOOCs) have gained increasing popularity in the field of online education. Students with different needs and learning specificities are able to attend a wide range of specialized online courses offered by universities and educational institutions. As a result, large amounts of data regarding students’ demographic characteristics, activity patterns, and learning performances are generated and stored in institutional repositories on a daily basis. Unfortunately, a key issue in MOOCs is low completion rates, which directly affect student success. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for educational institutions and faculty members to find more effective practices and reduce non-completer ratios. In this context, the main purpose of the present study is to employ a plethora of state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting student dropout in a MOOC for smart city professionals at an early stage. The experimental results show that accuracy exceeds 96% based on data collected during the first week of the course, thus enabling effective intervention strategies and support actions.

AB  - Sustainable development can be attained at a microlevel and having smart campuses around the world presents an opportunity to achieve city-wide smartness. In the process of attaining smartness on campuses, the elements requiring attention must be investigated. There are many publications on smart campuses, and this investigation used the bibliometric analysis method to identify such publications produced over the last decade. A matrix of 578 nodes and 3217 edges was developed from 285 publications on smart campus construction and procurement. Fifteen cluster themes were produced from the bibliometric analysis. The findings revealed that China contributed 48.4% of all published articles on the smart campus. The findings presented a framework from the cluster themes under the four broad infrastructure areas of building construction or repurposing, technology and IT network, continuous improvement, and smart learning and teaching management. The implications of the findings identified that IT project management, traditional procurement strategy, and standard forms of contracts such as the New Engineering Contract (NEC) and the Joint Contract Tribunal (JCT) are applicable in the procurement of smart cities.

AB  - The world is moving rapidly from carbon-producing vehicles to green transportation systems. Electric vehicles (EV) are a big step towards a friendly mode of transport. With the constant rise in the number of electric vehicles, we need a widespread and seamless charging infrastructure that supports seamless charging and billing. Some users generate electricity using solar panels and charge their electric vehicles. In contrast, some use charging stations, and they pay for vehicle charging. This raises the question of trust and transparency. There are many countries where laws are not strictly enforced to prevent fraud in payment systems. One of the preeminent problems presently existing with any of the trading systems is the lack of transparency. The service provider can overcharge the customer. Blockchain is a modern-day solution that mitigates trust and privacy issues. We have proposed a peer-to-peer energy trading and charging payment system for electric vehicles based on blockchain technology. Users who have excess electricity which they can sell to the charging stations through smart contracts. Electric vehicle users can pay the charging bills through electronic wallets. We have developed the electric vehicle’s automatic-payment system using the open-source platform Hyperledger fabric. The proposed system will reduce human interaction and increase trust, transparency, and privacy among EV participants. We have analyzed the resource utilization and also performed average transaction latency and throughput evaluation. This system can be helpful for the policymakers of smart cities.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a new technological world connecting billions of devices. Despite providing several benefits, the heterogeneous nature and the extensive connectivity of the devices make it a target of different cyberattacks that result in data breach and financial loss. There is a severe need to secure the IoT environment from such attacks. In this paper, an SDN-enabled deep-learning-driven framework is proposed for threats detection in an IoT environment. The state-of-the-art Cuda-deep neural network, gated recurrent unit (Cu- DNNGRU), and Cuda-bidirectional long short-term memory (Cu-BLSTM) classifiers are adopted for effective threat detection. We have performed 10 folds cross-validation to show the unbiasedness of results. The up-to-date publicly available CICIDS2018 data set is introduced to train our hybrid model. The achieved accuracy of the proposed scheme is 99.87%, with a recall of 99.96%. Furthermore, we compare the proposed hybrid model with Cuda-Gated Recurrent Unit, Long short term memory (Cu-GRULSTM) and Cuda-Deep Neural Network, Long short term memory (Cu- DNNLSTM), as well as with existing benchmark classifiers. Our proposed mechanism achieves impressive results in terms of accuracy, F1-score, precision, speed efficiency, and other evaluation metrics.

AB  - Since its emergence in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has swept through many cities around the world, claiming millions of lives and causing major socio-economic impacts. The pandemic occurred at an important historical juncture when smart solutions and technologies have become ubiquitous in many cities. Against this background, in this review, we examine how smart city solutions and technologies have contributed to resilience by enhancing planning, absorption, recovery, and adaptation abilities. For this purpose, we reviewed 147 studies that have discussed issues related to the use of smart solutions and technologies during the pandemic. The results were synthesized under four themes, namely, planning and preparation, absorption, recovery, and adaptation. This review shows that investment in smart city initiatives can enhance the planning and preparation ability. In addition, the adoption of smart solutions and technologies can, among other things, enhance the capacity of cities to predict pandemic patterns, facilitate an integrated and timely response, minimize or postpone transmission of the virus, provide support to overstretched sectors, minimize supply chain disruption, ensure continuity of basic services, and offer solutions for optimizing city operations. These are promising results that demonstrate the utility of smart solutions for enhancing resilience. However, it should be noted that realizing this potential hinges on careful attention to important issues and challenges related to privacy and security, access to open-source data, technological affordance, legal barriers, technological feasibility, and citizen engagement. Despite this, this review shows that further development of smart city initiatives can provide unprecedented opportunities for enhancing resilience to the pandemic and similar future events.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The rapid development and widespread use of information and telecommunication technologies do not mitigate, in many situations, information exclusion, nor the physical isolation of people—mainly that of the elderly living in remote locations, whose mobile network coverage is deficient or non-existent, preventing them from accessing health care, be it routine follow-up procedures or emergencies. Addressing this, we raise the question that guides our study: how can we monitor the elderly’s residence and health conditions, detect falls, and track their movement in the vicinity of their homes in a non-intrusive manner? To answer this question, we present a system prototype that uses affordable, low-cost, and low-energy equipment with media and data processing, supported by LoRa (Long Range) and ESP32 microcontrollers, coupling several sensors. As a result, it is possible to monitor sensors that predict and detect falls or other risk events for the user, e.g., fire, with authorized persons and entities, family members, civil protection, and security forces accessing the gathered data, assuring their security. We conclude that the system could decisively improve people’s quality of life, particularly those of the elderly who live in remote places with greater vulnerability.

AB  - Urbanization is a big concern for both developed and developing countries in recent years. People shift themselves and their families to urban areas for the sake of better education and a modern lifestyle. Due to rapid urbanization, cities are facing huge challenges, one of which is waste management, as the volume of waste is directly proportional to the people living in the city. The municipalities and the city administrations use the traditional wastage classification techniques which are manual, very slow, inefficient and costly. Therefore, automatic waste classification and management is essential for the cities that are being urbanized for the better recycling of waste. Better recycling of waste gives the opportunity to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills by reducing the need to collect new raw material. In this paper, the idea of a real-time smart waste classification model is presented that uses a hybrid approach to classify waste into various classes. Two machine learning models, a multilayer perceptron and multilayer convolutional neural network (ML-CNN), are implemented. The multilayer perceptron is used to provide binary classification, i.e., metal or non-metal waste, and the CNN identifies the class of non-metal waste. A camera is placed in front of the waste conveyor belt, which takes a picture of the waste and classifies it. Upon successful classification, an automatic hand hammer is used to push the waste into the assigned labeled bucket. Experiments were carried out in a real-time environment with image segmentation. The training, testing, and validation accuracy of the purposed model was 0.99% under different training batches with different input features.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Sign languages are the main visual communication medium between hard-hearing people and their societies. Similar to spoken languages, they are not universal and vary from region to region, but they are relatively under-resourced. Arabic sign language (ArSL) is one of these languages that has attracted increasing attention in the research community. However, most of the existing and available works on sign language recognition systems focus on manual gestures, ignoring other non-manual information needed for other language signals such as facial expressions. One of the main challenges of not considering these modalities is the lack of suitable datasets. In this paper, we propose a new multi-modality ArSL dataset that integrates various types of modalities. It consists of 6748 video samples of fifty signs performed by four signers and collected using Kinect V2 sensors. This dataset will be freely available for researchers to develop and benchmark their techniques for further advancement of the field. In addition, we evaluated the fusion of spatial and temporal features of different modalities, manual and non-manual, for sign language recognition using the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. This fusion boosted the accuracy of the recognition system at the signer-independent mode by 3.6% compared with manual gestures.

AB  - Information security is considered one of the most important issues in various infrastructures related to the field of data communication where most of the modern studies focus on finding effective and low-weight secure approaches. Digital watermarking is a trend in security techniques that hides data by using data embedding and data extraction processes. Watermarking technology is integrated into different frames without adding an overheard as in the conventional encryption. Therefore, it is efficient to be used in data encryption for applications that run over limited resources such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, different digital watermarking algorithms and approaches are presented. Additionally, watermarking requirements and challenges are illustrated in detail. Moreover, the common architecture of the watermarking system is described. Furthermore, IoT technology and its challenges are highlighted. Finally, the paper provides the motivations, objectives and applications of the recent secure watermarking techniques in IoT and summarises them into one table. In addition, the paper highlights the potential to apply the modified watermark algorithms to secure IoT networks.

AB  - Solar photovoltaic (PV) is one of the prominent sustainable energy sources which shares a greater percentage of the energy generated from renewable resources. As the need for solar energy has risen tremendously in the last few decades, monitoring technologies have received considerable attention in relation to performance enhancement. Recently, the solar PV monitoring system has been integrated with a wireless platform that comprises data acquisition from various sensors and nodes through wireless data transmission. However, several issues could affect the performance of solar PV monitoring, such as large data management, signal interference, long-range data transmission, and security. Therefore, this paper comprehensively reviews the progress of several solar PV-based monitoring technologies focusing on various data processing modules and data transmission protocols. Each module and transmission protocol-based monitoring technology is investigated with regard to type, design, implementations, specifications, and limitations. The critical discussion and analysis are carried out with respect to configurations, parameters monitored, software, platform, achievements, and suggestions. Moreover, various key issues and challenges are explored to identify the existing research gaps. Finally, this review delivers selective proposals for future research works. All the highlighted insights of this review will hopefully lead to increased efforts toward the enhancement of the monitoring technologies in future sustainable solar PV applications.

TI  - Subjectively Measured Streetscape Perceptions to Inform Urban Design Strategies for Shanghai
T2  - ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 8
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Recently, many new studies applying computer vision (CV) to street view imagery (SVI) datasets to objectively extract the view indices of various streetscape features such as trees to proxy urban scene qualities have emerged. However, human perception (e.g., imageability) have a subtle relationship to visual elements that cannot be fully captured using view indices. Conversely, subjective measures using survey and interview data explain human behaviors more. However, the effectiveness of integrating subjective measures with SVI datasets has been less discussed. To address this, we integrated crowdsourcing, CV, and machine learning (ML) to subjectively measure four important perceptions suggested by classical urban design theory. We first collected ratings from experts on sample SVIs regarding these four qualities, which became the training labels. CV segmentation was applied to SVI samples extracting streetscape view indices as the explanatory variables. We then trained ML models and achieved high accuracy in predicting scores. We found a strong correlation between the predicted complexity score and the density of urban amenities and services points of interest (POI), which validates the effectiveness of subjective measures. In addition, to test the generalizability of the proposed framework as well as to inform urban renewal strategies, we compared the measured qualities in Pudong to other five urban cores that are renowned worldwide. Rather than predicting perceptual scores directly from generic image features using a convolution neural network, our approach follows what urban design theory has suggested and confirmed as various streetscape features affecting multi-dimensional human perceptions. Therefore, the results provide more interpretable and actionable implications for policymakers and city planners.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a real-time cloud-based in-vehicle air quality monitoring system that enables the prediction of the current and future cabin air quality. The designed system provides predictive analytics using machine learning algorithms that can measure the drivers’ drowsiness and fatigue based on the air quality presented in the cabin car. It consists of five sensors that measure the level of CO2, particulate matter, vehicle speed, temperature, and humidity. Data from these sensors were collected in real-time from the vehicle cabin and stored in the cloud database. A predictive model using multilayer perceptron, support vector regression, and linear regression was developed to analyze the data and predict the future condition of in-vehicle air quality. The performance of these models was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and coefficient of determination (R2). The results showed that the support vector regression achieved excellent performance with the highest linearity between the predicted and actual data with an R2 of 0.9981.

TI  - Systematic Review of Contextual Suggestion and Recommendation Systems for Sustainable e-Tourism
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 15
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Agenda 2030 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 and 11 recognizes tourism as one of the central industries to global development to tackle global challenges. With the transformation of information and communication technologies (ICT), e-tourism has evolved globally to establish commercial relationships using the Internet for offering tourism-related products, including giving personalised suggestions. The contextual suggestion has emerged as a modified recommendation system that is integrated with information-retrieval techniques within large databases to provide tourists with a list of suggestions based on contexts, such as location, time of day, or day of the week (weekdays or weekends). This study surveyed literature in the field of contextual suggestion and recommendation systems with a focus on e-tourism. The concerns linked with approaches used in contextual suggestion and recommendation systems are highlighted in this systematic review, while motivations, recommendations, and practical implications in e-tourism are also discussed in this paper. A query search using the keywords “contextual suggestion system”, “recommendation system”, and “tourism” identified 143 relevant articles published from 2012 to 2020. Four major repositories are considered for searching, namely, (i) Science Direct, (ii) Scopus, (iii) IEEE, and (iv) Web of Science. This review was carried out under the protocols of four phases, namely, (i) query searching in major article repositories, (ii) removal of duplicates, (iii) scan of title and abstract, and (iv) complete reading of articles. To identify the gaps in current research, a taxonomy analysis was exemplified into categories and subcategories. The main categories were highlighted as (i) review articles, (ii) model/framework, and (iii) applications. Critical analysis was carried out on the basis of the available literature on the limitations of approaches used in contextual suggestion and recommendation systems. In conclusion, the approaches used are mainly based on content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, preference-based product ranking, and language modelling. The evaluation measures for the contextual suggestion system include precision, normalized discounted cumulative, and mean reciprocal rank, while test collections comprise Internet resources. Given that the tourism industry contributed to the environmental and social-economic development, contextual suggestion and recommendation systems have presented themselves to be relevant in integrating and achieving SDG 9 and SDG 11 in many ways such as web-based e-services by the government sector and smart gadgets based on reliable and real-time data and information for city planners as well as law enforcement personnel in a sustainable city.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1660-4601

AB  - COVID-19 shocked cities around the world and revealed the vulnerability of urban lives and functions. Most cities experienced a catastrophic disturbance that has lasted for a long time. Planning plays a critical role in responding efficiently to this crisis and enabling rapid functional recovery in the post-disaster era. Cities that have implemented digitalization initiatives and programs are likely to have more capacity to react appropriately. Specifically, digitalized cities could ensure the well-being of their residents and maintain continuity of urban functions. This research aims to analyze the role of technology in crisis management in the last two decades and provide appropriate policy recommendations for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Systematic literature review and subjective content analysis are employed to investigate the effects of technology on community well-being and making cities more resilient in past crises. This study shows that different technology-driven policies and actions enable crisis management, enhance community well-being, and increase urban resilience. Technology has enhanced coping and recovery capacities by increasing participation and social connectedness, enhancing physical and mental health and maintaining the functionality of education and economic systems. These have been achieved through various solutions and technologies such as social media, telehealth, tracking and monitoring systems, sensors and locational applications, teleworking systems, etc. These solutions and technologies have also been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance community well-being and sustain urban functions. However, technology deployment might have adverse effects such as social exclusion, digital divide, privacy and confidentiality violation, political bias and misinformation dissemination, and inefficient remote working and education. It is suggested that to mitigate these side effects, policymakers should liberate the process of digitalization, increase the accessibility to digital services, and enhance digital literacy.

TI  - Climate Change and Internet of Things Technologies—Sustainable Premises of Extending the Culture of the Amurg Cultivar in Transylvania—A Use Case for Târnave Vineyard
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 15
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Known for its dry and semi-dry white wine, the Târnave vineyard located in central Transylvania is challenged by the current climate change, which has resulted in an increase of the period of active vegetation by approximately 15–20 days, the average annual temperature by 1–1.5 °C and also the amount of useful temperatures (useful thermal balance for the grapevine). Furthermore, the frost periods have been reduced. Transylvania is an important Romanian region for grapevine cultivation. In this context, one can use the climatic changes to expand their wine assortment by cultivating an autochthonous grapevine variety called Amurg. Amurg is a red grape cultivar homologated at SCDVV Blaj, which also homologated 7 cultivars and 11 clones. Because viticulture depends on the stability of meteorological and hydrological parameters of the growing area, its foundations are challenged by climate change. Grapevine production is a long time investment, taking at least five years before the freshly planted vines produce the desired quality berries. We propose the implementation of a climate change-based precision viticulture turn-key solution for environmental monitoring in the Târnave vineyard. This solution aims to evaluate the grapevine’s micro-climate to extend the sustainable cultivation of the Amurg red grapes cultivar in Transylvania with the final goal of obtaining Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) rosé and red wines from this region. Worldwide, the changing conditions from the existing climate (a 30-year average), used in the past hundred years to dictate local standards, such as new and erratic trends of temperature and humidity regimes, late spring freezes, early fall frosts, storms, heatwaves, droughts, area wildfires, and insect infestations, would create dynamic problems for all farmers to thrive. These conditions will make it challenging to predict shifts in each of the components of seasonal weather conditions. Our proposed system also aims to give a solution that can be adapted to other vineyards as well.

T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Three-dimensional information perception from point clouds is of vital importance for improving the ability of machines to understand the world, especially for autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles. Data annotation for point clouds is one of the most challenging and costly tasks. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop and virtual–real interactive point cloud generation and model-upgrading framework called Parallel Point Clouds (PPCs). To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the training model has been changed from an open-loop to a closed-loop mechanism. The feedback from the evaluation results is used to update the training dataset, benefiting from the flexibility of artificial scenes. Under the framework, a point-based LiDAR simulation model is proposed, which greatly simplifies the scanning operation. Besides, a group-based placing method is put forward to integrate hybrid point clouds, via locating candidate positions for virtual objects in real scenes. Taking advantage of the CAD models and mobile LiDAR devices, two hybrid point cloud datasets, i.e., ShapeKITTI and MobilePointClouds, are built for 3D detection tasks. With almost zero labor cost on data annotation for newly added objects, the models (PointPillars) trained with ShapeKITTI and MobilePointClouds achieved 78.6% and 60.0% of the average precision of the model trained with real data on 3D detection, respectively.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In this paper, a methodological data condensation approach for reducing tabular big datasets in classification problems is presented, named FDR2-BD. The key of our proposal is to analyze data in a dual way (vertical and horizontal), so as to provide a smart combination between feature selection to generate dense clusters of data and uniform sampling reduction to keep only a few representative samples from each problem area. Its main advantage is allowing the model’s predictive quality to be kept in a range determined by a user’s threshold. Its robustness is built on a hyper-parametrization process, in which all data are taken into consideration by following a k-fold procedure. Another significant capability is being fast and scalable by using fully optimized parallel operations provided by Apache Spark. An extensive experimental study is performed over 25 big datasets with different characteristics. In most cases, the obtained reduction percentages are above 95%, thus outperforming state-of-the-art solutions such as FCNN_MR that barely reach 70%. The most promising outcome is maintaining the representativeness of the original data information, with quality prediction values around 1% of the baseline.

AB  - The envisioned smart city domains are expected to rely heavily on artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) approaches for their operations, where the basic ingredient is data. Privacy of the data and training time have been major roadblocks to achieving the specific goals of each application domain. Policy makers, the research community, and the industrial sector have been putting their efforts into addressing these issues. Federated learning, with its distributed and local training approach, stands out as a potential solution to these challenges. In this article, we discuss the potential interplay of different technologies and AI for achieving the required features of future smart city services. Having discussed a few use-cases for future eHealth, we list design goals and technical requirements of the enabling technologies. The paper confines its focus on federated learning. After providing the tutorial on federated learning, we analyze the Federated Learning research literature. We also highlight the challenges. A solution sketch and high-level research directions may be instrumental in addressing the challenges.

AB  - Recent advances in microfluidics, microelectronics, and electrochemical sensing methods have steered the way for the development of novel and potential wearable biosensors for healthcare monitoring. Wearable bioelectronics has received tremendous attention worldwide due to its great a potential for predictive medical modeling and allowing for personalized point-of-care-testing (POCT). They possess many appealing characteristics, for example, lightweight, flexibility, good stretchability, conformability, and low cost. These characteristics make wearable bioelectronics a promising platform for personalized devices. In this paper, we review recent progress in flexible and wearable sensors for non-invasive biomonitoring using sweat as the bio-fluid. Real-time and molecular-level monitoring of personal health states can be achieved with sweat-based or perspiration-based wearable biosensors. The suitability of sweat and its potential in healthcare monitoring, sweat extraction, and the challenges encountered in sweat-based analysis are summarized. The paper also discusses challenges that still hinder the full-fledged development of sweat-based wearables and presents the areas of future research.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Water quality measures for inland and coastal waters are available as discrete samples from professional and volunteer water quality monitoring programs and higher-frequency, near-continuous data from automated in situ sensors. Water quality parameters also are estimated from model outputs and remote sensing. The integration of these data, via data assimilation, can result in a more holistic characterization of these highly dynamic ecosystems, and consequently improve water resource management. It is becoming common to see combinations of these data applied to answer relevant scientific questions. Yet, methods for scaling water quality data across regions and beyond, to provide actionable knowledge for stakeholders, have emerged only recently, particularly with the availability of satellite data now providing global coverage at high spatial resolution. In this paper, data sources and existing data integration frameworks are reviewed to give an overview of the present status and identify the gaps in existing frameworks. We propose an integration framework to provide information to user communities through the the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) AquaWatch Initiative. This aims to develop and build the global capacity and utility of water quality data, products, and information to support equitable and inclusive access for water resource management, policy and decision making.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Transportation and mobility in smart cities are undergoing a grave transformation as new ways of mobility are introduced to facilitate seamless traveling, addressing travelers’ needs in a personalized manner. A novel concept that has been recently introduced is Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), where mobility services are bundled in MaaS Plans and offered to end-users through a single digital platform. The present paper introduces a recommender system for MaaS Plans selection that supports travelers to select bundles of mobility services that fit their everyday transportation needs. The recommender filters out unsuitable plans and then ranks the remaining ones on the basis of their similarity to the users’ characteristics, habits and preferences. The recommendation approach is based on Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) formalisms combined with cosine similarity techniques. The proposed method was evaluated in experimental settings and was further embedded in real-life pilot MaaS applications. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach provides lists of MaaS PlanMaaS Plans that users would choose in a real-life MaaS setting, in most of the cases. Moreover, the results of the real-life pilots showed that the majority of the participants chose an actual MaaS Plan from the top three places of the recommendation lists.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The article presents the course of the evolution of the concept of urban renewal’s emergence into its current, mature, integrated form of sustainable regeneration (sustainable urban regeneration—SUR). We present how the determination of renewal areas and its goals began to be based on particular indicators, and how the importance of these analyses gradually increased in managing the implementation of urban regeneration programs. Analytical techniques using GIS were used in the analyses of the differentiation of crisis phenomena inside cities before they became popular in smart city tools. Despite the wide use of GIS to analyze the diversity of crisis phenomena within the city, the availability of data means that different spheres are characterized with different accuracy. Starting from the significance of individual spheres, the focus has primarily been on the environment, which is underappreciated in Poland. Municipalities (urban, rural, urban–rural) with regeneration programs do not perceive negative environmental phenomena as significant in assessing a crisis in a degraded area. Nevertheless, municipalities that do analyze environmental issues in regeneration programs also see the need for action and implementation of projects in the environmental sphere. In order to verify the hypothesis, the Statistics Poland (formerly known in English as the Central Statistical Office; Polish: Główny Urząd Statystyczny, abbreviated and known as GUS) data on the regeneration process was analyzed, with reference to the relationships between renewal areas and the natural environment. In order to check these dependencies (or the lack thereof), the Yule φ coefficient and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient were used. As a result, this study showed that analysis of the level and degree of degradation of the environmental sphere is not carried out frequently enough in municipalities. Secondly, the difficulties of municipalities, especially small ones (urban-rural and rural), in their analysis of the environmental sphere are the result of poor data availability. Thirdly, it is noted that there is a relationship between the designation of environmental zones and the type of municipality. This is of particular importance for the enhancement of smart city tools for the regeneration of existing cities, esp. small ones.

AB  - The article presents a research in the field of complex sensing, detection, and recovery of communications networks applications and hardware, in case of failures, maloperations, or unauthorized intrusions. A case study, based on Davis AI engine operation versus human maintenance operation is performed on the efficiency of artificial intelligence agents in detecting faulty operation, in the context of growing complexity of communications networks, and the perspective of future development of internet of things, big data, smart cities, and connected vehicles. (*). In the second part of the article, a new solution is proposed for the detection of applications faults or unauthorized intrusions in traffic of communications networks. The first objective of the proposed method is to propose an approach for predicting time series. This approach is based on a multi-resolution decomposition of the signals employing the undecimate wavelet transform (UWT). The second approach for assessing traffic flow is based on the analysis of long-range dependence (LRD) (for this case, a long-term dependence). Estimating the degree of long-range dependence is performed by estimating the Hurst parameter of the analyzed time series. This is a relatively new statistical concept in communications traffic analysis and can be implemented using UWT. This property has important implications for network performance, design, and sizing. The presence of long-range dependency in network traffic is assumed to have a significant impact on network performance, and the occurrence of LRD can be the result of faults that occur during certain periods. The strategy chosen for this purpose is based on long-term dependence on traffic, and for the prediction of faults occurrence, a predictive control model (MPC) is proposed, combined with a neural network with radial function (RBF). It is demonstrated via simulations that, in the case of communications traffic, time location is the most important feature of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Emergence of the Energy Internet (EI) demands restructuring of traditional electricity grids to integrate heterogeneous energy sources, distribution network management with grid intelligence and big data management. This paradigm shift is considered to be a breakthrough in the energy industry towards facilitating autonomous and decentralized grid operations while maximizing the utilization of Distributed Generation (DG). Blockchain has been identified as a disruptive technology enabler for the realization of EI to facilitate reliable, self-operated energy delivery. In this paper, we highlight six key directions towards utilizing blockchain capabilities to realize the envisaged EI. We elaborate the challenges in each direction and highlight the role of blockchain in addressing them. Furthermore, we summarize the future research directive in achieving fully autonomous and decentralized electricity distribution networks, which will be known as Energy Internet.

AB  - Ecological environments research helps to assess the impacts on forests and managing forests. The usage of novel software and hardware technologies enforces the solution of tasks related to this problem. In addition, the lack of connectivity for large data throughput raises the demand for edge-computing-based solutions towards this goal. Therefore, in this work, we evaluate the opportunity of using a Wearable edge AI concept in a forest environment. For this matter, we propose a new approach to the hardware/software co-design process. We also address the possibility of creating wearable edge AI, where the wireless personal and body area networks are platforms for building applications using edge AI. Finally, we evaluate a case study to test the possibility of performing an edge AI task in a wearable-based environment. Thus, in this work, we evaluate the system to achieve the desired task, the hardware resource and performance, and the network latency associated with each part of the process. Through this work, we validated both the design pattern review and case study. In the case study, the developed algorithms could classify diseased leaves with a circa 90% accuracy with the proposed technique in the field. This results can be reviewed in the laboratory with more modern models that reached up to 96% global accuracy. The system could also perform the desired tasks with a quality factor of 0.95, considering the usage of three devices. Finally, it detected a disease epicenter with an offset of circa 0.5 m in a 6 m × 6 m × 12 m space. These results enforce the usage of the proposed methods in the targeted environment and the proposed changes in the co-design pattern.

AB  - The tremendous number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, with their ubiquity, has provided us with unprecedented productivity and simplified our daily life. At the same time, the insecurity of these technologies ensures that our daily lives are surrounded by vulnerable computers, allowing for the launch of multiple attacks via large-scale botnets through the IoT. These attacks have been successful in achieving their heinous objectives. A strong identification strategy is essential to keep devices secured. This paper proposes and implements a model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in IoT networks that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to detect and classify binary and multiclass IoT network data. The proposed model is validated using the BoT-IoT, IoT Network Intrusion, MQTT-IoT-IDS2020, and IoT-23 intrusion detection datasets. Our proposed binary and multiclass classification model achieved an exceptionally high level of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

VL  - 9
IS  - 3
SN  - 2227-7072

AB  - In banking and finance, credit risk is among the important topics because the process of issuing a loan requires a lot of attention to assessing the possibilities of getting the loaned money back. At the same time in emerging markets, the underbanked individuals cannot access traditional forms of collateral or identification that is required by financial institutions for them to be granted loans. Using the literature review approach through documentary and conceptual analysis to investigate the impact of machine learning and artificial intelligence in credit risk assessment, this study discovered that artificial intelligence and machine learning have a strong impact on credit risk assessments using alternative data sources such as public data to deal with the problems of information asymmetry, adverse selection, and moral hazard. This allows lenders to do serious credit risk analysis, to assess the behaviour of the customer, and subsequently to verify the ability of the clients to repay the loans, permitting less privileged people to access credit. Therefore, this study recommends that financial institutions such as banks and credit lending institutions invest more in artificial intelligence and machine learning to ensure that financially excluded households can obtain credit.

AB  - Using passive infrared sensors is a well-established technique of presence monitoring. While it can significantly reduce energy consumption, more savings can be made when utilising more modern sensor solutions coupled with machine learning algorithms. This paper proposes an improved method of presence monitoring, which can accurately derive the number of people in the area supervised with a low-cost and low-energy thermal imaging sensor. The method utilises U-Net-like convolutional neural network architecture and has a low parameter count, and therefore can be used in embedded scenarios. Instead of providing simple, binary information, it learns to estimate the occupancy density function with the person count and approximate location, allowing the system to become considerably more flexible. The tests show that the method compares favourably to the state of the art solutions, achieving significantly better results.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 15
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Based on a set of deep learning and mode decomposition methods, a short-term prediction model for PM2.5 concentration for Beijing city is established in this paper. An ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) algorithm is first used to decompose the original PM2.5 timeseries to several high- to low-frequency intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Each IMF component is then trained and predicted by a combination of three neural networks: back propagation network (BP), long short-term memory network (LSTM), and a hybrid network of a convolutional neural network (CNN) + LSTM. The results showed that both BP and LSTM are able to fit the low-frequency IMFs very well, and the total prediction errors of the summation of all IMFs are remarkably reduced from 21 g/m3 in the single BP model to 4.8 g/m3 in the EEMD + BP model. Spatial information from 143 stations surrounding Beijing city is extracted by CNN, which is then used to train the CNN+LSTM. It is found that, under extreme weather conditions of PM2.5 &lt; 35 g/m3 and PM2.5 &gt; 150 g/m3, the prediction errors of the CNN + LSTM model are improved by ~30% compared to the single LSTM model. However, the prediction of the very high-frequency IMF mode (IMF-1) remains a challenge for all neural networks, which might be due to microphysical turbulences and chaotic processes that cannot be resolved by the above-mentioned neural networks based on variable–variable relationship.

AB  - The exponential evolution of technology and the growth of the elderly population are two phenomena that will inevitably interact with increasing frequency in the future. This paper analyses scientific literature as a means of furthering progress in sustainable technology for senior living. We carried out a bibliometric analysis of papers published in this area and compiled by the Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus, examining the main participants and advances in the field from 2000 to the first quarter of 2021. The study describes some interesting research projects addressing three different aspects of older adults’ daily lives—health, daily activities and wellbeing—and policies to promote healthy aging and improve the sustainability of the healthcare system. It also looks at lines of research into transversal characteristics of technology. Our analysis showed that publications mentioning sustainability technologies for older adults have been growing progressively since the 2000s, but that the big increase in the number of research works in this area took place during the period 2016–2021. These more recent works show a tendency to study those factors that improve healthy aging, ensure the social inclusion of the elderly through technology and prolong the time in which they can live independent lives thanks to smart environments. Current research gaps in the literature are also discussed.

AB  - A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical entity, with dynamic, bi-directional links between the physical entity and its corresponding twin in the digital domain. Digital twins are increasingly used today in different industry sectors. Applied to medicine and public health, digital twin technology can drive a much-needed radical transformation of traditional electronic health/medical records (focusing on individuals) and their aggregates (covering populations) to make them ready for a new era of precision (and accuracy) medicine and public health. Digital twins enable learning and discovering new knowledge, new hypothesis generation and testing, and in silico experiments and comparisons. They are poised to play a key role in formulating highly personalised treatments and interventions in the future. This paper provides an overview of the technology’s history and main concepts. A number of application examples of digital twins for personalised medicine, public health, and smart healthy cities are presented, followed by a brief discussion of the key technical and other challenges involved in such applications, including ethical issues that arise when digital twins are applied to model humans.

AB  - Smart service provision systems can assist in the management of cargo transportation. The development of these systems faces a number of issues that relate to the analysis of numerous factors, which are influenced by the properties of such complex and dynamic systems. The aim of this research was the development of an adaptable smart service provision system that is able to recognize a wide spectrum of contextual information, which is obtained from different services and heterogeneous devices of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To ensure that the smart service provision system can assist with the analysis of specific cases of unforeseen and unwanted situations during the cargo transportation process, the system must have additional adaptability. To address the adequate provision of contextual data, we examined the problems of multi-dimensional definitions of contextual data and the choice of appropriate artificial intelligence (AI) methods for recognition of contextual information. The objectives relate to prioritizing potential service provision by ensuring the optimal quality of data supply channels and avoiding the flooding of wireless communication channels. The proposed methodology is based on methods of smart system architecture development that integrate the identification of context-aware data, conceptual structures of data warehouses, and algorithms for the recognition of transportation situations based on AI methods. Experimental research is outlined to illustrate the algorithmic analysis of the prototype system using an appropriate simulation environment.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - With the widespread of blockchain technology, preserving the anonymity and confidentiality of transactions have become crucial. An enormous portion of blockchain research is dedicated to the design and development of privacy protocols but not much has been achieved for proper assessment of these solutions. To mitigate the gap, we have first comprehensively classified the existing solutions based on blockchain fundamental building blocks (i.e., smart contracts, cryptography, and hashing). Next, we investigated the evaluation criteria used for validating these techniques. The findings depict that the majority of privacy solutions are validated based on computing resources i.e., memory, time, storage, throughput, etc., only, which is not sufficient. Hence, we have additionally identified and presented various other factors that strengthen or weaken blockchain privacy. Based on those factors, we have formulated an evaluation framework to analyze the efficiency of blockchain privacy solutions. Further, we have introduced a concept of privacy precision that is a quantifiable measure to empirically assess privacy efficiency in blockchains. The calculation of privacy precision will be based on the effectiveness and strength of various privacy protecting attributes of a solution and the associated risks. Finally, we conclude the paper with some open research challenges and future directions. Our study can serve as a benchmark for empirical assessment of blockchain privacy.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The revolutionary idea of the internet of things (IoT) architecture has gained enormous popularity over the last decade, resulting in an exponential growth in the IoT networks, connected devices, and the data processed therein. Since IoT devices generate and exchange sensitive data over the traditional internet, security has become a prime concern due to the generation of zero-day cyberattacks. A network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) can provide the much-needed efficient security solution to the IoT network by protecting the network entry points through constant network traffic monitoring. Recent NIDS have a high false alarm rate (FAR) in detecting the anomalies, including the novel and zero-day anomalies. This paper proposes an efficient anomaly detection mechanism using mutual information (MI), considering a deep neural network (DNN) for an IoT network. A comparative analysis of different deep-learning models such as DNN, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and its different variants, such as Gated Recurrent Unit and Long Short-term Memory is performed considering the IoT-Botnet 2020 dataset. Experimental results show the improvement of 0.57–2.6% in terms of the model’s accuracy, while at the same time reducing the FAR by 0.23–7.98% to show the effectiveness of the DNN-based NIDS model compared to the well-known deep learning models. It was also observed that using only the 16–35 best numerical features selected using MI instead of 80 features of the dataset result in almost negligible degradation in the model’s performance but helped in decreasing the overall model’s complexity. In addition, the overall accuracy of the DL-based models is further improved by almost 0.99–3.45% in terms of the detection accuracy considering only the top five categorical and numerical features.

AB  - From the end of 2019, the world has been facing the threat of COVID-19. It is predicted that, before herd immunity is achieved globally via vaccination, people around the world will have to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic using precautionary steps. This paper suggests a COVID-19 identification and control system that operates in real-time. The proposed system utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) platform to capture users’ time-sensitive symptom information to detect potential cases of coronaviruses early on, to track the clinical measures adopted by survivors, and to gather and examine appropriate data to verify the existence of the virus. There are five key components in the framework: symptom data collection and uploading (via communication technology), a quarantine/isolation center, an information processing core (using artificial intelligent techniques), cloud computing, and visualization to healthcare doctors. This research utilizes eight machine/deep learning techniques—Neural Network, Decision Table, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, OneR, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Dense Neural Network (DNN), and the Long Short-Term Memory technique—to detect coronavirus cases from time-sensitive information. A simulation was performed to verify the eight algorithms, after selecting the relevant symptoms, on real-world COVID-19 data values. The results showed that five of these eight algorithms obtained an accuracy of over 90%. Conclusively, it is shown that real-world symptomatic information would enable these three algorithms to identify potential COVID-19 cases effectively with enhanced accuracy. Additionally, the framework presents responses to treatment for COVID-19 patients.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Urban object segmentation and classification tasks are critical data processing steps in scene understanding, intelligent vehicles and 3D high-precision maps. Semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds is the foundational step in object recognition. To identify the intersecting objects and improve the accuracy of classification, this paper proposes a segment-based classification method for 3D point clouds. This method firstly divides points into multi-scale supervoxels and groups them by proposed inverse node graph (IN-Graph) construction, which does not need to define prior information about the node, it divides supervoxels by judging the connection state of edges between them. This method reaches minimum global energy by graph cutting, obtains the structural segments as completely as possible, and retains boundaries at the same time. Then, the random forest classifier is utilized for supervised classification. To deal with the mislabeling of scattered fragments, higher-order CRF with small-label cluster optimization is proposed to refine the classification results. Experiments were carried out on mobile laser scan (MLS) point dataset and terrestrial laser scan (TLS) points dataset, and the results show that overall accuracies of 97.57% and 96.39% were obtained in the two datasets. The boundaries of objects were retained well, and the method achieved a good result in the classification of cars and motorcycles. More experimental analyses have verified the advantages of the proposed method and proved the practicability and versatility of the method.

AB  - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, South Korea is moving to establish a national industry strategy to reduce regional inequalities within the country through the Green New Deal. Thus, it is important to closely integrate the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the Green New Deal with that of reducing deepening regional inequality from the Regionally Balanced New Deal. To accomplish these dual aims, this study provides a collaborative trans-regional R&amp;D strategy and a precise framework with three key dimensions: regional, technological, and organizational. We demonstrate that future mobility is the most important project of the Green New Deal, comprising 1963 nationally funded projects worth USD 1285.4 million. We also illustrate the level of government investment in nationally funded research projects related to future mobility for 17 different regions and seven different technology clusters related to future mobility, and determine which research organizations played an important role in each cluster for all 17 regions between 2015 and 2020. Our results indicate that the capital region and Daejeon have high innovation capability in many future mobility-related research fields, whereas some regions have capabilities in specific research fields such as hydrogen infrastructure, indicating their relative competitiveness.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - To mitigate the effects of climate change, the European Commission created a Strategic Energy Technology Plan committing to forming 100 Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) by 2025. These are considered to potentially be major instruments for decarbonization in a just transition. This plan has led to some districts being defined as PEDs, although none have fully met the criteria to be a PED yet. Research shows that new forms of energy ownership and production, as could potentially be found in PEDs, could help reduce energy poverty, which affects a significant segment of the population, as households can reduce their energy expenditure as well as improve their energy behavior. This paper set out to shed light on the PED landscape, investigating the barriers and opportunities to PED creation in Spain and its potential to mitigate energy poverty. We conducted a literature review on community-owned energy in Spain, followed with expert interviews (energy researchers, stakeholders, and NGOs) who focus on sustainability issues in Spain. Results show a number of barriers (lack of knowledge and awareness, and lack of trust from consumers) and opportunities connected with the creation of PEDs. In conclusion, policymaker engagement and support play a key role in successfully implementing PEDs.

VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Monitoring the indoor environment of historic buildings helps to identify potential risks, provide guidelines for improving regular maintenance, and preserve cultural artifacts. However, most of the existing monitoring systems proposed for historic buildings are not for general digitization purposes that provide data for smart services employing, e.g., artificial intelligence with machine learning. In addition, considering that preserving historic buildings is a long-term process that demands preventive maintenance, a monitoring system requires stable and scalable storage and computing resources. In this paper, a digitalization framework is proposed for smart preservation of historic buildings. A sensing system following the architecture of this framework is implemented by integrating various advanced digitalization techniques, such as Internet of Things, Edge computing, and Cloud computing. The sensing system realizes remote data collection, enables viewing real-time and historical data, and provides the capability for performing real-time analysis to achieve preventive maintenance of historic buildings in future research. Field testing results show that the implemented sensing system has a 2% end-to-end loss rate for collecting data samples and the loss rate can be decreased to 0.3%. The low loss rate indicates that the proposed sensing system has high stability and meets the requirements for long-term monitoring of historic buildings.

AB  - The Internet of Things has become a cutting-edge technology that is continuously evolving in size, connectivity, and applicability. This ecosystem makes its presence felt in every aspect of our lives, along with all other emerging technologies. Unfortunately, despite the significant benefits brought by the IoT, the increased attack surface built upon it has become more critical than ever. Devices have limited resources and are not typically created with security features. Lately, a trend of botnet threats transitioning to the IoT environment has been observed, and an army of infected IoT devices can expand quickly and be used for effective attacks. Therefore, identifying proper solutions for securing IoT systems is currently an important and challenging research topic. Machine learning-based approaches are a promising alternative, allowing the identification of abnormal behaviors and the detection of attacks. This paper proposes an anomaly-based detection solution that uses unsupervised deep learning techniques to identify IoT botnet activities. An empirical evaluation of the proposed method is conducted on both balanced and unbalanced datasets to assess its threat detection capability. False-positive rate reduction and its impact on the detection system are also analyzed. Furthermore, a comparison with other unsupervised learning approaches is included. The experimental results reveal the performance of the proposed detection method.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications in industrial settings are set to bring in the fourth industrial revolution. The industrial environment consisting of high profile manufacturing plants and a variety of equipment is inherently characterized by high reflectiveness, causing significant multi-path components that affect the propagation of wireless communications—a challenge among others that needs to be resolved. This paper provides a detailed insight into Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT), Industrial IoT (IIoT), and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) within the context of indoor industrial environments. It presents the applications of NB-IoT for industrial settings, such as the challenges associated with these applications. Furthermore, future research directions were put forth in the areas of NB-IoT network management using self-organizing network (SON) technology, edge computing for scalability enhancement, security in NB-IoT generated data, and proposing a suitable propagation model for reliable wireless communications.

AB  - A successful application of low-cost 3D cameras in combination with artificial intelligence (AI)-based 3D object detection algorithms to outdoor mobile mapping would offer great potential for numerous mapping, asset inventory, and change detection tasks in the context of smart cities. This paper presents a mobile mapping system mounted on an electric tricycle and a procedure for creating on-street parking statistics, which allow government agencies and policy makers to verify and adjust parking policies in different city districts. Our method combines georeferenced red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) imagery from two low-cost 3D cameras with state-of-the-art 3D object detection algorithms for extracting and mapping parked vehicles. Our investigations demonstrate the suitability of the latest generation of low-cost 3D cameras for real-world outdoor applications with respect to supported ranges, depth measurement accuracy, and robustness under varying lighting conditions. In an evaluation of suitable algorithms for detecting vehicles in the noisy and often incomplete 3D point clouds from RGB-D cameras, the 3D object detection network PointRCNN, which extends region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) to 3D point clouds, clearly outperformed all other candidates. The results of a mapping mission with 313 parking spaces show that our method is capable of reliably detecting parked cars with a precision of 100% and a recall of 97%. It can be applied to unslotted and slotted parking and different parking types including parallel, perpendicular, and angle parking.

AB  - The recent advances in computing technologies and the increasing availability of large amounts of data in smart grids and smart cities are generating new research opportunities in the application of Machine Learning (ML) for improving the observability and efficiency of modern power grids. However, as the number and diversity of ML techniques increase, questions arise about their performance and applicability, and on the most suitable ML method depending on the specific application. Trying to answer these questions, this manuscript presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art studies implementing ML techniques in the context of power systems, with a specific focus on the analysis of power flows, power quality, photovoltaic systems, intelligent transportation, and load forecasting. The survey investigates, for each of the selected topics, the most recent and promising ML techniques proposed by the literature, by highlighting their main characteristics and relevant results. The review revealed that, when compared to traditional approaches, ML algorithms can handle massive quantities of data with high dimensionality, by allowing the identification of hidden characteristics of (even) complex systems. In particular, even though very different techniques can be used for each application, hybrid models generally show better performances when compared to single ML-based models.

AB  - High costs for the repair of concrete structures can be prevented if damage at an early stage of degradation is detected and precautionary maintenance measures are applied. To this end, we use numerical wave propagation simulations to identify simulated damage in concrete using convolutional neural networks. Damage in concrete subjected to compression is modeled at the mesoscale using the discrete element method. Ultrasonic wave propagation simulation on the damaged concrete specimens is performed using the rotated staggered finite-difference grid method. The simulated ultrasonic signals are used to train a CNN-based classifier capable of classifying three different damage stages (microcrack initiation, microcrack growth and microcrack coalescence leading to macrocracks) with an overall accuracy of 77%. The performance of the classifier is improved by refining the dataset via an analysis of the averaged envelope of the signal. The classifier using the refined dataset has an overall accuracy of 90%.

TI  - A General Cooperative Optimization Approach for Distributing Service Points in Mobility Applications
T2  - Algorithms

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - This article presents a cooperative optimization approach (COA) for distributing service points for mobility applications, which generalizes and refines a previously proposed method. COA is an iterative framework for optimizing service point locations, combining an optimization component with user interaction on a large scale and a machine learning component that learns user needs and provides the objective function for the optimization. The previously proposed COA was designed for mobility applications in which single service points are sufficient for satisfying individual user demand. This framework is generalized here for applications in which the satisfaction of demand relies on the existence of two or more suitably located service stations, such as in the case of bike/car sharing systems. A new matrix factorization model is used as surrogate objective function for the optimization, allowing us to learn and exploit similar preferences among users w.r.t. service point locations. Based on this surrogate objective function, a mixed integer linear program is solved to generate an optimized solution to the problem w.r.t. the currently known user information. User interaction, refinement of the matrix factorization, and optimization are iterated. An experimental evaluation analyzes the performance of COA with special consideration of the number of user interactions required to find near optimal solutions. The algorithm is tested on artificial instances, as well as instances derived from real-world taxi data from Manhattan. Results show that the approach can effectively solve instances with hundreds of potential service point locations and thousands of users, while keeping the user interactions reasonably low. A bound on the number of user interactions required to obtain full knowledge of user preferences is derived, and results show that with 50% of performed user interactions the solutions generated by COA feature optimality gaps of only 1.45% on average.

AB  - Only recently, smart cities are taking shape, thanks to the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and other similar technologies. Given the high demands placed on advanced technologies such as autonomous driving, cloud data services, and high-precision sensors, smart cities are creating an intelligent transportation environment conducive to the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this context, the use of AVs in transportation is also considered a form of transportation innovation. As a result, AVs are considered more favorable to people interested in new technologies because they appear to be technologically superior. Their association with the most up-to-date technology can serve as a symbol for those who wish to demonstrate their interest in new technologies through their appearance. The positive image of technological innovation projected by AVs may influence their acceptance among technology enthusiasts to a significant degree. In this context, this study investigates the effects of perceived advantage, perceived risk, and perceived safety on the intention to use autonomous vehicles. For this purpose, data were collected from vehicle users living in Turkey by survey method. Secondly, factor analyses and regression analyses were performed with the data set obtained from 611 participants. As a result of the analyses, it has been determined that the perceived advantage and perceived security increase the intention to use autonomous vehicles. In contrast, the perceived risk reduces this intention to use. According to these results, recommendations were made to the companies about the level of acceptance of this technology by the users to assess their investments in autonomous vehicles better.

AB  - There is a range of anxiety-related phenomena among users and potential buyers of electric vehicles. Chief among them is the fear of the vehicle stopping and its users getting “stuck” before reaching their designated destination. The limited range of an electric vehicle makes EV users worry that the battery will drain while driving and the vehicle will stall on the road. It is therefore important to know the factors that could further reduce the range during daily vehicle operation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of selected parameters on a battery’s depth of discharge (DOD). In a simulation study of an electric vehicle, the effects of the driving cycle, ambient temperature, load, and initial state of charge of the accumulator on the energy consumption pattern and a battery’s depth of discharge (DOD) were analyzed. The simulation results confirmed that the route taken has the highest impact on energy consumption. The presented results show how significantly the operating conditions of an electric vehicle affect the energy life. This translates into an electric vehicle’s range.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The detection of building footprints and road networks has many useful applications including the monitoring of urban development, real-time navigation, etc. Taking into account that a great deal of human attention is required by these remote sensing tasks, a lot of effort has been made to automate them. However, the vast majority of the approaches rely on very high-resolution satellite imagery (&lt;2.5 m) whose costs are not yet affordable for maintaining up-to-date maps. Working with the limited spatial resolution provided by high-resolution satellite imagery such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) makes it hard to detect buildings and roads, since these labels may coexist within the same pixel. This paper focuses on this problem and presents a novel methodology capable of detecting building and roads with sub-pixel width by increasing the resolution of the output masks. This methodology consists of fusing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data (at 10 m) together with OpenStreetMap to train deep learning models for building and road detection at 2.5 m. This becomes possible thanks to the usage of OpenStreetMap vector data, which can be rasterized to any desired resolution. Accordingly, a few simple yet effective modifications of the U-Net architecture are proposed to not only semantically segment the input image, but also to learn how to enhance the resolution of the output masks. As a result, generated mappings quadruplicate the input spatial resolution, closing the gap between satellite and aerial imagery for building and road detection. To properly evaluate the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology, a data-set composed of 44 cities across the Spanish territory have been considered and divided into training and testing cities. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used for sub-pixel width building and road detection following the proper methodology.

AB  - In the last few decades, agriculture has played an important role in the worldwide economy. The need to produce more food for a rapidly growing population is creating pressure on crop and animal production and a negative impact to the environment. On the other hand, smart farming technologies are becoming increasingly common in modern agriculture to assist in optimizing agricultural and livestock production and minimizing the wastes and costs. Precision agriculture (PA) is a technology-enabled, data-driven approach to farming management that observes, measures, and analyzes the needs of individual fields and crops. Precision livestock farming (PLF), relying on the automatic monitoring of individual animals, is used for animal growth, milk production, and the detection of diseases as well as to monitor animal behavior and their physical environment, among others. This study aims to briefly review recent scientific and technological trends in PA and their application in crop and livestock farming, serving as a simple research guide for the researcher and farmer in the application of technology to agriculture. The development and operation of PA applications involve several steps and techniques that need to be investigated further to make the developed systems accurate and implementable in commercial environments.

AB  - The unique art that was developed in Byzantine times is widely accepted as a precursor to the Renaissance and is still evident in monuments either from or influenced by the Byzantium. Visiting such a site is a unique experience due to the lavishly painted interior for both tourists and scholars. Taking advantage of the emerging 5G technologies, cloud/fog computing, and Augmented/Mixed Reality mechanisms, a common smart device (e.g., smartphone, tablet) could be employed to give a better experience to the end-users. The proposed framework is intended to provide visitors with interpretative information regarding the visited monuments and their paintings. Under the framework introduced in this paper, camera input is uploaded to a cloud/fog computing infrastructure where appropriate algorithms and services provide monument and painting recognition and the mobile application retrieves and projects the related information. In addition, the designed immersive user interfaces assist visitors in contributing in cases of monuments and paintings for which no available information exists. This paper presents the state of the art in approaches for immersive experiences in Digital Culture, reviews the current image recognition approaches and their suitability for Byzantine paintings, proposes interaction techniques appropriately designed for observation and interaction of paintings, and discusses the overall framework architecture that is needed to support the described functionality while stressing the challenging issues of the above aspects thus paving the road for future work and providing guidelines for a test-bed implementation.

AB  - Railways are facing a serious problem of road vehicle–train collisions at unmanned railway level crossings. The purpose of the study is the development of a safe stopping sight distance and sight distance from road to rail track model with appropriate computation and analysis. The scope of the study lies in avoiding road vehicle–train collisions at unmanned railway level crossings. An intelligent and autonomous framework is being developed using supervised machine learning regression algorithms. Further, a sight distance from road to rail track model is being developed for road vehicles of 0.5 to 10 m length using the observed geometric characteristics of the route. The model prediction accuracy obtained better results in the development of a stopping sight distance model in comparison to other intelligent algorithms. The developed model suggested an increment of approximately 23% in the current safe stopping sight distance on all unmanned railway level crossings. Further, the feature analysis indicates the ‘approach road gradient’ to be the major contributing parameter for safe stopping sight distance determination. The accident prediction study finally indicates that, as the safe stopping sight distance is increased by following the developed model, it is predicted to decrease road vehicle–train collisions.

AB  - The network session constraints for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications are different and challenging. These constraints necessitates a high level of reconfigurability, so that the system can assess the impact of an event and adjust the network effectively. Software Defined Networking (SDN) in contrast to existing networks segregates the control and data plane to support network configuration which is programmable with smart cities requirement that shows the highest impact on the system but faces the problem of reliability. To address this issue, the SDN-IIoT based load balancing algorithm is proposed in this article and it is not application specific.Quality of service (QoS) aware architecture i.e., SDN-IIoT load balancing scheme is proposed and it deals with load on the servers. Huge load on the servers, makes them vulnerable to halt the system and hence leads to faults which creates the reliability problem for real time applications. In this article, load is migrated from one server to another server, if load on one server is more than threshold value. Load distribution has made the proposed scheme more reliable than already existing schemes. Further, the topology used for the implementation has been designed using POX controller and the results has been evaluated using Mininet emulator with its support in python programming. Lastly, the performance is evaluated based on the various Quality of Service (QoS) metrics; data transmission, response time and CPU utilization which shows that the proposed algorithm has shown 10% improvement over the existing LBBSRT, Random, Round-robin, Heuristic algorithms.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Conventional crop insurance systems are complex and often not economically feasible. Farmers are often reluctant to be covered for their crops due to lack of trust in insurance firms and the fear of delayed or non-payment of claims. In this paper, a blockchain based crop insurance solution is suggested. The solution suggested in this paper is an affordable, efficient, low cost crop insurance solution which will ensure many farmers are insured and benefiting from timely crop insurance. Currently the cost of administering insurance is an essential barrier to accessing this facility. With the proper use of blockchain based on ethereum this expense can be reduced dramatically. We have conducted various tests on platforms such as Google Cloud and found that the least throughput is 165 transactions. Upon analysis we have found that the time taken by the block formation is directly proportional to the timing of processing. The end-to-end average latency of the system was achieved as 31.2 s, which was quite effective for the infrastructure what we are using. Upon conducting acceptance testing, we found that the system suggested in the paper is effective and we are planning to release the application on open source platforms for future improvements.

TI  - FedResilience: A Federated Learning Application to Improve Resilience of Resource-Constrained Critical Infrastructures
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 16
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Critical infrastructures (e.g., energy and transportation systems) are essential lifelines for most modern sectors and have utmost significance in our daily lives. However, these important domains can fail to operate due to system failures or natural disasters. Though the major disturbances in such critical infrastructures are rare, the severity of such events calls for the development of effective resilience assessment strategies to mitigate relative losses. Traditional critical infrastructure resilience approaches consider that the available critical infrastructure agents are resource-sufficient and agree to exchange local data with the server and other agents. Such assumptions create two issues: (1) uncertainty in reaching convergence while applying learning strategies on resource-constrained critical infrastructure agents, and (2) a huge risk of privacy leakage. By understanding the pressing need to construct an effective resilience model for resource-constrained critical infrastructure, this paper aims at leveraging a distributed machine learning technique called Federated Learning (FL) to tackle an agent’s resource limitations effectively and at the same time keep the agent’s information private. Particularly, this paper is focused on predicting the probable outage and resource status of critical infrastructure agents without sharing any local data and carrying out the learning process even when most of the agents are incapable of accomplishing a given computational task. To that end, an FL algorithm is designed specifically for a resource-constrained critical infrastructure environment that could facilitate the training of each agent in a distributed fashion, restrict them from sharing their raw data with any other external entities (e.g., server, neighbor agents), choose proficient clients by analyzing their resources, and allow a partial amount of computation tasks to be performed by the resource-constrained agents. We considered a different number of agents with various stragglers and checked the performance of FedAvg and our proposed FedResilience algorithm with prediction tasks for a probable outage, as well as checking the agents’ resource-sharing scope. Our simulation results show that if the majority of the FL agents are stragglers and we drop them from the training process, then the agents learn very slowly and the overall model performance is negatively affected. We also demonstrate that the selection of proficient agents and allowing them to complete only parts of their tasks can significantly improve the knowledge of each agent by eliminating the straggler effects, and the global model convergence is accelerated.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Short-term electric load forecasting plays a significant role in the safe and stable operation of the power system and power market transactions. In recent years, with the development of new energy sources, more and more sources have been integrated into the grid. This has posed a serious challenge to short-term electric load forecasting. Focusing on load series with non-linear and time-varying characteristics, an approach to short-term electric load forecasting using a “decomposition and ensemble” framework is proposed in this paper. The method is verified using hourly load data from Oslo and the surrounding areas of Norway. First, the load series is decomposed into five components by variational mode decomposition (VMD). Second, a support vector regression (SVR) forecasting model is established for the five components to predict the electric load components, and the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is used to optimize the cost and gamma parameters of SVR. Finally, the predicted values of the five components are superimposed to obtain the final electric load forecasting results. In this paper, the proposed method is compared with GWO-SVR without modal decomposition and using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to test the impact of VMD on prediction. This paper also compares the proposed method with the SVR model using VMD and other optimization algorithms. The four evaluation indexes of the proposed method are optimal: MAE is 71.65 MW, MAPE is 1.41%, MSE is 10,461.32, and R2 is 0.9834. This indicates that the proposed method has a good application prospect for short-term electric load forecasting.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Over the past years, numerous Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare systems have been developed to monitor patient health conditions, but these traditional systems do not adapt to constraints imposed by revolutionized IoT technology. IoT-based healthcare systems are considered mission-critical applications whose missing deadlines cause critical situations. For example, in patients with chronic diseases or other fatal diseases, a missed task could lead to fatalities. This study presents a smart patient health monitoring system (PHMS) based on an optimized scheduling mechanism using IoT-tasks orchestration architecture to monitor vital signs data of remote patients. The proposed smart PHMS consists of two core modules: a healthcare task scheduling based on optimization and optimization of healthcare services using a real-time IoT-based task orchestration architecture. First, an optimized time-constraint-aware scheduling mechanism using a real-time IoT-based task orchestration architecture is developed to generate autonomous healthcare tasks and effectively handle the deployment of emergent healthcare tasks. Second, an optimization module is developed to optimize the services of the e-Health industry based on objective functions. Furthermore, our study uses Libelium e-Health toolkit to monitors the physiological data of remote patients continuously. The experimental results reveal that an optimized scheduling mechanism reduces the tasks starvation by 14% and tasks failure by 17% compared to a conventional fair emergency first (FEF) scheduling mechanism. The performance analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, and it suggests that the proposed solution can be an effective and sustainable solution towards monitoring patient’s vital signs data in the IoT-based e-Health domain.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the world into an ecosystem of objects that communicate with each other to enrich our lives. The devices’ collaboration allows the creation of complex applications, where each object can provide one or more services needed for global benefit. The information moves to nodes in a peer-to-peer network, in which the concept of trustworthiness is essential. Trust and Reputation Models (TRMs) are developed with the goal of guaranteeing that actions taken by entities in a system reflect their trustworthiness values and to prevent these values from being manipulated by malicious entities. The cornerstone of any TRM is the ability to generate a coherent evaluation of the information received. Indeed, the feedback generated by the consumers of the services has a vital role as the source of any trust model. In this paper, we focus on the generation of the feedback and propose different metrics to evaluate it. Moreover, we illustrate a new collusive attack that influences the evaluation of the received services. Simulations with a real IoT dataset show the importance of feedback generation and the impact of the new proposed attack.

AB  - Twenty-first century infrastructure needs to respond to changing demographics, becoming climate neutral, resilient, and economically affordable, while remaining a driver for development and shared prosperity. However, the infrastructure sector remains one of the least innovative and digitalized, plagued by delays, cost overruns, and benefit shortfalls. The authors assessed trends and barriers in the planning and delivery of infrastructure based on secondary research, qualitative interviews with internationally leading experts, and expert workshops. The analysis concludes that the root-cause of the industry’s problems is the prevailing fragmentation of the infrastructure value chain and a lacking long-term vision for infrastructure. To help overcome these challenges, an integration of the value chain is needed. The authors propose that this could be achieved through a use-case-based, as well as vision and governance-driven creation of federated digital platforms applied to infrastructure projects and outline a concept. Digital platforms enable full-lifecycle participation and responsible governance guided by a shared infrastructure vision. This paper has contributed as policy recommendation to the Group of Twenty (G20) in 2021.

AB  - Wafer bonding technology is one of the most effective methods for high-quality thin-film transfer onto different substrates combined with ion implantation processes, laser irradiation, and the removal of the sacrificial layers. In this review, we systematically summarize and introduce applications of the thin films obtained by wafer bonding technology in the fields of electronics, optical devices, on-chip integrated mid-infrared sensors, and wearable sensors. The fabrication of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers based on the Smart CutTM process, heterogeneous integrations of wide-bandgap semiconductors, infrared materials, and electro-optical crystals via wafer bonding technology for thin-film transfer are orderly presented. Furthermore, device design and fabrication progress based on the platforms mentioned above is highlighted in this work. They demonstrate that the transferred films can satisfy high-performance power electronics, molecular sensors, and high-speed modulators for the next generation applications beyond 5G. Moreover, flexible composite structures prepared by the wafer bonding and de-bonding methods towards wearable electronics are reported. Finally, the outlooks and conclusions about the further development of heterogeneous structures that need to be achieved by the wafer bonding technology are discussed.

AB  - Energy management and exchange have increasingly shifted from concentrated to hierarchical modes. Numerous issues have arisen in the decentralized energy sector, including the storage of customer data and the need to ensure data integrity, fairness, and accountability in the transaction phase. The problem is that in the field of the innovative technology of blockchain and its applications, with the energy sector still in the developmental stages, there is still a need for more research to understand the full capacity of the technology in the field. The main aim of this work was to investigate the state of the current research of blockchain technologies as well as their application within the field of energy. This work also set out to identify certain research gaps and provide a set of recommendations for future directions. Among these research gaps is the application of blockchain in decentralized storage, the integration of blockchain with artificial intelligence, and security and privacy concerns, which have not received much attention despite their importance. An analysis of fifty-seven carefully reviewed studies revealed that the emerging blockchain which provides privacy-protection technologies in cryptography and other areas that can be integrated to address users’ privacy concerns is another aspect that needs further investigation. Grid operations, economies, and customers will all learn from blockchain technology as it provides disintermediation, confidentiality, and tamper-proof transfers. Moreover, it provides innovative ways for customers and small solar generators to participate more actively in the electricity sector and to benefit from their properties. Blockchains are a rapidly evolving field of research and growth. A study of this emerging technology is necessary to increase comprehension, to educate the body of expertise on blockchains, and to realize its potential. This study recommends that future work investigates the potential application of blockchain in the energy sector as well as the challenges that face its implementation from the perspective of policy makers. This future approach will enable researchers to direct their focus to the case studies approach, which will facilitate and ease the application of blockchain technology.

AB  - Two of the key information technologies with very high expectations to change our contemporary society are the fifth generation broadband cellular network technologies, which are already emerging to markets, and the foreseen sixth generation broadband cellular network technologies currently under research and development. The core promise of these next generation technologies lies especially in lower latency for providing users feedback on their behavior; thus, growing opportunities for influencing users in their everyday contexts. This viewpoint article seeks to discuss how these opportunities may impact future information technology in general and especially persuasive design and research before 2030. In addition, we will address challenges regarding the promise of 5G and 6G technologies. Information and communication technology can support individuals’ behavioral change only if they can access the technology. In this article, we will exemplify this by presenting possible ways to minimize the digital divide between rural and urban areas, wherein lies a general danger that the divide would increase further.

TI  - A Hybrid Population Distribution Prediction Approach Integrating LSTM and CA Models with Micro-Spatiotemporal Granularity: A Case Study of Chongming District, Shanghai

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Studying population prediction under micro-spatiotemporal granularity is of great significance for modern and refined urban traffic management and emergency response to disasters. Existing population studies are mostly based on census and statistical yearbook data due to the limitation of data collecting methods. However, with the advent of techniques in this information age, new emerging data sources with fine granularity and large sample sizes have provided rich materials and unique venues for population research. This article presents a new population prediction model with micro-spatiotemporal granularity based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) and cellular automata (CA) models. We aim at designing a hybrid data-driven model with good adaptability and scalability, which can be used in more refined population prediction. We not only try to integrate these two models, aiming to fully mine the spatiotemporal characteristics, but also propose a method that fuses multi-source geographic data. We tested its functionality using the data from Chongming District, Shanghai, China. The results demonstrated that, among all scenarios, the model trained by three consecutive days (ordinary dates), with the granularity of one hour, incorporated with road networks, achieves the best performance (0.905 as the mean absolute error) and generalization capability.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 16
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are generally considered to be the next generation of engineered systems. However, the actual application of CPSs in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is still at a low level. The sensing method in the construction process plays a very important role in the establishment of CPSs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the application potential of computer vision-based sensing methods and provide practical suggestions through a literature review. This paper provides a review of the current application of CPSs in the AEC industry, summarizes the current knowledge gaps, and discusses the problems with the current construction site sensing approach. Considering the unique advantages of the computer vision (CV) method at the construction site, the application of CV for different construction entities was reviewed and summarized to achieve a CV-based construction site sensing approach for construction process CPSs. The potential of CPS can be further stimulated by providing rich information from on-site sensing using CV methods. According to the review, this approach has unique advantages in the specific environment of the construction site. Based on the current knowledge gap identified in the literature review, this paper proposes a novel concept of visual-based construction site sensing method for CPS application, and an architecture for CV-based CPS is proposed as an implementation of this concept. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a CPS architecture using computer vision as the main information acquisition method based on the literature review. This architecture innovatively introduces computer vision as a sensing method of construction sites, and realizes low-cost and non-invasive information acquisition in complex construction scenarios. This method can be used as an important supplement to on-site sensing to further promote the automation and intelligence of the construction process.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology and provides connectivity among physical objects with the support of 5G communication. In recent decades, there have been a lot of applications based on IoT technology for the sustainability of smart cities, such as farming, e-healthcare, education, smart homes, weather monitoring, etc. These applications communicate in a collaborative manner between embedded IoT devices and systematize daily routine tasks. In the literature, many solutions facilitate remote users to gather the observed data by accessing the stored information on the cloud network and lead to smart systems. However, most of the solutions raise significant research challenges regarding information sharing in mobile IoT networks and must be able to stabilize the performance of smart operations in terms of security and intelligence. Many solutions are based on 5G communication to support high user mobility and increase the connectivity among a huge number of IoT devices. However, such approaches lack user and data privacy against anonymous threats and incur resource costs. In this paper, we present a mobility support 5G architecture with real-time routing for sustainable smart cities that aims to decrease the loss of data against network disconnectivity and increase the reliability for 5G-based public healthcare networks. The proposed architecture firstly establishes a mutual relationship among the nodes and mobile sink with shared secret information and lightweight processing. Secondly, multi-secured levels are proposed to protect the interaction with smart transmission systems by increasing the trust threshold over the insecure channels. The conducted experiments are analyzed, and it is concluded that their performance significantly increases the information sustainability for mobile networks in terms of security and routing.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The substantial advancements offered by the edge computing has indicated serious evolutionary improvements for the internet of things (IoT) technology. The rigid design philosophy of the traditional network architecture limits its scope to meet future demands. However, information centric networking (ICN) is envisioned as a promising architecture to bridge the huge gaps and maintain IoT networks, mostly referred as ICN-IoT. The edge-enabled ICN-IoT architecture always demands efficient in-network caching techniques for supporting better user’s quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we propose an enhanced ICN-IoT content caching strategy by enabling artificial intelligence (AI)-based collaborative filtering within the edge cloud to support heterogeneous IoT architecture. This collaborative filtering-based content caching strategy would intelligently cache content on edge nodes for traffic management at cloud databases. The evaluations has been conducted to check the performance of the proposed strategy over various benchmark strategies, such as LCE, LCD, CL4M, and ProbCache. The analytical results demonstrate the better performance of our proposed strategy with average gain of 15% for cache hit ratio, 12% reduction in content retrieval delay, and 28% reduced average hop count in comparison to best considered LCD. We believe that the proposed strategy will contribute an effective solution to the related studies in this domain.

AB  - Disasters pose a real threat to the lives and property of citizens; therefore, it is necessary to reduce their impact to the minimum possible. In order to achieve this goal, a framework for enhancing the current disaster management system was proposed, called the smart disaster management system. The smart aspect of this system is due to the application of the principles of information and communication technology, especially the Internet of Things. All participants and activities of the proposed system were clarified by preparing a conceptual design by using The Unified Modeling Language diagrams. This effort was made to overcome the lack of citizens’ readiness towards the use of information and communication technology as well as increase their readiness towards disasters. This study aims to develop conceptual design that can facilitate in development of smart management system for flooding disaster. This will assist in the design process of the Internet of Things systems in this regard.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Global plastic waste is increasing rapidly. In general, densely populated regions generate tons of plastic waste daily, which is sometimes disposed of on land or diverged to sea. Most of the plastics created in the form of waste have complex degradation behavior and are non-biodegradable by nature. These remain intact in the environment for a long time span and potentially originate complications within terrestrial and marine life ecosystems. The strategic management of plastic waste and recycling can preserve environmental species and associated costs. The key contribution in this work focuses on ongoing efforts to utilize plastic waste by introducing blockchain during plastic waste recycling. It is proposed that the efficiency of plastic recycling can be improved enormously by using the blockchain phenomenon. Automation for the segregation and collection of plastic waste can effectively establish a globally recognizable tool using blockchain-based applications. Collection and sorting of plastic recycling are feasible by keeping track of plastic with unique codes or digital badges throughout the supply chain. This approach can support a collaborative digital consortium for efficient plastic waste management, which can bring together multiple stakeholders, plastic manufacturers, government entities, retailers, suppliers, waste collectors, and recyclers.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The shift to e-commerce has changed many business areas. Real estate is one of the applications that has been affected by this modern technological wave. Recommender systems are intelligent models that assist users of real estate platforms in finding the best possible properties that fulfill their needs. However, the recommendation task is substantially more challenging in the real estate domain due to the many domain-specific limitations that impair typical recommender systems. For instance, real estate recommender systems usually face the clod-start problem where there are no historical logs for new users or new items, and the recommender system should provide recommendations for these new entities. Therefore, the recommender systems in the real estate market are different and substantially less studied than in other domains. In this article, we aim at providing a comprehensive and systematic literature review on applications of recommender systems in the real estate market. We evaluate a set of research articles (13 journal and 13 conference papers) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of real estate recommender systems. These papers have been reviewed and categorized based on their methodological approaches, the main challenges that they addressed, and their evaluation procedures. Based on these categorizations, we outlined some possible directions for future research.

SN  - 2227-9032

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been a worldwide catastrophe. Its impact, not only economically, but also socially and in terms of human lives, was unexpected. Each of the many mechanisms to fight the contagiousness of the illness has been proven to be extremely important. One of the most important mechanisms is the use of facemasks. However, the wearing the facemasks incorrectly makes this prevention method useless. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and especially facial recognition techniques can be used to detect misuses and reduce virus transmission, especially indoors. In this paper, we present an intelligent method to automatically detect when facemasks are being worn incorrectly in real-time scenarios. Our proposal uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with transfer learning to detect not only if a mask is used or not, but also other errors that are usually not taken into account but that may contribute to the virus spreading. The main problem that we have detected is that there is currently no training set for this task. It is for this reason that we have requested the participation of citizens by taking different selfies through an app and placing the mask in different positions. Thus, we have been able to solve this problem. The results show that the accuracy achieved with transfer learning slightly improves the accuracy achieved with convolutional neural networks. Finally, we have also developed an Android-app demo that validates the proposal in real scenarios.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 5

SN  - 2413-8851

AB  - Increasingly urbanized populations and climate change have shifted the focus of decision makers from economic growth to the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructure and communities, especially when communities face multiple hazards and need to recover from recurring disasters. Understanding human behavior and its interactions with built environments in disasters requires disciplinary crossover to explain its complexity, therefore we apply the lens of complex adaptive systems (CAS) to review disaster studies across disciplines. Disasters can be understood to consist of three interacting systems: (1) the physical system, consisting of geological, ecological, and human-built systems; (2) the social system, consisting of informal and formal human collective behavior; and (3) the individual actor system. Exploration of human behavior in these systems shows that CAS properties of heterogeneity, interacting subsystems, emergence, adaptation, and learning are integral, not just to cities, but to disaster studies and connecting them in the CAS framework provides us with a new lens to study disasters across disciplines. This paper explores the theories and models used in disaster studies, provides a framework to study and explain disasters, and discusses how complex adaptive systems can support theory building in disaster science for promoting more sustainable and resilient cities.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) workflow applications have been rapidly growing in practice. These internet-based applications can run on the distributed healthcare sensing system, which combines mobile computing, edge computing and cloud computing. Offloading and scheduling are the required methods in the distributed network. However, a security issue exists and it is hard to run different types of tasks (e.g., security, delay-sensitive, and delay-tolerant tasks) of IoMT applications on heterogeneous computing nodes. This work proposes a new healthcare architecture for workflow applications based on heterogeneous computing nodes layers: an application layer, management layer, and resource layer. The goal is to minimize the makespan of all applications. Based on these layers, the work proposes a secure offloading-efficient task scheduling (SEOS) algorithm framework, which includes the deadline division method, task sequencing rules, homomorphic security scheme, initial scheduling, and the variable neighbourhood searching method. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed plans outperform all existing baseline approaches for healthcare applications in terms of makespan.

AB  - A positive energy system that produces more renewable energy than its demand while ensuring appropriate comfort levels is an excellent path towards increasing the portion of renewable energy, reducing carbon emission, and increasing the energy system’s overall performance. In particular, it has been believed as step forward towards zero energy systems. Recent progress in positive energy building and community levels is gaining interest among different stakeholders. However, an inadequate understanding of the positive energy system is widely noticed in many projects, and a shortage of standard details on the positive energy system still prevails in the research community. Therefore, a state-of-the-art review of positive energy building and community is conducted in this paper. Firstly, this paper begins with the definitions and concepts of positive energy buildings and communities. Secondly, it comprehensively describes the energy supplies, demands, indicators, storage, energy management, roles of stakeholders, and bottlenecks of positive energy systems. Thirdly, the main differences between positive energy buildings and communities are summarized. Fourthly, the impact of smart energy grids and new energy vehicles on the positive energy buildings and communities is derived. As a conclusion, this paper shows that even though all the energy-efficient buildings such as passive buildings, nearly zero energy buildings, zero energy buildings, positive energy buildings look like an up-trending scale of renewable penetration, considerable differences are visible among all, and the same thing applies to the community level. Furthermore, considerable differences exist when comparing between positive buildings and communities regarding both the technical and economic perspectives.

AB  - Recently, many companies have adopted smart factories to increase productivity and efficiency. However, the fashion industry is one of the industries that have been relatively slow at embracing automation and switching to a smart factory. The purpose of the study is to suggest the future direction of the low-maturity smart factory in the fashion industry through newspaper analysis. In this study, semantic network analysis and convergence of iterated correlation (CONCOR) analysis were performed on 15,523 news articles. The analyses revealed that the smart fashion factory was developing to incorporate automated, unmanned, and intelligent operation. The problem of job loss owing to the smart factory was also heavily addressed in the news articles. In the newspaper articles, the view that the smart factory is efficient, fast, and innovative, and concerns regarding the possible damages that will result from hacking and machine malfunction were simultaneously expressed. Therefore, if news about security improvement emerges in the future, negative public opinion will be reduced, positively influencing the government’s support for smart factories and policy making.

AB  - Smart cities connect people and places using innovative technologies such as Data Mining (DM), Machine Learning (ML), big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper presents a bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of studies associated with DM technologies used in smart cities applications. The study aims to identify the main DM techniques used in the context of smart cities and how the research field of DM for smart cities evolves over time. We adopted both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the topic. We used the Scopus database to find relative articles published in scientific journals. This study covers 197 articles published over the period from 2013 to 2021. For the bibliometric analysis, we used the Biliometrix library, developed in R. Our findings show that there is a wide range of DM technologies used in every layer of a smart city project. Several ML algorithms, supervised or unsupervised, are adopted for operating the instrumentation, middleware, and application layer. The bibliometric analysis shows that DM for smart cities is a fast-growing scientific field. Scientists from all over the world show a great interest in researching and collaborating on this interdisciplinary scientific field.

TI  - The Improvement of Air Quality and Associated Mortality during the COVID-19 Lockdown in One Megacity of China: An Empirical Strategy

AB  - Although the lockdown policy implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic indeed improved the air quality and reduced the related health risks, the real effects of the lockdown and its resulting health risks remain unclear considering the effects of unobserved confounders and the longstanding efforts of the government regarding air pollution. We compared air pollution between the lockdown period and the period before the lockdown using a difference-in-differences (DID) model and estimated the mortality burden caused by the number of deaths related to air pollution changes. The NO2 and CO concentrations during the lockdown period (17 days) declined by 8.94 μg/m3 (relative change: 16.94%; 95% CI: 3.71, 14.16) and 0.20 mg/m3 (relative change: 16.95%; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.35) on an average day, respectively, and O3 increased by 8.41 μg/m3 (relative change: 32.80%; 95% CI: 4.39, 12.43); no meaningful impacts of the lockdown policy on the PM2.5, PM10, SO2, or the AQI values were observed. Based on the three clearly changed air pollutants, the lockdown policy prevented 8.22 (95% CI: 3.97, 12.49) all-cause deaths. Our findings suggest that the overall excess deaths caused by air pollution during the lockdown period declined. It is beneficial for human health when strict control measures, such as upgrading industry structure and promoting green transportation, are taken to reduce emissions, especially in cities with serious air pollution in China, such as Shijiazhuang.

TI  - Automating Visual Blockage Classification of Culverts with Deep Learning
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 16
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Blockage of culverts by transported debris materials is reported as the salient contributor in originating urban flash floods. Conventional hydraulic modeling approaches had no success in addressing the problem primarily because of the unavailability of peak floods hydraulic data and the highly non-linear behavior of debris at the culvert. This article explores a new dimension to investigate the issue by proposing the use of intelligent video analytics (IVA) algorithms for extracting blockage related information. The presented research aims to automate the process of manual visual blockage classification of culverts from a maintenance perspective by remotely applying deep learning models. The potential of using existing convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms (i.e., DarkNet53, DenseNet121, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MobileNet, ResNet50, VGG16, EfficientNetB3, NASNet) is investigated over a dataset from three different sources (i.e., images of culvert openings and blockage (ICOB), visual hydrology-lab dataset (VHD), synthetic images of culverts (SIC)) to predict the blockage in a given image. Models were evaluated based on their performance on the test dataset (i.e., accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1 score, Jaccard Index, region of convergence (ROC) curve), floating point operations per second (FLOPs) and response times to process a single test instance. Furthermore, the performance of deep learning models was benchmarked against conventional machine learning algorithms (i.e., SVM, RF, xgboost). In addition, the idea of classifying deep visual features extracted by CNN models (i.e., ResNet50, MobileNet) using conventional machine learning approaches was also implemented in this article. From the results, NASNet was reported most efficient in classifying the blockage images with the 5-fold accuracy of 85%; however, MobileNet was recommended for the hardware implementation because of its improved response time with 5-fold accuracy comparable to NASNet (i.e., 78%). Comparable performance to standard CNN models was achieved for the case where deep visual features were classified using conventional machine learning approaches. False negative (FN) instances, false positive (FP) instances and CNN layers activation suggested that background noise and oversimplified labelling criteria were two contributing factors in the degraded performance of existing CNN algorithms. A framework for partial automation of the visual blockage classification process was proposed, given that none of the existing models was able to achieve high enough accuracy to completely automate the manual process. In addition, a detection-classification pipeline with higher blockage classification accuracy (i.e., 94%) has been proposed as a potential future direction for practical implementation.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In this work, we examine the privacy and safety issues of Internet of Things (IoT)-based Precision Agriculture (PA), which could lead to the problem that industry is currently experiencing as a result of Intellectual Property Theft (IPT). Increasing IoT-based information flow in PA will make a system less secure if a proper security mechanism is not ensured. Shortly, IoT will transform everyday lives with its applications. Intellectual Property (IP) is another important concept of an intelligent farming system. If the IP of a wise farming system leaks, it damages all intellectual ideas like cultivation patterns, plant variety rights, and IoT generated information of IoT-based PA. Thus, we proposed an IoT enabled SDN gateway regulatory system that ensures control of a foreign device without having access to sensitive farm information. Most of the farm uses its devices without the use of its integrated management and memory unit. An SDN-based structure to solve IP theft in precision farming has been proposed. In our proposed concept, a control system integrates with the cloud server, which is called the control hub. This hub will carry out the overall PA monitoring system. By hiring the farm devices in the agricultural system, these devices must be tailored according to our systems. Therefore, our proposed PA is a management system for all controllable inputs. The overall goal is to increase the probability of profit and reduce the likelihood of IPT. It does not only give more information but also improves information securely by enhancing the overall performance of PA. Our proposed PA architecture has been measured based on the throughput, round trip time, jitter, packet error rate, and the cumulative distribution function. Our achieved results reduced around (1.66–6.46)% compared to the previous research. In the future, blockchain will be integrated with this proposed architecture for further implementation.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - With the exponential growth of science, Internet of Things (IoT) innovation, and expanding significance in renewable energy, Smart Grid has become an advanced innovative thought universally as a solution for the power demand increase around the world. The smart grid is the most practical trend of effective transmission of present-day power assets. The paper aims to survey the present literature concerning predictive maintenance and different types of faults that could be detected within the smart grid. Four databases (Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science) were searched between 2012 and 2020. Sixty-five (n = 65) were chosen based on specified exclusion and inclusion criteria. Fifty-seven percent (n = 37/65) of the studies analyzed the issues from predictive maintenance perspectives, while about 18% (n = 12/65) focused on factors-related review studies on the smart grid and about 15% (n = 10/65) focused on factors related to the experimental study. The remaining 9% (n = 6/65) concentrated on fields related to the challenges and benefits of the study. The significance of predictive maintenance has been developing over time in connection with Industry 4.0 revolution. The paper’s fundamental commitment is the outline and overview of faults in the smart grid such as fault location and detection. Therefore, advanced methods of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can enhance and improve the reliability and resilience of smart grid systems. For future direction, we aim to supply a deep understanding of Smart meters to detect or monitor faults in the smart grid as it is the primary IoT sensor in an AMI.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines six levels of driving automation, ranging from Level 0 to Level 5. Automated driving systems perform entire dynamic driving tasks for Levels 3–5 automated vehicles. Delegating dynamic driving tasks from driver to automated driving systems can eliminate crashes attributed to driver errors. Sharing status, sharing intent, seeking agreement, or sharing prescriptive information between road users and vehicles dedicated to automated driving systems can further enhance dynamic driving task performance, safety, and traffic operations. Extensive simulation is required to reduce operating costs and achieve an acceptable risk level before testing cooperative automated driving systems in laboratory environments, test tracks, or public roads. Cooperative automated driving systems can be simulated using a vehicle dynamics simulation tool (e.g., CarMaker and CarSim) or a traffic microsimulation tool (e.g., Vissim and Aimsun). Vehicle dynamics simulation tools are mainly used for verification and validation purposes on a small scale, while traffic microsimulation tools are mainly used for verification purposes on a large scale. Vehicle dynamics simulation tools can simulate longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dynamics for only a few vehicles in each scenario (e.g., up to ten vehicles in CarMaker and up to twenty vehicles in CarSim). Conventional traffic microsimulation tools can simulate vehicle-following, lane-changing, and gap-acceptance behaviors for many vehicles in each scenario without simulating vehicle powertrain. Vehicle dynamics simulation tools are more compute-intensive but more accurate than traffic microsimulation tools. Due to software architecture or computing power limitations, simplifying assumptions underlying convectional traffic microsimulation tools may have been a necessary compromise long ago. There is, therefore, a need for a simulation tool to optimize computational complexity and accuracy to simulate many vehicles in each scenario with reasonable accuracy. This research proposes a traffic microsimulation tool that employs a simplified vehicle powertrain model and a model-based fault detection method to simulate many vehicles with reasonable accuracy at each simulation time step under noise and unknown inputs. Our traffic microsimulation tool considers driver characteristics, vehicle model, grade, pavement conditions, operating mode, vehicle-to-vehicle communication vulnerabilities, and traffic conditions to estimate longitudinal control variables with reasonable accuracy at each simulation time step for many conventional vehicles, vehicles dedicated to automated driving systems, and vehicles equipped with cooperative automated driving systems. Proposed vehicle-following model and longitudinal control functions are verified for fourteen vehicle models, operating in manual, automated, and cooperative automated modes over two driving schedules under three malicious fault magnitudes on transmitted accelerations.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Recent technological advancements in geomatics and mobile sensing have led to various urban big data, such as Tencent street view (TSV) photographs; yet, the urban objects in the big dataset have hitherto been inadequately exploited. This paper aims to propose a pedestrian analytics approach named vectors of uncountable and countable objects for clustering and analysis (VUCCA) for processing 530,000 TSV photographs of Hong Kong Island. First, VUCCA transductively adopts two pre-trained deep models to TSV photographs for extracting pedestrians and surrounding pixels into generalizable semantic vectors of features, including uncountable objects such as vegetation, sky, paved pedestrian path, and guardrail and countable objects such as cars, trucks, pedestrians, city animals, and traffic lights. Then, the extracted pedestrians are semantically clustered using the vectors, e.g., for understanding where they usually stand. Third, pedestrians are semantically indexed using relations and activities (e.g., walking behind a guardrail, road-crossing, carrying a backpack, or walking a pet) for queries of unstructured photographic instances or natural language clauses. The experiment results showed that the pedestrians detected in the TSV photographs were successfully clustered into meaningful groups and indexed by the semantic vectors. The presented VUCCA can enrich eye-level urban features into computational semantic vectors for pedestrians to enable smart city research in urban geography, urban planning, real estate, transportation, conservation, and other disciplines.

T2  - Algorithms

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - Many smart city and society applications such as smart health (elderly care, medical applications), smart surveillance, sports, and robotics require the recognition of user activities, an important class of problems known as human activity recognition (HAR). Several issues have hindered progress in HAR research, particularly due to the emergence of fog and edge computing, which brings many new opportunities (a low latency, dynamic and real-time decision making, etc.) but comes with its challenges. This paper focuses on addressing two important research gaps in HAR research: (i) improving the HAR prediction accuracy and (ii) managing the frequent changes in the environment and data related to user activities. To address this, we propose an HAR method based on Soft-Voting and Self-Learning (SVSL). SVSL uses two strategies. First, to enhance accuracy, it combines the capabilities of Deep Learning (DL), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and AdaBoost classifiers using soft-voting. Second, to classify the most challenging data instances, the SVSL method is equipped with a self-training mechanism that generates training data and retrains itself. We investigate the performance of our proposed SVSL method using two publicly available datasets on six human activities related to lying, sitting, and walking positions. The first dataset consists of 562 features and the second dataset consists of five features. The data are collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope smartphone sensors. The results show that the proposed method provides 6.26%, 1.75%, 1.51%, and 4.40% better prediction accuracy (average over the two datasets) compared to GLM, DL, RF, and AdaBoost, respectively. We also analyze and compare the class-wise performance of the SVSL methods with that of DL, GLM, RF, and AdaBoost.

AB  - Smart cities need (sensor) data for better decision-making. However, while there are vast amounts of data available about and from cities, an intermediary is needed that connects and interprets (sensor) data on a Web-scale. Today, governments in Europe are struggling to publish open data in a sustainable, predictable and cost-effective way. Our research question considers what methods for publishing Linked Open Data time series, in particular air quality data, are suitable in a sustainable and cost-effective way. Furthermore, we demonstrate the cross-domain applicability of our data publishing approach through a different use case on railway infrastructure—Linked Open Data. Based on scenarios co-created with various governmental stakeholders, we researched methods to promote data interoperability, scalability and flexibility. The results show that applying a Linked Data Fragments-based approach on public endpoints for air quality and railway infrastructure data, lowers the cost of publishing and increases availability due to better Web caching strategies.

AB  - Address is a structured description used to identify a specific place or point of interest, and it provides an effective way to locate people or objects. The standardization of Chinese place name and address occupies an important position in the construction of a smart city. Traditional address specification technology often adopts methods based on text similarity or rule bases, which cannot handle complex, missing, and redundant address information well. This paper transforms the task of address standardization into calculating the similarity of address pairs, and proposes a contrast learning address matching model based on the attention-Bi-LSTM-CNN network (ABLC). First of all, ABLC use the Trie syntax tree algorithm to extract Chinese address elements. Next, based on the basic idea of contrast learning, a hybrid neural network is applied to learn the semantic information in the address. Finally, Manhattan distance is calculated as the similarity of the two addresses. Experiments on the self-constructed dataset with data augmentation demonstrate that the proposed model has better stability and performance compared with other baselines.

AB  - The increasing use of electric vehicles in road and air transportation, especially in last-mile delivery and city mobility, raises new operational challenges due to the limited capacity of electric batteries. These limitations impose additional driving range constraints when optimizing the distribution and mobility plans. During the last years, several researchers from the Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research communities have been developing optimization, simulation, and machine learning approaches that aim at generating efficient and sustainable routing plans for hybrid fleets, including both electric and internal combustion engine vehicles. After contextualizing the relevance of electric vehicles in promoting sustainable transportation practices, this paper reviews the existing work in the field of electric vehicle routing problems. In particular, we focus on articles related to the well-known vehicle routing, arc routing, and team orienteering problems. The review is followed by numerical examples that illustrate the gains that can be obtained by employing optimization methods in the aforementioned field. Finally, several research opportunities are highlighted.

AB  - One of the key challenges of developing countries is to tackle the mitigation of the impacts of rapid and uncontrolled urbanization. Assessing this phenomenon is crucial to lessen the consequences for the environment and society. ‘Literature has been concentrated in planning strategies for the cities’ adaptation and engagements to the principles of green development ensuring a long-term quality of life for their citizens. Hereby, smart technologies and applications consist of two of the most encouraging concepts for solutions for achieving the 2030 and 2050 horizon targets towards clean energy transition and carbon neutrality. In academia, scholars have already raised the importance of ‘smartness’ to define the adaptative patterns for the global pressures of climate change and uncontrolled urban growth. The mitigation of these phenomena is crucial to ensure the cities’ future and lessen their impacts. This study seeks a strategic and smart-driven vision to leverage smartness on the phenomenon of rapid urbanization that occurred in the case of Beijing, China. Defining and evaluating the environmental impacts in line with the RIAM approach as one of its main targets. Future works can be focused on addressing solutions in similar cases in further developing countries to not only overcome environmental, but also economic, social, and digital complications.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The problem of structural imbalance in terms of supply and demand due to changes in traffic patterns by time zone has been continuously raised in the mobility market. In Korea, unlike large overseas cities, the waiting time tolerance increases during the daytime when supply far exceeds demand, resulting in a large loss of operating profit. The purpose of this study is to increase taxi demand and further improve driver’s profits through real-time fare discounts during off-peak daytime hours in Seoul, Korea. To this end, we propose a real-time fare bidding system among taxi drivers based on a dynamic pricing scheme and simulate the appropriate fare discount level for each regional time zone. The driver-to-driver fare competition system consists of simulating fare competition based on the multi-agent Deep Q-Network method after developing a fare discount index that reflects the supply and demand level of each region in 25 districts in Seoul. According to the optimal fare discount level analysis in the off-peak hours, the lower the OI Index, which means the level of demand relative to supply, the higher the fare discount rate. In addition, an analysis of drivers’ profits and matching rates according to the distance between the origin and destination of each region showed up to 89% and 65% of drivers who actively offered discounts on fares. The results of this study in the future can serve as the foundation of a fare adjustment system for varying demand and supply situations in the Korean mobility market.

AB  - CRISP-DM (cross-industry standard process for data mining) methodology was developed as an intuitive tool for data scientists, to help them with applying Big Data methods in the complex technological environment of Industry 4.0. The review of numerous recent papers and studies uncovered that most of papers focus either on the application of existing methods in case studies, summarizing existing knowledge, or developing new methods for a certain kind of problem. Although all of these types of research are productive and required, we identified a lack of complex best practices for a specific field. Therefore, our goal is to propose best practices for the data analysis in production industry. The foundation of our proposal is based on three main points: the CRISP-DM methodology as the theoretical framework, the literature overview as an expression of current needs and interests in the field of data analysis, and case studies of projects we were directly involved in as a source of real-world experience. The results are presented as lists of the most common problems for selected phases (‘Data Preparation’ and ‘Modelling’), proposal of possible solutions, and diagrams for these phases. These recommendations can help other data scientists avoid certain problems or choose the best way to approach them.

AB  - Evaluation and monitoring of wireless sensor networks (WSN) and the parameters defining their operations and design, such as energy consumption, latency, and stability, is a complex task due to interaction with real devices. For greater control of these variables, the use of simulators arises as an alternative. Cooja is a WSN simulator/emulator which handles the devices’ controllers and multiple communication protocol implementations, such as RPL (RPL is one of the most used protocol in IoT). However, Cooja does not consider either the implementation of an energy model (it has infinite energy consumption) nor the visual behavior of the topology construction, although these aspects are crucial for effective network analysis and decision taking. This paper presents the design and the implementation of ViTool-BC, a software built on top of Cooja, which allows the creation of different energy estimation models and also to visualize in real time the behavior of WSN topology construction. In addition, ViTool-BC offers a heat map of energy consumption traces. Therefore, this tool helps researchers to monitor in real time the topology construction, node disconnection, and battery depletion, aspects to be considered in the analysis of the available routing protocols in Cooja.

AB  - This review paper examines the past, present, and future of sustainable consumption and production (SCP). The history of the Sustainable Development Goal No. 12 (i.e., to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns) is presented and analyzed. A definition of the sustainable consumption is given and the role of education is explained. The present status and existing trends of SCP are introduced by analyzing unsustainable behavior and the existing dilemma, namely sustainable growth or degrowth. A very broad range of methods is used for measuring and evaluating SCP within sustainable development. To forecast the future of SCP, important trends are presented. The future development of SCP will follow several megatrends and it will require reduced personal and collective consumption (degrowth). Energy usage in buildings, renewable energy sources, and energy storage will be important in that respect. Transportation emissions will continue to be lowered. Waste, especially food waste, shall be reduced, and consumer products shall become more durable. All waste must be collected and separated to be reused. SPC is elaborated in view of the two approaches—Industry 4.0 (smart factory), and the “Sixth Wave” evolution. Net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, resource efficiency, and zero waste will be at the forefront of future activities. A circular economy requires extension of product lifetimes, and the reuse and recycling of products. Reducing emissions, pollution and specific energy, water, and raw material usage (especially critical raw materials), as well as the role of digitalization, will be important.

AB  - The widespread adoption of wearables, extended reality, and metaverses has accelerated the diverse configurations of remote collaboration and telementoring systems. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of interactive telementoring, especially for wearers of smartglasses. In particular, recent relevant studies are reviewed to derive the needs and trends of telementoring technology. Based on this analysis, we define what can be integrated into smartglass-enabled interactive telementoring. To further illustrate this type of special use case for telementoring, we present five illustrative and descriptive scenarios. We expect our specialized use case to support various telementoring applications beyond medical and surgical telementoring, while harmoniously fostering cooperation using the smart devices of mentors and mentees at different scales for collocated, distributed, and remote collaboration.

TI  - Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Fire Safety of Agricultural Structures

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 16
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Artificial intelligence applications in fire safety of agricultural structures have practical economic and technological benefits on commercial agriculture. The FAO estimates that wildfires result in at least USD 1 billion in agriculture-related losses due to the destruction of livestock pasture, destruction of agricultural buildings, premature death of farm animals, and general disruption of agricultural activities. Even though artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and adaptive neurofuzzy inference systems (ANFISs), among others, have proven useful in fire prevention, their application is limited in real farm environments. Most farms rely on traditional/non-technology-based methods of fire prevention. The case for AI in agricultural fire prevention is grounded on the accuracy and reliability of computer simulations in smoke movement analysis, risk assessment, and postfire analysis. In addition, such technologies can be coupled with next-generation fire-retardant materials such as intumescent coatings with a polymer binder, blowing agent, carbon donor, and acid donor. Future prospects for AI in agriculture transcend basic fire safety to encompass Society 5.0, energy systems in smart cities, UAV monitoring, Agriculture 4.0, and decentralized energy. However, critical challenges must be overcome, including the health and safety aspects, cost, and reliability. In brief, AI offers unlimited potential in the prevention of fire hazards in farms, but the existing body of knowledge is inadequate.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 16
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data represent a source of information in real time not only about electricity consumption but also as an indicator of other social, demographic, and economic dynamics within a city. This paper presents a Data Analytics/Big Data framework applied to AMI data as a tool to leverage the potential of this data within the applications in a Smart City. The framework includes three fundamental aspects. First, the architectural view places AMI within the Smart Grids Architecture Model-SGAM. Second, the methodological view describes the transformation of raw data into knowledge represented by the DIKW hierarchy and the NIST Big Data interoperability model. Finally, a binding element between the two views is represented by human expertise and skills to obtain a deeper understanding of the results and transform knowledge into wisdom. Our new view faces the challenges arriving in energy markets by adding a binding element that gives support for optimal and efficient decision-making. To show how our framework works, we developed a case study. The case implements each component of the framework for a load forecasting application in a Colombian Retail Electricity Provider (REP). The MAPE for some of the REP’s markets was less than 5%. In addition, the case shows the effect of the binding element as it raises new development alternatives and becomes a feedback mechanism for more assertive decision making.

AB  - Smart cities are an extremely important, multi-faceted subject, both in terms of their practical aspects and in terms of research. This is expressed, among other things, in the multitude of approaches to this concept. These approaches differ based on the emphasis placed on individual aspects: some focus more on technology, and others put more weight on social issues, while still others value sustainable development issues. Currently, an important topic of discussion about the development of the smart city—the importance of which has become even greater in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic—is the digital transformation of the city. The use of robotic process automation (RPA) tools can be a part of such a transformation, as such tools, using advanced software, enable the automation of those tasks carried out thus far by humans. Although such an approach has, to date, been widespread in the case of enterprises (in particular, those operating in the financial and BPO/SSC sectors, but less often in the utilities sector, the first applications of these solutions in the context of process automation for cities are also beginning to emerge in various parts of the world. This article is based on a case study approach. The implementation conditions (including the constraints) of such an approach, the benefits achieved, and the lessons learned (which can be important for other local government units) are outlined using the example of the Bydgoszcz city hall’s (Poland) electricity billing document management. The results of the case study presented here lead to the conclusion that the use of RPA tools enables, very quickly and at relatively low cost, measurable results to be achieved that are related to the processing of electricity billing documentation for the city of Bydgoszcz. This allows the assertion to be made that robotic process automation can be taken into consideration as one of the tools used to build smart cities.

AB  - According to the security breach level index, millions of records are stolen worldwide on every single day. Personal health records are the most targeted records on the internet, and they are considered sensitive, and valuable. Security and privacy are the most important parameters of cryptography and encryption. They reduce the availability of data on patients and healthcare to the appropriate personnel and ultimately lead to a barrier in the transfer of healthcare into a digital health system. Using a permission blockchain to share healthcare data can reduce security and privacy issues. According to the literature, most healthcare systems rely on a centralized system, which is more prone to security vulnerabilities. The existing blockchain-based healthcare schemes provide only a data-sharing framework, but they lack security and privacy. To cope with these kinds of security issues, we have designed a novel security algorithm that provides security as well as privacy with much better efficiency and a lower cost. Hence, in this research, we have proposed a patient healthcare framework that provides greater security, reliability, and authentication compared to existing blockchain-based access control.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - Smart city is a collective term for technologies and concepts that are directed toward making cities efficient, technologically more advanced, greener and more socially inclusive. These concepts include technical, economic and social innovations. This term has been tossed around by various actors in politics, business, administration and urban planning since the 2000s to establish tech-based changes and innovations in urban areas. The idea of the smart city is used in conjunction with the utilization of digital technologies and at the same time represents a reaction to the economic, social and political challenges that post-industrial societies are confronted with at the start of the new millennium. The key focus is on dealing with challenges faced by urban society, such as environmental pollution, demographic change, population growth, healthcare, the financial crisis or scarcity of resources. In a broader sense, the term also includes non-technical innovations that make urban life more sustainable. So far, the idea of using IoT-based sensor networks for healthcare applications is a promising one with the potential of minimizing inefficiencies in the existing infrastructure. A machine learning approach is key to successful implementation of the IoT-powered wireless sensor networks for this purpose since there is large amount of data to be handled intelligently. Throughout this paper, it will be discussed in detail how AI-powered IoT and WSNs are applied in the healthcare sector. This research will be a baseline study for understanding the role of the IoT in smart cities, in particular in the healthcare sector, for future research works.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The epidemic disease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) called COVID-19 has become a more frequently active disease. Managing and monitoring COVID-19 patients is still a challenging issue for advanced technologies. The first and foremost critical issue in COVID-19 is to diagnose it timely and cut off the chain of transmission by isolating the susceptible and patients. COVID-19 spreads through close interaction and contact with an infected person. It has affected the entire world, and every country is facing the challenges of having adequate medical facilities along with the availability of medical staff in rural and urban areas that have a high number of patients due to the pandemic. Due to the invasive method of treatment, SARS-COVID is spreading swiftly. In this paper, we propose an intelligent health monitoring framework using wearable Internet of Things (IoT) and Geo-fencing for COVID-19 susceptible and patient monitoring, and isolation and quarantine management to control the pandemic. The proposed system consists of four layers, and each layer has different functionality: a wearable sensors layer, IoT gateway layer, cloud server layer, and client application layer for visualization and analysis. The wearable sensors layer consists of wearable biomedical and GPS sensors for physiological parameters, and GPS and Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator acquisition for health monitoring and user Geo-fencing. The IoT gateway layer provides a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi based wireless body area network and IoT environment for data transmission anytime and anywhere. Cloud servers use Raspberry Pi and ThingSpeak cloud for data analysis and web-based application layers for remote monitoring based on user consent. The susceptible and patient conditions, real-time sensor’s data, and Geo-fencing enables minimizing the spread through close interaction. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TI  - An In-Depth Analysis of Parking Patterns in a Typical Chinese Danwei via Customized Data Collection App
T2  - ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 8
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The danwei is a distinctive spatial unit in China, as a legacy of the Maoist era. In a danwei, state-owned enterprises supplied a full set of facilities, such that people’s daily activities did not often extend beyond their danweis. However, with the rapid alteration of civic social space in Chinese cities, many employees are no longer tied to a particular danwei. Traditional Chinese danweis have suddenly been faced with a shortage of car-parking space. In the context of the municipal call for danweis to “dismantle the walls and open up for traffic microcirculation”, this study aims to propose a practical approach that analyzes the parking status in a typical danwei. Based on both the parking data collected via a self-designed smartphone application and the survey data collected via questionnaires, the approach analyzes the parking situation in terms of four aspects, including hot parking zones, dynamic parking demand, vehicle parking behaviors, and perceptions of the parking situation. We conducted the experiment on the Information Department Campus of Wuhan University, which is a typical Chinese danwei with complicated surroundings. The results indicate non-negligible issues in the current parking situation, such as vulnerabilities in parking resource management, and a contradiction between supply and demand. Based on the results, we recommend possible strategies to alleviate the tense parking situation and we are confident of the feasibility of opening danwei roads first instead of opening parking facilities, as a response to “open up” the danweis. This study may serve as a representative example of how danweis should analyze their current parking situation and how to respond to the municipality’s suggestions: using modern technology to conduct data collection, perform in-depth and detailed analysis, and synthesize explicit localized policy.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Nowadays, the internet of things (IoT) is used to generate data in several application domains. A logistic regression, which is a standard machine learning algorithm with a wide application range, is built on such data. Nevertheless, building a powerful and effective logistic regression model requires large amounts of data. Thus, collaboration between multiple IoT participants has often been the go-to approach. However, privacy concerns and poor data quality are two challenges that threaten the success of such a setting. Several studies have proposed different methods to address the privacy concern but to the best of our knowledge, little attention has been paid towards addressing the poor data quality problems in the multi-party logistic regression model. Thus, in this study, we propose a multi-party privacy-preserving logistic regression framework with poor quality data filtering for IoT data contributors to address both problems. Specifically, we propose a new metric gradient similarity in a distributed setting that we employ to filter out parameters from data contributors with poor quality data. To solve the privacy challenge, we employ homomorphic encryption. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations using real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework is privacy-preserving and robust against poor quality data.

Given the growing number of drones in low-altitude airspace, linking drones to form the Internet of drones (IoD) is a highly desirable trend to improve the safety as well as the quality of flight. However, there remain security, privacy, and communication issues related to IoD. In this paper, we discuss the key requirements of security, privacy, and communication and we present a taxonomy of IoD based on the most relevant considerations. Furthermore, we present the most commonly used commercial case studies and address the latest advancements and solutions proposed for the IoD environments. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future research directions of IoD.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) can help to pave the way to the circular economy and to a more sustainable world by enabling the digitalization of many operations and processes, such as water distribution, preventive maintenance, or smart manufacturing. Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries. Overall, this article provides guidelines that will help future developers to face the challenges that will arise when creating the next generation of Edge-AI G-IoT systems.

SN  - 2077-0472

AB  - In the greenhouse environment, the application of complex event processing (CEP) technology can effectively tackle the problem of recognition of the complex patterns that appeared in greenhouse conditions. In the existing research, few scholars have proposed a scheme to integrate complicated scenes within the greenhouse environment with high efficiency, convenience, and low coupling. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of hard recognition and fusion of complex patterns in the greenhouse environment, based on the characteristics of the greenhouse, this paper proposes a complex event processing method for greenhouse control. Our method has high applicability and high expansibility, including 13 types of event processing agents and 21 types of typical events involved in greenhouse automatic control. This method has the advantages of low information coupling and multi-domain integration, which can be directly used by agricultural experts and related workers and is of great significance to promote the extensive application of CEP technology in the greenhouse field. Our experiment successfully realized a greenhouse intelligent control system based on CEP technology is successfully realized in our experiment. The experimental statistics shows that the structure of the control system was accessible and effective.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Nowadays, many organizations and individual users are employing cloud services extensively due to their efficiency, reliability and low cost. A key aspect for cloud data centers is to achieve management methods to reduce energy consumption, increasing the profit and reducing the environmental impact, which is critical in the deployment of leading-edge technologies today such as blockchain and digital finances, IoT, online gaming and video streaming. In this review, various clustering, optimization, and machine learning methods used in cloud resource allocation to increase the energy efficiency and performance are analyzed, compared and classified. Specifically, on the one hand, we discuss how clustering methods and optimization techniques are widely applied in energy management due to their capacity to provide solutions for energy consumption reduction. On the other hand, we study how multi-objective optimization methods focus on reducing energy consumption as well as service level agreement (SLA) violation, and improving quality of services (QoS) simultaneously. Also, we discuss how optimization methods such as the firefly algorithm, whale optimization algorithm (WOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) provide the highest performance in the field. Moreover, we analyze how machine learning methods such as deep neural network (DNN), random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to the prediction of energy consumption in the cloud, showing an accurate performance in this prediction. Nevertheless, we study how the existing methods still have limitations of low convergence, trap into local optima and overfitting.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Energy consumption in Bangladesh increased for economic, industrial, and digitalization growth. Reductions in conventional sources such as natural gas (54%) and coal (5.6%) are calls to enhance renewable resources. This paper aims to investigate the atmospheric variables for potential wind zones and develop a statistical power-forecasting model. The study-site is Bangladesh, focusing on eight divisions across two regions. First, the southern zone includes Dhaka (Capital), Chittagong, Barishal, and Khulna. The northern regions are Rajshahi, Rangpur, Mymensingh, and Sylhet. This investigation illustrates wind (m/s) speeds at various heights (m) and analyzes the boundary layer height (BLH) from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast reanalysis 5th generation (ERA5). The data is from a period of 40 years from 1979 to 2018, assessing with a climatic base of 20 years (1979 to 2000). The climatological analysis comprises trends, time series, anomalies, and linear correlations. The results for the wind speed (BLH) indicate that the weakest (lower) and strongest (higher) regions are Sylhet and Barishal, respectively. Based on power-curve relationships, a simple power predictive model (SPPM) is developed using global wind atlas (GWA) data (sample: 1100) to estimate the power density (W/m2) and found an accuracy of 0.918 and 0.892 for Exponential (EXP) and Polynomial (PN) with mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 22.92 and 21.8%, respectively. For validation, SPPM also forecasts power incorporating historical observations for Chittagong and obtains correlations of 0.970 and 0.974 for EXP and PN with a MAPE of 10.26 and 7.69% individually. Furthermore, calculations for annual energy production reveal an average megawattage of 1748 and 1070 in the southern and northern regions, with an MAPE of 15.71 and 5.85% for EXP and PN models, except Sylhet. The SPPM’s predictability can be improved with observed wind speeds and turbine types. The research wishes to apply SPPM for estimating energy in operational power plants.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Urban modeling and visualization are highly useful in the development of smart cities. Buildings are the most prominent features in the urban environment, and are necessary for urban decision support; thus, buildings should be modeled effectively and efficiently in three dimensions (3D). In this study, with the help of Gaofen-7 (GF-7) high-resolution stereo mapping satellite double-line camera (DLC) images and multispectral (MUX) images, the boundary of a building is segmented via a multilevel features fusion network (MFFN). A digital surface model (DSM) is generated to obtain the elevation of buildings. The building vector with height information is processed using a 3D modeling tool to create a white building model. The building model, DSM, and multispectral fused image are then imported into the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) to complete the urban scene level, vividly rendered with environmental effects for urban visualization. The results of this study show that high accuracy of 95.29% is achieved in building extraction using our proposed method. Based on the extracted building vector and elevation information from the DSM, building 3D models can be efficiently created in Level of Details 1 (LOD1). Finally, the urban scene is produced for realistic 3D visualization. This study shows that high-resolution stereo mapping satellite images are useful in 3D modeling for urban buildings and can support the generation and visualization of urban scenes in a large area for different applications.
