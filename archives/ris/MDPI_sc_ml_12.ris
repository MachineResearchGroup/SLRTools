AB  - The automotive industry could be facing a situation of profound change and opportunity in the coming decades. There are a number of influencing factors such as increasing urban and aging populations, self-driving cars, 3D parts printing, energy innovation, and new models of transportation service delivery (Zipcar, Uber). The connected car means that vehicles are now part of the connected world, continuously Internet-connected, generating and transmitting data, which on the one hand can be helpfully integrated into applications, like real-time traffic alerts broadcast to smartwatches, but also raises security and privacy concerns. This paper explores the automotive connected world, and describes five killer QS (Quantified Self)-auto sensor applications that link quantified-self sensors (sensors that measure the personal biometrics of individuals like heart rate) and automotive sensors (sensors that measure driver and passenger biometrics or quantitative automotive performance metrics like speed and braking activity). The applications are fatigue detection, real-time assistance for parking and accidents, anger management and stress reduction, keyless authentication and digital identity verification, and DIY diagnostics. These kinds of applications help to demonstrate the benefit of connected world data streams in the automotive industry and beyond where, more fundamentally for human progress, the automation of both physical and now cognitive tasks is underway.

AB  - Storm-based stream processing is widely used for real-time large-scale distributed processing. Knowing the run-time status and ensuring performance is critical to providing expected dependability for some applications, e.g., continuous video processing for security surveillance. The existing scheduling strategies’ granularity is too coarse to have good performance, and mainly considers network resources without computing resources while scheduling. In this paper, we propose Healthcare4Storm, a framework that finds Storm insights based on Storm metrics to gain knowledge from the health status of an application, finally ending up with smart scheduling decisions. It takes into account both network and computing resources and conducts scheduling at a fine-grained level using tuples instead of topologies. The comprehensive evaluation shows that the proposed framework has good performance and can improve the dependability of the Storm-based applications.

AB  - In many countries around the world, smart cities are becoming a reality. These cities contribute to improving citizens’ quality of life by providing services that are normally based on data extracted from wireless sensor networks (WSN) and other elements of the Internet of Things. Additionally, public administration uses these smart city data to increase its efficiency, to reduce costs and to provide additional services. However, the information received at smart city data centers is not always accurate, because WSNs are sometimes prone to error and are exposed to physical and computer attacks. In this article, we use real data from the smart city of Barcelona to simulate WSNs and implement typical attacks. Then, we compare frequently used anomaly detection techniques to disclose these attacks. We evaluate the algorithms under different requirements on the available network status information. As a result of this study, we conclude that one-class Support Vector Machines is the most appropriate technique. We achieve a true positive rate at least 56% higher than the rates achieved with the other compared techniques in a scenario with a maximum false positive rate of 5% and a 26% higher in a scenario with a false positive rate of 15%.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, the advancement of sensor technology has led to the generation of heterogeneous Internet-of-Things (IoT) data by smart cities. Thus, the development and deployment of various aspects of IoT-based applications are necessary to mine the potential value of data to the benefit of people and their lives. However, the variety, volume, heterogeneity, and real-time nature of data obtained from smart cities pose considerable challenges. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework that integrates the IoT with machine learning for smart cities. The proposed framework retrieves and models urban data for certain kinds of IoT applications based on semantic and machine-learning technologies. Moreover, we propose two case studies: pollution detection from vehicles and traffic pattern detection. The experimental results show that our system is scalable and capable of accommodating a large number of urban regions with different types of IoT applications.

PY  - 2017
VL  - 17

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - One of the main priorities of smart cities is improving the quality of life of their inhabitants. Traffic noise is one of the pollutant sources that causes a negative impact on the quality of life of citizens, which is gaining attention among authorities. The European Commission has promoted the Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC (END) to inform citizens and to prevent the harmful effects of noise exposure. The measure of acoustic levels using noise maps is a strategic issue in the END action plan. Noise maps are typically calculated by computing the average noise during one year and updated every five years. Hence, the implementation of dynamic noise mapping systems could lead to short-term plan actions, besides helping to better understand the evolution of noise levels along time. Recently, some projects have started the monitoring of noise levels in urban areas by means of acoustic sensor networks settled in strategic locations across the city, while others have taken advantage of collaborative citizen sensing mobile applications. In this paper, we describe the design of an acoustic low-cost sensor network installed on public buses to measure the traffic noise in the city in real time. Moreover, the challenges that a ubiquitous bus acoustic measurement system entails are enumerated and discussed. Specifically, the analysis takes into account the feature extraction of the audio signal, the identification and separation of the road traffic noise from urban traffic noise, the hardware platform to measure and process the acoustic signal, the connectivity between the several nodes of the acoustic sensor network to store the data and, finally, the noise maps’ generation process. The implementation and evaluation of the proposal in a real-life scenario is left for future work.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Web of Things (WoT) facilitates the discovery and interoperability of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a cyber-physical system (CPS). Moreover, a uniform knowledge representation of physical resources is quite necessary for further composition, collaboration, and decision-making process in CPS. Though several efforts have integrated semantics with WoT, such as knowledge engineering methods based on semantic sensor networks (SSN), it still could not represent the complex relationships between devices when dynamic composition and collaboration occur, and it totally depends on manual construction of a knowledge base with low scalability. In this paper, to addresses these limitations, we propose the semantic Web of Things (SWoT) framework for CPS (SWoT4CPS). SWoT4CPS provides a hybrid solution with both ontological engineering methods by extending SSN and machine learning methods based on an entity linking (EL) model. To testify to the feasibility and performance, we demonstrate the framework by implementing a temperature anomaly diagnosis and automatic control use case in a building automation system. Evaluation results on the EL method show that linking domain knowledge to DBpedia has a relative high accuracy and the time complexity is at a tolerant level. Advantages and disadvantages of SWoT4CPS with future work are also discussed.

AB  - The collection of raw data is based on sensors embedded in devices or the environment for real-time data extraction. Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) environment is used to support autonomous data collection by reducing human involvement. It is hard to analyze such data, especially when working with the sensors in a real-time environment. On using data analytics in IoT with the help of RDF, many issues can be resolved. Resultant data will have a better chance of quality analytics by reforming data into the semantical annotation. Industrial correspondence through data will be improved by the induction of semantics at large due to efficient data capturing, whereas one popular medium of sensors’ data storage is Relational Database (RDB). This study provides a complete automated mechanism to transform from loosely structured data stored in RDB into RDF. These data are obtained from sensors in semantically annotated RDF stores. The given study comprises methodology for improving compatibility by introducing bidirectional transformation between classical DB and RDF data stores to enhance the sustainable capabilities of IoT systems for autonomous analytics. Two case studies, one on weather and another on heart-rate measurement collections through IoT sensors, are used to show the transformation process in operation.

AB  - The rapid development of new technologies and the changing landscape of the online world (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of All, cloud-based solutions) provide a unique opportunity for developing automated and robotic systems for urban farming, agriculture, and forestry. Technological advances in machine vision, global positioning systems, laser technologies, actuators, and mechatronics have enabled the development and implementation of robotic systems and intelligent technologies for precision agriculture. Herein, we present and review robotic applications on plant pathology and management, and emerging agricultural technologies for intra-urban agriculture. Greenhouse advanced management systems and technologies have been greatly developed in the last years, integrating IoT and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Machine learning, machine vision, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have been utilized and applied in agriculture for automated and robotic farming. Intelligence technologies, using machine vision/learning, have been developed not only for planting, irrigation, weeding (to some extent), pruning, and harvesting, but also for plant disease detection and identification. However, plant disease detection still represents an intriguing challenge, for both abiotic and biotic stress. Many recognition methods and technologies for identifying plant disease symptoms have been successfully developed; still, the majority of them require a controlled environment for data acquisition to avoid false positives. Machine learning methods (e.g., deep and transfer learning) present promising results for improving image processing and plant symptom identification. Nevertheless, diagnostic specificity is a challenge for microorganism control and should drive the development of mechatronics and robotic solutions for disease management.

AB  - Nowadays, the railway industry is in a position where it is able to exploit the opportunities created by the IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) and enabling communication technologies under the paradigm of Internet of Trains. This review details the evolution of communication technologies since the deployment of GSM-R, describing the main alternatives and how railway requirements, specifications and recommendations have evolved over time.

AB  - Predicting large-scale transportation network traffic has become an important and challenging topic in recent decades. Inspired by the domain knowledge of motion prediction, in which the future motion of an object can be predicted based on previous scenes, we propose a network grid representation method that can retain the fine-scale structure of a transportation network. Network-wide traffic speeds are converted into a series of static images and input into a novel deep architecture, namely, spatiotemporal recurrent convolutional networks (SRCNs), for traffic forecasting. The proposed SRCNs inherit the advantages of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The spatial dependencies of network-wide traffic can be captured by DCNNs, and the temporal dynamics can be learned by LSTMs. An experiment on a Beijing transportation network with 278 links demonstrates that SRCNs outperform other deep learning-based algorithms in both short-term and long-term traffic prediction.

AB  - We are witnessing the emergence of new big data processing architectures due to the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoTs), edge computing and cloud computing. Existing big data processing architectures are underpinned by the transfer of raw data streams to the cloud computing environment for processing and analysis. This operation is expensive and fails to meet the real-time processing needs of IoT applications. In this article, we present and evaluate a novel big data processing architecture named RedEdge (i.e., data reduction on the edge) that incorporates mechanism to facilitate the processing of big data streams near the source of the data. The RedEdge model leverages mobile IoT-termed mobile edge devices as primary data processing platforms. However, in the case of the unavailability of computational and battery power resources, it offloads data streams in nearer mobile edge devices or to the cloud. We evaluate the RedEdge architecture and the related mechanism within a real-world experiment setting involving 12 mobile users. The experimental evaluation reveals that the RedEdge model has the capability to reduce big data stream by up to 92.86% without compromising energy and memory consumption on mobile edge devices.

AB  - Considering the current advancements in biometric sensors and other related technologies, as well as the use of bio-inspired models for AI improvements, we can infer that the swarm intelligence paradigm can be implemented in human daily spheres through the connectivity between user gadgets connected to the Internet of Things. This is a first step towards a real Ambient Intelligence, but also of a Global Intelligence. This unconscious (by the user) connectivity may alter the way by which we feel the world. Besides, with the arrival of new augmented ways of capturing and providing information or radical new ways of expanding our bodies (through synthetic biology or artificial prosthesis like brain–computer connections), we can be very close to a change which may radically affect our experience of ourselves and of the feeling of collectivity. We call it the techno-phenomenological turn. We show social implications, present challenges, and and open questions for the new kind of swarm intelligence-enhanced society, and provide the taxonomy of the field of study. We will also explore the possible roadmaps of this next possible situation.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2017
VL  - 17
IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - One of the main aspects affecting the quality of life of people living in urban and suburban areas is their continued exposure to high Road Traffic Noise (RTN) levels. Until now, noise measurements in cities have been performed by professionals, recording data in certain locations to build a noise map afterwards. However, the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) has enabled automatic noise mapping in smart cities. In order to obtain a reliable picture of the RTN levels affecting citizens, Anomalous Noise Events (ANE) unrelated to road traffic should be removed from the noise map computation. To this aim, this paper introduces an Anomalous Noise Event Detector (ANED) designed to differentiate between RTN and ANE in real time within a predefined interval running on the distributed low-cost acoustic sensors of a WASN. The proposed ANED follows a two-class audio event detection and classification approach, instead of multi-class or one-class classification schemes, taking advantage of the collection of representative acoustic data in real-life environments. The experiments conducted within the DYNAMAP project, implemented on ARM-based acoustic sensors, show the feasibility of the proposal both in terms of computational cost and classification performance using standard Mel cepstral coefficients and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The two-class GMM core classifier relatively improves the baseline universal GMM one-class classifier F1 measure by 18.7% and 31.8% for suburban and urban environments, respectively, within the 1-s integration interval. Nevertheless, according to the results, the classification performance of the current ANED implementation still has room for improvement.

AB  - Smart cities are demanding solutions for improved traffic efficiency, in order to guarantee optimal access to mobility resources available in urban areas. Intelligent video analytics deployed directly on board embedded sensors offers great opportunities to gather highly informative data about traffic and transport, allowing reconstruction of a real-time neat picture of urban mobility patterns. In this paper, we present a visual sensor network in which each node embeds computer vision logics for analyzing in real time urban traffic. The nodes in the network share their perceptions and build a global and comprehensive interpretation of the analyzed scenes in a cooperative and adaptive fashion. This is possible thanks to an especially designed Internet of Things (IoT) compliant middleware which encompasses in-network event composition as well as full support of Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication mechanism. The potential of the proposed cooperative visual sensor network is shown with two sample applications in urban mobility connected to the estimation of vehicular flows and parking management. Besides providing detailed results of each key component of the proposed solution, the validity of the approach is demonstrated by extensive field tests that proved the suitability of the system in providing a scalable, adaptable and extensible data collection layer for managing and understanding mobility in smart cities.

AB  - With the rapid development of smart cities in the world, research relating to smart city evaluation has become a new research hotspot in academia. However, there are general problems of cognitive deprivation, lack of planning experience, and low level of coordination in smart cities construction. It is necessary for us to develop a set of scientific, reasonable, and effective evaluation index systems and evaluation models to analyze the development degree of urban wisdom. Based on the theory of the urban system, we established a comprehensive evaluation index system for urban intelligent development based on the people-oriented, city-system, and resources-flow (PSF) evaluation model. According to the characteristics of the comprehensive evaluation index system of urban intelligent development, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) combined with the experts’ opinions determine the index weight of this system. We adopted the neural network model to construct the corresponding comprehensive evaluation model to characterize the non-linear characteristics of the comprehensive evaluation indexes system, thus to quantitatively quantify the comprehensive evaluation indexes of urban intelligent development. Finally, we used the AHP, AHP-BP (Back Propagation), and AHP-ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) models to evaluate the intelligent development level of 151 cities in China, and compared them from the perspective of model accuracy and time cost. The final simulation results show that the AHP-ELM model is the best evaluation model.

AB  - According to UNESCO, education is a fundamental human right and every nation’s citizens should be granted universal access with equal quality to it. Because this goal is yet to be achieved in most countries, in particular in the developing and underdeveloped countries, it is extremely important to find more effective ways to improve education. This paper presents a model based on the application of computational intelligence (data mining and data science) that leads to the development of the student’s knowledge profile and that can help educators in their decision making for best orienting their students. This model also tries to establish key performance indicators to monitor objectives’ achievement within individual strategic planning assembled for each student. The model uses random forest for classification and prediction, graph description for data structure visualization and recommendation systems to present relevant information to stakeholders. The results presented were built based on the real dataset obtained from a Brazilian private k-9 (elementary school). The obtained results include correlations among key data, a model to predict student performance and recommendations that were generated for the stakeholders.

AB  - Intelligent recognition of traffic police command gestures increases authenticity and interactivity in virtual urban scenes. To actualize real-time traffic gesture recognition, a novel spatiotemporal convolution neural network (ST-CNN) model is presented. We utilized Kinect 2.0 to construct a traffic police command gesture skeleton (TPCGS) dataset collected from 10 volunteers. Subsequently, convolution operations on the locational change of each skeletal point were performed to extract temporal features, analyze the relative positions of skeletal points, and extract spatial features. After temporal and spatial features based on the three-dimensional positional information of traffic police skeleton points were extracted, the ST-CNN model classified positional information into eight types of Chinese traffic police gestures. The test accuracy of the ST-CNN model was 96.67%. In addition, a virtual urban traffic scene in which real-time command tests were carried out was set up, and a real-time test accuracy rate of 93.0% was achieved. The proposed ST-CNN model ensured a high level of accuracy and robustness. The ST-CNN model recognized traffic command gestures, and such recognition was found to control vehicles in virtual traffic environments, which enriches the interactive mode of the virtual city scene. Traffic command gesture recognition contributes to smart city construction.

PY  - 2018

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Among the current challenges of the Smart City, traffic management and maintenance are of utmost importance. Road surface monitoring is currently performed by humans, but the road surface condition is one of the main indicators of road quality, and it may drastically affect fuel consumption and the safety of both drivers and pedestrians. Abnormalities in the road, such as manholes and potholes, can cause accidents when not identified by the drivers. Furthermore, human-induced abnormalities, such as speed bumps, could also cause accidents. In addition, while said obstacles ought to be signalized according to specific road regulation, they are not always correctly labeled. Therefore, we developed a novel method for the detection of road abnormalities (i.e., speed bumps). This method makes use of a gyro, an accelerometer, and a GPS sensor mounted in a car. After having the vehicle cruise through several streets, data is retrieved from the sensors. Then, using a cross-validation strategy, a genetic algorithm is used to find a logistic model that accurately detects road abnormalities. The proposed model had an accuracy of 0.9714 in a blind evaluation, with a false positive rate smaller than 0.018, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9784. This methodology has the potential to detect speed bumps in quasi real-time conditions, and can be used to construct a real-time surface monitoring system.

AB  - As the era of big data approaches, big data has attracted increasing amounts of attention from researchers. Various types of studies have been conducted and these studies have focused particularly on the management, organization, and correlation of data and calculations using data. Most studies involving big data address applications in scientific, commercial, and ecological fields. However, the application of big data to government management is also needed. This paper examines the application of multi-source government data to urban construction and supervision in Tianjin, China. The analytic hierarchy process and a new approach called the correlation degree algorithm are introduced to calculate the degree of correlation between different approval items in one construction project and between different construction projects. The results show that more than 75% of the construction projects and their approval items are highly correlated. The results of this study suggest that most of the examined construction projects are well supervised, have relatively high probabilities of satisfying the relevant legal requirements, and observe their initial planning schemes.

AB  - Big data has been extensively applied to many fields and wanted for sustainable development. However, increasingly growing publications and the dynamic nature of research fronts pose challenges to understand the current research situation and sustainable development directions of big data. In this paper, we visually conducted a bibliometric study of big data literatures from the Web of Science (WoS) between 2002 and 2016, involving 4927 effective journal articles in 1729 journals contributed by 16,404 authors from 4137 institutions. The bibliometric results reveal the current annual publications distribution, journals distribution and co-citation network, institutions distribution and collaboration network, authors distribution, collaboration network and co-citation network, and research hotspots. The results can help researchers worldwide to understand the panorama of current big data research, to find the potential research gaps, and to focus on the future sustainable development directions.

AB  - The information of human occupancy plays a crucial role in building management. For instance, fewer people, less demand for heat and electricity supply, and vice versa. Moreover, when there is a fire in a building, it is convenient to know how many persons in a single room there are in order to plan a more efficient rescue strategy. However, currently most buildings have not installed adequate devices that can be used to count the number of people, and the most popular embedded fire alarm system triggers a warning only when a fire breaks out with plenty of smoke. In view of this constraint, in this paper we propose a carbon oxides gases based warning system to detect potential fire breakouts and to estimate the number of people in the proximity. In order to validate the efficiency of the devised system, we simulate its application in the Fog Computing environment. Furthermore, we also improve the iFogSim by giving data analytics capacity to it. Based on this framework, energy consumption, latency, and network usage of the designed system obtained from iFogSim are compared with those obtained from Cloud environment.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 11

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - New technologies such as sensor networks have been incorporated into the management of buildings for organizations and cities. Sensor networks have led to an exponential increase in the volume of data available in recent years, which can be used to extract consumption patterns for the purposes of energy and monetary savings. For this reason, new approaches and strategies are needed to analyze information in big data environments. This paper proposes a methodology to extract electric energy consumption patterns in big data time series, so that very valuable conclusions can be made for managers and governments. The methodology is based on the study of four clustering validity indices in their parallelized versions along with the application of a clustering technique. In particular, this work uses a voting system to choose an optimal number of clusters from the results of the indices, as well as the application of the distributed version of the k-means algorithm included in Apache Spark’s Machine Learning Library. The results, using electricity consumption for the years 2011–2017 for eight buildings of a public university, are presented and discussed. In addition, the performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using synthetic big data, which cab represent thousands of buildings in a smart city. Finally, policies derived from the patterns discovered are proposed to optimize energy usage across the university campus.

AB  - In this paper, we see the Data Centers (DCs) as producers of waste heat integrated with smart energy infrastructures, heat which can be re-used for nearby neighborhoods. We provide a model of the thermo-electric processes within DCs equipped with heat reuse technology, allowing them to adapt their thermal response profile to meet various levels of hot water demand. On top of the model, we have implemented computational fluid dynamics-based simulations to determine the cooling system operational parameters settings, which allow the heat to build up without endangering the servers’ safety operation as well as the distribution of the workload on the servers to avoid hot spots. This will allow for setting higher temperature set points for short periods of time and using pre-cooling and post-cooling as flexibility mechanisms for DC thermal profile adaptation. To reduce the computational time complexity, we have used neural networks, which are trained using the simulation results. Experiments have been conducted considering a small operational DC featuring a server room of 24 square meters and 60 servers organized in four racks. The results show the DCs’ potential to meet different levels of thermal energy demand by re-using their waste heat in nearby neighborhoods.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 10

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Infrared moving target tracking plays a fundamental role in many burgeoning research areas of Smart City. Challenges in developing a suitable tracker for infrared images are particularly caused by pose variation, occlusion, and noise. In order to overcome these adverse interferences, a total variation regularization term-based low-rank and sparse matrix representation (TV-LRSMR) model is designed in order to exploit a robust infrared moving target tracker in this paper. First of all, the observation matrix that is derived from the infrared sequence is decomposed into a low-rank target matrix and a sparse occlusion matrix. For the purpose of preventing the noise pixel from being separated into the occlusion term, a total variation regularization term is proposed to further constrain the occlusion matrix. Then an alternating algorithm combing principal component analysis and accelerated proximal gradient methods is employed to separately optimize the two matrices. For long-term tracking, the presented algorithm is implemented using a Bayesien state inference under the particle filtering framework along with a dynamic model update mechanism. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments that were examined on real infrared video sequences verify that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision rate and success rate.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Contemporary systems of mobility are undergoing a transition towards automation. In the UK, this transition is being led by (often new) partnerships between incumbent manufacturers and new entrants, in collaboration with national governments, local/regional councils, and research institutions. This paper first offers a framework for analyzing the governance of the transition, adapting ideas from the Transition Management (TM) perspective, and then applies the framework to ongoing automated vehicle transition dynamics in the UK. The empirical analysis suggests that the UK has adopted a reasonably comprehensive approach to the governing of automated vehicle innovation but that this approach cannot be characterized as sufficiently inclusive, democratic, diverse and open. The lack of inclusivity, democracy, diversity and openness is symptomatic of the post-political character of how the UK’s automated mobility transition is being governed. The paper ends with a call for a reconfiguration of the automated vehicle transition in the UK and beyond, so that much more space is created for dissent and for reflexive and comprehensive big picture thinking on (automated) mobility futures.

AB  - The obese population is increasing rapidly due to the change of lifestyle and diet habits. Obesity can cause various complications and is becoming a social disease. Nonetheless, many obese patients are unaware of the medical treatments that are right for them. Although a variety of online and offline obesity management services have been introduced, they are still not enough to attract the attention of users and are not much of help to solve the problem. Obesity healthcare and personalized health activities are the important factors. Since obesity is related to lifestyle habits, eating habits, and interests, I concluded that the big data analysis of these factors could deduce the problem. Therefore, I collected big data by applying the machine learning and crawling method to the unstructured citizen health data in Korea and the search data of Naver, which is a Korean portal company, and Google for keyword analysis for personalized health activities. It visualized the big data using text mining and word cloud. This study collected and analyzed the data concerning the interests related to obesity, change of interest on obesity, and treatment articles. The analysis showed a wide range of seasonal factors according to spring, summer, fall, and winter. It also visualized and completed the process of extracting the keywords appropriate for treatment of abdominal obesity and lower body obesity. The keyword big data analysis technique for personalized health activities proposed in this paper is based on individual’s interests, level of interest, and body type. Also, the user interface (UI) that visualizes the big data compatible with Android and Apple iOS. The users can see the data on the app screen. Many graphs and pictures can be seen via menu, and the significant data values are visualized through machine learning. Therefore, I expect that the big data analysis using various keywords specific to a person will result in measures for personalized treatment and health activities.

AB  - Aiming for sustainable buildings and cities is critical to achieving a future that is socially just, ecologically regenerative, culturally rich, and economically viable. However, our current concepts of sustainability often exclude the essential domains of data, information, and the knowledge relating to the relationship between buildings and people that inhabit them. Thus, the research questions at the core of this paper have been as follows: Can technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) be used to create systems that enhance relationships between buildings and inhabitants? Can social networks and natural interactions support further research relating to human-centric design tools for the built environment? The Human Observation Meta-Environment (HOME) project was developed to address this question. The ICT architecture has been tested to observe and collect human behaviour data within a sentient room at the Politecnico di Torino (IT), where the inhabitants were strategically aware of their behaviours. Methods of analysis included technologies related to the domain of AI (such as Natural Language Analysis, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning) that have been used in social network analysis in connection with the word &lsquo;comfort&rsquo;, and definitions resonate strongly with the realm of regenerative design. Results were used to further research the role of users that could serve as leverages to design (both spaces and related smart systems) according to actual user needs. People from very different disciplinary backgrounds interacted with the prototype in a workshop and provided stimuli for further considerations regarding the possible technological, psychological, cognitive, cultural, social, political, and aesthetical impacts of the use of these technologies inside sentient buildings. The paper enriches the discourse on how ICT data can be organised and read in a human-centric regenerative design process perspective.

AB  - Many municipalities express a wish to use digital technologies to achieve environmental aims. However, there is still a need for a better understanding of how this should practically be done, both among municipalities and among ICT developers. We have used workshops and literature studies to formulate technological abilities of digitalization. We use two EU directives that are relevant for municipal environmental goals and combine the activities that these directives indicate with technological abilities of digitalization, in order to formulate practical implementations of digital technology to help these activities and reach the directives&rsquo; goals. We suggest that this method can be used for any municipal goal, as follows: (1) Identify the objective (in our case set by the EU-directives); (2) Identify what activities these points will require or generate; (3a) From a municipal viewpoint: Based on the results of 1 and 2, formulate and structure ideas of how digitalization can support the objectives and how those ideas can be implemented; (3b) From a provider&rsquo;s viewpoint: Investigate what digital solutions supporting 1 and 2 exist, or how existing services can be tweaked to support the objectives and explore how new digital solutions supporting 1 and 2 can be developed.

AB  - Human activity recognition is a challenging problem for context-aware systems and applications. It is gaining interest due to the ubiquity of different sensor sources, wearable smart objects, ambient sensors, etc. This task is usually approached as a supervised machine learning problem, where a label is to be predicted given some input data, such as the signals retrieved from different sensors. For tackling the human activity recognition problem in sensor network environments, in this paper we propose the use of deep learning (convolutional neural networks) to perform activity recognition using the publicly available OPPORTUNITY dataset. Instead of manually choosing a suitable topology, we will let an evolutionary algorithm design the optimal topology in order to maximize the classification F1 score. After that, we will also explore the performance of committees of the models resulting from the evolutionary process. Results analysis indicates that the proposed model was able to perform activity recognition within a heterogeneous sensor network environment, achieving very high accuracies when tested with new sensor data. Based on all conducted experiments, the proposed neuroevolutionary system has proved to be able to systematically find a classification model which is capable of outperforming previous results reported in the state-of-the-art, showing that this approach is useful and improves upon previously manually-designed architectures.

AB  - Smart city (SC) technologies can provide appropriate services according to citizens&rsquo; demands.

However, these devices usually come from different manufacturers with different product standards, which confront interactive control problems. Moreover, these devices will produce large amounts of data, and efficiently analyzing these data for intelligent services. In this paper, we propose a novel artificial intelligence-based semantic IoT (AI-SIoT) hybrid service architecture to integrate heterogeneous IoT devices to support intelligent services. In particular, the proposed architecture is empowered by semantic and AI technologies, which enable flexible connections among heterogeneous devices. The AI technology can support very implement efficient data analysis and make accurate decisions on service provisions in various kinds. Furthermore, we also present several practical use cases of the proposed AI-SIoT architecture and the opportunities and challenges to implement the proposed AI-SIoT for future SCs are also discussed.

In this purpose, we have developed a mixed artificial neural network (ANN) approach using both non-linear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) ANNs and function fitting neural networks (FITNETs). We have used a large dataset containing detailed electricity consumption data recorded by sensors, monitoring a series of individual appliances, while in the NARX case we have also used timestamps datasets as exogenous variables. After having developed and validated the forecasting method, we have compiled it in view of incorporating it into a cloud solution, being delivered to the contractor that can provide it as a service for a monthly fee to both the operators and residential consumers.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In the last few years, a large number of smart meters have been deployed in buildings to continuously monitor fine-grained energy consumption. Meteorological data deeply impact energy consumption, and an in-depth analysis of collected and correlated data can uncover interesting and actionable insights to improve the overall energy balance of our communities and to enhance people&rsquo;s awareness of energy wasting. To effectively extract meaningful and interpretable insights from large collections of energy measurements and multi-dimensional meteorological data, innovative data science methodologies should be devised. Research frontiers are addressing self-learning approaches, which allow non-experts to exploit machine learning techniques more easily, and algorithmic transparency of models, hence providing actionable, explicit, declarative knowledge representation. This paper presents METeorological Data Analysis for Thermal Energy CHaracterization (METATECH), a data mining engine based on both exploratory and unsupervised data analytics algorithms, devised to build transparent models correlating weather conditions and energy consumption in buildings. METATECH exploits a joint approach coupling cluster analysis and generalized association rules to allow a deeper yet human-readable understanding of how meteorological data impact heating consumption. First, a partitional clustering algorithm is applied to weather conditions. Then, resulting clusters are characterized by means of generalized association rules, which provide a self-learning explainable model of the most interesting correlations between energy consumption and weather conditions at different granularity levels. The experimental evaluation performed on real datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in automatically extracting interesting knowledge from data, and provide it transparently to domain experts.

AB  - The increase of consumer income has resulted in the rapid development of the retail industry in China, which provides high market potential for retail companies worldwide. However, site selection for retail shops has been a confusing business issue in practical business decisions. In this study, a two-step hybrid model in site selection for small retail shops was proposed. The two steps were spatial accessibility evaluation and market potential estimation. The spatial accessibility of target regions was evaluated based on the improved gravity model to determine regions that lack retail shops. Then, a PCA (principal component analysis)&ndash;BP (backpropagation network) model was established to estimate the market potential in the target regions. The two-step model could determine sites with the most market potential and low competition. We conducted the experiment in Guiyang, China and considered 18 socioeconomic factors to make the site selection convincing. Through the experiment, 42 locations were determined with high business value; the locations were recommended to the new retail shops. The accuracy of the PCA&ndash;BP model was then proven satisfactory by comparing it with other regression methods. The proposed model could guide retail chains in enhancing business location planning and formulating regional development policies.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) utilizes algorithms to facilitate intelligent applications across cities in the form of smart-urban projects. As the majority of devices in IoT are battery operated, their applications should be facilitated with a low-power communication setup. Such facility is possible through the Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN), but at a constrained bit rate. For long-range communication over LPWAN, several approaches and protocols are adopted. One such protocol is the Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), which is a media access layer protocol for long-range communication between the devices and the application servers via LPWAN gateways. However, LoRaWAN comes with fewer security features as a much-secured protocol consumes more battery because of the exorbitant computational overheads. The standard protocol fails to support end-to-end security and perfect forward secrecy while being vulnerable to the replay attack that makes LoRaWAN limited in supporting applications where security (especially end-to-end security) is important. Motivated by this, an enhanced LoRaWAN security protocol is proposed, which not only provides the basic functions of connectivity between the application server and the end device, but additionally averts these listed security issues. The proposed protocol is developed with two options, the Default Option (DO) and the Security-Enhanced Option (SEO). The protocol is validated through Burrows&ndash;Abadi&ndash;Needham (BAN) logic and the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The proposed protocol is also analyzed for overheads through system-based and low-power device-based evaluations. Further, a case study on a smart factory-enabled parking system is considered for its practical application. The results, in terms of network latency with reliability fitting and signaling overheads, show paramount improvements and better performance for the proposed protocol compared with the two handshake options, Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Current technology provides an efficient way of monitoring the personal health of individuals. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based sensors can be considered as a solution for monitoring personal vital signs data. In this study, we propose a personalized healthcare monitoring system by utilizing a BLE-based sensor device, real-time data processing, and machine learning-based algorithms to help diabetic patients to better self-manage their chronic condition. BLEs were used to gather users&rsquo; vital signs data such as blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and blood glucose (BG) from sensor nodes to smartphones, while real-time data processing was utilized to manage the large amount of continuously generated sensor data. The proposed real-time data processing utilized Apache Kafka as a streaming platform and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the patient. The results show that commercial versions of the BLE-based sensors and the proposed real-time data processing are sufficiently efficient to monitor the vital signs data of diabetic patients. Furthermore, machine learning&ndash;based classification methods were tested on a diabetes dataset and showed that a Multilayer Perceptron can provide early prediction of diabetes given the user&rsquo;s sensor data as input. The results also reveal that Long Short-Term Memory can accurately predict the future BG level based on the current sensor data. In addition, the proposed diabetes classification and BG prediction could be combined with personalized diet and physical activity suggestions in order to improve the health quality of patients and to avoid critical conditions in the future.

AB  - Integration of high volume (high penetration) of photovoltaic (PV) generation with power grids consequently leads to some technical challenges that are mainly due to the intermittent nature of solar energy, the volume of data involved in the smart grid architecture, and the impact power electronic-based smart inverters. These challenges include reverse power flow, voltage fluctuations, power quality issues, dynamic stability, big data challenges and others. This paper investigates the existing challenges with the current level of PV penetration and looks into the challenges with high PV penetration in future scenarios such as smart cities, transactive energy, proliferation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), possible eclipse events, big data issues and environmental impacts. Within the context of these future scenarios, this paper reviewed the existing solutions and provides insights to new and future solutions that could be explored to ultimately address these issues and improve the smart grid&rsquo;s security, reliability and resiliency.

TI  - Real-Time Vehicle Roll Angle Estimation Based on Neural Networks in IoT Low-Cost Devices
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 7
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The high rate of vehicle-crash victims has a fatal economic and social impact in today&rsquo;s societies. In particular, road crashes where heavy vehicles are involved cause more severe damage because they are prone to rollover. For this reason, many researches are focused on developing RSC Roll Stability Control (RSC) systems. Concerning the design of RSC systems with an adequate performance, it is mandatory to know the dynamics of the vehicle. The main problem arises from the lack of ability to directly capture several required dynamic vehicle variables, such as roll angle, from low-cost sensors. Previous studies demonstrate that low-cost sensors can provide data in real-time with the required precision and reliability. Even more, other research works indicate that neural networks are efficient mechanisms to estimate roll angle. Nevertheless, it is necessary to assess that the fusion of data coming from low-cost devices and estimations provided by neural networks can fulfill hard real-time processing constraints, achieving high level of accuracy during circulation of a vehicle in real situations. In order to address this issue, this study has two main goals: (1) Design and develop an IoT based architecture, integrating ANN in low cost kits with different hardware architectures in order to estimate under real-time constraints the vehicle roll angle. This architecture is able to work under high dynamic conditions, by following specific best practices and considerations during its design; (2) assess that the IoT architecture deployed in low-cost experimental kits achieve the hard real-time performance constraints estimating the roll angle with the required calculation accuracy. To fulfil these objectives, an experimental environment was set up, composed of a van with two set of low-cost kits, one including a Raspberry Pi 3 Model Band the other having an Intel Edison System on Chip linked to a SparkFun 9 Degrees of Freedom module. This experimental environment be tested in different maneuvers for comparison purposes. Neural networks embedded in low-cost sensor kits provide roll angle estimations highly approximated to real values. Even more, Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B have enough computing capabilities to successfully run roll angle estimation based on neural networks to determine rollover risk situations, fulfilling real-time operation restrictions stated for this problem.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 7
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In modern society, air pollution is an important topic as this pollution exerts a critically bad influence on human health and the environment. Among air pollutants, Particulate Matter (PM2.5) consists of suspended particles with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 &mu;m. Sources of PM2.5 can be coal-fired power generation, smoke, or dusts. These suspended particles in the air can damage the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of the human body, which may further lead to other diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, or cardiovascular diseases. To monitor and estimate the PM2.5 concentration, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are combined and applied to the PM2.5 forecasting system. To compare the overall performance of each algorithm, four measurement indexes, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) Pearson correlation coefficient and Index of Agreement (IA) are applied to the experiments in this paper. Compared with other machine learning methods, the experimental results showed that the forecasting accuracy of the proposed CNN-LSTM model (APNet) is verified to be the highest in this paper. For the CNN-LSTM model, its feasibility and practicability to forecast the PM2.5 concentration are also verified in this paper. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a deep neural network model that integrates the CNN and LSTM architectures, and through historical data such as cumulated hours of rain, cumulated wind speed and PM2.5 concentration. In the future, this study can also be applied to the prevention and control of PM2.5.

TI  - Dense Connectivity Based Two-Stream Deep Feature Fusion Framework for Aerial Scene Classification
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2018
VL  - 10
IS  - 7
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Aerial scene classification is an active and challenging problem in high-resolution remote sensing imagery understanding. Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved prominent performance in this field. The extraction of deep features from the layers of a CNN model is widely used in these CNN-based methods. Although the CNN-based approaches have obtained great success, there is still plenty of room to further increase the classification accuracy. As a matter of fact, the fusion with other features has great potential for leading to the better performance of aerial scene classification. Therefore, we propose two effective architectures based on the idea of feature-level fusion. The first architecture, i.e., texture coded two-stream deep architecture, uses the raw RGB network stream and the mapped local binary patterns (LBP) coded network stream to extract two different sets of features and fuses them using a novel deep feature fusion model. In the second architecture, i.e., saliency coded two-stream deep architecture, we employ the saliency coded network stream as the second stream and fuse it with the raw RGB network stream using the same feature fusion model. For sake of validation and comparison, our proposed architectures are evaluated via comprehensive experiments with three publicly available remote sensing scene datasets. The classification accuracies of saliency coded two-stream architecture with our feature fusion model achieve 97.79%, 98.90%, 94.09%, 95.99%, 85.02%, and 87.01% on the UC-Merced dataset (50% and 80% training samples), the Aerial Image Dataset (AID) (20% and 50% training samples), and the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset (10% and 20% training samples), respectively, overwhelming state-of-the-art methods.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emerging technology that leverages computing, storage, and network resources deployed at the proximity of users to offload their delay-sensitive tasks. Various existing facilities including mobile devices with idle resources, vehicles, and MEC servers deployed at base stations or road side units, could act as edges in the network. Since task offloading incurs extra transmission energy consumption and transmission latency, two key questions to be addressed in such an environment are (i) should the workload be offloaded to the edge or computed in terminals? (ii) Which edge, among the available ones, should the task be offloaded to? In this paper, we formulate the task assignment problem as a one-to-many matching game which is a powerful tool for studying the formation of a mutual beneficial relationship between two sets of agents. The main goal of our task assignment mechanism design is to reduce overall energy consumption, while satisfying task owners&rsquo; heterogeneous delay requirements and supporting good scalability. An intensive simulation is conducted to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed mechanism.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Detection errors such as false alarms and undetected faults are inevitable in any practical anomaly detection system. These errors can create potentially significant problems in the underlying application. In particular, false alarms can result in performing unnecessary recovery actions while missed detections can result in failing to perform recovery which can lead to severe consequences. In this paper, we present an approach for application-aware anomaly detection (AAAD). Our approach takes an existing anomaly detector and configures it to minimize the impact of detection errors. The configuration of the detectors is chosen so that application performance in the presence of detection errors is as close as possible to the performance that could have been obtained if there were no detection errors. We evaluate our result using a case study of real-time control of traffic signals, and show that the approach outperforms significantly several baseline detectors.

AB  - The adaptive coordination of trust services can provide highly dependable and personalized solutions for industrial requirements in the service-oriented industrial internet of things (IIoT) architecture to achieve efficient utilization of service resources. Although great progress has been made, trust service coordination still faces challenging problems such as trustless industry service, poor coordination, and quality of service (QoS) personalized demand. In this paper, we propose a QoS-driven and adaptive trust service coordination method to implement Pareto-efficient allocation of limited industrial service resources in the background of the IIoT. First, we established a Pareto-effective and adaptive industrial IoT trust service coordination model and introduced a blockchain-based adaptive trust evaluation mechanism to achieve trust evaluation of industrial services. Then, taking advantage of a large and complex search space for solution efficiency, we introduced and compared multi-objective gray-wolf algorithms with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and dragonfly algorithms. The experimental results showed that by judging and blacklisting malicious raters quickly and accurately, our model can efficiently realize self-adaptive, personalized, and intelligent trust service coordination under the given constraints, improving not only the response time, but also the success rate in coordination.

AB  - While applications of big data have been extensively studied, discussion is mostly made from the perspectives of computer science, Internet services, and informatics. Alternatively, this article takes the big data approach as an institutional innovation and uses the problem of illegal subdivided units (ISUs) in Hong Kong as a case study. High transaction costs incurred in identification of suspected ISUs and associated enforcement actions lead to a proliferation of ISUs in the city. We posit that the deployment of big data analytics can lower these transaction costs, enabling the government to tackle the problem of illegal accommodations. We propose a framework for big data collection, analysis, and feedback. As the findings of a structured questionnaire survey reveal, building professionals believed that the proposed framework could reduce transaction costs of ISU identification. Yet, concerns associated with the big data approach like privacy and predictive policing were also raised by the professionals.

The acoustic emission (AE) method relying on the analysis of active destructive processes can be the best choice.

The purpose of the current paper is to provide an inclusive review and survey on shared bicycle besides its benefits, history, brands and comparisons. In addition, it proposes the concept of the Internet of Shared Bicycle (IoSB) for the first time, as far as we know, to find a feasible solution for those technical problems of the shared bicycle. The possible architecture of IoSB in our opinion is presented, as well as most of key IoT technologies, and their capabilities to merge into and apply to the different parts of IoSB are introduced. Meanwhile, some challenges and barriers to IoSB&rsquo;s implementation are expressed thoroughly too. As far as the advice for overcoming those barriers be concerned, the IoSB&rsquo;s potential aspects and applications in smart city with respect to technology development in the future provide another valuable further discussion in this paper.

TI  - Economically Incentivising Smart Urban Regeneration. Case Study of Port Louis, Mauritius
T2  - Smart Cities

PY  - 2018
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Port Louis, the capital city of Mauritius, has been the preferred city for hosting the judicial, political and business activities of the country for the past two centuries. However, new policies have created nine new smart cities in greenfield locations within 10 km from Port Louis, so the capital city is facing economic decline as it is losing businesses, as well as administrative functions. This loss equates to an erosion in municipal revenue along with a reduced interest in contributing to the development of the city; all of which takes a toll on its urban economic landscape, as well as on the broader Mauritian economy. This paper builds from the findings of a focus group study to propose a smart urban regeneration model for the City of Port Louis, which could enable the old city to be restored and regenerated rather than redeveloped in modernist architecture, as has happened in the new smart cities model. A smart urban regeneration model is proposed backed by the pillars of smart infrastructure, culture, metabolism and governance. The proposed model is applied to the context of Port Louis to generate an urban regeneration scheme. The potential benefits in terms of financial outcomes, investment attraction and job creation are explored through a combined application of econometric forecasting models. The results support positive figures of both investment and job creation, and the findings of this study aim at informing and providing the governing bodies of Port Louis with a tangible solution for revamping the centuries-old capital city, as well as demonstrating to the world that smart cities can mean sensitive urban regeneration.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - We introduce a device for the automatic detecting and reporting of crawling insects in urban environments. It is a monitoring device for urban pests that complies with the context of smart homes and smart cities, and is compatible with the emerging discipline of the Internet of Things (IoT). We believe it can find its place in every room of a hotel, hospital, military camp, and residence. This box-shaped device attracts targeted insect pests, senses the entering insect, and takes automatically a picture of the internal space of the box. The e-trap includes strong attractants (pheromone and/or food) to increase capture efficiency and traps the insect on its sticky floor. The device carries the necessary optoelectronic sensors to monitor all entrances of the trap. As the insect enters it interrupts the infrared light source. This triggers a detection event; a picture is taken, and a time-stamp is set before delivering the picture through the Wi-Fi to an authorized person/stakeholder. The device can be integrated seamlessly in urban environments and operates unobtrusively to human activities. We report results on various insect pests and depending on the insect species, can reach a detection accuracy ranging from 96 to 99%.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The emerging fog computing technology is characterized by an ultralow latency response, which benefits a massive number of time-sensitive services and applications in the Internet of things (IoT) era. To this end, the fog computing infrastructure must minimize latencies for both service delivery and execution phases. While the transmission latency significantly depends on external factors (e.g., channel bandwidth, communication resources, and interferences), the computation latency can be considered as an internal issue that the fog computing infrastructure could actively self-handle. From this view point, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that utilizes the evolution strategies for real-time task assignment among fog servers to minimize the total computation latency during a long-term period. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the latency by approximately 16.1% compared to the existing methods. Additionally, the proposed learning algorithm has low computational complexity and an effectively parallel operation; therefore, it is especially appropriate to be implemented in modern heterogeneous computing platforms.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) has proven to be an effective approach for link classification in sensor networks. In this paper, we present a data-driven framework for reliable link classification that models Kernelized Linear Support Vector Machine (KLSVM) to produce stable and consistent results. KLSVM is a linear classifying technique that learns the &ldquo;best&rdquo; parameter settings. We investigated its application to model and capture two phenomena: High dimensional multi-category classification and Spatiotemporal data correlation in wireless sensor network (WSN). In addition, the technique also detects anomalies within the network. With the optimized selection of the linear kernel hyperparameters, the technique models high-dimensional data classification and the examined packet traces exhibit correlations between link features. Link features with Packet Reception Rate (PRR) greater than 50% show a high degree of negative correlation while the other sensor node observations show a moderate degree of positive correlation. The model gives a good visual intuition of the network behavior. The efficiency of the supervised learning technique is studied over real dataset obtained from a WSN testbed. To achieve that, we examined packet traces from the 802.15.4 network. The technique has a good performance on link quality estimation accuracy and a precise anomaly detection of sensor nodes within the network.

Moreover, the present study reveals the students&rsquo; perceptions on the sustainability of these changes and developments, and therefore aims to reduce the possible negative impact on consumers, and at anticipate the changes that AI will produce in the future. In order to collect the data, the authors have used a quantitative research method. A questionnaire-based sociological survey was completed by 928 students, with a representation error of only &plusmn;3%. The analysis has shown that a great number of respondents have a positive attitude towards the emergence of AI, who believe it will influence society for the better. The results have also underscored underlying differences based on the respondents&rsquo; type of specialization (humanistic or technical), and their gender.

AB  - A conventional Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) cannot have an infinite lifetime without a battery recharge or replacement. Energy Harvesting (EH), from environmental energy sources, is a promising technology to provide sustainable powering for a WSN. In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel predictive energy management framework that combines the Maximal Power Transferring Tracking (MPTT) algorithm, a predictive energy allocation strategy, and a high efficiency transmission power control mechanism: First, the MPTT optimal working point guarantees minimum power loss of the EH-WSN system; Then, by exactly predicting the upcoming available energy, the power allocation strategy regulates EH-nodes&rsquo; duty cycle accurately to minimize the power failure time; Ultimately, the transmission power control module further improves energy efficiency by dynamically selecting the optimum matching transmission power level with minimum energy consumption. A wind energy powered wireless sensor system has been equipped and tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Results indicate that compared with other predictive energy managers, the proposed mechanism incurs relatively low power failure time while maintaining a high-energy conversion rate.

AB  - Traffic prediction is a critical task for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Prediction at intersections is challenging as it involves various participants, such as vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the accurate intersection traffic prediction by introducing extra data sources other than road traffic volume data into the prediction model. In particular, we take advantage of the data collected from the reports of road accidents and roadworks happening near the intersections. In addition, we investigate two types of learning schemes, namely batch learning and online learning. Three popular ensemble decision tree models are used in the batch learning scheme, including Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting Trees (XGBoost), while the Fast Incremental Model Trees with Drift Detection (FIMT-DD) model is adopted for the online learning scheme. The proposed approach is evaluated using public data sets released by the Victorian Government of Australia. The results indicate that the accuracy of intersection traffic prediction can be improved by incorporating nearby accidents and roadworks information.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT), inspired by the tremendous growth of connected heterogeneous devices, has pioneered the notion of smart city. Various components, i.e., smart transportation, smart community, smart healthcare, smart grid, etc. which are integrated within smart city architecture aims to enrich the quality of life (QoL) of urban citizens. However, real-time processing requirements and exponential data growth withhold smart city realization. Therefore, herein we propose a Big Data analytics (BDA)-embedded experimental architecture for smart cities. Two major aspects are served by the BDA-embedded smart city. Firstly, it facilitates exploitation of urban Big Data (UBD) in planning, designing, and maintaining smart cities. Secondly, it occupies BDA to manage and process voluminous UBD to enhance the quality of urban services. Three tiers of the proposed architecture are liable for data aggregation, real-time data management, and service provisioning. Moreover, offline and online data processing tasks are further expedited by integrating data normalizing and data filtering techniques to the proposed work. By analyzing authenticated datasets, we obtained the threshold values required for urban planning and city operation management. Performance metrics in terms of online and offline data processing for the proposed dual-node Hadoop cluster is obtained using aforementioned authentic datasets. Throughput and processing time analysis performed with regard to existing works guarantee the performance superiority of the proposed work. Hence, we can claim the applicability and reliability of implementing proposed BDA-embedded smart city architecture in the real world.

AB  - Governments these days are demanding better Smart City technologies in order to connect with citizens and understand their demands. For such governments, much needed information exists on social media where members belonging to diverse groups share different interests, post statuses, review and comment on various topics. Aspect extraction from this data can provide a thorough understanding of citizens&rsquo; behaviors and choices. Also, categorization of these aspects can better summarize societal concerns regarding political, economic, religious and social issues. Aspect category detection (ACD) from people reviews is one of the major tasks of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). The success of ABSA is mainly defined by the inexpensive and accurate machine-processable representation of the raw input sentences. Previous approaches rely on cumbersome feature extraction procedures from sentences, which adds its own complexity and inaccuracy in performing ACD tasks. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive and simple method to obtain the most suitable representation of a sentence-vector through different algebraic combinations of a sentence&rsquo;s word vectors, which will act as an input to any machine learning classifier. We have tested our technique on the restaurant review data provided in SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2016. SemEval is a series of global challenges to evaluate the effectiveness of disambiguation of word sense. Our results showed the highest F1-scores of 76.40% in SemEval-2016 Task 5, and 94.99% in SemEval-2015 Task 12.

AB  - Smart cities work with large volumes of data from sensor networks and other sources. To prevent data from being compromised by attacks or errors, smart city IT administrators need to apply attack detection techniques to evaluate possible incidents as quickly as possible. Machine learning has proven to be effective in many fields and, in the context of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), it has proven adequate to detect attacks. However, a smart city poses a much more complex scenario than a WSN, and it has to be evaluated whether these techniques are equally valid and effective. In this work, we evaluate two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines (SVM) and isolation forests) to detect anomalies in a laboratory that reproduces a real smart city use case with heterogeneous devices, algorithms, protocols, and network configurations. The experience has allowed us to show that, although these techniques are of great value for smart cities, additional considerations must be taken into account to effectively detect attacks. Thus, through this empiric analysis, we point out broader challenges and difficulties of using machine learning in this context, both for the technical complexity of the systems, and for the technical difficulty of configuring and implementing them in such environments.

AB  - Electric power systems are experiencing relevant changes involving the growing penetration of distributed generation and energy storage systems, the introduction of electric vehicles, the management of responsive loads, the proposals for new energy markets and so on. Such an evolution is pushing a paradigm shift that is one of the most important challenges in power network design: the management must move from traditional planning and manual intervention to full &ldquo;smartization&rdquo; of medium and low voltage networks. Peculiarities and criticalities of future power distribution networks originate from the complexity of the system which includes both the physical aspects of electric networks and the cyber aspects, like data elaboration, feature extraction, communication, supervision and control; only fully integrated advanced monitoring systems can foster this transition towards network automation. The design and development of such future networks require distinct kinds of expertise in the industrial and information engineering fields. In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive review of current challenges and multidisciplinary interactions in the development of smart distribution networks. The aim of this paper is to discuss, in an integrated and organized manner, the state of the art while focusing on the need for interaction between different disciplines and highlighting how innovative and future-proof outcomes of both research and practice can only emerge from a coordinated design of all the layers in the smart distribution network architecture.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The new standard oneM2M (one machine-to-machine) aims to standardize the architecture and protocols of Internet of Things (IoT) middleware for better interoperability. Although the standard seems promising, it lacks several features for efficiently searching and retrieving IoT data which satisfy users&rsquo; intentions. In this paper, we design and develop a oneM2M-based query engine, called OMQ, that provides a real-time processing over IoT data streams. For this purpose, we define a query language which enables users to retrieve IoT data from data sources using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). We also propose efficient query processing algorithms which utilizes the oneM2M architecture consisting of two nodes: (1) the IoT node and (2) the infrastructure node. IoT nodes of OMQ are mainly sensor devices execute user queries the aggregate, transform and filter operators, whereas the infrastructure node handles the join operator of user queries. Since the query processing algorithms are implemented as the hybrid infrastructure-edge processing, user queries can be executed efficiently in each IoT node rather than only in the infrastructure node. Thus, our OMQ system reduces the query processing time and the network bandwidth. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of OMQ using a real and a synthetic data set. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of OMQ system for executing queries and transferring data from each IoT node.

AB  - Today, buildings consume more than 40% of primary energy in and produce more than 36% of CO2. So, an intelligent controller applied to the buildings for energy and comfort management could achieve significant reduction in energy consumption while improving occupant&rsquo;s comfort. Conventional on/off controllers were only able to automate the tasks in building and were not well suited for energy optimization tasks. Therefore, building energy management has become a focal point in recent years, promising the development of various technologies for various scenarios. This paper deals with a state of the art review on recent developments in building energy management system (BEMS) and occupants comfort, focusing on three model types: white box, black box, and gray box models. Through a comparative study, this paper presents pros and cons of each model.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Tracking multiple pedestrians across multi-camera scenarios is an important part of intelligent video surveillance and has great potential application for public security, which has been an attractive topic in the literature in recent years. In most previous methods, artificial features such as color histograms, HOG descriptors and Haar-like feature were adopted to associate objects among different cameras. But there are still many challenges caused by low resolution, variation of illumination, complex background and posture change. In this paper, a feature extraction network named NCA-Net is designed to improve the performance of multiple objects tracking across multiple cameras by avoiding the problem of insufficient robustness caused by hand-crafted features. The network combines features learning and metric learning via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and the loss function similar to neighborhood components analysis (NCA). The loss function is adapted from the probability loss of NCA aiming at object tracking. The experiments conducted on the NLPR_MCT dataset show that we obtain satisfactory results even with a simple matching operation. In addition, we embed the proposed NCA-Net with two existing tracking systems. The experimental results on the corresponding datasets demonstrate that the extracted features using NCA-net can effectively make improvement on the tracking performance.

TI  - Dynamic Neural Network Modelling of Soil Moisture Content for Predictive Irrigation Scheduling

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Sustainable freshwater management is underpinned by technologies which improve the efficiency of agricultural irrigation systems. Irrigation scheduling has the potential to incorporate real-time feedback from soil moisture and climatic sensors. However, for robust closed-loop decision support, models of the soil moisture dynamics are essential in order to predict crop water needs while adapting to external perturbation and disturbances. This paper presents a Dynamic Neural Network approach for modelling of the temporal soil moisture fluxes. The models are trained to generate a one-day-ahead prediction of the volumetric soil moisture content based on past soil moisture, precipitation, and climatic measurements. Using field data from three sites, a      R 2      value above 0.94 was obtained during model evaluation in all sites. The models were also able to generate robust soil moisture predictions for independent sites which were not used in training the models. The application of the Dynamic Neural Network models in a predictive irrigation scheduling system was demonstrated using AQUACROP simulations of the potato-growing season. The predictive irrigation scheduling system was evaluated against a rule-based system that applies irrigation based on predefined thresholds. Results indicate that the predictive system achieves a water saving ranging between 20 and 46% while realizing a yield and water use efficiency similar to that of the rule-based system.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Every day we experience unprecedented data growth from numerous sources, which contribute to big data in terms of volume, velocity, and variability. These datasets again impose great challenges to analytics framework and computational resources, making the overall analysis difficult for extracting meaningful information in a timely manner. Thus, to harness these kinds of challenges, developing an efficient big data analytics framework is an important research topic. Consequently, to address these challenges by exploiting non-linear relationships from very large and high-dimensional datasets, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are being used in analytics frameworks. Apache Spark has been in use as the fastest big data processing arsenal, which helps to solve iterative ML tasks, using distributed ML library called Spark MLlib. Considering real-world research problems, DL architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an effective approach to overcoming practical issues such as reduced accuracy, long-term sequence dependency, and vanishing and exploding gradient in conventional deep architectures. In this paper, we propose an efficient analytics framework, which is technically a progressive machine learning technique merged with Spark-based linear models, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and LSTM, using a two-stage cascade structure in order to enhance the predictive accuracy. Our proposed architecture enables us to organize big data analytics in a scalable and efficient way. To show the effectiveness of our framework, we applied the cascading structure to two different real-life datasets to solve a multiclass and a binary classification problem, respectively. Experimental results show that our analytical framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a high-level of classification accuracy.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Blockchain has emerged as a decentralized and trustable ledger for recording and storing digital transactions. The mining process of Blockchain, however, incurs a heavy computational workload for miners to solve the proof-of-work puzzle (i.e., a series of the hashing computation), which is prohibitive from the perspective of the mobile terminals (MTs). The advanced multi-access mobile edge computing (MEC), which enables the MTs to offload part of the computational workloads (for solving the proof-of-work) to the nearby edge-servers (ESs), provides a promising approach to address this issue. By offloading the computational workloads via multi-access MEC, the MTs can effectively increase their successful probabilities when participating in the mining game and gain the consequent reward (i.e., winning the bitcoin). However, as a compensation to the ESs which provide the computational resources to the MTs, the MTs need to pay the ESs for the corresponding resource-acquisition costs. Thus, to investigate the trade-off between obtaining the computational resources from the ESs (for solving the proof-of-work) and paying for the consequent cost, we formulate an optimization problem in which the MTs determine their acquired computational resources from different ESs, with the objective of maximizing the MTs’ social net-reward in the mining process while keeping the fairness among the MTs. In spite of the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we exploit its layered structure and propose efficient distributed algorithms for the MTs to individually determine their optimal computational resources acquired from different ESs. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and the performance of our proposed multi-access MEC for Blockchain.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) holds great promises to provide an edge cutting technology that enables numerous innovative services related to healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities and various human daily activities. In a typical IoT scenario, a large number of self-powered smart devices collect real-world data and communicate with each other and with the cloud through a wireless link in order to exchange information and to provide specific services. However, the high energy consumption associated with the wireless transmission limits the performance of these IoT self-powered devices in terms of computation abilities and battery lifetime. Thus, to optimize data transmission, different approaches have to be explored such as cooperative transmission, multi-hop network architectures and sophisticated compression techniques. For the latter, compressive sensing (CS) is a very attractive paradigm to be incorporated in the design of IoT platforms. CS is a novel signal acquisition and compression theory that exploits the sparsity behavior of most natural signals and IoT architectures to achieve power-efficient, real-time platforms that can grant efficient IoT applications. This paper assesses the extant literature that has aimed to incorporate CS in IoT applications. Moreover, the paper highlights emerging trends and identifies several avenues for future CS-based IoT research.

AB  - Distributed systems are commonly built under the assumption that the network is the primary bottleneck, however this assumption no longer holds by emerging high-performance RDMA enabled protocols in datacenters. Designing distributed applications over such protocols requires a fundamental rethinking in communication components in comparison with traditional protocols (i.e., TCP/IP). In this paper, communication paradigms in existing systems and new possible paradigms have been investigated. Advantages and drawbacks of each paradigm have been comprehensively analyzed and experimentally evaluated. The experimental results show that writing the requests to server and reading the response presents up to 10 times better performance comparing to other communication paradigms. To further expand the investigation, the proposed communication paradigm has been substituted in a real-world distributed application, and the performance has been enhanced up to seven times.

AB  - Due to the rapid installation of a massive number of fixed and mobile sensors, monitoring machines are intentionally or unintentionally involved in the production of a large amount of geospatial data. Environmental sensors and related software applications are rapidly altering human lifestyles and even impacting ecological and human health. However, there are rarely specific geospatial sensor web (GSW) applications for certain ecological public health questions. In this paper, we propose an ontology-driven approach for integrating intelligence to manage human and ecological health risks in the GSW. We design a Human and Ecological health Risks Ontology (HERO) based on a semantic sensor network ontology template. We also illustrate a web-based prototype, the Human and Ecological Health Risk Management System (HaEHMS), which helps health experts and decision makers to estimate human and ecological health risks. We demonstrate this intelligent system through a case study of automatic prediction of air quality and related health risk.

TI  - Estimation of the Fe and Cu Contents of the Surface Water in the Ebinur Lake Basin Based on LIBS and a Machine Learning Algorithm

PY  - 2018
VL  - 15

SN  - 1660-4601

AB  - Traditional technology for detecting heavy metals in water is time consuming and difficult and thus is not suitable for quantitative detection of large samples. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) can identify multi-state (such as solid, liquid, and gas) substances simultaneously, rapidly and remotely. In this study, water samples were collected from the Ebinur Lake Basin. The water samples were subjected to LIBS to extract the characteristic peaks of iron (Fe) and copper (Cu). Most of the quantitative analysis of LIBS rarely models and estimates the heavy metal contents in natural environments and cannot quickly determine the heavy metals in field water samples. This study creatively uses the Fe and Cu contents in water samples and the characteristics of their spectral curves in LIBS for regression modelling analysis and estimates their contents in an unknown water body by using LIBS technology and a machine learning algorithm, thus improving the detection rate. The results are as follows: (1) The Cu content of the Ebinur Lake Basin is generally higher than the Fe content, the highest Fe and Cu contents found within the basin are in the Ebinur Lake watershed, and the lowest are in the Jing River. (2) A number of peaks from each sample were found of the LIBS curve. The characteristic analysis lines of Fe and Cu were finally determined according to the intensities of the Fe and Cu characteristic lines, transition probabilities and high signal-to-background ratio (S/B). Their wavelengths were 396.3 and 324.7 nm, respectively. (3) The relative percent deviation (RPD) of the Fe content back-propagation (BP) network estimation model is 0.23, and the prediction ability is poor, so it is impossible to accurately predict the Fe content of samples. In the estimation model of BP network of Cu, the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.8, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is 0.1, and the RPD is 1.79. This result indicates that the BP estimation model of Cu content has good accuracy and strong predictive ability and can accurately predict the Cu content in a sample. In summary, estimation based on LIBS improved the accuracy and efficiency of Fe and Cu content detection in water and provided new ideas and methods for the accurate estimation of Fe and Cu contents in water.

AB  - The continuous increase in deprived living conditions in many cities of the Global South contradicts efforts to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable places. Using examples of Asian, African, and Latin American cities, this study shows the scope and limits of earth observation (EO)-based mapping of deprived living conditions in support of providing consistent global information for the SDG indicator 11.1.1 “proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing”. At the technical level, we compare several EO-based methods and imagery for mapping deprived living conditions, discussing their ability to map such areas including differences in terms of accuracy and performance at the city scale. At the operational level, we compare available municipal maps showing identified deprived areas with the spatial extent of morphological mapped areas of deprived living conditions (using EO) at the city scale, discussing the reasons for inconsistencies between municipal and EO-based maps. We provide an outlook on how EO-based mapping of deprived living conditions could contribute to a global spatial information base to support targeting of deprived living conditions in support of the SDG Goal 11.1.1 indicator, when uncertainties and ethical considerations on data provision are well addressed.

AB  - Digitalization has enabled infrastructure and cities to be “smarter”; the use of physical space and energy, the transmission of information, the management of users, assets and processes, the operation of businesses and companies have been progressively digitalized. The main challenges of a Smart City is its definition, scope and interconnections; there are different approaches to Smart City implementations that vary from collaborative multidisciplinary environments, the addition of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) within its physical fabric to the use of Big Data for higher abstraction decisions. This paper presents the concept of Digital as a Service (DaaS), where any complete digitalization can be implemented independently of its associated physical infrastructure in a Cloud environment; DasS would enable an interoperable Virtual Digital Infrastructure (VDI). In addition, this paper reviews the current Digital Systems, Transmission Networks, Servers and Management Systems. The next Industrial Revolution will be founded on Artificial Intelligence that will entirely replace humans by taking production and management decisions based on the Internet of Things (IoT), the Cloud, BlockChain, Big Data, Virtual Reality and the combination of digital and real infrastructure or city. Digital as a Service would be its enabler by providing the entire interconnection, integration and virtualization of its Space, Services and Structure (3S).

AB  - Cloud computing has significantly enhanced the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) by ensuring and supporting the Quality of Service (QoS) of IoT applications. However, cloud services are still far from IoT devices. Notably, the transmission of IoT data experiences network issues, such as high latency. In this case, the cloud platforms cannot satisfy the IoT applications that require real-time response. Yet, the location of cloud services is one of the challenges encountered in the evolution of the IoT paradigm. Recently, edge cloud computing has been proposed to bring cloud services closer to the IoT end-users, becoming a promising paradigm whose pitfalls and challenges are not yet well understood. This paper aims at presenting the leading-edge computing concerning the movement of services from centralized cloud platforms to decentralized platforms, and examines the issues and challenges introduced by these highly distributed environments, to support engineers and researchers who might benefit from this transition.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 10
IS  - 11
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Socioeconomic attributes are essential characteristics of people, and many studies on economic attribute inference focus on data that contain user profile information. For data without user profiles, like smart card data, there is no validated method for inferring individual economic attributes. This study aims to bridge this gap by formulating a mobility to attribute framework to infer passengers&rsquo; economic attributes based on the relationship between individual mobility and personal attributes. This framework integrates shop consumer prices, house prices, and smart card data using three steps: individual mobility extraction, location feature identification, and economic attribute inference. Each passenger&rsquo;s individual mobility is extracted by smart card data. Economic features of stations are described using house price and shop consumer price data. Then, each passenger&rsquo;s comprehensive consumption indicator set is formulated by integrating these data. Finally, individual economic levels are classified. From the case study of Beijing, commuting distance and trip frequency using the metro have a negative correlation with passengers&rsquo; income and the results confirm that metro passengers are mainly in the low- and middle-income groups. This study improves on passenger information extracted from data without user profile information and provides a method to integrate multisource big data mining for more information.

AB  - Information Centric Network (ICN) is expected to be the favorable deployable future Internet paradigm. ICN intends to replace the current IP-based model with the name-based content-centric model, as it aims at providing better security, scalability, and content distribution. However, it is a challenging task to conceive how ICN can be linked with the other most emerging paradigm, i.e., Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). In this article, we present an overview of the ICN-based VANET approach in line with its contributions and research challenges.In addition, the connectivity issues of vehicular ICN model is presented with some other emerging paradigms, such as Software Defined Network (SDN), Cloud, and Edge computing. Moreover, some ICN-based VANET research opportunities, in terms of security, mobility, routing, naming, caching, and fifth generation (5G) communications, are also covered at the end of the paper.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enormous potential in enabling new applications in various areas, ranging from military, security, medicine, and surveillance to traffic-monitoring applications. Lately, there has been heavy investment in the development of UAVs and multi-UAVs systems that can collaborate and complete missions more efficiently and economically. Emerging technologies such as 4G/5G networks have significant potential on UAVs equipped with cameras, sensors, and GPS receivers in delivering Internet of Things (IoT) services from great heights, creating an airborne domain of the IoT. However, there are many issues to be resolved before the effective use of UAVs can be made, including security, privacy, and management. As such, in this paper we review new UAV application areas enabled by the IoT and 5G technologies, analyze the sensor requirements, and overview solutions for fleet management over aerial-networking, privacy, and security challenges. Finally, we propose a framework that supports and enables these technologies on UAVs. The introduced framework provisions a holistic IoT architecture that enables the protection of UAVs as “flying” things in a collaborative networked environment.

VL  - 18
IS  - 11
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper deals with recently proposed algorithms for real-time distributed blind macro-calibration of sensor networks based on consensus (synchronization). The algorithms are completely decentralized and do not require a fusion center. The goal is to consolidate all of the existing results on the subject, present them in a unified way, and provide additional important analysis of theoretical and practical issues that one can encounter when designing and applying the methodology. We first present the basic algorithm which estimates local calibration parameters by enforcing asymptotic consensus, in the mean-square sense and with probability one (w.p.1), on calibrated sensor gains and calibrated sensor offsets. For the more realistic case in which additive measurement noise, communication dropouts and additive communication noise are present, two algorithm modifications are discussed: one that uses a simple compensation term, and a more robust one based on an instrumental variable. The modified algorithms also achieve asymptotic agreement for calibrated sensor gains and offsets, in the mean-square sense and w.p.1. The convergence rate can be determined in terms of an upper bound on the mean-square error. The case when the communications between nodes is completely asynchronous, which is of substantial importance for real-world applications, is also presented. Suggestions for design of a priori adjustable weights are given. We also present the results for the case in which the underlying sensor network has a subset of (precalibrated) reference sensors with fixed calibration parameters. Wide applicability and efficacy of these algorithms are illustrated on several simulation examples. Finally, important open questions and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Nowadays, it is more and more important to deal with the potential security issues of internet-of-things (IoT). Indeed, using the physical layer features of IoT wireless signals to achieve individual identity authentication is an effective way to enhance the security of IoT. However, traditional classifiers need to know all the categories in advance to get the recognition models. Realistically, it is difficult to collect all types of samples, which will result in some mistakes that the unknown target class may be decided as a known one. Consequently, this paper constructs an improving open-categorical classification model based on the generative adversarial networks (OCC-GAN) to solve the above problems. Here, we have modified the loss function of the generative model G and the discriminative model D. Compared to the traditional GAN model which can generate the fake sample overlapping with the real samples, our proposed G model generates the fake samples as negative samples which are evenly surrounding with the real samples, while the D model learns to distinguish between real samples and fake samples. Besides, we add auxiliary training not only to gain a better recognition result but also to improve the efficiency of the model. Furthermore, Our proposed model is verified through experimental study. Compared to other common methods, such as one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) and one-versus-rest support vector machine (OvR-SVM), the OCC-GAN model has a better performance. The recognition rate of the OCC-GAN model can reach more than 90% with a recall rate of 97% by the data of the IoT module.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Social sensors perceive the real world through social media and online web services, which have the advantages of low cost and large coverage over traditional physical sensors. In intelligent transportation researches, sensing and analyzing such social signals provide a new path to monitor, control and optimize transportation systems. However, current research is largely focused on using single channel online social signals to extract and sense traffic information. Clearly, sensing and exploiting multi-channel social signals could effectively provide deeper understanding of traffic incidents. In this paper, we utilize cross-platform online data, i.e., Sina Weibo and News, as multi-channel social signals, then we propose a word2vec-based event fusion (WBEF) model   for sensing, detecting, representing, linking and fusing urban traffic incidents. Thus, each traffic incident can be comprehensively described from multiple aspects, and finally the whole picture of unban traffic events can be obtained and visualized. The proposed WBEF architecture was trained by about 1.15 million multi-channel online data from Qingdao (a coastal city in China), and the experiments show our method surpasses the baseline model, achieving an 88.1% F1 score in urban traffic incident detection. The model also demonstrates its effectiveness in the open scenario test.

We model and solve the task of reducing the size of the dataset used for learning about campus mobility. Our conclusions show an important reduction of the required data to learn mobility patterns by more than 90%, while improving (at the same time) the precision of the predictions of theapplied machine-learning method (up to 15%). All this was done along with the construction of a real system in a city, which hopefully resulted in a very comprehensive work in smart cities using sensors.

AB  - Undoubtedly, the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has impacted on our every-day life, surrounding us with smart objects. Thus, the potentialities of this new market attracted the industry, so that many enterprises developed their own IoT platforms aiming at helping IoT services&rsquo; developers. In the multitude of possible platforms, selecting the most suitable to implement a specific service is not straightforward, especially from a security perspective. This paper analyzes some of the most prominent proposals in the IoT platforms market-place, performing an in-depth security comparison using five common criteria. These criteria are detailed in sub-criteria, so that they can be used as a baseline for the development of a secure IoT service. Leveraging the knowledge gathered from our in-depth study, both researchers and developers may select the IoT platform which best fits their needs. Additionally, an IoT service for monitoring commercial flights is implemented in two previously analyzed IoT platforms, giving an adequate detail level to represent a solid guideline for future IoT developers.

AB  - The use of wearable and Internet-of-Things (IoT) for smart and affordable healthcare is trending. In traditional setups, the cloud backend receives the healthcare data and performs monitoring and prediction for diseases, diagnosis, and wellness prediction. Fog computing (FC) is a distributed computing paradigm that leverages low-power embedded processors in an intermediary node between the client layer and cloud layer. The diagnosis for wellness and fitness monitoring could be transferred to the fog layer from the cloud layer. Such a paradigm leads to a reduction in latency at an increased throughput. This paper processes a fog-based deep learning model, DeepFog that collects the data from individuals and predicts the wellness stats using a deep neural network model that can handle heterogeneous and multidimensional data. The three important abnormalities in wellness namely, (i) diabetes; (ii) hypertension attacks and (iii) stress type classification were chosen for experimental studies. We performed a detailed analysis of proposed models&rsquo; accuracy on standard datasets. The results validated the efficacy of the proposed system and architecture for accurate monitoring of these critical wellness and fitness criteria. We used standard datasets and open source software tools for our experiments.

AB  - With the increasing size of cloud data centers, the number of users and virtual machines (VMs) increases rapidly. The requests of users are entertained by VMs residing on physical servers. The dramatic growth of internet services results in unbalanced network resources. Resource management is an important factor for the performance of a cloud. Various techniques are used to manage the resources of a cloud efficiently. VM-consolidation is an intelligent and efficient strategy to balance the load of cloud data centers. VM-placement is an important subproblem of the VM-consolidation problem that needs to be resolved. The basic objective of VM-placement is to minimize the utilization rate of physical machines (PMs). VM-placement is used to save energy and cost. An enhanced levy-based particle swarm optimization algorithm with variable sized bin packing (PSOLBP) is proposed for solving the VM-placement problem. Moreover, the best-fit strategy is also used with the variable sized bin packing problem (VSBPP). Simulations are done to authenticate the adaptivity of the proposed algorithm. Three algorithms are implemented in Matlab. The given algorithm is compared with simple particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a hybrid of levy flight and particle swarm optimization (LFPSO). The proposed algorithm efficiently minimized the number of running PMs. VM-consolidation is an NP-hard problem, however, the proposed algorithm outperformed the other two algorithms.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Vehicle driving path planning is an important information service in intelligent transportation systems. As an important basis for path planning optimization, the travel time prediction method has attracted much attention. However, traffic flow has features of high nonlinearity, time-varying, and uncertainty, which makes it hard for prediction method with single feature to meet the accuracy demand of intelligent transportation system in big data environment. In this paper, the historical vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) information data is used to establish the traffic prediction model. Firstly, the Clustering in QUEst (CLIQUE)-based clustering algorithm V-CLIQUE is proposed to analyze the historical vehicle GPS data. Secondly, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction model is proposed. Finally, the ANN-based weighted shortest path algorithm, A-Dijkstra, is proposed. We used mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to evaluate the predictive model and compare it with the predicted results of Average and support regression vector (SRV). Experiments show that the improved ANN path planning model we proposed can accurately predict real-time traffic status at the given location. It has less relative error and saves time for users&rsquo; travel while saving social resources.

AB  - Indoor emitter localization is a topic of continued interest for improving wireless security as wireless technologies continue to become more advanced. Conventional methods have focused on the localization of devices relative to multi-sensor systems owing to ease of implementation with pre-existing infrastructures. This work, however, focuses on enhancing wireless security via non-cooperative emitter localization in scenarios where only a single receiver can be employed. A vector sensor is simulated and experimentally developed that extracts three-dimensional signal characteristics for room-based emitter localization and is compared to conventional methodologies such as Received Signal Strength (RSS), Time of Arrival (ToA), and Direction of Arrival (DoA). The proposed method generates time-frequency fingerprints and extracts features through dimensionality reduction. A second stage extracts spatial parameters consisting of Channel State Information (CSI) and DoAs that are analyzed using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to segregate fine-grained regions of interest within each room where the non-cooperative emitter resides. Blind channel equalization cascaded with a least squares channel estimate is used for acquiring the CSI, whereas the DoAs are obtained by unique trigonometric properties of the vector sensing antenna. The results demonstrate that a vector sensor can improve non-cooperative emitter localization and enhance wireless security in indoor environments.

AB  - Indoor localization has become a mature research area, but further scientific developments are limited due to the lack of open datasets and corresponding frameworks suitable to compare and evaluate specialized localization solutions. Although several competitions provide datasets and environments for comparing different solutions, they hardly consider novel technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is gaining more and more importance in indoor localization due to its wide availability in personal and environmental devices and to its low costs and flexibility. This paper contributes to cover this gap by: (i) presenting a new indoor BLE dataset; (ii) reviewing several, meaningful use cases in different application scenarios; and (iii) discussing alternative uses of the dataset in the evaluation of different positioning and navigation applications, namely localization, tracking, occupancy and social interaction.

IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - IEEE 802.11p based Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) is considered a potential wireless technology to enable transportation safety and traffic efficiency. A major challenge in the development of IEEE 802.11p technology is ensuring communication reliability in highly dynamic Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) environments. The design of IEEE 802.11p does not have a sufficient number of training symbols in the time domain and pilot carriers in the frequency domain to enable accurate estimation of rapidly varying V2V channels. The channel estimation of IEEE 802.11p is preamble based, which cannot guarantee a suitable equalization in urban and highway scenarios, especially for longer length data packets. This limitation has been investigated by some research works, which suggest that one major challenge is determining an accurate means of updating channel estimate over the course of packet length while adhering to the standard. The motivation behind this article is to overcome this challenge. We have proposed an improved Constructed Data Pilot (iCDP) scheme which adheres to the standard and constructs data pilots by considering the correlation characteristics between adjacent data symbols in time domain and adjacent subcarriers in frequency domain. It is in contrast to previous schemes which considered the correlation in the time domain. The results have shown that the proposed scheme performs better than previous schemes in terms of bit error rate (BER) and root-mean-square error (RMSE).

TI  - Prediction of Hourly Effect of Land Use on Crime

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Predicting the exact urban places where crime is most likely to occur is one of the greatest interests for Police Departments. Therefore, the goal of the research presented in this paper is to identify specific urban areas where a crime could happen in Manhattan, NY for every hour of a day. The outputs from this research are the following: (i) predicted land uses that generates the top three most committed crimes in Manhattan, by using machine learning (random forest and logistic regression), (ii) identifying the exact hours when most of the assaults are committed, together with hot spots during these hours, by applying time series and hot spot analysis, (iii) built hourly prediction models for assaults based on the land use, by deploying logistic regression. Assault, as a physical attack on someone, according to criminal law, is identified as the third most committed crime in Manhattan. Land use (residential, commercial, recreational, mixed use etc.) is assigned to every area or lot in Manhattan, determining the actual use or activities within each particular lot. While plotting assaults on the map for every hour, this investigation has identified that the hot spots where assaults occur were ‘moving’ and not confined to specific lots within Manhattan. This raises a number of questions: Why are hot spots of assaults not static in an urban environment? What makes them ‘move’—is it a particular urban pattern? Is the ‘movement’ of hot spots related to human activities during the day and night? Answering these questions helps to build the initial frame for assault prediction within every hour of a day. Knowing a specific land use vulnerability to assault during each exact hour can assist the police departments to allocate forces during those hours in risky areas. For the analysis, the study is using two datasets: a crime dataset with geographical locations of crime, date and time, and a geographic dataset about land uses with land use codes for every lot, each obtained from open databases. The study joins two datasets based on the spatial location and classifies data into 24 classes, based on the time range when the assault occurred. Machine learning methods reveal the effect of land uses on larceny, harassment and assault, the three most committed crimes in Manhattan. Finally, logistic regression provides hourly prediction models and unveils the type of land use where assaults could occur during each hour for both day and night.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Fog computing is a paradigm that extends cloud computing and services to the edge of the network in order to address the inherent problems of the cloud, such as latency and lack of mobility support and location-awareness. The fog is a decentralized platform capable of operating and processing data locally and can be installed in heterogeneous hardware which makes it ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are an integral part of any security system for fog and IoT networks to ensure the quality of service. Due to the resource limitations of fog and IoT devices, lightweight IDS is highly desirable. In this paper, we present a lightweight IDS based on a vector space representation using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. We evaluated the presented IDS against the Australian Defense Force Academy Linux Dataset (ADFA-LD) and Australian Defense Force Academy Windows Dataset (ADFA-WD), which are new generation system calls datasets that contain exploits and attacks on various applications. The simulation shows that by using a single hidden layer and a small number of nodes, we are able to achieve a 94% Accuracy, 95% Recall, and 92% F1-Measure in ADFA-LD and 74% Accuracy, 74% Recall, and 74% F1-Measure in ADFA-WD. The performance is evaluated using a Raspberry Pi.

TI  - An Improved Unauthorized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Detection Algorithm Using Radiofrequency-Based Statistical Fingerprint Analysis
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now readily available worldwide and users can easily fly them remotely using smart controllers. This has created the problem of keeping unauthorized UAVs away from private or sensitive areas where they can be a personal or public threat. This paper proposes an improved radio frequency (RF)-based method to detect UAVs. The clutter (interference) is eliminated using a background filtering method. Then singular value decomposition (SVD) and average filtering are used to reduce the noise and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Spectrum accumulation (SA) and statistical fingerprint analysis (SFA) are employed to provide two frequency estimates. These estimates are used to determine if a UAV is present in the detection environment. The data size is reduced using a region of interest (ROI), and this improves the system efficiency and improves azimuth estimation accuracy. Detection results are obtained using real UAV RF signals obtained experimentally which show that the proposed method is more effective than other well-known detection algorithms. The recognition rate with this method is close to 100% within a distance of 2.4 km and greater than 90% within a distance of 3 km. Further, multiple UAVs can be detected accurately using the proposed method.

TI  - SURROGATES: Virtual OBUs to Foster 5G Vehicular Services
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Virtualization technologies are key enablers of softwarized 5G networks, and their usage in the vehicular domain can provide flexibility and reliability in real deployments, where mobility and processing needs may be an issue. Next-generation vehicular services, such as the ones in the area of urban mobility and, in general, those interconnecting on-board sensors, require continuous data gathering and processing, but current architectures are stratified in two-tier solutions in which data is collected by on-board units (OBU) and sent to cloud servers. In this line, intermediate cache and processing layers are needed in order to cover quasi-ubiquitous data-gathering needs of vehicles in scenarios of smart cities/roads considering vehicles as moving sensors. The SURROGATES solution presented in this paper proposes to virtualize vehicle OBUs and create a novel Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) layer with the aim of offloading processing from the vehicle and serving data-access requests. This deals with potential disconnection periods of vehicles, saves radio resources when accessing the physical OBU and improves data processing performance. A proof of concept has been implemented using OpenStack and Open Source MANO to virtualize resources and gather data from in-vehicle sensors, and a final traffic monitoring service has been implemented to validate the proposal. Performance results reveal a speedup of more than 50% in the data request resolution, with consequently great savings of network resources in the wireless segment. Thus, this work opens a novel path regarding the virtualization of end-devices in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) ecosystem.

VL  - 8

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting (STELF) through Data Analytics (DA) is an emerging and active research area. Forecasting about electricity load and price provides future trends and patterns of consumption. There is a loss in generation and use of electricity. So, multiple strategies are used to solve the aforementioned problems. Day-ahead electricity price and load forecasting are beneficial for both suppliers and consumers. In this paper, Deep Learning (DL) and data mining techniques are used for electricity load and price forecasting. XG-Boost (XGB), Decision Tree (DT), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Random Forest (RF) are used for feature selection and feature extraction. Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (ECNN) and Enhanced Support Vector Regression (ESVR) are used as classifiers. Grid Search (GS) is used for tuning of the parameters of classifiers to increase their performance. The risk of over-fitting is mitigated by adding multiple layers in ECNN. Finally, the proposed models are compared with different benchmark schemes for stability analysis. The performance metrics MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperformed other benchmark schemes. ECNN performed well with threshold 0.08 for load forecasting. While ESVR performed better with threshold value 0.15 for price forecasting. ECNN achieved almost 2% better accuracy than CNN. Furthermore, ESVR achieved almost 1% better accuracy than the existing scheme (SVR).

AB  - We spend about 90% of our lives in indoor living environments. Thus, it is essential to provide indoor air quality monitoring for enhanced living environments. Advances in networking, sensors, and embedded devices have made monitoring and supply of assistance possible to people in their homes. Technological advancements have made possible the building of smart devices with significant capabilities for sensing and connecting, but also provide several improvements in ambient assisted living system architectures. Indoor air quality assumes an important role in building productive and healthy indoor environments. In this paper, the authors present an Internet of Things system for real-time indoor air quality monitoring named iAir. This system is composed by an ESP8266 as the communication and processing unit and a MICS-6814 sensor as the sensing unit. The MICS-6814 is a metal oxide semiconductor sensor capable of detecting several gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ethanol, methane, and propane. The iAir system also provides a smartphone application for data consulting and real-time notifications. Compared to other solutions, the iAir system is based on open-source technologies and operates as a totally Wi-Fi system, with several advantages such as its modularity, scalability, low cost, and easy installation. The results obtained are very promising, representing a meaningful contribution for enhanced living environments as iAir provides real-time monitoring for enhanced ambient assisted living and occupational health.

AB  - Designing advanced health monitoring systems is still an active research topic. Wearable and remote monitoring devices enable monitoring of physiological and clinical parameters (heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, etc.) and analysis using cloud-centric machine-learning applications and decision-support systems to predict critical clinical states. This paper moves from a totally cloud-centric concept to a more distributed one, by transferring sensor data processing and analysis tasks to the edges of the network. The resulting solution enables the analysis and interpretation of sensor-data traces within the wearable device to provide actionable alerts without any dependence on cloud services. In this paper, we use a supervised-learning approach to detect heartbeats and classify arrhythmias. The system uses a window-based feature definition that is suitable for execution within an asymmetric multicore embedded processor that provides a dedicated core for hardware assisted pattern matching. We evaluate the performance of the system in comparison with various existing approaches, in terms of achieved accuracy in the detection of abnormal events. The results show that the proposed embedded system achieves a high detection rate that in some cases matches the accuracy of the state-of-the-art algorithms executed in standard processors.

TI  - Household Power Demand Prediction Using Evolutionary Ensemble Neural Network Pool with Multiple Network Structures
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 3
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The progress of technology on energy and IoT fields has led to an increasingly complicated electric environment in low-voltage local microgrid, along with the extensions of electric vehicle, micro-generation, and local storage. It is required to establish a home energy management system (HEMS) to efficiently integrate and manage household energy micro-generation, consumption and storage, in order to realize decentralized local energy systems at the community level. Domestic power demand prediction is of great importance for establishing HEMS on realizing load balancing as well as other smart energy solutions with the support of IoT techniques. Artificial neural networks with various network types (e.g., DNN, LSTM/GRU based RNN) and other configurations are widely utilized on energy predictions. However, the selection of network configuration for each research is generally a case by case study achieved through empirical or enumerative approaches. Moreover, the commonly utilized network initialization methods assign parameter values based on random numbers, which cause diversity on model performance, including learning efficiency, forecast accuracy, etc. In this paper, an evolutionary ensemble neural network pool (EENNP) method is proposed to achieve a population of well-performing networks with proper combinations of configuration and initialization automatically. In the experimental study, power demand predictions of multiple households are explored in three application scenarios: optimizing potential network configuration set, forecasting single household power demand, and refilling missing data. The impacts of evolutionary parameters on model performance are investigated. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method achieves better solutions on the considered scenarios. The optimized potential network configuration set using EENNP achieves a similar result to manual optimization. The results of household demand prediction and missing data refilling perform better than the na&iuml;ve and simple predictors.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - This paper takes 50 ETF options in the options market with high transaction complexity as the research goal. The Random Forest (RF) model, the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) model, and the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model are used to predict 50 ETF price. Firstly, the original quantitative investment strategy is taken as the research object, and the 15 min trading frequency, which is more in line with the actual trading situation, is used, and then the Delta hedging concept of the options is introduced to control the risk of the quantitative investment strategy, to achieve the 15 min hedging strategy. Secondly, the final transaction price, buy price, highest price, lowest price, volume, historical volatility, and the implied volatility of the time segment marked with 50 ETF are the seven key factors affecting the price of 50 ETF. Then, two different types of LSTM-SVR models, LSTM-SVR I and LSTM-SVR II, are used to predict the final transaction price of the 50 ETF in the next time segment. In LSTM-SVR I model, the output of LSTM and seven key factors are combined as the input of SVR model. In LSTM-SVR II model, the hidden state vectors of LSTM and seven key factors are combined as the inputs of the SVR model. The results of the two LSTM-SVR models are compared with each other, and the better one is applied to the trading strategy. Finally, the benefit of the deep learning-based quantitative investment strategy, the resilience, and the maximum drawdown are used as indicators to judge the pros and cons of the research results. The accuracy and deviations of the LSTM-SVR prediction models are compared with those of the LSTM model and those of the RF model. The experimental results show that the quantitative investment strategy based on deep learning has higher returns than the traditional quantitative investment strategy, the yield curve is more stable, and the anti-fall performance is better.

TI  - Optimal Scheduling of Energy Storage Using A New Priority-Based Smart Grid Control Method

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This paper presents a method to optimally use an energy storage system (such as a battery) on a microgrid with load and photovoltaic generation. The purpose of the method is to employ the photovoltaic generation and energy storage systems to reduce the main grid bill, which includes an energy cost and a power peak cost. The method predicts the loads and generation power of each day, and then searches for an optimal storage behavior plan for the energy storage system according to these predictions. However, this plan is not followed in an open-loop control structure as in previous publications, but provided to a real-time decision algorithm, which also considers real power measures. This algorithm considers a series of device priorities in addition to the storage plan, which makes it robust enough to comply with unpredicted situations. The whole proposed method is implemented on a real-hardware test bench, with its different steps being distributed between a personal computer and a programmable logic controller according to their time scale. When compared to a different state-of-the-art method, the proposed method is concluded to better adjust the energy storage system usage to the photovoltaic generation and general consumption.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Clustering analysis of massive data in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSN) has become a hot topic. However, most data clustering algorithms have difficulty in obtaining latent nonlinear correlations of data features, resulting in a low clustering accuracy. In addition, it is difficult to extract features from missing or corrupted data, so incomplete data are widely used in practical work. In this paper, the optimally designed variational autoencoder networks is proposed for extracting features of incomplete data and using high-order fuzzy c-means algorithm (HOFCM) to improve cluster performance of incomplete data. Specifically, the feature extraction model is improved by using variational autoencoder to learn the feature of incomplete data. To capture nonlinear correlations in different heterogeneous data patterns, tensor based fuzzy c-means algorithm is used to cluster low-dimensional features. The tensor distance is used as the distance measure to capture the unknown correlations of data as much as possible. Finally, in the case that the clustering results are obtained, the missing data can be restored by using the low-dimensional features. Experiments on real datasets show that the proposed algorithm not only can improve the clustering performance of incomplete data effectively, but also can fill in missing features and get better data reconstruction results.

AB  - The traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has evolved towards intelligent IoT applications which exploit knowledge produced by IoT devices using artificial intelligence techniques. Knowledge sharing between IoT devices is a challenging issue in this trend. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge of Things (KoT) framework which enables sharing self-taught knowledge between IoT devices which require similar or identical knowledge without help from the cloud. The proposed KoT framework allows an IoT device to effectively produce, cumulate, and share its self-taught knowledge with other devices at the edge in the vicinity. This framework can alleviate behavioral repetition in users and computational redundancy in systems in intelligent IoT applications. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we examine a smart home case study and build a prototype of the KoT framework-based smart home system. Experimental results show that the proposed KoT framework reduces the response time to use intelligent IoT devices from a user&rsquo;s perspective and the power consumption for compuation from a system&rsquo;s perspective.

This article analyses the product rank relevance provided by different commercial Big Data recommender systems (Grouplens film, Trip Advisor and Amazon); it also proposes an Intelligent Recommender System (IRS) based on the Random Neural Network; IRS acts as an interface between the customer and the different Recommender Systems that iteratively adapts to the perceived user relevance. In addition, a relevance metric that combines both relevance and rank is presented; this metric is used to validate and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm. On average, IRS outperforms the Big Data recommender systems after learning iteratively from its customer.

T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This work proposes a persuasion model based on argumentation theory and users&rsquo; characteristics for improving the use of resources in bike sharing systems, fostering the use of the bicycles and thus contributing to greater energy sustainability by reducing the use of carbon-based fuels. More specifically, it aims to achieve a balanced network of pick-up and drop-off stations in urban areas with the help of the users, thus reducing the dedicated management trucks that redistribute bikes among stations. The proposal aims to persuade users to choose different routes from the shortest route between a start and an end location. This persuasion is carried out when it is not possible to park the bike in the desired station due to the lack of parking slots, or when the user is highly influenceable. Differently to other works, instead of employing a single criteria to recommend alternative stations, the proposed system can incorporate a variety of criteria. This result is achieved by providing a defeasible logic-based persuasion engine that is capable of aggregating the results from multiple recommendation rules. The proposed framework is showcased with an example scenario of a bike sharing system.

However, computational methods are necessary to assist in the process of creating smart cities because they are fundamental to the decision-making process, assist in policy making, and offer improved services to citizens. As such, the aim of this research is to present a systematic review regarding data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) approaches adopted in the promotion of smart cities. The Methodi Ordinatio was used to find relevant articles and the VOSviewer software was performed for a network analysis. Thirty-nine significant articles were identified for analysis from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, in which we analyzed the DM and ML techniques used, as well as the areas that are most engaged in promoting smart cities. Predictive analytics was the most common technique and the studies focused primarily on the areas of smart mobility and smart environment. This study seeks to encourage approaches that can be used by governmental agencies and companies to develop smart cities, being essential to assist in the Sustainable Development Goals.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - On-demand shared mobility is increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to address urban transport challenges in large and fast-growing cities. The appeal of this form of transport is largely attributed to its convenience, ease of use, and affordability made possible through digital platforms and innovations. The convergence of the shared economy with a number of established and emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud and Fog computing—is helping to expedite their deployment as a new form of public transport. Recently, this has manifested itself in the form of Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMoD) solutions, aimed at meeting personal travel demands through flexible routing and scheduling. Increasingly, these shared mobility solutions are blurring the boundaries with existing forms of public transport, particularly bus operations. This paper presents an environmental scan and analysis of the technological, social, and economic impacts surrounding disruptive technology-driven shared mobility trends. Specifically, the paper includes an examination of current and anticipated external factors that are of direct relevance to collaborative and low carbon mobility. The paper also outlines how these trends are likely to influence the mobility industries now and into the future. The paper collates information from a wide body of literature and reports on findings from actual ‘use cases’ that exist today which have used these disruptive mobility solutions to deliver substantial benefits to travellers around the world. Finally, the paper provides stakeholders with insight into identifying and responding to the likely needs and impacts of FMoD and informs their policy and strategy positions on the implementation of smart mobility systems in their cities and jurisdictions.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) has been a popular research area in the last decade. The dependability of CPS is still a critical issue, and few surveys have been published in this domain. CPS is a dynamic complex system, which involves various multidisciplinary technologies. To avoid human errors and to simplify management, self-management CPS (SCPS) is a wise choice. To achieve dependable self-management, systematic solutions are necessary to verify the design and to guarantee the safety of self-adaptation decisions, as well as to maintain the health of SCPS. This survey first recalls the concepts of dependability, and proposes a generic environment-in-loop processing flow of self-management CPS, and then analyzes the error sources and challenges of self-management through the formal feedback flow. Focusing on reducing the complexity, we first survey the self-adaptive architecture approaches and applied dependability means, then we introduce a hybrid multi-role self-adaptive architecture, and discuss the supporting technologies for dependable self-management at the architecture level. Focus on dependable environment-centered adaptation, we investigate the verification and validation (V&amp;V) methods for making safe self-adaptation decision and the solutions for processing decision dependably. For system-centered adaptation, the comprehensive self-healing methods are summarized. Finally, we analyze the missing pieces of the technology puzzle and the future directions. In this survey, the technical trends for dependable CPS design and maintenance are discussed, an all-in-one solution is proposed to integrate these technologies and build a dependable organic SCPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on dependable SCPS building and evaluation.

AB  - Radio-based locating systems allow for a robust and continuous tracking in industrial environments and are a key enabler for the digitalization of processes in many areas such as production, manufacturing, and warehouse management. Time difference of arrival (TDoA) systems estimate the time-of-flight (ToF) of radio burst signals with a set of synchronized antennas from which they trilaterate accurate position estimates of mobile tags. However, in industrial environments where multipath propagation is predominant it is difficult to extract the correct ToF of the signal. This article shows how deep learning (DL) can be used to estimate the position of mobile objects directly from the raw channel impulse responses (CIR) extracted at the receivers. Our experiments show that our DL-based position estimation not only works well under harsh multipath propagation but also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in line-of-sight situations.

AB  - The ecological footprint (EF) model is an effective tool for determining whether natural assets are over-utilized. The traditional EF (TEF) model and its improved model which include the emergy ecological footprint (EEF) and net primary productivity ecological footprint (NPPEF) have been widely used, but some emergy data are hard to obtain and NPP data is not stable. Therefore, in this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) EF model with emergy and net primary productivity (3DEF-ENPP) is proposed. The Henan province of China was chosen as the research area and commonly used statistical yearbook data and NPP data were used which are easy to obtain. We expanded a 2D EF model to a 3D EF model and took advantage of emergy analysis and net primary productivity because they have stable energy parameters, can reflect the difference in bioproductivity of different land types, and are suitable for spatial and temporal analysis. Based on our model, we obtained a rectified emergy-based ecological footprint (REEF), an ecological capacity based on net primary productivity (RNPPEC), a rectified ecological deficit (RED), an ecological footprint intensity (EFI), an ecological coordination coefficient, and a 3D-EF, which can comprehensively reflect Henan&rsquo;s ecological security status. The results show that: (1) The REEF and RNPPED obtained by our proposed model are more stable than those of the former method. (2) Henan&rsquo;s RED has been negative and has a downward trend, which indicates the burden of human activities on the natural environment are becoming increasingly serious. (3) The EF is increasing with time, indicating that the consumption of natural resources in Henan is gradually increasing. High EF regions are mainly distributed in the northwestern area. Southeastern regions have relatively low EFs. (4) Capital flows cannot meet the needs of current social development in Henan province and it is in a state of unsustainable development. (5) The ecological stress index is at a safe state but is still at an ecological security warning level and Henan has good ecological coordination.

AB  - As an emerging and promising computing paradigm in the Internet of things (IoT), edge computing can significantly reduce energy consumption and enhance computation capability for resource-constrained IoT devices. Computation offloading has recently received considerable attention in edge computing. Many existing studies have investigated the computation offloading problem with independent computing tasks. However, due to the inter-task dependency in various devices that commonly happens in IoT systems, achieving energy-efficient computation offloading decisions remains a challengeable problem. In this paper, a cloud-assisted edge computing framework with a three-tier network in an IoT environment is introduced. In this framework, we first formulated an energy consumption minimization problem as a mixed integer programming problem considering two constraints, the task-dependency requirement and the completion time deadline of the IoT service. To address this problem, we then proposed an Energy-efficient Collaborative Task Computation Offloading (ECTCO) algorithm based on a semidefinite relaxation and stochastic mapping approach to obtain strategies of tasks computation offloading for IoT sensors. Simulation results demonstrated that the cloud-assisted edge computing framework was feasible and the proposed ECTCO algorithm could effectively reduce the energy cost of IoT sensors.

TI  - Measurement Noise Recommendation for Efficient Kalman Filtering over a Large Amount of Sensor Data

AB  - To effectively maintain and analyze a large amount of real-time sensor data, one often uses a filtering technique that reflects characteristics of original data well. This paper proposes a novel method for recommending the measurement noise for Kalman filtering, which is one of the most representative filtering techniques. Kalman filtering corrects inaccurate values of input sensor data, and its filtering performance varies depending on the input noise parameters. In particular, if the noise parameters determined based on the user&rsquo;s experience are incorrect, the accuracy of Kalman filtering may be reduced significantly. Based on this observation, this paper addresses how to determine the measurement noise variance, a major input parameter of Kalman filtering, by analyzing past sensor data and how to use the estimated noise to improve the filtering accuracy. More specifically, to estimate the measurement noise variance, two analytical methods are proposed: one a transform-based method using a wavelet transform and the other a learning-based method using a denoising autoencoder. Experimental results show that the proposed methods estimated the measurement noise variance accurately and were superior to the experience-based method in the filtering accuracy.
