SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - In recent years, due to the unnecessary wastage of electrical energy in residential buildings, the requirement of energy optimization and user comfort has gained vital importance. In the literature, various techniques have been proposed addressing the energy optimization problem. The goal of each technique is to maintain a balance between user comfort and energy requirements, such that the user can achieve the desired comfort level with the minimum amount of energy consumption. Researchers have addressed the issue with the help of different optimization algorithms and variations in the parameters to reduce energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved yet due to its challenging nature. The gaps in the literature are due to advancements in technology, the drawbacks of optimization algorithms, and the introduction of new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly proposed optimization algorithms have produced better accuracy on the benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. Detailed discussion has been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort, visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge computing techniques used in smart homes.

TI  - Towards Semantic Sensor Data: An Ontology Approach
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In order to optimize intelligent applications driven by various sensors, it is vital to properly interpret and reuse sensor data from different domains. The construction of semantic maps which illustrate the relationship between heterogeneous domain ontologies plays an important role in knowledge reuse. However, most mapping methods in the literature use the literal meaning of each concept and instance in the ontology to obtain semantic similarity. This is especially the case for domain ontologies which are built for applications with sensor data. At the instance level, there is seldom work to utilize data of the sensor instances when constructing the ontologies&rsquo; mapping relationship. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to achieve the association between sensor data and domain ontology. In our approach, we first classify the sensor data by making them as SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) ontology instances, and map the corresponding instances to the concepts in the domain ontology. Secondly, a multi-strategy similarity calculation method is used to evaluate the similarity of the concept pairs between the domain ontologies at multiple levels. Finally, the set of concept pairs with a high similarity is selected by the analytic hierarchy process to construct the mapping relationship between the domain ontologies, and then the correlation between sensor data and domain ontologies are constructed. Using the method presented in this paper, we perform sensor data correlation experiments with a simulator for a real world scenario. By comparison to other methods, the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Reduction of Artefacts in JPEG-XR Compressed Images
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The JPEG-XR encoding process utilizes two types of transform operations: Photo Overlap Transform (POT) and Photo Core Transform (PCT). Using the Device Porting Kit (DPK) provided by Microsoft, we performed encoding and decoding processes on JPEG XR images. It was discovered that when the quantization parameter is &gt;1-lossy compression conditions, the resulting image displays chequerboard block artefacts, border artefacts and corner artefacts. These artefacts are due to the nonlinearity of transforms used by JPEG-XR. Typically, it is not so visible; however, it can cause problems while copying and scanning applications, as it shows nonlinear transforms when the source and the target of the image have different configurations. Hence, it is important for document image processing pipelines to take such artefacts into account. Additionally, these artefacts are most problematic for high-quality settings and appear more visible at high compression ratios. In this paper, we analyse the cause of the above artefacts. It was found that the main problem lies in the step of POT and quantization. To solve this problem, the use of a &ldquo;uniform matrix&rdquo; is proposed. After POT (encoding) and before inverse POT (decoding), an extra step is added to multiply this uniform matrix. Results suggest that it is an easy and effective way to decrease chequerboard, border and corner artefacts, thereby improving the image quality of lossy encoding JPEG XR than the original DPK program with no increased calculation complexity or file size.

VL  - 12

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The problem of power demand forecasting for the effective planning and operation of smart grid, renewable energy and electricity market bidding systems is an open challenge. Numerous research efforts have been proposed for improving prediction performance in practical environments through statistical and artificial neural network approaches. Despite these efforts, power demand forecasting problems remain to be a grand challenge since existing methods are not sufficiently practical to be widely deployed due to their limited accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid power demand forecasting model, called (c, l)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) + Convolution Neural Network (CNN). We consider the power demand as a key value, while we incorporate c different types of contextual information such as temperature, humidity and season as context values in order to preprocess datasets into bivariate sequences consisting of &lt;Key, Context[1, c]&gt; pairs. These c bivariate sequences are then input into c LSTM networks with l layers to extract feature sets. Using these feature sets, a CNN layer outputs a predicted profile of power demand. To assess the applicability of the proposed hybrid method, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world datasets. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed (c, l)-LSTM+CNN hybrid model performs with higher accuracy than previous approaches.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - We present a novel Deep Learning (DL) stack for detecting Advanced Persistent threat (APT) attacks. This model is based on a theoretical approach where an APT is observed as a multi-vector multi-stage attack with a continuous strategic campaign. To capture these attacks, the entire network flow and particularly raw data must be used as an input for the detection process. By combining different types of tailored DL-methods, it is possible to capture certain types of anomalies and behaviour. Our method essentially breaks down a bigger problem into smaller tasks, tries to solve these sequentially and finally returns a conclusive result. This concept paper outlines, for example, the problems and possible solutions for the tasks. Additionally, we describe how we will be developing, implementing and testing the method in the near future.

TI  - Large-Scale Station-Level Crowd Flow Forecast with ST-Unet
T2  - ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 3
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - High crowd mobility is a characteristic of transportation hubs such as metro/bus/bike stations in cities worldwide. Forecasting the crowd flow for such places, known as station-level crowd flow forecast (SLCFF) in this paper, would have many benefits, for example traffic management and public safety. Concretely, SLCFF predicts the number of people that will arrive at or depart from stations in a given period. However, one challenge is that the crowd flows across hundreds of stations irregularly scattered throughout a city are affected by complicated spatio-temporal events. Additionally, some external factors such as weather conditions or holidays may change the crowd flow tremendously. In this paper, a spatio-temporal U-shape network model (ST-Unet) for SLCFF is proposed. It is a neural network-based multi-output regression model, handling hundreds of target variables, i.e., all stations&rsquo; in and out flows. ST-Unet emphasizes stations&rsquo; spatial dependence by integrating the crowd flow information from neighboring stations and the cluster it belongs to after hierarchical clustering. It learns the temporal dependence by modeling the temporal closeness, period, and trend of crowd flows. With proper modifications on the network structure, ST-Unet is easily trained and has reliable convergency. Experiments on four real-world datasets were carried out to verify the proposed method&rsquo;s performance and the results show that ST-Unet outperforms seven baselines in terms of SLCFF.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 3
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Panoramic images have a wide range of applications in many fields with their ability to perceive all-round information. Object detection based on panoramic images has certain advantages in terms of environment perception due to the characteristics of panoramic images, e.g., lager perspective. In recent years, deep learning methods have achieved remarkable results in image classification and object detection. Their performance depends on the large amount of training data. Therefore, a good training dataset is a prerequisite for the methods to achieve better recognition results. Then, we construct a benchmark named Pano-RSOD for panoramic road scene object detection. Pano-RSOD contains vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs and guiding arrows. The objects of Pano-RSOD are labelled by bounding boxes in the images. Different from traditional object detection datasets, Pano-RSOD contains more objects in a panoramic image, and the high-resolution images have 360-degree environmental perception, more annotations, more small objects and diverse road scenes. The state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms are trained on Pano-RSOD for object detection, which demonstrates that Pano-RSOD is a useful benchmark, and it provides a better panoramic image training dataset for object detection tasks, especially for small and deformed objects.

AB  - In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and its subarea of deep learning have drawn the attention of many researchers. At the same time, advances in technologies enable the generation or collection of large amounts of valuable data (e.g., sensor data) from various sources in different applications, such as those for the Internet of Things (IoT), which in turn aims towards the development of smart cities. With the availability of sensor data from various sources, sensor information fusion is in demand for effective integration of big data. In this article, we present an AI-based sensor-information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of transportation data generated and collected from various types of sensors, including remote sensed imagery for the geographic information system (GIS), accelerometers, as well as sensors for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and global positioning system (GPS). The discovered knowledge and information returned from our system provides analysts with a clearer understanding of trajectories or mobility of citizens, which in turn helps to develop better transportation models to achieve the ultimate goal of smarter cities. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and practicality of our AI-based sensor information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of big transportation data.

TI  - An Effective Spectrum Handoff Based on Reinforcement Learning for Target Channel Selection in the Industrial Internet of Things
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 6
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The overcrowding of the wireless space has triggered a strict competition for scare network resources. Therefore, there is a need for a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technique that will ensure fair allocation of the available network resources for diverse network elements competing for the network resources. Spectrum handoff (SH) is a DSA technique through which cognitive radio (CR) promises to provide effective channel utilization, fair resource allocation, as well as reliable and uninterrupted real-time connection. However, SH may consume extra network resources, increase latency, and degrade network performance if the spectrum sensing technique used is ineffective and the channel selection strategy (CSS) is poorly implemented. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an SH policy that holistically considers the implementation of effective CSS, and spectrum sensing technique, as well as minimizes communication delays. In this work, two reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are integrated into the CSS to perform channel selection. The first algorithm is used to evaluate the channel future occupancy, whereas the second algorithm is used to determine the channel quality in order to sort and rank the channels in candidate channel list (CCL). A method of masking linearly dependent and useless state elements is implemented to improve the convergence of the learning. Our approach showed a significant reduction in terms of latency and a remarkable improvement in throughput performance in comparison to conventional approaches.

AB  - Recently, network attacks launched by malicious attackers have seriously affected modern life and enterprise production, and these network attack samples have the characteristic of type imbalance, which undoubtedly increases the difficulty of intrusion detection. In response to this problem, it would naturally be very meaningful to design an intrusion detection system (IDS) to effectively and quickly identify and detect malicious behaviors. In our work, we have proposed a method for an IDS-combined incremental extreme learning machine (I-ELM) with an adaptive principal component (A-PCA). In this method, the relevant features of network traffic are adaptively selected, where the best detection accuracy can then be obtained by I-ELM. We have used the NSL-KDD standard dataset and UNSW-NB15 standard dataset to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. Through analysis of the experimental results, we can see that our proposed method has better computation capacity, stronger generalization ability, and higher accuracy.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Through the Internet of things (IoT), as promoted by smart cities, there is an emergence of big data accentuating the use of artificial intelligence through various components of urban planning, management, and design. One such system is that of artificial neural networks (ANNs), a component of machine learning that boasts similitude with brain neurological networks and its functioning. However, the development of ANN was done in singular fashion, whereby processes are rendered in sequence in a unidimensional perspective, contrasting with the functions of the brain to which ANN boasts similitude, and in particular to the concept of neuroplasticity which encourages unique complex interactions in self-learning fashion, thereby encouraging more inclusive urban processes and render urban coherence. This paper takes inspiration from Christopher Alexander&rsquo;s Nature of Order and dwells in the concept of complexity theory; it also proposes a theoretical model of how ANN can be rendered with the same plastic properties as brain neurological networks with multidimensional interactivity in the context of smart cities through the use of big data and its emerging complex networks. By doing so, this model caters to the creation of stronger, richer, and more complex patterns that support Alexander&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; through the connection of overlapping networks. This paper is aimed toward engineers with interdisciplinary interest looking at creating more complex and intricate ANN models, and toward urban planners and urban theorists working on the emerging contemporary concept of smart cities.

AB  - Citizen safety in modern urban environments is an important aspect of life quality. Implementation of a smart city approach to video surveillance depends heavily on the capability of gathering and processing huge amounts of live urban data. Analyzing data from high bandwidth surveillance video streams provided by large size distributed sensor networks is particularly challenging. We propose here an efficient method for automatic violent behavior detection designed for video sensor networks. Known solutions to real-time violence detection are not suitable for implementation in a resource-constrained environment due to the high processing power requirements. Our algorithm achieves real-time processing on a Raspberry PI-embedded architecture. To ensure separation of temporal and spatial information processing we employ a computationally effective cascaded approach. It consists of a deep neural network followed by a time domain classifier. In contrast with current approaches, the deep neural network input is fed exclusively with motion vector features extracted directly from the MPEG encoded video stream. As proven by results, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, while running on a low computational resources embedded architecture.

AB  - With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), applications have become smarter and connected devices give rise to their exploitation in all aspects of a modern city. As the volume of the collected data increases, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are applied to further enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. The field of smart transportation has attracted many researchers and it has been approached with both ML and IoT techniques. In this review, smart transportation is considered to be an umbrella term that covers route optimization, parking, street lights, accident prevention/detection, road anomalies, and infrastructure applications. The purpose of this paper is to make a self-contained review of ML techniques and IoT applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and obtain a clear view of the trends in the aforementioned fields and spot possible coverage needs. From the reviewed articles it becomes profound that there is a possible lack of ML coverage for the Smart Lighting Systems and Smart Parking applications. Additionally, route optimization, parking, and accident/detection tend to be the most popular ITS applications among researchers.

AB  - Ambient Intelligence is currently a lively application domain of Artificial Intelligence and has become the central subject of multiple initiatives worldwide. Several approaches inside this domain make use of knowledge bases or knowledge graphs, both previously existing and ad hoc. This form of representation allows heterogeneous data gathered from diverse sources to be contextualized and combined to create relevant information for intelligent systems, usually following higher level constraints defined by an ontology. In this work, we conduct a systematic review of the existing usages of knowledge bases in intelligent environments, as well as an in-depth study of the predictive and decision-making models employed. Finally, we present a use case for smart homes and illustrate the use and advantages of Knowledge Graph Embeddings in this context.

Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research and deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the contributions made by different academicians and organizations. Selected references were clustered into three application domains corresponding to plant management, animal farming and food/agricultural product supply traceability. Furthermore, we discussed the challenges along with future research prospects, to help new researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.

AB  - In the era of big data, smart cities have become a promising prospect for governments, citizens, and industrials. Many ideas and their derived systems for smart cities depend on big data for achieving a goal of data intelligence. However, there is an urgent transformation trend from data intelligence to service intelligence in the vision of smart cities due to the living requirements of citizens. People-centric service intelligence in smart cities has to support the realization of people&rsquo;s needs within urban and social domains. This paper introduces a concept of people-centric service intelligence, defines the level of it and its challenges in the aspect of infrastructure, human dynamics, human understanding and prediction, and the human&ndash;machine interface. Then, this paper proposes the theoretical framework and technical frameworks of people-centric service intelligence, and the service intelligence schemas for future construction of smart cities. It will be helpful for governments and industries to design people-centric service intelligence for improving the quality of life, the capabilities of good sustainability, and better development.

AB  - To achieve the full analytical potential of the streaming data from the internet of things, the interconnection of various data sources is needed. By definition, those sources are heterogeneous and their integration is not a trivial task. A common approach to exploit streaming sensor data potential is to use machine learning techniques for predictive analytics in a way that is agnostic to the domain knowledge. Such an approach can be easily integrated in various use cases. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data fusion of a set of heterogeneous data streams. The proposed framework enriches streaming sensor data with the contextual and historical information relevant for describing the underlying processes. The final result of the framework is a feature vector, ready to be used in a machine learning algorithm. The framework has been applied to a cloud and to an edge device. In the latter case, incremental learning capabilities have been demonstrated. The reported results illustrate a significant improvement of data-driven models, applied to sensor streams. Beside higher accuracy of the models the platform offers easy setup and thus fast prototyping capabilities in real-world applications.

AB  - Cyber-attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) are growing at an alarming rate as devices, applications, and communication networks are becoming increasingly connected and integrated. When attacks on IoT networks go undetected for longer periods, it affects availability of critical systems for end users, increases the number of data breaches and identity theft, drives up the costs and impacts the revenue. It is imperative to detect attacks on IoT systems in near real time to provide effective security and defense. In this paper, we develop an intelligent intrusion-detection system tailored to the IoT environment. Specifically, we use a deep-learning algorithm to detect malicious traffic in IoT networks. The detection solution provides security as a service and facilitates interoperability between various network communication protocols used in IoT. We evaluate our proposed detection framework using both real-network traces for providing a proof of concept, and using simulation for providing evidence of its scalability. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed intrusion-detection system can detect real-world intrusions effectively.

AB  - As the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge computing have been major paradigms for distributed data collection, communication, and processing, smart city applications in the real world tend to adopt IoT and edge computing broadly. Today, more and more machine learning algorithms would be deployed into front-end sensors, devices, and edge data centres rather than centralised cloud data centres. However, front-end sensors and devices are usually not so capable as those computing units in huge data centres, and for this sake, in practice, engineers choose to compromise for limited capacity of embedded computing and limited memory, e.g., neural network models being pruned to fit embedded devices. Visual object tracking is one of many important elements of a smart city, and in the IoT and edge computing context, high requirements to computing power and memory space severely prevent massive and accurate tracking. In this paper, we report on our contribution to object tracking on lightweight computing including (1) using limited computing capacity and memory space to realise tracking; (2) proposing a new algorithm region proposal correlation filter fitting for most edge devices. Systematic evaluations show that (1) our techniques can fit most IoT devices; (2) our techniques can keep relatively high accuracy; and (3) the generated model size is much less than others.

AB  - Rapid classification of tumors that are detected in the medical images is of great importance in the early diagnosis of the disease. In this paper, a new liver and brain tumor classification method is proposed by using the power of convolutional neural network (CNN) in feature extraction, the power of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in signal processing, and the power of long short-term memory (LSTM) in signal classification. A CNN&ndash;DWT&ndash;LSTM method is proposed to classify the computed tomography (CT) images of livers with tumors and to classify the magnetic resonance (MR) images of brains with tumors. The proposed method classifies liver tumors images as benign or malignant and then classifies brain tumor images as meningioma, glioma, and pituitary. In the hybrid CNN&ndash;DWT&ndash;LSTM method, the feature vector of the images is obtained from pre-trained AlexNet CNN architecture. The feature vector is reduced but strengthened by applying the single-level one-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (1-D DWT), and it is classified by training with an LSTM network. Under the scope of the study, images of 56 benign and 56 malignant liver tumors that were obtained from Fırat University Research Hospital were used and a publicly available brain tumor dataset were used. The experimental results show that the proposed method had higher performance than classifiers, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). By using the CNN&ndash;DWT&ndash;LSTM hybrid method, an accuracy rate of 99.1% was achieved in the liver tumor classification and accuracy rate of 98.6% was achieved in the brain tumor classification. We used two different datasets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Performance measurements show that the proposed method has a satisfactory accuracy rate at the liver tumor and brain tumor classifying.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is the global network of interrelated physical devices such as sensors, actuators, smart applications, objects, computing devices, mechanical machines, and people that are becoming an essential part of the internet. In an industrial environment, these devices are the source of data which provide abundant information in manufacturing processes. Nevertheless, the massive, heterogeneous, and time-sensitive nature of the data brings substantial challenges to the real-time collection, processing, and decision making. Therefore, this paper presents a framework of an IoT-based Industrial Data Management System (IDMS) which can manage the huge industrial data, support online monitoring, and control smart manufacturing. The framework contains five basic layers such as physical, network, middleware, database, and application layers to provide a service-oriented architecture for the end users. Experimental results from a smart factory case study demonstrate that the framework can manage the regular data and urgent events generated from various factory devices in the distributed industrial environment through state-of-the-art communication protocols. The collected data is converted into useful information which improves productivity and the prognosis of production lines.

TI  - Dependable Fire Detection System with Multifunctional Artificial Intelligence Framework

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A fire detection system requires accurate and fast mechanisms to make the right decision in a fire situation. Since most commercial fire detection systems use a simple sensor, their fire recognition accuracy is deficient because of the limitations of the detection capability of the sensor. Existing proposals, which use rule-based algorithms or image-based machine learning can hardly adapt to the changes in the environment because of their static features. Since the legacy fire detection systems and network services do not guarantee data transfer latency, the required need for promptness is unmet. In this paper, we propose a new fire detection system with a multifunctional artificial intelligence framework and a data transfer delay minimization mechanism for the safety of smart cities. The framework includes a set of multiple machine learning algorithms and an adaptive fuzzy algorithm. In addition, Direct-MQTT based on SDN is introduced to solve the traffic concentration problems of the traditional MQTT. We verify the performance of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and delay time and found a fire detection accuracy of over 95%. The end-to-end delay, which comprises the transfer and decision delays, is reduced by an average of 72%.

TI  - Forecasting Heating Consumption in Buildings: A Scalable Full-Stack Distributed Engine
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Predicting power demand of building heating systems is a challenging task due to the high variability of their energy profiles. Power demand is characterized by different heating cycles including sequences of various transient and steady-state phases. To effectively perform the predictive task by exploiting the huge amount of fine-grained energy-related data collected through Internet of Things (IoT) devices, innovative and scalable solutions should be devised. This paper presents PHi-CiB, a scalable full-stack distributed engine, addressing all tasks from energy-related data collection, to their integration, storage, analysis, and modeling. Heterogeneous data measurements (e.g., power consumption in buildings, meteorological conditions) are collected through multiple hardware (e.g., IoT devices) and software (e.g., web services) entities. Such data are integrated and analyzed to predict the average power demand of each building for different time horizons. First, the transient and steady-state phases characterizing the heating cycle of each building are automatically identified; then the power-level forecasting is performed for each phase. To this aim, PHi-CiB relies on a pipeline of three algorithms: the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, and the Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent. PHi-CiB&rsquo;s current implementation exploits Apache Spark and MongoDB and supports parallel and scalable processing and analytical tasks. Experimental results, performed on energy-related data collected in a real-world system show the effectiveness of PHi-CiB in predicting heating power consumption of buildings with a limited prediction error and an optimal horizontal scalability.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The Smart campus is a concept of an education institute using technologies, such as information systems, internet of things (IoT), and context-aware computing, to support learning, teaching, and administrative activities. Classrooms are important building blocks of a school campus. Therefore, a feasible architecture for building and running smart classrooms is essential for a smart campus. However, most studies related to the smart classroom are focused on studying or addressing particular technical or educational issues, such as networking, AI applications, lecture quality, and user responses to technology. In this study, an architecture for building and running context-aware smart classrooms is proposed. The proposed architecture consists of three parts including a prototype of a context-aware smart classroom, a model for technology integration, and supporting measures for the operation of smart classrooms in this architecture. The classroom prototype was designed based on our study results and a smart classroom project in Ming Chuan University (MCU). The integration model was a layered model uses Raspberry Pi in the bottom layer of the model to integrate underlying technologies and provide application interfaces to the higher layer applications for the ease of building context-aware smart classroom applications. As a result, application interfaces were implemented using Raspberry Pi based on the proposed technology integration model, and a context-aware energy-saving smart classroom application was implemented based on the proposed classroom prototype and the implemented web application interface. The result shows that, in terms of technology, the proposed architecture is feasible for building context-aware smart classrooms in smart campuses.

AB  - Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been designed, implemented, and validated to help clinicians and practitioners for decision-making about diagnosing some diseases. Within the CDSSs, we can find Fuzzy inference systems. For the reasons above, the objective of this study was to design, to implement, and to validate a methodology for developing data-driven Mamdani-type fuzzy clinical decision support systems using clusters and pivot tables. For validating the proposed methodology, we applied our algorithms on five public datasets including Wisconsin, Coimbra breast cancer, wart treatment (Immunotherapy and cryotherapy), and caesarian section, and compared them with other related works (Literature). The results show that the Kappa Statistics and accuracies were close to 1.0% and 100%, respectively for each output variable, which shows better accuracy than some literature results. The proposed framework could be considered as a deep learning technique because it is composed of various processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction.

TI  - Deep Autoencoder Neural Networks for Short-Term Traffic Congestion Prediction of Transportation Networks

PY  - 2019

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Traffic congestion prediction is critical for implementing intelligent transportation systems for improving the efficiency and capacity of transportation networks. However, despite its importance, traffic congestion prediction is severely less investigated compared to traffic flow prediction, which is partially due to the severe lack of large-scale high-quality traffic congestion data and advanced algorithms. This paper proposes an accessible and general workflow to acquire large-scale traffic congestion data and to create traffic congestion datasets based on image analysis. With this workflow we create a dataset named Seattle Area Traffic Congestion Status (SATCS) based on traffic congestion map snapshots from a publicly available online traffic service provider Washington State Department of Transportation. We then propose a deep autoencoder-based neural network model with symmetrical layers for the encoder and the decoder to learn temporal correlations of a transportation network and predicting traffic congestion. Our experimental results on the SATCS dataset show that the proposed DCPN model can efficiently and effectively learn temporal relationships of congestion levels of the transportation network for traffic congestion forecasting. Our method outperforms two other state-of-the-art neural network models in prediction performance, generalization capability, and computation efficiency.

AB  - Understanding hydrological processes in large, open areas, such as catchments, and further modelling these processes are still open research questions. The system proposed in this work provides an automatic end-to-end pipeline from data collection to information extraction that can potentially assist hydrologists to better understand the hydrological processes using a data-driven approach. In this work, the performance of a low-cost off-the-shelf self contained sensor unit, which was originally designed and used to monitor liquid levels, such as AdBlue, fuel, lubricants etc., in a sealed tank environment, is first examined. This process validates that the sensor does provide accurate water level information for open water level monitoring tasks. Utilising the dataset collected from eight sensor units, an end-to-end pipeline of automating the data collection, data processing and information extraction processes is proposed. Within the pipeline, a data-driven anomaly detection method that automatically extracts rapid changes in measurement trends at a catchment scale. The lag-time of the test site (Dodder catchment Dublin, Ireland) is also analyzed. Subsequently, the water level response in the catchment due to storm events during the 27 month deployment period is illustrated. To support reproducible and collaborative research, the collected dataset and the source code of this work will be publicly available for research purposes.

TI  - An Improved Ball Pivot Algorithm-Based Ground Filtering Mechanism for LiDAR Data
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Automatic ground filtering is an essential step for Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generation, which has significant application value. However, extraction and classification of ground points from the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, especially in multitudinous terrain situations, is a challenging task because it is difficult to determine the set of optimal parameters for removing various non-ground features. In this paper, a new ground filtering technique based on an improved Ball Pivot Algorithm (BPA) is proposed. At the beginning, the LiDAR point cloud dataset was divided into different subsets based on the 2D regular grid. The lowest point in each grid was selected as the seed point to build a single-layer surface. After that, the improved BPA was executed to remove points on the higher location. Then, the rest of the points were calculated and selected as a new seed point according to the spatial relationship with the initial surface. Finally, non-ground points were filtered by means of improved BPA traversing all the grids. Our experimental results on the Benchmark dataset provided by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Working Group III/3 showed high accuracy (with a mean kappa coefficient over 80%) in terms of completeness, correctness, and quality for DEM generation. The experimental results demonstrated the proposed method is robust to various terrain situations, as it is more effective and feasible for ground filtering.

AB  - The long continuity of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide high space and resolution data for ground deformation investigations. The ground deformation in this paper appeared in the city&rsquo;s development, although it is close to the Erhai region, which is different from a water-deficient city. Therefore, the analysis and prediction of ground deformation using a new method is required. In this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from 2015 to 2018 were used to study the characteristics of ground deformation in the Erhai region using the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique. The results were cross-validated using ascending and descending direction images to ensure the accuracy. In addition, the results showed that there was little ground deformation in the northern part of the Erhai region, while there was obvious ground deformation in the southern part. Four influencing factors&mdash;including the building area, water level, cumulative precipitation, and cumulative temperature of the southern Erhai region&mdash;were used together to predict the cumulative ground deformation using back-propagation (BP). The R of all the involved data was 0.966, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the simulated values using BP and the true measured values were 3.063, 1.003, and 1.119, respectively. The results showed that BP has great potential in predicting the change tendency of ground deformation with high precision. The main reason for ground deformation is the continuous increase of building area; the water level followed. The cumulative precipitation and cumulative temperature are the reasons for the seasonal ground deformation. Some countermeasures and suggestions are given to face the challenge of serious ground deformation.

AB  - With the development of wireless technology, indoor localization has gained wide attention. The fingerprint localization method is proposed in this paper, which is divided into two phases: offline training and online positioning. In offline training phase, the Improved Fuzzy C-means (IFCM) algorithm is proposed for regional division. The Between-Within Proportion (BWP) index is selected to divide fingerprint database, which can ensure the result of regional division consistent with the building plane structure. Moreover, the Agglomerative Nesting (AGNES) algorithm is applied to accomplish Access Point (AP) optimization. In the online positioning phase, sub-region selection is performed by nearest neighbor algorithm, then the Weighted K-nearest Neighbor (WKNN) algorithm based on Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is utilized to locate the target point. After the evaluation on the effect of regional division and AP optimization of location precision and time, the experiments show that the average positioning error is 2.53 m and the average computation time of the localization algorithm based on PCC reduced by 94.13%.

TI  - An Adaptive Framework for Multi-Vehicle Ground Speed Estimation in Airborne Videos
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAV-based intelligent airborne surveillance systems represented by real-time ground vehicle speed estimation have attracted wide attention from researchers. However, there are still many challenges in extracting speed information from UAV videos, including the dynamic moving background, small target size, complicated environment, and diverse scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive framework for multi-vehicle ground speed estimation in airborne videos. Firstly, we build a traffic dataset based on UAV. Then, we use the deep learning detection algorithm to detect the vehicle in the UAV field of view and obtain the trajectory in the image through the tracking-by-detection algorithm. Thereafter, we present a motion compensation method based on homography. This method obtains matching feature points by an optical flow method and eliminates the influence of the detected target to accurately calculate the homography matrix to determine the real motion trajectory in the current frame. Finally, vehicle speed is estimated based on the mapping relationship between the pixel distance and the actual distance. The method regards the actual size of the car as prior information and adaptively recovers the pixel scale by estimating the vehicle size in the image; it then calculates the vehicle speed. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we carry out a large number of experiments on the AirSim Simulation platform as well as real UAV aerial surveillance experiments. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis of the simulation results and real experiments, we verify that the proposed system has a unique ability to detect, track, and estimate the speed of ground vehicles simultaneously even with a single downward-looking camera. Additionally, the system can obtain effective and accurate speed estimation results, even in various complex scenes.

TI  - Higher-Order Conditional Random Fields-Based 3D Semantic Labeling of Airborne Laser-Scanning Point Clouds
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - This paper presents a novel framework to achieve 3D semantic labeling of objects (e.g., trees, buildings, and vehicles) from airborne laser-scanning point clouds. To this end, we propose a framework which consists of hierarchical clustering and higher-order conditional random fields (CRF) labeling. In the hierarchical clustering, the raw point clouds are over-segmented into a set of fine-grained clusters by integrating the point density clustering and the classic K-means clustering algorithm, followed by the proposed probability density clustering algorithm. Through this process, we not only obtain a more uniform size and more homogeneous clusters with semantic consistency, but the topological relationships of the cluster&rsquo;s neighborhood are implicitly maintained by turning the problem of topology maintenance into a clustering problem based on the proposed probability density clustering algorithm. Subsequently, the fine-grained clusters and their topological context are fed into the CRF labeling step, from which the fine-grained cluster&rsquo;s semantic labels are learned and determined by solving a multi-label energy minimization formulation, which simultaneously considers the unary, pairwise, and higher-order potentials. Our experiments of classifying urban and residential scenes demonstrate that the proposed approach reaches 88.5% and 86.1% of &ldquo;m    F 1    &rdquo; estimated by averaging all classes of the     F 1    -scores. We prove that the proposed method outperforms five other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed energy terms by using an &ldquo;ablation study&rdquo; strategy.

TI  - HealthyBroker: A Trustworthy Blockchain-Based Multi-Cloud Broker for Patient-Centered eHealth Services
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 6
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Delivering electronic health care (eHealth) services across multi-cloud providers to implement patient-centric care demands a trustworthy brokering architecture. Specifically, such an architecture should aggregate relevant medical information to allow informed decision-making. It should also ensure that this information is complete and authentic and that no one has tampered with it. Brokers deployed in eHealth services may fall short of meeting such criteria due to two key behaviors. The first involves violating international health-data protection laws by allowing user anonymity and limiting user access rights. Second, brokers claiming to provide trustworthy transactions between interested parties usually rely on user feedback, an approach vulnerable to manipulation by malicious users. This paper addresses these data security and trust challenges by proposing HealthyBroker, a novel, trust-building brokering architecture for multiple cloud environments. This architecture is designed specifically for patient-centric cloud eHealth services. It enables care-team members to complete eHealth transactions securely and access relevant patient data on a &ldquo;need-to-know&rdquo; basis in compliance with data-protection laws. HealthyBroker also protects against potential malicious behavior by assessing the trust relationship and tracking it using a neutral, tamper-proof, distributed blockchain ledger. Trust is assessed based on two strategies. First, all transactions and user feedback are tracked and audited in a distributed ledger for transparency. Second, only feedback coming from trustworthy parties is taken into consideration. HealthyBroker was tested in a simulated eHealth multi-cloud environment. The test produced better results than a benchmark algorithm in terms of data accuracy, service time, and the reliability of feedback received as measured by three malicious behavior models (na&iuml;ve, feedback isolated, and feedback collective). These results demonstrate that HealthyBroker can provide care teams with a trustworthy, transparent ecosystem that can facilitate information sharing and well-informed decisions for patient-centric care.

AB  - With the development of online cars, the demand for travel prediction is increasing in order to reduce the information asymmetry between passengers and drivers of online car-hailing. This paper proposes a travel demand forecasting model named OC-CNN based on the convolutional neural network to forecast the travel demand. In order to make full use of the spatial characteristics of the travel demand distribution, this paper meshes the prediction area and creates a travel demand data set of the graphical structure to preserve its spatial properties. Taking advantage of the convolutional neural network in image feature extraction, the historical demand data of the first twenty-five minutes of the entire region are used as a model input to predict the travel demand for the next five minutes. In order to verify the performance of the proposed method, one-month data from online car-hailing of the Chengdu Fourth Ring Road are used. The results show that the model successfully extracts the spatiotemporal features of the data, and the prediction accuracies of the proposed method are superior to those of the representative methods, including the Bayesian Ridge Model, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory networks.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the keywords related to smart city concepts, and to understand their flow. This research used a keyword network analysis by collecting keywords from papers published on the web from Scopus, which is an international scholarly papers engine. The data were collected from before and after 2016, and since the amount of data has been growing rapidly after global agreements such as the United Nations&rsquo; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, we attempted to focus on adjacent years of publication. In order to understand the flow of research, we conducted a central analysis, which is widely used in quantitative research relating to social network analysis, and performed cluster analysis to identify relationships with related research. The results of the analysis are represented in the form of network maps, and the role of each keyword was clarified based on these network maps. In addition, the overall flow explained the change of flow through discarded and emerging keywords, and the relationships with related fields were explained through cluster analysis. The findings could serve as a basis for policymakers, urban managers, and researchers seeking a comprehensive understanding of the smart city concept in urban planning areas.

AB  - With the popularity of small-screen smart mobile devices, gestures as a new type of human–computer interaction are highly demanded. Furthermore, finger gestures are more familiar to people in controlling devices. In this paper, a new method for recognizing finger gestures is proposed. Ultrasound was actively emitted to measure the micro-Doppler effect caused by finger motions and was obtained at high resolution. By micro-Doppler processing, micro-Doppler feature maps of finger gestures were generated. Since the feature map has a similar structure to the single channel color image, a recognition model based on a convolutional neural network was constructed for classification. The optimized recognition model achieved an average accuracy of 96.51% in the experiment.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Limited by the noise, missing data and varying sampling density of the point clouds, planar primitives are prone to be lost during plane segmentation, leading to topology errors when reconstructing complex building models. In this paper, a pipeline to recover the broken topology of planar primitives (TopoLAP) is proposed to reconstruct level of details 3 (LoD3) models. Firstly, planar primitives are segmented from the incomplete point clouds and feature lines are detected both from point clouds and images. Secondly, the structural contours of each plane segment are reconstructed by subset selection from intersections of these feature lines. Subsequently, missing planes are recovered by plane deduction according to the relationships between linear and planar primitives. Finally, the manifold and watertight polyhedral building models are reconstructed based on the optimized PolyFit framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can handle partial incomplete point clouds and reconstruct the LoD3 models of complex buildings automatically. A comparative analysis indicates that the proposed method performs better to preserve sharp edges and achieves a higher fitness and correction rate than rooftop-based modeling and the original PolyFit algorithm.

AB  - With the development of the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT), soldiers have become key nodes of information collection and resource control on the battlefield. It has become a trend to develop wearable devices with diverse functions for the military. However, although densely deployed wearable sensors provide a platform for comprehensively monitoring the status of soldiers, wearable technology based on multi-source fusion lacks a generalized research system to highlight the advantages of heterogeneous sensor networks and information fusion. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-level fusion framework (MLFF) based on Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) of soldiers, and describes a model of the deployment of heterogeneous sensor networks. The proposed framework covers multiple types of information at a single node, including behaviors, physiology, emotions, fatigue, environments, and locations, so as to enable Soldier-BSNs to obtain sufficient evidence, decision-making ability, and information resilience under resource constraints. In addition, we systematically discuss the problems and solutions of each unit according to the frame structure to identify research directions for the development of wearable devices for the military.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Cooperative communication is an effective method of improving the transmission performance for vehicular ad hoc networks. However, the rapid movement of vehicles leads to frequent changes in network topology and reduces the probability of successful data transmission on the medium access control (MAC) layer. In this paper, we propose an Optimal Cooperative Ad hoc MAC protocol (OCA-MAC) based on time division multiple access (TDMA). OCA-MAC utilizes multiple cooperative nodes to forward data, so as to improve the probability of successful data transmission. It chooses cooperative nodes according to direct successful transmission probability, communication range between potential helper node and destination node, and available time slot. Meanwhile, in order to avoid excessive transmission redundancy caused by multiple cooperative forwarding, the optimal number of cooperative forwarding nodes is obtained through analysis of a probabilistic model. Simulation results show that OCA-MAC improves the successful data transmission rate and reduces the number of transmission times and transmission delay compared to the multichannel TDMA MAC protocol (VeMAC) and the cooperative ad hoc MAC protocol (CAH-MAC).

AB  - This article reports on a study to investigate how the driving behaviour of autonomous vehicles influences trust and acceptance. Two different designs were presented to two groups of participants (n = 22/21), using actual autonomously driving vehicles. The first was a vehicle programmed to drive similarly to a human, &ldquo;peeking&rdquo; when approaching road junctions as if it was looking before proceeding. The second design had a vehicle programmed to convey the impression that it was communicating with other vehicles and infrastructure and &ldquo;knew&rdquo; if the junction was clear so could proceed without ever stopping or slowing down. Results showed non-significant differences in trust between the two vehicle behaviours. However, there were significant increases in trust scores overall for both designs as the trials progressed. Post-interaction interviews indicated that there were pros and cons for both driving styles, and participants suggested which aspects of the driving styles could be improved. This paper presents user information recommendations for the design and programming of driving systems for autonomous vehicles, with the aim of improving their users&rsquo; trust and acceptance.

AB  - This study sought to propose a big data analysis and prediction model for transmission line tower outliers to assess when something is wrong with transmission line tower big data based on deep reinforcement learning. The model enables choosing automatic cluster K values based on non-labeled sensor big data. It also allows measuring the distance of action between data inside a cluster with the Q-value representing network output in the altered transmission line tower big data clustering algorithm containing transmission line tower outliers and old Deep Q Network. Specifically, this study performed principal component analysis to categorize transmission line tower data and proposed an automatic initial central point approach through standard normal distribution. It also proposed the A-Deep Q-Learning algorithm altered from the deep Q-Learning algorithm to explore policies based on the experiences of clustered data learning. It can be used to perform transmission line tower outlier data learning based on the distance of data within a cluster. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed model recorded an approximately 2.29%~4.19% higher prediction rate and around 0.8% ~ 4.3% higher accuracy rate compared to the old transmission line tower big data analysis model.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Currently, one of the main challenges that large metropolitan areas must face is traffic congestion. To address this problem, it becomes necessary to implement an efficient solution to control traffic that generates benefits for citizens, such as reducing vehicle journey times and, consequently, environmental pollution. By properly analyzing traffic demand, it is possible to predict future traffic conditions, using this information for the optimization of the routes taken by vehicles. Such an approach becomes especially effective if applied in the context of autonomous vehicles, which have a more predictable behavior, thus enabling city management entities to mitigate the effects of traffic congestion and pollution, thereby improving the traffic flow in a city in a fully centralized manner. This paper represents a step forward towards this novel traffic management paradigm by proposing a route server capable of handling all the traffic in a city, and balancing traffic flows by accounting for present and future traffic congestion conditions. We perform a simulation study using real data of traffic congestion in the city of Valencia, Spain, to demonstrate how the traffic flow in a typical day can be improved using our proposed solution. Experimental results show that our proposed traffic prediction equation, combined with frequent updating of traffic conditions on the route server, can achieve substantial improvements in terms of average travel speeds and travel times, both indicators of lower degrees of congestion and improved traffic fluidity.

AB  - Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the key factors that enables, drives and accelerates the digital transformation all over the world. The vision of the IoT is not only the immediate access to the data but also the ability to turning data into intelligence. As such, there is a growing number of public cloud computing providers offering IoT related services, including data processing, data analyzing and data visualization. However, with tens of billions of microcontroller-powered devices getting involved in the era of IoT, the concerns for overall security, privacy and cost are rising constantly and exponentially. Furthermore, these issues cannot be solved by public cloud computing providers since they mainly focus on the software and services rather than on the end devices. In this article, an integrated solution including Azure Sphere devices and Azure cloud services is proposed to provide a comprehensive and efficient way to ensure security that starts in the device and extends to the cloud with limited budgets. Moreover, the implementation details including hardware components, software design and Azure cloud integration are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 13
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - There is strong demand for real-time suspicious tracking across multiple cameras in intelligent video surveillance for public areas, such as universities, airports and factories. Most criminal events show that the nature of suspicious behavior are carried out by un-known people who try to hide themselves as much as possible. Previous learning-based studies collected a large volume data set to train a learning model to detect humans across multiple cameras but failed to recognize newcomers. There are also several feature-based studies aimed to identify humans within-camera tracking. It would be very difficult for those methods to get necessary feature information in multi-camera scenarios and scenes. It is the purpose of this study to design and implement a suspicious tracking mechanism across multiple cameras based on correlation filters, called suspicious tracking across multiple cameras based on correlation filters (STAM-CCF). By leveraging the geographical information of cameras and YOLO object detection framework, STAM-CCF adjusts human identification and prevents errors caused by information loss in case of object occlusion and overlapping for within-camera tracking cases. STAM-CCF also introduces a camera correlation model and a two-stage gait recognition strategy to deal with problems of re-identification across multiple cameras. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well with highly acceptable accuracy. The evidences also show that the proposed STAM-CCF method can continuously recognize suspicious behavior within-camera tracking and re-identify it successfully across multiple cameras.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Dust is one of the components causing heavy environmental pollution in open-pit mines, especially PM10. Some pathologies related to the lung, respiratory system, and occupational diseases have been identified due to the effects of PM10 in open-pit mines. Therefore, the prediction and control of PM10 concentration in the production process are necessary for environmental and health protection. In this study, PM10 concentration from drilling operations in the Coc Sau open-pit coal mine (Vietnam) was investigated and considered through a database including 245 datasets collected. A novel hybrid artificial intelligence model was developed based on support vector regression (SVR) and a swarm optimization algorithm (i.e., particle swarm optimization (PSO)), namely PSO-SVR, for estimating PM10 concentration from drilling operations at the mine. Polynomial (P), radial basis function (RBF), and linear (L) kernel functions were considered and applied to the development of the PSO-SVR models in the present study, abbreviated as PSO-SVR-P, PSO-SVR-RBF, and PSO-SVR-L. Also, three benchmark artificial intelligence techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and classification and regression trees (CART), were applied and developed for estimating PM10 concentration and then compared with the PSO-SVR models. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R2) were used as the statistical criteria for evaluating the performance of the developed models. The results exhibited that the PSO algorithm had an essential role in the optimization of the hyper-parameters of the SVR models. The PSO-SVR models (i.e., PSO-SVR-L, PSO-SVR-P, and PSO-SVR-RBF) had higher performance levels than the other models (i.e., RF, CART, and KNN) with an RMSE of 0.040, 0.042, and 0.043; and R2 of 0.954, 0.948, and 0.946; for the PSO-SVR-L, PSO-SVR-P, and PSO-SVR-RBF models, respectively. Of these PSO-SVR models, the PSO-SVR-L model was the most dominant model with an RMSE of 0.040 and R2 of 0.954. The remaining three benchmark models (i.e., RF, CART, and KNN) yielded a more unsatisfactory performance with an RMSE of 0.060, 0.052, and 0.067; and R2 of 0.894, 0.924, and 0.867, for the RF, CART, and KNN models, respectively. Furthermore, the findings of this study demonstrated that the density of rock mass, moisture content, and the penetration rate of the drill were essential parameters on the PM10 concentration caused by drilling operations in open-pit mines.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Improperly grown trees may cause huge hazards to the environment and to humans, through e.g., climate change, soil erosion, etc. A proximity environmental feature-based tree health assessment (PTA) scheme is proposed to prevent these hazards by providing guidance for early warning methods of potential poor tree health. In PTA development, tree health is defined and evaluated based on proximity environmental features (PEFs). The PEF takes into consideration the seven surrounding ambient features that strongly impact tree health. The PEFs were measured by the deployed smart sensors surrounding trees. A database composed of tree health and relative PEFs was established for further analysis. An adaptive data identifying (ADI) algorithm is applied to exclude the influence of interference factors in the database. Finally, the radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN), a machine leaning algorithm, has been identified as the appropriate tool with which to correlate tree health and PEFs to establish the PTA algorithm. One of the salient features of PTA is that the algorithm can evaluate, and thus monitor, tree health remotely and automatically from smart sensor data by taking advantage of the well-established internet of things (IoT) network and machine learning algorithm.

AB  - The recent development in IoT and 5G translates into a significant growth of Big data in 5G&mdash;envisioned industrial automation. To support big data analysis, Deep Learning (DL) has been considered the most promising approach in recent years. Note, however, that designing an effective DL paradigm for IoT has certain challenges such as single point of failure, privacy leak of IoT devices, lack of valuable data for DL, and data poisoning attacks. To this end, we present BlockDeepNet, a Blockchain-based secure DL that combines DL and blockchain to support secure collaborative DL in IoT. In BlockDeepNet, collaborative DL is performed at the device level to overcome privacy leak and obtain enough data for DL, whereas blockchain is employed to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of collaborative DL in IoT. The experimental evaluation shows that BlockDeepNet can achieve higher accuracy for DL with acceptable latency and computational overhead of blockchain operation.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) is emerging as a promising communication technology offering a reliable wireless connection to a large number of devices employed in pervasive monitoring scenarios, such as Smart City, Precision Agriculture, and Industry 4.0. Since most of the NB-IoT transmissions occur in the uplink, the random access channel (that is the primary interface between devices and the base station) may usually become the main bottleneck of the entire system. For this reason, analytical models and simulation tools able to investigate its behavior in different scenarios are of the utmost importance for driving current and future research activities. Unfortunately, scientific literature partially addresses the current open issues by means of simplified and, in many cases, not standard-compliant approaches. To provide a significant step forward in this direction, the contribution of this paper is three-folded. First, it presents a flexible, open-source, and 3GPP-compliant implementation of the NB-IoT random access procedure. Second, it formulates an analytical model capturing both collision and success probabilities associated with the aforementioned procedure. Third, it presents the cross-validation of both the analytical model and the simulation tool, by taking into account reference applications scenarios of sensor networks enabling periodic reporting in monitoring infrastructures. Obtained results prove the remarkable accuracy, demonstrating a well-calibrated instrument, which will be also useful for future research activities.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Major metropolitan cities worldwide have extensively invested to secure utilities and build state-of-the-art infrastructure related to underground fluid transportation. Sewer and water pipelines make our lives extremely convenient when they function appropriately. However, leakages in underground pipe mains causes sinkholes and drinking-water scarcity. Sinkholes are the complex problems stemming from the interaction of leaked water and ground. The aim of this work is to review the existing methods for monitoring leakage in underground pipelines, the sinkholes caused by these leakages, and the viability of wireless sensor networking (WSN) for monitoring leakages and sinkholes. Herein, the authors have discussed the methods based on different objectives and their applicability via various approaches&mdash;(1) patent analysis; (2) web-of-science analysis; (3) WSN-based pipeline leakage and sinkhole monitoring. The study shows that the research on sinkholes due to leakages in sewer and water pipelines by using WSN is still in a premature stage and needs extensive investigation and research contributions. Additionally, the authors have suggested prospects for future research by comparing, analyzing, and classifying the reviewed methods. This study advocates collocating WSN, Internet of things, and artificial intelligence with pipeline monitoring methods to resolve the issues of the sinkhole occurrence.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus must monitor their blood glucose levels in order to control the glycaemia. Consequently, they must perform a capillary test at least three times per day and, besides that, a laboratory test once or twice per month. These standard methods pose difficulty for patients since they need to prick their finger in order to determine the glucose concentration, yielding discomfort and distress. In this paper, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based framework for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring is described. The system is based on Raspberry Pi Zero (RPi) energised with a power bank, using a visible laser beam and a Raspberry Pi Camera, all implemented in a glove. Data for the non-invasive monitoring is acquired by the RPi Zero taking a set of pictures of the user fingertip and computing their histograms. Generated data is processed by an artificial neural network (ANN) implemented on a Flask microservice using the Tensorflow libraries. In this paper, all measurements were performed in vivo and the obtained data was validated against laboratory blood tests by means of the mean absolute error (10.37%) and Clarke grid error (90.32% in zone A). Estimated glucose values can be harvested by an end device such as a smartphone for monitoring purposes.

AB  - Human motion detection and activity recognition are becoming vital for the applications in smart homes. Traditional Human Activity Recognition (HAR) mechanisms use special devices to track human motions, such as cameras (vision-based) and various types of sensors (sensor-based). These mechanisms are applied in different applications, such as home security, Human&ndash;Computer Interaction (HCI), gaming, and healthcare. However, traditional HAR methods require heavy installation, and can only work under strict conditions. Recently, wireless signals have been utilized to track human motion and HAR in indoor environments. The motion of an object in the test environment causes fluctuations and changes in the Wi-Fi signal reflections at the receiver, which result in variations in received signals. These fluctuations can be used to track object (i.e., a human) motion in indoor environments. This phenomenon can be improved and leveraged in the future to improve the internet of things (IoT) and smart home devices. The main Wi-Fi sensing methods can be broadly categorized as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Wi-Fi radar (by using Software Defined Radio (SDR)) and Channel State Information (CSI). CSI and RSSI can be considered as device-free mechanisms because they do not require cumbersome installation, whereas the Wi-Fi radar mechanism requires special devices (i.e., Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)). Recent studies demonstrate that CSI outperforms RSSI in sensing accuracy due to its stability and rich information. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in the CSI-based sensing mechanism and illustrates the drawbacks, discusses challenges, and presents some suggestions for the future of device-free sensing technology.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The pervasive and increasing deployment of smart meters allows collecting a huge amount of fine-grained energy data in different urban scenarios. The analysis of such data is challenging and opening up a variety of interesting and new research issues across energy and computer science research areas. The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches. This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption. SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets. As a case study, SPEC has been tested on real data of an heating distribution network and power consumption data collected in a major Italian city. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SPEC to forecast both fine-grained values and coarse levels of power consumption of buildings.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Psycho-acoustic parameters have been extensively used to evaluate the discomfort or pleasure produced by the sounds in our environment. In this context, wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) can be an interesting solution for monitoring subjective annoyance in certain soundscapes, since they can be used to register the evolution of such parameters in time and space. Unfortunately, the calculation of the psycho-acoustic parameters involved in common annoyance models implies a significant computational cost, and makes difficult the acquisition and transmission of these parameters at the nodes. As a result, monitoring psycho-acoustic annoyance becomes an expensive and inefficient task. This paper proposes the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large urban sound dataset capable of efficiently predicting psycho-acoustic annoyance from raw audio signals continuously. We evaluate the proposed regression model and compare the resulting computation times with the ones obtained by the conventional direct calculation approach. The results confirm that the proposed model based on CNN achieves high precision in predicting psycho-acoustic annoyance, predicting annoyance values with an average quadratic error of around 3%. It also achieves a very significant reduction in processing time, which is up to 300 times faster than direct calculation, making CNN designed a clear exponent to work in IoT devices.

AB  - An exemplary paradigm of how an AI can be a disruptive technological paragon via the utilization of blockchain comes straight from the world of deep learning. Data scientists have long struggled to maintain the quality of a dataset for machine learning by an AI entity. Datasets can be very expensive to purchase, as, depending on both the proper selection of the elements and the homogeneity of the data contained within, constructing and maintaining the integrity of a dataset is difficult. Blockchain as a highly secure storage medium presents a technological quantum leap in maintaining data integrity. Furthermore, blockchain&rsquo;s immutability constructs a fruitful environment for creating high quality, permanent and growing datasets for deep learning. The combination of AI and blockchain could impact fields like Internet of things (IoT), identity, financial markets, civil governance, smart cities, small communities, supply chains, personalized medicine and other fields, and thereby deliver benefits to many people.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) and Blockchain-based delivery framework, called DeliveryCoin, for drone-delivered services. The DeliveryCoin framework consists of four phases, including system initialization phase, creating the block, updating the blockchain, and intrusion detection phase. To achieve privacy-preservation, the DeliveryCoin framework employs hash functions and short signatures without random oracles and the Strong Diffie&ndash;Hellman (SDH) assumption in bilinear groups. To achieve consensus inside the blockchain-based delivery platform, we introduce a UAV-aided forwarding mechanism, named pBFTF. We also propose an IDS system in each macro eNB (5G) for detecting self-driving network attacks as well as false transactions between self-driving nodes. Furthermore, extensive simulations are conducted, and results confirm the efficiency of our proposed DeliveryCoin framework in terms of latency of blockchain consensus and accuracy.

AB  - Mobile health research field aims to provide access to healthcare anytime and anywhere through mobile computing technologies while using a cost-effective approach. Mobile health is closely related to ambient assisted living as both research fields address independence in elderly adults. Aging has become a relevant challenge, as it is anticipated that 20% of world population will be aged 60 years and older in 2050. Most people spend more than 90% of their time indoors, therefore the indoor environmental quality has a relevant impact on occupant&rsquo;s health and well-being. We intended to provide real-time indoor quality monitoring for enhanced living environments and occupational health. This paper presents the AirPlus real-time indoor environmental quality monitoring system, which incorporates several advantages when compared to other systems, such as scalability, flexibility, modularity, easy installation, and configuration, as well as mobile computing software for data consulting and notifications. The results that were obtained are promising and present a significant contribution to the monitoring solutions available in the literature. AirPlus provides a rich dataset to plan interventions for enhanced indoor quality, but also to support clinical diagnostics and correlate occupant&rsquo;s health problems with their living environment conditions.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - One of the unavoidable bottlenecks in the public application of passive signal (e.g., received signal strength, magnetic) fingerprinting-based indoor localization technologies is the extensive human effort that is required to construct and update database for indoor positioning. In this paper, we propose an accurate visual-inertial integrated geo-tagging method that can be used to collect fingerprints and construct the radio map by exploiting the crowdsourced trajectory of smartphone users. By integrating multisource information from the smartphone sensors (e.g., camera, accelerometer, and gyroscope), this system can accurately reconstruct the geometry of trajectories. An algorithm is proposed to estimate the spatial location of trajectories in the reference coordinate system and construct the radio map and geo-tagged image database for indoor positioning. With the help of several initial reference points, this algorithm can be implemented in an unknown indoor environment without any prior knowledge of the floorplan or the initial location of crowdsourced trajectories. The experimental results show that the average calibration error of the fingerprints is 0.67 m. A weighted k-nearest neighbor method (without any optimization) and the image matching method are used to evaluate the performance of constructed multisource database. The average localization error of received signal strength (RSS) based indoor positioning and image based positioning are 3.2 m and 1.2 m, respectively, showing that the quality of the constructed indoor radio map is at the same level as those that were constructed by site surveying. Compared with the traditional site survey based positioning cost, this system can greatly reduce the human labor cost, with the least external information.

AB  - To build sustainable smart energy cities (SECs) around the world, many countries are now combining customized services and businesses within their energy infrastructure and urban environments. Such changes could then promote the development of platforms that ultimately provide benefits for citizens such as convenience, safety, and cost savings. Currently, the development of technologies for SECs focuses on independent products and unit technology. However, this is problematic, as it may not be possible to develop sustainable cities if there is a lack of connectivity between various elements within the SEC. To solve such problems, this paper presents an AI-based physical and virtual platform using a 5-layer architecture to develop a sustainable smart energy city (SSEC). The architecture employs both a top-down and bottom-up approach and the links between each energy element in the SSEC can readily be analyzed. The economic analysis based on return on investment (ROI) is carried out by comparing the economic benefits before and after the application of this system. Deploying the proposed platform will enable the speedy development and application of new services for SSECs and will provide SSECs with measures to ensure sustainable development, such as rapid urban development, and cost reductions.

AB  - In this paper, an energy-efficient localization algorithm is proposed for precise localization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the process is accomplished in three steps. Firstly, the beacon nodes discover their one-hop neighbor nodes with additional tone requests and reply packets over the media access control (MAC) layer to avoid collision of packets. Secondly, the discovered one-hop unknown nodes are divided into two sets, i.e. unknown nodes with direct communication, and with indirect communication for energy efficiency. In direct communication, source beacon nodes forward the information directly to the unknown nodes, but a common beacon node is selected for communication which reduces overall energy consumption during transmission in indirect communication. Finally, a correction factor is also introduced, and localized unknown nodes are upgraded into helper nodes for reducing the localization error. To analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, various simulations are conducted and compared with the existing algorithms.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The accurate prediction of bus passenger flow is the key to public transport management and the smart city. A long short-term memory network, a deep learning method for modeling sequences, is an efficient way to capture the time dependency of passenger flow. In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have sought to apply the LSTM model to passenger flow prediction. However, few of them pay attention to the optimization procedure during model training. In this article, we propose a hybrid, optimized LSTM network based on Nesterov accelerated adaptive moment estimation (Nadam) and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD). This method trains the model with high efficiency and accuracy, solving the problems of inefficient training and misconvergence that exist in complex models. We employ a hybrid optimized LSTM network to predict the actual passenger flow in Qingdao, China and compare the prediction results with those obtained by non-hybrid LSTM models and conventional methods. In particular, the proposed model brings about a 4%–20% extra performance improvements compared with those of non-hybrid LSTM models. We have also tried combinations of other optimization algorithms and applications in different models, finding that optimizing LSTM by switching Nadam to SGD is the best choice. The sensitivity of the model to its parameters is also explored, which provides guidance for applying this model to bus passenger flow data modelling. The good performance of the proposed model in different temporal and spatial scales shows that it is more robust and effective, which can provide insightful support and guidance for dynamic bus scheduling and regional coordination scheduling.

As the environment of cognitive vehicular and maritime networks is extremely dynamic, these networks suffer with a long delay because of intermittent links while providing services for different applications. To this end, here we introduce the integration of cognitive vehicular and maritime networks to design a coastal smart city by utilizing software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and fog computing under the same infrastructure. This novel integrated cognitive coastal city fulfills the demand of each application user in a hybrid environment with a quicker response time. The idea is to combine vehicular and maritime communications to meet different user demands. Different virtual networks are launched by network function virtualization, and are managed and controlled by a software-defined networking controller. From the integration of software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and fog computing, both vehicular and marine users are provided with stable paths to meet each application&rsquo;s demands.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Urban development in recent decades has had a significant impact on climate change. Cities have implemented traffic monitoring systems to sustain the new building code in meeting the target for environmental indicators. Timisoara is the second city in Romania and manages over 60% of the development and pollution of Timis County. The analysis of large volumes of data provided by local sensors and databases requires big data analytics. In this research, for the first time, we simultaneously developed two parallel scenario-based decision-making support models to assess a CO2 sequestration index. The model is based on a tree inventory for traffic area and car flow using Roegenian processes with borders. The first scenario (dt1) analyzes the real O2-pollution car flows for process streets as receivers of pollution. The second scenario (dt2) analyzes O2-pollution flows for the same streets from the perspective of streets that garage the cars. We modeled the parallel integration of actual O2 production and pollution flows for 160 main streets that account for over 50% of the urban mileage of Timisoara city. The carbon sequestration indexes of the streets are in the range of 0.0000043&ndash;0.437 (dt1) and 0.0000092&ndash;11.78 (dt2). The results can be used to support local decision making regarding the environment CO2-O2 balances by optimizing the local fiscal policies. The research could be extended to secondary streets and separately for the pollution of heating-cooling devices for residential building areas.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The need to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, as well as the use of local renewable heat sources has caused heat meters to be used not only to calculate the consumed energy, but also for the active management of central heating systems. Increasing the reading frequency and the use of measurement data to control the heating system expands the requirements for the reliability of heat meters. The aim of the research is to analyze a large set of meters in the real network and predict their faults to avoid inaccurate readings, incorrect billing, heating system disruption, and unnecessary maintenance. The reliability analysis of heat meters, based on historical data collected over several years, shows some regularities, which cannot be easily described by physics-based models. The failure rate is almost constant and does depend on the past, but is a non-linear combination of state variables. To predict meters&rsquo; failures in the next billing period, three independent machine learning models are implemented and compared with selected metrics, because even the high performance of a single model (87% true positive for neural network) may be insufficient to make a maintenance decision. Additionally, performing hyperparameter optimization boosts the models&rsquo; performance by a few percent. Finally, three improved models are used to build an ensemble classifier, which outperforms the individual models. The proposed procedure ensures the high efficiency of fault detection (&gt;95%), while maintaining overfitting at the minimum level. The methodology is universal and can be utilized to study the reliability and predict faults of other types of meters and different objects with the constant failure rate.

AB  - Machine learning-based indoor localization used to suffer from the collection, construction, and maintenance of labeled training databases for practical implementation. Semi-supervised learning methods have been developed as efficient indoor localization methods to reduce use of labeled training data. To boost the efficiency and the accuracy of indoor localization, this paper proposes a new time-series semi-supervised learning algorithm. The key aspect of the developed method, which distinguishes it from conventional semi-supervised algorithms, is the use of unlabeled data. The learning algorithm finds spatio-temporal relationships in the unlabeled data, and pseudolabels are generated to compensate for the lack of labeled training data. In the next step, another balancing-optimization learning algorithm learns a positioning model. The proposed method is evaluated for estimating the location of a smartphone user by using a Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurement. The experimental results show that the developed learning algorithm outperforms some existing semi-supervised algorithms according to the variation of the number of training data and access points. Also, the proposed method is discussed in terms of why it gives better performance, by the analysis of the impact of the learning parameters. Moreover, the extended localization scheme in conjunction with a particle filter is executed to include additional information, such as a floor plan.

AB  - Increasingly serious traffic jams and traffic accidents pose threats to the social economy and human life. The lamp semantics of driving is a major way to transmit the driving behavior information between vehicles. The detection and recognition of the vehicle taillights can acquire and understand the taillight semantics, which is of great significance for realizing multi-vehicle behavior interaction and assists driving. It is a challenge to detect taillights and identify the taillight semantics on real traffic road during the day. The main research content of this paper is mainly to establish a neural network to detect vehicles and to complete recognition of the taillights of the preceding vehicle based on image processing. First, the outlines of the preceding vehicles are detected and extracted by using convolutional neural networks. Then, the taillight area in the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space are extracted and the taillight pairs are detected by correlations of histograms, color and positions. Then the taillight states are identified based on the histogram feature parameters of the taillight image. The detected taillight state of the preceding vehicle is prompted to the driver to reduce traffic accidents caused by the untimely judgement of the driving intention of the preceding vehicle. The experimental results show that this method can accurately identify taillight status during the daytime and can effectively reduce the occurrence of confused judgement caused by light interference.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Along with the advancement of light-weight sensing and processing technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become popular platforms for intelligent traffic monitoring and control. UAV-mounted cameras can capture traffic-flow videos from various perspectives providing a comprehensive insight into road conditions. To analyze the traffic flow from remotely captured videos, a reliable and accurate vehicle detection-and-tracking approach is required. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning framework for vehicle detection and tracking from UAV videos for monitoring traffic flow in complex road structures. This approach is designed to be invariant to significant orientation and scale variations in the videos. The detection procedure is performed by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art object detector, You Only Look Once (YOLOv3), using several custom-labeled traffic datasets. Vehicle tracking is conducted following a tracking-by-detection paradigm, where deep appearance features are used for vehicle re-identification, and Kalman filtering is used for motion estimation. The proposed methodology is tested on a variety of real videos collected by UAVs under various conditions, e.g., in late afternoons with long vehicle shadows, in dawn with vehicles lights being on, over roundabouts and interchange roads where vehicle directions change considerably, and from various viewpoints where vehicles&rsquo; appearance undergo substantial perspective distortions. The proposed tracking-by-detection approach performs efficiently at 11 frames per second on color videos of 2720p resolution. Experiments demonstrated that high detection accuracy could be achieved with an average F1-score of 92.1%. Besides, the tracking technique performs accurately, with an average multiple-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) of 81.3%. The proposed approach also addressed the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art in multi-object tracking regarding frequent identity switching, resulting in a total of only one identity switch over every 305 tracked vehicles.

AB  - This paper studies the indoor localization based on Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI). In addition to position estimation, this study examines the expansion of applications using Wi-Fi RSSI data sets in three areas: (i) feature extraction, (ii) mobile fingerprinting, and (iii) mapless localization. First, the features of Wi-Fi RSSI observations are extracted with respect to different floor levels and designated landmarks. Second, the mobile fingerprinting method is proposed to allow a trainer to collect training data efficiently, which is faster and more efficient than the conventional static fingerprinting method. Third, in the case of the unknown-map situation, the trajectory learning method is suggested to learn map information using crowdsourced data. All of these parts are interconnected from the feature extraction and mobile fingerprinting to the map learning and the estimation. Based on the experimental results, we observed (i) clearly classified data points by the feature extraction method as regards the floors and landmarks, (ii) efficient mobile fingerprinting compared to conventional static fingerprinting, and (iii) improvement of the positioning accuracy owing to the trajectory learning.

TI  - A Novel Left-Turn Signal Control Method for Improving Intersection Capacity in a Connected Vehicle Environment

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 9
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Setting up an exclusive left-turn lane and corresponding signal phase for intersection traffic safety and efficiency will decrease the capacity of the intersection when there are less or no left-turn movements. This is especially true during rush hours because of the ineffective use of left-turn lane space and signal phase duration. With the advantages of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, a novel intersection signal control model is proposed which sets up variable lane direction arrow marking and turns the left-turn lane into a controllable shared lane for left-turn and through movements. The new intersection signal control model and its control strategy are presented and simulated using field data. After comparison with two other intersection control models and control strategies, the new model is validated to improve the intersection capacity in rush hours. Besides, variable lane lines and the corresponding control method are designed and combined with the left-turn waiting area to overcome the shortcomings of the proposed intersection signal control model and control strategy.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 19
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Affect recognition is an interdisciplinary research field bringing together researchers from natural and social sciences. Affect recognition research aims to detect the affective state of a person based on observables, with the goal to, for example, provide reasoning for the person&rsquo;s decision making or to support mental wellbeing (e.g., stress monitoring). Recently, beside of approaches based on audio, visual or text information, solutions relying on wearable sensors as observables, recording mainly physiological and inertial parameters, have received increasing attention. Wearable systems enable an ideal platform for long-term affect recognition applications due to their rich functionality and form factor, while providing valuable insights during everyday life through integrated sensors. However, existing literature surveys lack a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art research in wearable-based affect recognition. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a broad overview and in-depth understanding of the theoretical background, methods and best practices of wearable affect and stress recognition. Following a summary of different psychological models, we detail the influence of affective states on the human physiology and the sensors commonly employed to measure physiological changes. Then, we outline lab protocols eliciting affective states and provide guidelines for ground truth generation in field studies. We also describe the standard data processing chain and review common approaches related to the preprocessing, feature extraction and classification steps. By providing a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art and guidelines to various aspects, we would like to enable other researchers in the field to conduct and evaluate user studies and develop wearable systems.

TI  - Structural 3D Reconstruction of Indoor Space for 5G Signal Simulation with Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds
T2  - Remote Sensing

VL  - 11

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - 3D modelling of indoor environment is essential in smart city applications such as building information modelling (BIM), spatial location application, energy consumption estimation, and signal simulation, etc. Fast and stable reconstruction of 3D models from point clouds has already attracted considerable research interest. However, in the complex indoor environment, automated reconstruction of detailed 3D models still remains a serious challenge. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel method that couples linear structures with three-dimensional geometric surfaces to automatically reconstruct 3D models using point cloud data from mobile laser scanning. In our proposed approach, a fully automatic room segmentation is performed on the unstructured point clouds via multi-label graph cuts with semantic constraints, which can overcome the over-segmentation in the long corridor. Then, the horizontal slices of point clouds with individual room are projected onto the plane to form a binary image, which is followed by line extraction and regularization to generate floorplan lines. The 3D structured models are reconstructed by multi-label graph cuts, which is designed to combine segmented room, line and surface elements as semantic constraints. Finally, this paper proposed a novel application that 5G signal simulation based on the output structural model to aim at determining the optimal location of 5G small base station in a large-scale indoor scene for the future. Four datasets collected using handheld and backpack laser scanning systems in different locations were used to evaluate the proposed method. The results indicate our proposed methodology provides an accurate and efficient reconstruction of detailed structured models from complex indoor scenes.

AB  - Concerns exists regarding natural disasters, but what about the resulting power outages? This study investigates the characteristics of a digital visual narrative depicting the loss of electrical power after a natural disaster to identify how such situations are represented in images found on the internet. A qualitative approach with an exploratory scope was taken using digital methods. Six events in different places were selected, and 4691 images were analyzed using the Google Cloud Vision API. A constant comparison method was used to identify categories from these images. Then, a manual analysis was performed on a sample of the images of each event, and then categorized. It was found that more than half of the images refer to categories such as infrastructure, nature, and hazards, while the energy category was represented in 13.02% of the images. Most images were photographs; however, the non-photographic images found contained useful information regarding energy. Even when all events featuring power outages, few focused on the lack of energy and more on impacts to the infrastructure, despite energy being required for cities&rsquo; recovery.

AB  - Pervasive healthcare services have undergone a great evolution in recent years. The technological development of communication networks, including the Internet, sensor networks, and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) have given rise to new architectures, applications, and standards related to addressing almost all current e-health challenges. Among the standards, the importance of OpenEHR has been recognized, since it enables the separation of medical semantics from data representation of electronic health records. However, it does not meet the requirements related to interoperability of e-health devices in M2M networks, or in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Moreover, the lack of interoperability hampers the application of new data-processing techniques, such as data mining and online analytical processing, due to the heterogeneity of the data and the sources. This article proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform for pervasive healthcare that ensures interoperability, quality of the detection process, and scalability in an M2M-based architecture, and provides functionalities for the processing of high volumes of data, knowledge extraction, and common healthcare services. The platform uses the semantics described in OpenEHR for both data quality evaluation and standardization of healthcare data stored by the association of IoMT devices and observations defined in OpenEHR. Moreover, it enables the application of big data techniques and online analytic processing (OLAP) through Hadoop Map/Reduce and content-sharing through fast healthcare interoperability resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs).

AB  - The purpose of this descriptive research paper is to initiate discussions on the use of innovative technologies and their potential to support the research and development of pan-Canadian monitoring and surveillance activities associated with environmental impacts on health and within the health system. Its primary aim is to provide a review of disruptive technologies and their current uses in the environment and in healthcare. Drawing on extensive experience in population-level surveillance through the use of technology, knowledge from prior projects in the field, and conducting a review of the technologies, this paper is meant to serve as the initial steps toward a better understanding of the research area. In doing so, we hope to be able to better assess which technologies might best be leveraged to advance this unique intersection of health and environment. This paper first outlines the current use of technologies at the intersection of public health and the environment, in particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The paper provides a description for each of these technologies, along with a summary of their current applications, and a description of the challenges one might face with adopting them. Thereafter, a high-level reference architecture, that addresses the challenges of the described technologies and could potentially be incorporated into the pan-Canadian surveillance system, is conceived and presented.

TI  - Vehicle Logo Recognition Based on Enhanced Matching for Small Objects, Constrained Region and SSFPD Network
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 20
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Vehicle Logo Recognition (VLR) is an important part of vehicle behavior analysis and can provide supplementary information for vehicle identification, which is an essential research topic in robotic systems. However, the inaccurate extraction of vehicle logo candidate regions will affect the accuracy of logo recognition. Additionally, the existing methods have low recognition rate for most small vehicle logos and poor performance under complicated environments. A VLR method based on enhanced matching, constrained region extraction and SSFPD network is proposed in this paper to solve the aforementioned problems. A constrained region extraction method based on segmentation of the car head and car tail is proposed to accurately extract the candidate region of logo. An enhanced matching method is proposed to improve the detection performance of small objects, which augment each of training images by copy-pasting small objects many times in the unconstrained region. A single deep neural network based on a reduced ResNeXt model and Feature Pyramid Networks is proposed in this paper, which is named as Single Shot Feature Pyramid Detector (SSFPD). The SSFPD uses the reduced ResNeXt to improve classification performance of the network and retain more detailed information for small-sized vehicle logo detection. Additionally, it uses the Feature Pyramid Networks module to bring in more semantic context information to build several high-level semantic feature maps, which effectively improves recognition performance. Extensive evaluations have been made on self-collected and public vehicle logo datasets. The proposed method achieved 93.79% accuracy on the Common Vehicle Logos Dataset and 99.52% accuracy on another public dataset, respectively, outperforming the existing methods.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are increasingly embraced around the world to advance smart mobility and more broadly, smart, and sustainable cities. Algorithms form the basis of decision-making in AVs, allowing them to perform driving tasks autonomously, efficiently, and more safely than human drivers and offering various economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, algorithmic decision-making in AVs can also introduce new issues that create new safety risks and perpetuate discrimination. We identify bias, ethics, and perverse incentives as key ethical issues in the AV algorithms&rsquo; decision-making that can create new safety risks and discriminatory outcomes. Technical issues in the AVs&rsquo; perception, decision-making and control algorithms, limitations of existing AV testing and verification methods, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can also undermine the performance of the AV system. This article investigates the ethical and technical concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making in AVs by exploring how driving decisions can perpetuate discrimination and create new safety risks for the public. We discuss steps taken to address these issues, highlight the existing research gaps and the need to mitigate these issues through the design of AV&rsquo;s algorithms and of policies and regulations to fully realise AVs&rsquo; benefits for smart and sustainable cities.

AB  - The development and high growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) have improved quality of life and strengthened different areas in society. Many cities worldwide are looking forward to becoming smart. One of the most popular use cases in smart cities is the implementation of smart parking solutions, as they allow people to optimize time, reduce fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions. Smart parking solutions have a defined architecture with particular components (sensors, communication protocols, and software solutions). Although there are only three components that compose a smart parking solution, it is important to mention that each component has many types that can be used in the deployment of these solutions. This paper identifies the most used types of every component and highlights usage trends in the established analysis period. It provides a complementary perspective and represents a very useful source of information. The scientific community could use this information to decide regarding the selection of types of components to implement a smart parking solution. For this purpose, herein we review several works related to smart parking solutions deployment. To achieve this goal, a semi-cyclic adaptation of the action research methodology combined with a systematic review is used to select papers related to the subject of study. The most relevant papers were reviewed to identify subcategories for each component; these classifications are presented in tables to mark the relevance of each paper accordingly. Trends of usage in terms of sensors, protocols and software solutions are analyzed and discussed in every section. In addition to the trends of usage, this paper determines a guide of complementary features from the type of components that should be considered when implementing a smart parking solution.

AB  - Smart Cities are approaching the Internet of Things (IoT) World. Most of the first-generation Smart City solutions are based on Extract Transform Load (ETL); processes and languages that mainly support pull protocols for data gathering. IoT solutions are moving forward to event-driven processes using push protocols. Thus, the concept of IoT applications has turned out to be widespread; but it was initially &ldquo;implemented&rdquo; with ETL; rule-based solutions; and finally; with true data flows. In this paper, these aspects are reviewed, highlighting the requirements for smart city IoT applications and in particular, the ones that implement a set of specific MicroServices for IoT Applications in Smart City contexts. Moreover; our experience has allowed us to implement a suite of MicroServices for Node-RED; which has allowed for the creation of a wide range of new IoT applications for smart cities that includes dashboards, IoT Devices, data analytics, discovery, etc., as well as a corresponding Life Cycle. The proposed solution has been validated against a large number of IoT applications, as it can be verified by accessing the https://www.Snap4City.org portal; while only three of them have been described in the paper. In addition, the reported solution assessment has been carried out by a number of smart city experts. The work has been developed in the framework of the Select4Cities PCP (PreCommercial Procurement), funded by the European Commission as Snap4City platform.

AB  - With the expansion of smart agriculture, wireless sensor networks are being increasingly applied. These networks collect environmental information, such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 rates. However, if a faulty sensor node operates continuously in the network, unnecessary data transmission adversely impacts the network. Accordingly, a data-based fault-detection algorithm was implemented in this study to analyze data of sensor nodes and determine faults, to prevent the corresponding nodes from transmitting data; thus, minimizing damage to the network. A cloud-based &ldquo;farm as a service&rdquo; optimized for smart farms was implemented as an example, and resource management of sensors and actuators was provided using the oneM2M common platform. The effectiveness of the proposed fault-detection model was verified on an integrated management platform based on the Internet of Things by collecting and analyzing data. The results confirm that when a faulty sensor node is not separated from the network, unnecessary data transmission of other sensor nodes occurs due to continuous abnormal data transmission; thus, increasing energy consumption and reducing the network lifetime.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Public bike share (PBS) systems are meant to be a sustainable urban mobility solution in areas where different travel options and the practice of active transport modes can diminish the need on the vehicle and decrease greenhouse gas emission. Although PBS systems have been included in transportation plans in the last decades experiencing an important development and growth, it is crucial to know the main enablers and barriers that PBS systems are facing to reach their goals. In this paper, first, sentiment analysis techniques are applied to user generated content (UGC) in social media comments (Facebook, Twitter and TripAdvisor) to identify these enablers and barriers. This analysis provides a set of explanatory variables that are combined with data from official statistics and the PBS observatory in Spain. As a result, a statistical model that assesses the connection between PBS use and certain characteristics of the PBS systems, utilizing sociodemographic, climate, and positive and negative opinion data extracted from social media is developed. The outcomes of the research work show that the identification of the main enablers and barriers of PBS systems can be effectively achieved following the research method and tools presented in the paper. The findings of the research can contribute to transportation planners to uncover the main factors related to the adoption and use of PBS systems, by taking advantage of publicly available data sources.

AB  - Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors that increase the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes mellitus. It is crucial to get diagnosed with time to take preventive measures, especially for patients in locations without proper access to laboratories and medical consultations. This work presented a new methodology to diagnose diseases using data mining that documents all the phases thoroughly for further improvement of the resulting models. We used the methodology to create a new model to diagnose the syndrome without using biochemical variables. We compared similar classification models, using their reported variables and previously obtained data from a study in Colombia. We built a new model and compared it to previous models using the holdout, and random subsampling validation methods to get performance evaluation indicators between the models. Our resulting ANN model used three hidden layers and only Hip Circumference, dichotomous Waist Circumference, and dichotomous blood pressure variables. It gave an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 87.75% by the IDF and 85.12% by HMS MetS diagnosis criteria, higher than previous models. Thanks to our new methodology, diagnosis models can be thoroughly documented for appropriate future comparisons, thus benefiting the diagnosis of the studied diseases.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - High-quality updates of road information play an important role in smart city planning, sustainable urban expansion, vehicle management, urban planning, traffic navigation, public health and other fields. However, due to interference from road geometry and texture noise, it is difficult to avoid the decline of automation while accurately extracting roads. Therefore, we propose a high-resolution optical satellite image lane-level road extraction method. First, from the perspective of template matching and considering road characteristics and relevant semantic relations, an adaptive correction model, an MLSOH (multi-scale line segment orientation histogram) descriptor, a sector descriptor, and a multiangle beamlet descriptor are proposed to solve the interference from geometry and texture noise in road template matching and tracking. Second, based on refined lane-level tracking, single-lane and double-lane road-tracking modes are designed to extract single-lane and double-lane roads, respectively. In this paper, Pleiades satellite and GF-2 images are selected to set up different scenarios for urban and rural areas. Experiments are carried out on the phenomena that restrict road extraction, such as tree occlusion, building shadow occlusion, road bending, and road boundary blurring. Compared with other methods, the proposed method not only ensures the accuracy of lane-level road extraction but also greatly improves the automation of road extraction.

AB  - Floods are amongst the most common and devastating of all natural hazards. The alarming number of flood-related deaths and financial losses suffered annually across the world call for improved response to flood risks. Interestingly, the last decade has presented great opportunities with a series of scholarly activities exploring how camera images and wireless sensor data from Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks can improve flood management. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature regarding IoT-based sensors and computer vision applications in flood monitoring and mapping. The paper contributes by highlighting the main computer vision techniques and IoT sensor approaches utilised in the literature for real-time flood monitoring, flood modelling, mapping and early warning systems including the estimation of water level. The paper further contributes by providing recommendations for future research. In particular, the study recommends ways in which computer vision and IoT sensor techniques can be harnessed to better monitor and manage coastal lagoons&mdash;an aspect that is under-explored in the literature.

To assess the well-being of a dog, it is very important for human beings to understand the activity pattern of the dog, and its emotional behavior. A wearable, sensor-based system is suitable for such ends, as it will be able to monitor the dogs in real-time. However, the question remains unanswered as to what kind of data should be used to detect the activity patterns and emotional patterns, as does another: what should be the location of the sensors for the collection of data and how should we automate the system? Yet these questions remain unanswered, because to date, there is no such system that can address the above-mentioned concerns. The main purpose of this study was (1) to develop a system that can detect the activities and emotions based on the accelerometer and gyroscope signals and (2) to automate the system with robust machine learning techniques for implementing it for real-time situations. Therefore, we propose a system which is based on the data collected from 10 dogs, including nine breeds of various sizes and ages, and both genders. We used machine learning classification techniques for automating the detection and evaluation process. The ground truth fetched for the evaluation process was carried out by taking video recording data in frame per second and the wearable sensors data were collected in parallel with the video recordings. Evaluation of the system was performed using an ANN (artificial neural network), random forest, SVM (support vector machine), KNN (k nearest neighbors), and a na&iuml;ve Bayes classifier. The robustness of our system was evaluated by taking independent training and validation sets. We achieved an accuracy of 96.58% while detecting the activity and 92.87% while detecting emotional behavior, respectively. This system will help the owners of dogs to track their behavior and emotions in real-life situations for various breeds in different scenarios.

AB  - As urbanization continues to accelerate, the number of cities and their growing populations have created problems, such as the congestion and noise related to transportation, the pollution from industry, and the difficulty of disposing of garbage. An emerging urban strategy is to make use of digital technologies and big data to help improve the quality of life of urban residents. In the past decade, more and more researchers have studied smart cities, and the number of literature in this field grows rapidly, making it &ldquo;big data&rdquo;. With the aim of better understanding the contexts of smart-city research, including the distribution of topics, knowledge bases, and the research frontiers in the field, this paper is based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection, and the method used is that of comprehensive scientometric analysis and knowledge mapping in terms of diversity, time slicing, and dynamics, using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to study the literature in the field. The main research topics can be divided into three areas&mdash;&ldquo;the concepts and elements of the smart city&rdquo;, &ldquo;the smart city and the Internet of Things&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the smart city of the future&rdquo;&mdash;through document co-citation analysis. There are four key directions&mdash;&ldquo;research objectives and development-strategy research&rdquo;, &ldquo;technical-support research&rdquo;, &ldquo;data-processing and applied research&rdquo;, and &ldquo;management and applied research&rdquo;&mdash;analyzed using keywords co-occurrence. Finally, the research frontiers are urban-development, sustainable cities, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, integration, undertaken through keyword co-occurrence analysis.

AB  - Automatic traffic flow classification is useful to reveal road congestions and accidents. Nowadays, roads and highways are equipped with a huge amount of surveillance cameras, which can be used for real-time vehicle identification, and thus providing traffic flow estimation. This research provides a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art object detectors, visual features, and classification models useful to implement traffic state estimations. More specifically, three different object detectors are compared to identify vehicles. Four machine learning techniques are successively employed to explore five visual features for classification aims. These classic machine learning approaches are compared with the deep learning techniques. This research demonstrates that, when methods and resources are properly implemented and tested, results are very encouraging for both methods, but the deep learning method is the most accurately performing one reaching an accuracy of 99.9% for binary traffic state classification and 98.6% for multiclass classification.

AB  - The exponential growth of cities has brought important challenges such as waste management, pollution and overpopulation, and the administration of transportation. To mitigate these problems, the idea of the smart city was born, seeking to provide robust solutions integrating sensors and electronics, information technologies, and communication networks. More particularly, to face transportation challenges, intelligent transportation systems are a vital component in this quest, helped by vehicular communication networks, which offer a communication framework for vehicles, road infrastructure, and pedestrians. The extreme conditions of vehicular environments, nonetheless, make communication between nodes that may be moving at very high speeds very difficult to achieve, so non-deterministic approaches are necessary to maximize the chances of packet delivery. In this paper, we address this problem using artificial intelligence from a hybrid perspective, focusing on both the best next message to replicate and the best next hop in its path. Furthermore, we propose a deep learning&ndash;based router (DLR+), a router with a prioritized type of message scheduler and a routing algorithm based on deep learning. Simulations done to assess the router performance show important gains in terms of network overhead and hop count, while maintaining an acceptable packet delivery ratio and delivery delays, with respect to other popular routing protocols in vehicular networks.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The present work tries to fill part of the gap regarding the pilots&rsquo; emotions and their bio-reactions during some flight procedures such as, takeoff, climbing, cruising, descent, initial approach, final approach and landing. A sensing architecture and a set of experiments were developed, associating it to several simulated flights (     N  f l i g h t s   = 13    ) using the Microsoft Flight Simulator Steam Edition (FSX-SE). The approach was carried out with eight beginner users on the flight simulator (     N  p i l o t s   = 8    ). It is shown that it is possible to recognize emotions from different pilots in flight, combining their present and previous emotions. The cardiac system based on Heart Rate (HR), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Electroencephalography (EEG), were used to extract emotions, as well as the intensities of emotions detected from the pilot face. We also considered five main emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprise and scared. The emotion recognition is based on Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning techniques. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were the main methods used to measure the quality of the regression output models. The tests of the produced output models showed that the lowest recognition errors were reached when all data were considered or when the GSR datasets were omitted from the model training. It also showed that the emotion surprised was the easiest to recognize, having a mean RMSE of 0.13 and mean MAE of 0.01; while the emotion sad was the hardest to recognize, having a mean RMSE of 0.82 and mean MAE of 0.08. When we considered only the higher emotion intensities by time, the most matches accuracies were between 55% and 100%.

TI  - Application of a Hybrid Artificial Neural Network-Particle Swarm Optimization (ANN-PSO) Model in Behavior Prediction of Channel Shear Connectors Embedded in Normal and High-Strength Concrete

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Channel shear connectors are known as an appropriate alternative for common shear connectors due to having a lower manufacturing cost and an easier installation process. The behavior of channel connectors is generally determined through conducting experiments. However, these experiments are not only costly but also time-consuming. Moreover, the impact of other parameters cannot be easily seen in the behavior of the connectors. This paper aims to investigate the application of a hybrid artificial neural network&ndash;particle swarm optimization (ANN-PSO) model in the behavior prediction of channel connectors embedded in normal and high-strength concrete (HSC). To generate the required data, an experimental project was conducted. Dimensions of the channel connectors and the compressive strength of concrete were adopted as the inputs of the model, and load and slip were predicted as the outputs. To evaluate the ANN-PSO model, an ANN model was also developed and tuned by a backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm. The results of the paper revealed that an ANN model could properly predict the behavior of channel connectors and eliminate the need for conducting costly experiments to some extent. In addition, in this case, the ANN-PSO model showed better performance than the ANN-BP model by resulting in superior performance indices.

AB  - Rising interest in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems combined with the increased availability of collected data allows the study of different methods for prevention of traffic congestion in cities. A common need in all of these methods is the use of traffic predictions for supporting planning and operation of the traffic lights and traffic management schemes. This paper focuses on comparing the forecasting effectiveness of three machine learning models, namely Random Forests, Support Vector Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron&mdash;in addition to Multiple Linear Regression&mdash;using probe data collected from the road network of Thessaloniki, Greece. The comparison was conducted with multiple tests clustered in three types of scenarios. The first scenario tests the algorithms on specific randomly selected dates on different randomly selected roads. The second scenario tests the algorithms on randomly selected roads over eight consecutive 15 min intervals; the third scenario tests the algorithms on random roads for the duration of a whole day. The experimental results show that while the Support Vector Regression model performs best at stable conditions with minor variations, the Multilayer Perceptron model adapts better to circumstances with greater variations, in addition to having the most near-zero errors.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The increasing availability of trajectory recordings has led to the mining of a massive amount of historical track data, allowing for a better understanding of travel behaviors by revealing meaningful motion patterns. In the context of human mobility analysis, the problem of motion prediction assumes a central role and is beneficial for a wide range of applications, including for touristic purposes, such as personalized services or targeted recommendations, and sustainability studies related to crowd management and resource redistribution. This paper tackles a particular case of the trajectory prediction problem, focusing on large-scale mobility traces of short-term foreign tourists. These sparse trajectories, short and non-repetitive, lack spatial and temporal regularity, making prediction analysis based on individual historical motion data unreliable. To face this issue, we hereby propose a deep learning-based approach, taking into account the collective mobility of tourists over the territory. The underlying semantics of motion patterns are captured by means of a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model trained on pre-processed location sequences, aiming to predict the next visited place in the trajectory. We tested the methodology on a real-world big dataset, demonstrating its higher feasibility with respect to traditional approaches.

AB  - Everyday life of the elderly and impaired population living in smart homes is challenging because of possible accidents that may occur due to daily activities. In such activities, persons often lean over (to reach something) and, if they not cautious, are prone to falling. To identify fall incidents, which could stochastically cause serious injuries or even death, we propose specific temporal inference models; namely, CM-I and CM-II. These models can infer a fall incident based on classification methods by exploiting wearable Internet of Things (IoT) altimeter sensors adopted by seniors. We analyzed real and synthetic data of fall and lean over incidents to test the proposed models. The results are promising for incorporating such inference models to assist healthcare for fall verification of seniors in smart homes. Specifically, the CM-II model achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.98, which is the highest accuracy when compared to other models in the literature under the McNemar&rsquo;s test criterion. These models could be incorporated in wearable IoT devices to provide early warning and prediction of fall incidents to clinical doctors.

AB  - This study is to analyze the influence of visibility in a foggy weather environment on the accuracy of machine vision obstacle detection in assisted driving. We present a foggy day imaging model and analyze the image characteristics, then we set up the faster region convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) as the basic network for target detection in the simulation experiment and use Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) data for network detection and classification training. PreScan software is used to build weather and traffic scenes based on a foggy imaging model, and we study object detection of machine vision in four types of weather condition&mdash;clear (no fog), light fog, medium fog, and heavy fog&mdash;by simulation experiment. The experimental results show that the detection recall is 91.55%, 85.21%, 72.54~64.79%, and 57.75% respectively in no fog, light fog, medium fog, and heavy fog environments. Then we used real scenes in medium fog and heavy fog environment to verify the simulation experiment. Through this study, we can determine the influence of bad weather on the detection results of machine vision, and hence we can improve the safety of assisted driving through further research.

AB  - The AI-in-the-loop system (AIS) has been widely used in various autonomous decision and control systems, such as computing vision, autonomous vehicle, and collision avoidance systems. AIS generates and updates control strategies through learning algorithms, which make the control behaviors non-deterministic and bring about the test oracle problem in AIS testing procedure. The traditional system mainly concerns about properties of safety, reliability, and real-time, while AIS concerns more about the correctness, robustness, and stiffness of system. To perform an AIS testing with the existing testing techniques according to the testing requirements, this paper presents an extendable framework of AI-in-the-loop system testing by exploring the key steps involved in the testing procedure, named ExtendAIST, which contributes to define the execution steps of ExtendAIST and design space of testing techniques. Furthermore, the ExtendAIST framework provides three concerns for AIS testing, which include: (a) the extension points; (b) sub-extension points; and (c) existing techniques commonly present in each point. Therefore, testers can obtain the testing strategy using existing techniques directly for corresponding testing requirements or extend more techniques based on these extension points.

AB  - The power output forecasting of the photovoltaic (PV) system is essential before deciding to install a photovoltaic system in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, due to the uneven power production and unstable data. This research simulates the power output forecasting of PV systems by using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), comparing accuracy with particle swarm optimization combined with artificial neural network methods (PSO-ANN). The simulation results show that the forecasting with the ANFIS method is more accurate than the PSO-ANN method. The performance of the ANFIS and PSO-ANN models were verified with mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAP) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE). The accuracy of the ANFIS model is 99.8532%, and the PSO-ANN method is 98.9157%. The power output forecast results of the model were evaluated and show that the proposed ANFIS forecasting method is more beneficial compared to the existing method for the computation of power output and investment decision making. Therefore, the analysis of the production of power output from PV systems is essential to be used for the most benefit and analysis of the investment cost.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In recent years, deep learning technology has been widely used in the field of hyperspectral image classification and achieved good performance. However, deep learning networks need a large amount of training samples, which conflicts with the limited labeled samples of hyperspectral images. Traditional deep networks usually construct each pixel as a subject, ignoring the integrity of the hyperspectral data and the methods based on feature extraction are likely to lose the edge information which plays a crucial role in the pixel-level classification. To overcome the limit of annotation samples, we propose a new three-channel image build method (virtual RGB image) by which the trained networks on natural images are used to extract the spatial features. Through the trained network, the hyperspectral data are disposed as a whole. Meanwhile, we propose a multiscale feature fusion method to combine both the detailed and semantic characteristics, thus promoting the accuracy of classification. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve ideal results better than the state-of-art methods. In addition, the virtual RGB image can be extended to other hyperspectral processing methods that need to use three-channel images.

VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Low-light image enhancement is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, and it is actively researched and used to solve various problems. Most of the time, image processing achieves significant performance under normal lighting conditions. However, under low-light conditions, an image turns out to be noisy and dark, which makes subsequent computer vision tasks difficult. To make buried details more visible, and reduce blur and noise in a low-light captured image, a low-light image enhancement task is necessary. A lot of research has been applied to many different techniques. However, most of these approaches require much effort or expensive equipment to perform low-light image enhancement. For example, the image has to be captured in a raw camera file in order to be processed, and the addressing method does not perform well under extreme low-light conditions. In this paper, we propose a new convolutional network, Attention U-net (the integration of an attention gate and a U-net network), which is able to work on common file types (.PNG, .JPEG, .JPG, etc.) with primary support from deep learning to solve the problem of surveillance camera security in smart city inducements without requiring the raw image file from the camera, and it can perform under the most extreme low-light conditions.

AB  - In order to protect human lives and infrastructure, as well as to minimize the risk of damage, it is important to predict and respond to natural disasters in advance. However, currently, the standardized disaster response system in South Korea still needs further advancement, and the response phase systems need to be improved to ensure that they are properly equipped to cope with natural disasters. Existing studies on intelligent disaster management systems (IDSSs) in South Korea have focused only on storms, floods, and earthquakes, and they have not used past data. This research proposes a new conceptual framework of an IDSS for disaster management, with particular attention paid to wildfires and cold/heat waves. The IDSS uses big data collected from open application programming interface (API) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to help decision-makers make faster and more accurate decisions. In addition, a simple example of the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect fire in surveillance video has been developed, which can be used for automatic fire detection and provide an appropriate response. The system will also consider connecting to open source intelligence (OSINT) to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and develop more robust security policies than those currently in place to prevent cyber-attacks.

This research identified the research works written in English about the recognition of daily activities and environment recognition using the AdaBoost method with the data obtained from the sensors available in mobile devices that were published between 2012 and 2018. Thus, 13 studies were selected and analysed from 151 identified records in the searched databases. The results proved the reliability of the method for daily activities and environment recognition, highlighting the use of several features, including the mean, standard deviation, pitch, roll, azimuth, and median absolute deviation of the signal of motion sensors, and the mean of the signal of magnetic sensors. When reported, the analysed studies presented an accuracy higher than 80% in recognition of daily activities and environments with the Adaboost method.

AB  - Industrial IoT has special communication requirements, including high reliability, low latency, flexibility, and security. These are instinctively provided by the 5G mobile technology, making it a successful candidate for supporting Industrial IoT (IIoT) scenarios. The aim of this paper is to identify current research challenges and solutions in relation to 5G-enabled Industrial IoT, based on the initial requirements and promises of both domains. The methodology of the paper follows the steps of surveying state-of-the art, comparing results to identify further challenges, and drawing conclusions as lessons learned for each research domain. These areas include IIoT applications and their requirements; mobile edge cloud; back-end performance tuning; network function virtualization; and security, blockchains for IIoT, Artificial Intelligence support for 5G, and private campus networks.

AB  - Though the technological advancement of smart city infrastructure has significantly improved urban pedestrians&rsquo; health and safety, there remains a large number of road traffic accident victims, making it a pressing current transportation concern. In particular, unsignalized crosswalks present a major threat to pedestrians, but we lack dense behavioral data to understand the risks they face. In this study, we propose a new model for potential pedestrian risky event (PPRE) analysis, using video footage gathered by road security cameras already installed at such crossings. Our system automatically detects vehicles and pedestrians, calculates trajectories, and extracts frame-level behavioral features. We use k-means clustering and decision tree algorithms to classify these events into six clusters, then visualize and interpret these clusters to show how they may or may not contribute to pedestrian risk at these crosswalks. We confirmed the feasibility of the model by applying it to video footage from unsignalized crosswalks in Osan city, South Korea.

AB  - Noise pollution is one of the major urban environmental pollutions, and it is increasingly becoming a matter of crucial public concern. Monitoring and predicting environmental noise are of great significance for the prevention and control of noise pollution. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, urban noise monitoring is emerging in the direction of a small interval, long time, and large data amount, which is difficult to model and predict with traditional methods. In this study, an IoT-based noise monitoring system was deployed to acquire the environmental noise data, and a two-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) network was proposed for the prediction of environmental noise under the condition of large data volume. The optimal hyperparameters were selected through testing, and the raw data sets were processed. The urban environmental noise was predicted at time intervals of 1 s, 1 min, 10 min, and 30 min, and their performances were compared with three classic predictive models: random walk (RW), stacked autoencoder (SAE), and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed model outperforms the other three existing classic methods. The time interval of the data set has a close connection with the performance of all models. The results revealed that the LSTM network could reflect changes in noise levels within one day and has good prediction accuracy. Impacts of monitoring point location on prediction results and recommendations for environmental noise management were also discussed in this paper.

AB  - Traditional teaching based on masterclasses or techniques where the student develops a passive role has proven to be inefficient methods in the learning process. The use of technology in universities helps to generate active learning where the student&rsquo;s interest improves making him the main actor in his education. However, implementing an environment where active learning takes place requires a great deal of effort given the number of variables involved in this objective. To identify these variables, it is necessary to analyze the data generated by the students in search of patterns that allow them to be classified according to their needs. Once these needs are identified, it is possible to make decisions that contribute to the learning of each student; for this, the use of artificial intelligence is considered. These techniques emulate the processes of human thought using structures that contain knowledge and experience of human experts.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - The neighborhood rough set theory was adopted for attributes reduction and the weight distribution of condition attributes based on the concept of importance level. Smart elderly care coverage rate is low in China. A decisive role in the adoption of smart elderly care is still a problem that needs to be addressed. This study contributes to the adoption of smart elderly care was selected as the decision attribute. The remaining attributes are used as conditional attributes and the multi-level symmetric attribute set for assessing acceptance of smart elderly care. Prior studies are not included smart elderly care adoption attributes in multi-levels; hence, this problem needs to be addressed. The results of this study indicate that the condition attribute of gender has the greatest influence on the decision attribute. The condition attribute of living expenses for smart elderly care has the second largest impact on decision attribute. Children&rsquo;s support for the elderly decency of the novel elderly care system and the acceptance of non-traditional elderly care methods belong to the primary condition attribute of traditional concept. The result indicates traditional concepts have a certain impact on the adoption of smart elderly care and a condition attribute of residence also has a slight influence on the symmetric decision attribute. The sensitivity analysis shows the insights for uncertainties and provides as a basis for the analysis of the attributes in the smart elderly care service adoption.

TI  - Multi-Scale Context Aggregation for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The semantic segmentation of remote sensing images (RSIs) is important in a variety of applications. Conventional encoder-decoder-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use cascade pooling operations to aggregate the semantic information, which results in a loss of localization accuracy and in the preservation of spatial details. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the use of the high-resolution network (HRNet) to produce high-resolution features without the decoding stage. Moreover, we enhance the low-to-high features extracted from different branches separately to strengthen the embedding of scale-related contextual information. The low-resolution features contain more semantic information and have a small spatial size; thus, they are utilized to model the long-term spatial correlations. The high-resolution branches are enhanced by introducing an adaptive spatial pooling (ASP) module to aggregate more local contexts. By combining these context aggregation designs across different levels, the resulting architecture is capable of exploiting spatial context at both global and local levels. The experimental results obtained on two RSI datasets show that our approach significantly improves the accuracy with respect to the commonly used CNNs and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB  - Precision Agriculture (PA) is an ever-expanding field that takes modern technological advancements and applies it to farming practices to reduce waste and increase output. One advancement that can play a significant role in achieving precision agriculture is wireless technology, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Small, inch scale and low-cost devices can be used to monitor great agricultural areas. In this paper, a system for precision viticulture which uses IoT devices for real-time monitoring is proposed. The different components of the system are programmed properly and the interconnection between them is designed to minimize energy consumption. Wireless sensor nodes measure soil moisture and soil temperature in the field and transmit the information to a base station. If the conditions are optimal for a disease or pest to occur, a drone flies towards the area. When the drone is over the node, pictures are captured and then it returns to the base station for further processing. The feasibility of the system is examined through experimentation in a realistic scenario.

AB  - Modern object recognition algorithms have very high precision. At the same time, they require high computational power. Thus, widely used low-power IoT devices, which gather a substantial amount of data, cannot directly apply the corresponding machine learning algorithms to process it due to the lack of local computational resources. A method for fast detection and classification of moving objects for low-power single-board computers is shown in this paper. The developed algorithm uses geometric parameters of an object as well as scene-related parameters as features for classification. The extraction and classification of these features is a relatively simple process which can be executed by low-power IoT devices. The algorithm aims to recognize the most common objects in the street environment, e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, and cars. The algorithm can be applied in the dark environment by processing images from a near-infrared camera. The method has been tested on both synthetic virtual scenes and real-world data. The research showed that a low-performance computing system, such as a Raspberry Pi 3, is able to classify objects with acceptable frame rate and accuracy.

AB  - The transition of the energy system into a more efficient state requires innovative ideas to finance new schemes and engage people into adjusting their behavioural patterns concerning consumption. Effective energy management combined with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) open new opportunities for local and regional authorities, but also for energy suppliers, utilities and other obligated parties, or even energy cooperatives, to implement mechanisms that allow people to become more efficient either by producing and trading energy or by reducing their energy consumption. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed connecting energy savings with a digital energy currency. This framework builds reward schemes where the energy end-users could benefit financially from saving energy, by receiving coins according to their real consumption compared to the predicted consumption if no actions were to take place. A pilot appraisal of such a scheme is presented for the case of Bahrain, so as to simulate the behaviour of the proposed framework in order for it to become a viable choice for intelligent energy management in future action plans.

AB  - The number of publications on acoustic scene classification (ASC) in environmental audio recordings has constantly increased over the last few years. This was mainly stimulated by the annual Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) competition with its first edition in 2013. All competitions so far involved one or multiple ASC tasks. With a focus on deep learning based ASC algorithms, this article summarizes and groups existing approaches for data preparation, i.e., feature representations, feature pre-processing, and data augmentation, and for data modeling, i.e., neural network architectures and learning paradigms. Finally, the paper discusses current algorithmic limitations and open challenges in order to preview possible future developments towards the real-life application of ASC systems.

AB  - Data management and processing to enable predictive analytics in cyber physical systems holds the promise of creating insight over underlying processes, discovering anomalous behaviours and predicting imminent failures threatening a normal and smooth production process. In this context, proactive strategies can be adopted, as enabled by predictive analytics. Predictive analytics in turn can make a shift in traditional maintenance approaches to more effective optimising their cost and transforming maintenance from a necessary evil to a strategic business factor. Empowered by the aforementioned points, this paper discusses a novel methodology for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation enabling predictive maintenance of industrial equipment using partial knowledge over its degradation function and the parameters that are affecting it. Moreover, the design and prototype implementation of a plug-n-play end-to-end cloud architecture, supporting predictive maintenance of industrial equipment is presented integrating the aforementioned concept as a service. This is achieved by integrating edge gateways, data stores at both the edge and the cloud, and various applications, such as predictive analytics, visualization and scheduling, integrated as services in the cloud system. The proposed approach has been implemented into a prototype and tested in an industrial use case related to the maintenance of a robotic arm. Obtained results show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed methodology in supporting predictive analytics in the era of Industry 4.0.

AB  - High-speed wired and wireless Internet are one of the useful ways to acquire various types of media data easily. In this circumstance, people also can easily get media data including objects with exposed personal information through the Internet. Exposure of personal information emerges as a social issue. This paper proposes an effective blocking technique that makes it possible to robustly detect target objects with exposed personal information from various types of input images with the use of deep neural computing and to effectively block the detected objects&rsquo; regions. The proposed technique first utilizes the neural computing-based learning algorithm to robustly detect the target object including personal information from an image. It next generates a grid-type mosaic and lets the mosaic overlap the target object region detected in the previous step so as to effectively block the object region that includes personal information. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm robustly detects the target object region with exposed personal information from a variety of input images and effectively blocks the detected region through grid-type mosaic processing. The object blocking technique proposed in this paper is expected to be applied to various application fields such as image security, sustainable anticipatory computing, object tracking, and target blocking.

AB  - Nowadays, traffic infrastructures and vehicles are connected through the network benefiting from the development of Internet of Things (IoT). Connected automated cars can provide some useful traffic information. An architecture and algorithm of mobile service computing are proposed for traffic state sensing by integration between IoT and transport system models (TSMs). The formation process of queue at this intersection is analyzed based on the state information of connected vehicles and the velocity of shockwave is calculated to predict queue length. The computing results can be delivered to the traffic information edge server. However, not all the vehicles are capable of connecting to the network and will affect the queue length estimation accuracy. At the same time, traffic cameras transmit the traffic image to the edge server and a deep neuron network (DNN) is constructed on the edge server to tackle the traffic image. It can recognize and classify the vehicles in the image but takes several seconds to work with the complex DNN. At last, the final queue length is determined according to the weight of the two computing results. The integrated result is delivered to the traffic light controller and traffic monitoring center cloud. It reveals that the estimation from DNN can compensate the estimation from shockwave when the penetration rate of connected vehicles is low. A testbed is built based on VISSIM, and the evaluation results demonstrate the availability and accuracy of the integrated queue length estimation algorithm.

AB  - Perfect channel state information (CSI) is required in most of the classical physical-layer security techniques, while it is difficult to obtain the ideal CSI due to the time-varying wireless fading channel. Although imperfect CSI has a great impact on the security of MIMO communications, deep learning is becoming a promising solution to handle the negative effect of imperfect CSI. In this work, we propose two types of deep learning-based secure MIMO detectors for heterogeneous networks, where the macro base station (BS) chooses the null-space eigenvectors to prevent information leakage to the femto BS. Thus, the bit error rate of the associated user is adopted as the metric to evaluate the system performance. With the help of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the macro BS obtains the refined version from the imperfect CSI. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed algorithms. The impacts of system parameters, such as the correlation factor of imperfect CSI, the normalized doppler frequency, the number of antennas is investigated in different setup scenarios. The results show that considerable performance gains can be obtained from the deep learning-based detectors compared with the classical maximum likelihood algorithm.

AB  - Regional collision risk identification and prediction is important for traffic surveillance in maritime transportation. This study proposes a framework of real-time prediction for regional collision risk by combining Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) technique, Shapley value method and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Firstly, the DBSCAN technique is applied to cluster vessels in specific sea area. Then the regional collision risk is quantified by calculating the contribution of each vessel and each cluster with Shapley value method. Afterwards, the optimized RNN method is employed to predict the regional collision risk of specific seas in short time. As a result, the framework is able to determine and forecast the regional collision risk precisely. At last, a case study is carried out with actual Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, the results show that the proposed framework is an effective tool for regional collision risk identification and prediction.

AB  - The significant increase of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart homes and other smart infrastructure, and the recent attacks on these IoT devices, are motivating factors to secure and protect IoT networks. The primary security challenge to develop a methodology to identify a malicious activity correctly and mitigate the impact of such activity promptly. In this paper, we propose a two-level anomalous activity detection model for intrusion detection system in IoT networks. The level-1 model categorizes the network flow as normal flow or abnormal flow, while the level-2 model classifies the category or subcategory of detected malicious activity. When the network flow classified as an anomaly by the level-1 model, then the level-1 model forwards the stream to the level-2 model for further investigation to find the category or subcategory of the detected anomaly. Our proposed model constructed on flow-based features of the IoT network. Flow-based detection methodologies only inspect packet headers to classify the network traffic. Flow-based features extracted from the IoT Botnet dataset and various machine learning algorithms were investigated and tested via different cross-fold validation tests to select the best algorithm. The decision tree classifier yielded the highest predictive results for level-1, and the random forest classifier produced the highest predictive results for level-2. Our proposed model Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F score for level-1 were measured as 99.99% and 99.90% for level-2. A two-level anomalous activity detection system for IoT networks we proposed will provide a robust framework for the development of malicious activity detection system for IoT networks. It would be of interest to researchers in academia and industry.

AB  - The urban functional zone, as a special fundamental unit of the city, helps to understand the complex interaction between human space activities and environmental changes. Based on the recognition of physical and social semantics of buildings, combining remote sensing data and social sensing data is an effective way to quickly and accurately comprehend urban functional zone patterns. From the object level, this paper proposes a novel object-wise recognition strategy based on very high spatial resolution images (VHSRI) and social sensing data. First, buildings are extracted according to the physical semantics of objects; second, remote sensing and point of interest (POI) data are combined to comprehend the spatial distribution and functional semantics in the social function context; finally, urban functional zones are recognized and determined by building with physical and social functional semantics. When it comes to building geometrical information extraction, this paper, given the importance of building boundary information, introduces the deeper edge feature map (DEFM) into the segmentation and classification, and improves the result of building boundary recognition. Given the difficulty in understanding deeper semantics and spatial information and the limitation of traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) models in feature extraction, we propose the Deeper-Feature Convolutional Neural Network (DFCNN), which is able to extract more and deeper features for building semantic recognition. Experimental results conducted on a Google Earth image of Shenzhen City show that the proposed method and model are able to effectively, quickly, and accurately recognize urban functional zones by combining building physical semantics and social functional semantics, and are able to ensure the accuracy of urban functional zone recognition.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the past decade, time series data have been generated from various fields at a rapid speed, which offers a huge opportunity for mining valuable knowledge. As a typical task of time series mining, Time Series Classification (TSC) has attracted lots of attention from both researchers and domain experts due to its broad applications ranging from human activity recognition to smart city governance. Specifically, there is an increasing requirement for performing classification tasks on diverse types of time series data in a timely manner without costly hand-crafting feature engineering. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework named Edge4TSC that allows time series to be processed in the edge environment, so that the classification results can be instantly returned to the end-users. Meanwhile, to get rid of the costly hand-crafting feature engineering process, deep learning techniques are applied for automatic feature extraction, which shows competitive or even superior performance compared to state-of-the-art TSC solutions. However, because time series presents complex patterns, even deep learning models are not capable of achieving satisfactory classification accuracy, which motivated us to explore new time series representation methods to help classifiers further improve the classification accuracy. In the proposed framework Edge4TSC, by building the binary distribution tree, a new time series representation method was designed for addressing the classification accuracy concern in TSC tasks. By conducting comprehensive experiments on six challenging time series datasets in the edge environment, the potential of the proposed framework for its generalization ability and classification accuracy improvement is firmly validated with a number of helpful insights.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - There are massive entities with strong denaturation of state in the physical world, and users have urgent needs for real-time and intelligent acquisition of entity information, thus recommendation technologies that can actively provide instant and precise entity state information come into being. Existing IoT data recommendation methods ignore the characteristics of IoT data and user search behavior; thus the recommendation performances are relatively limited. Considering the time-varying characteristics of the IoT entity state and the characteristics of user search behavior, an edge-cloud collaborative entity recommendation method is proposed via combining the advantages of edge computing and cloud computing. First, an entity recommendation system architecture based on the collaboration between edge and cloud is designed. Then, an entity identification method suitable for edge is presented, which takes into account the feature information of entities and carries out effective entity identification based on the deep clustering model, so as to improve the real-time and accuracy of entity state information search. Furthermore, an interest group division method applied in cloud is devised, which fully considers user&rsquo;s potential search needs and divides user interest groups based on clustering model for enhancing the quality of recommendation system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed recommendation method can effectively improve the real-time and accuracy performance of entity recommendation in comparison with traditional methods.

AB  - Owing to frequent traffic accidents and casualties nowadays, the ability to predict the number of traffic accidents in a period is significant for the transportation department to make decisions scientifically. However, owing to many variables affecting traffic accidents in the road traffic system, there are two critical challenges in traffic accident prediction. The first issue is how to evaluate the weight of each variable&rsquo;s impact on the accident. The second issue is how to model the prediction process for multiple interrelated variables. Aiming to solve these two problems, we propose effective solutions to deal with traffic accident prediction. Firstly, for the first issue, we exploit the grey correlation analysis to measure the correlation of factors to accident occurrence. Then, for the second issue, we select the main factors by correlation analysis to establish a multivariable grey model&mdash;MGM(1,N) for prediction process modeling. Further, we explore the collinearity between variables and better optimize the predictive model. The experimental results show that our approach achieves best performance than four general-purpose comparative algorithms in traffic accident prediction task.

AB  - Nowadays, the increasing number of patients accompanied with the emergence of new symptoms and diseases makes heath monitoring and assessment a complicated task for medical staff and hospitals. Indeed, the processing of big and heterogeneous data collected by biomedical sensors along with the need of patients&rsquo; classification and disease diagnosis become major challenges for several health-based sensing applications. Thus, the combination between remote sensing devices and the big data technologies have been proven as an efficient and low cost solution for healthcare applications. In this paper, we propose a robust big data analytics platform for real time patient monitoring and decision making to help both hospital and medical staff. The proposed platform relies on big data technologies and data analysis techniques and consists of four layers: real time patient monitoring, real time decision and data storage, patient classification and disease diagnosis, and data retrieval and visualization. To evaluate the performance of our platform, we implemented our platform based on the Hadoop ecosystem and we applied the proposed algorithms over real health data. The obtained results show the effectiveness of our platform in terms of efficiently performing patient classification and disease diagnosis in healthcare applications.

VL  - 13

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - The current methods that aim at monitoring the structural health status (SHS) of road pavements allow detecting surface defects and failures. This notwithstanding, there is a lack of methods and systems that are able to identify concealed cracks (particularly, bottom-up cracks) and monitor their growth over time. For this reason, the objective of this study is to set up a supervised machine learning (ML)-based method for the identification and classification of the SHS of a differently cracked road pavement based on its vibro-acoustic signature. The method aims at collecting these signatures (using acoustic-sensors, located at the roadside) and classifying the pavement&rsquo;s SHS through ML models. Different ML classifiers (i.e., multilayer perceptron, MLP, convolutional neural network, CNN, random forest classifier, RFC, and support vector classifier, SVC) were used and compared. Results show the possibility of associating with great accuracy (i.e., MLP = 91.8%, CNN = 95.6%, RFC = 91.0%, and SVC = 99.1%) a specific vibro-acoustic signature to a differently cracked road pavement. These results are encouraging and represent the bases for the application of the proposed method in real contexts, such as monitoring roads and bridges using wireless sensor networks, which is the target of future studies.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - The amalgamation of Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) with the Internet of Things (IoT) leads to the concept of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). IoV forms a solid backbone for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which paves the way for technologies that better explain about traffic efficiency and their management applications. IoV architecture is seen as a big player in different areas such as the automobile industry, research organizations, smart cities and intelligent transportation for various commercial and scientific applications. However, as VANET is vulnerable to various types of security attacks, the IoV structure should ensure security and efficient performance for vehicular communications. To address these issues, in this article, an authentication-based protocol (A-MAC) for smart vehicular communication is proposed along with a novel framework towards an IoV architecture model. The scheme requires hash operations and uses cryptographic concepts to transfer messages between vehicles to maintain the required security. Performance evaluation helps analyzing its strength in withstanding various types of security attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that A-MAC outshines other protocols in terms of communication cost, execution time, storage cost, and overhead.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful concept still in its infancy that has the potential, if utilised responsibly, to provide a vehicle for positive change that could promote sustainable transitions to a more resource-efficient livability paradigm. AI with its deep learning functions and capabilities can be employed as a tool which empowers machines to solve problems that could reform urban landscapes as we have known them for decades now and help with establishing a new era; the era of the &ldquo;smart city&rdquo;. One of the key areas that AI can redefine is transport. Mobility provision and its impact on urban development can be significantly improved by the employment of intelligent transport systems in general and automated transport in particular. This new breed of AI-based mobility, despite its machine-orientation, has to be a user-centred technology that &ldquo;understands&rdquo; and &ldquo;satisfies&rdquo; the human user, the markets and the society as a whole. Trust should be built, and risks should be eliminated, for this transition to take off. This paper provides a novel conceptual contribution that thoroughly discusses the scarcely studied nexus of AI, transportation and the smart city and how this will affect urban futures. It specifically covers key smart mobility initiatives referring to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), autonomous Personal and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (PAVs and UAVs) and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), but also interventions that may work as enabling technologies for transport, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Physical Internet (PI) or reflect broader transformations like Industry 4.0. This work is ultimately a reference tool for researchers and city planners that provides clear and systematic definitions of the ambiguous smart mobility terms of tomorrow and describes their individual and collective roles underpinning the nexus in scope.

AB  - The Internet of Things refers (IoT) to the billions of physical devices around the globe that are connected to the Internet, collecting and sharing data. The overall Internet of Things market is projected to be worth more than 50.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. IoT devices possess low processing capabilities, limited memory, limited storage, and minimal network protocol support. With the help of cloud computing technology, we can overcome the limited resources of IoT devices. A lot of research has been conducted on IoT device virtualization to facilitate remote access and control. The concept of virtualization in IoT is to provide a virtual representation of physical devices in the form of virtual objects. IoT devices are more likely to be accessed and communicate through virtual objects in the near future. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of building a virtual IoT network for a smart home. The virtual network is based on virtual objects and IoT controller. We derived the concept from Software Defined Network (SDN) and separated the control plane and data plane in the virtual IoT network. This enhanced the rapid development of diverse applications on top of the virtualization layer by establishing a dynamic end-to-end connection between IoT devices. This article briefly explains the design and development of the virtual network. Results achieved during experiments and performance analysis show that IoT controller enhances the capabilities of a virtual network by dynamically controlling the traffic congestion, handling mapping requests, and routing mechanisms.

TI  - A Method for Human Facial Image Annotation on Low Power Consumption Autonomous Devices

VL  - 20
IS  - 7
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper proposes a classifier designed for human facial feature annotation, which is capable of running on relatively cheap, low power consumption autonomous microcomputer systems. An autonomous system is one that depends only on locally available hardware and software&mdash;for example, it does not use remote services available through the Internet. The proposed solution, which consists of a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) face detector and a set of neural networks, has comparable average accuracy and average true positive and true negative ratio to state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) architectures. However, contrary to DNNs, it is possible to easily implement the proposed method in a microcomputer with very limited RAM memory and without the use of additional coprocessors. The proposed method was trained and evaluated on a large 200,000 image face data set and compared with results obtained by other researchers. Further evaluation proves that it is possible to perform facial image attribute classification using the proposed algorithm on incoming video data captured by an RGB camera sensor of the microcomputer. The obtained results can be easily reproduced, as both the data set and source code can be downloaded. Developing and evaluating the proposed facial image annotation algorithm and its implementation, which is easily portable between various hardware and operating systems (virtually the same code works both on high-end PCs and microcomputers using the Windows and Linux platforms) and which is dedicated for low power consumption devices without coprocessors, is the main and novel contribution of this research.

AB  - Recognizing human physical activities from streaming smartphone sensor readings is essential for the successful realization of a smart environment. Physical activity recognition is one of the active research topics to provide users the adaptive services using smart devices. Existing physical activity recognition methods lack in providing fast and accurate recognition of activities. This paper proposes an approach to recognize physical activities using only2-axes of the smartphone accelerometer sensor. It also investigates the effectiveness and contribution of each axis of the accelerometer in the recognition of physical activities. To implement our approach, data of daily life activities are collected labeled using the accelerometer from 12 participants. Furthermore, three machine learning classifiers are implemented to train the model on the collected dataset and in predicting the activities. Our proposed approach provides more promising results compared to the existing techniques and presents a strong rationale behind the effectiveness and contribution of each axis of an accelerometer for activity recognition. To ensure the reliability of the model, we evaluate the proposed approach and observations on standard publicly available dataset WISDM also and provide a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art studies. The proposed approach achieved 93% weighted accuracy with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, which is almost 13% higher than the existing methods.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The overhead contact system (OCS) is a critical railway infrastructure for train power supply. Periodic inspections, aiming at acquiring the operational condition of the OCS and detecting problems, are necessary to guarantee the safety of railway operations. One of the OCS inspection means is to analyze data of point clouds collected by mobile 2D LiDAR. Recognizing OCS components from the collected point clouds is a critical task of the data analysis. However, the complex composition of OCS makes the task difficult. To solve the problem of recognizing multiple OCS components, we propose a new deep learning-based method to conduct semantic segmentation on the point cloud collected by mobile 2D LiDAR. Both online data processing and batch data processing are supported because our method is designed to classify points into meaningful categories of objects scan line by scan line. Local features are important for the success of point cloud semantic segmentation. Thus, we design an iterative point partitioning algorithm and a module named as Spatial Fusion Network, which are two critical components of our method for multi-scale local feature extraction. We evaluate our method on point clouds where sixteen categories of common OCS components have been manually labeled. Experimental results show that our method is effective in multiple object recognition since mean Intersection-over-Unions (mIoUs) of online data processing and batch data processing are, respectively, 96.12% and 97.17%.

AB  - The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) systems has received much attention from the research community, and it has brought many innovations to smart cities, particularly through the Internet of Moving Things (IoMT). The dynamic geographic distribution of IoMT devices enables the devices to sense themselves and their surroundings on multiple spatio-temporal scales, interact with each other across a vast geographical area, and perform automated analytical tasks everywhere and anytime. Currently, most of the geospatial applications of IoMT systems are developed for abnormal detection and control monitoring. However, it is expected that, in the near future, optimization and prediction tasks will have a larger impact on the way citizens interact with smart cities. This paper examines the state of the art of IoMT systems and discusses their crucial role in supporting anticipatory learning. The maximum potential of IoMT systems in future smart cities can be fully exploited in terms of proactive decision making and decision delivery via an anticipatory action/feedback loop. We also examine the challenges and opportunities of anticipatory learning for IoMT systems in contrast to GIS. The holistic overview provided in this paper highlights the guidelines and directions for future research on this emerging topic.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - In the era of ubiquitous digitization, the Internet of Things (IoT), information plays a vital role. All types of data are collected, and some of this data are stored as text files. An important aspect&mdash;regardless of the type of data&mdash;is related to file storage, especially the amount of disk space that is required. The less space is used on storing data sets, the lower is the cost of this service. Another important aspect of storing data warehouses in the form of files is the cost of data transmission needed for file transfer and its processing. Moreover, the data that are stored should be minimally protected against access and reading by other entities. The aspects mentioned above are particularly important for large data sets like Big Data. Considering the above criteria, i.e., minimizing storage space, data transfer, ensuring minimum security, the main goal of the article was to show the new way of storing text files. This article presents a method that converts data from text files like txt, json, html, py to images (image files) in png format. Taking into account such criteria as the output size of the file, the results obtained for the test files confirm that presented method enables to reduce the need for disk space, as well as to hide data in an image file. The described method can be used for texts saved in extended ASCII and UTF-8 coding.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 8
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This paper proposes a video-based smoke detection technique for early warning in antifire surveillance systems. The algorithm is developed to detect the smoke behavior in a restricted video surveillance environment, both indoor (e.g., railway carriage, bus wagon, industrial plant, or home/office) or outdoor (e.g., storage area or parking area). The proposed technique exploits a Kalman estimator, color analysis, image segmentation, blob labeling, geometrical features analysis, and M of N decisor, in order to extract an alarm signal within a strict real-time deadline. This new technique requires just a few seconds to detect fire smoke, and it is 15 times faster compared to the requirements of fire-alarm standards for industrial or transport systems, e.g., the EN50155 standard for onboard train fire-alarm systems. Indeed, the EN50155 considers a response time of at least 60 s for onboard systems. The proposed technique has been tested and compared with state-of-art systems using the open access Firesense dataset developed as an output of a European FP7 project, including several fire/smoke indoor and outdoor scenes. There is an improvement of all the detection metrics (recall, accuracy, F1 score, precision, etc.) when comparing Advanced Video SmokE Detection (AdViSED) with other video-based antifire works recently proposed in literature. The proposed technique is flexible in terms of input camera type and frame size and rate and has been implemented on a low-cost embedded platform to develop a distributed antifire system accessible via web browser.

AB  - This paper introduces a possible architecture and discusses the research directions for the realization of the Cognitive Perceptual Internet (CPI), which is enabled by the convergence of wired and wireless communications, traditional sensor networks, mobile crowd-sensing, and machine learning techniques. The CPI concept stems from the fact that mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming an outstanding mean for zero-effort world-sensing and digitalization thanks to their pervasive diffusion and the increasing number of embedded sensors. Data collected by such devices provide unprecedented insights into the physical world that can be inferred through cognitive processes, thus originating a digital sixth sense. In this paper, we describe how the Internet can behave like a sensing brain, thus evolving into the Internet of Senses, with network-based cognitive perception and action capabilities built upon mobile crowd-sensing mechanisms. The new concept of hyper-map is envisioned as an efficient geo-referenced repository of knowledge about the physical world. Such knowledge is acquired and augmented through heterogeneous sensors, multi-user cooperation and distributed learning mechanisms. Furthermore, we indicate the possibility to accommodate proactive sensors, in addition to common reactive sensors such as cameras, antennas, thermometers and inertial measurement units, by exploiting massive antenna arrays at millimeter-waves to enhance mobile terminals perception capabilities as well as the range of new applications. Finally, we distillate some insights about the challenges arising in the realization of the CPI, corroborated by preliminary results, and we depict a futuristic scenario where the proposed Internet of Senses becomes true.

AB  - Nowadays, the integration of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IoT) provides a great concern for the research community for enabling advanced services. An IoT network may comprise a large number of heterogeneous smart devices for gathering and forwarding huge data. Such diverse networks raise several research questions, such as processing, storage, and management of massive data. Furthermore, IoT devices have restricted constraints and expose to a variety of malicious network attacks. This paper presents a Secure Sensor Cloud Architecture (SASC) for IoT applications to improve network scalability with efficient data processing and security. The proposed architecture comprises two main phases. Firstly, network nodes are grouped using unsupervised machine learning and exploit weighted-based centroid vectors for the development of intelligent systems. Secondly, the proposed architecture makes the use of sensor-cloud infrastructure for boundless storage and consistent service delivery. Furthermore, the sensor-cloud infrastructure is protected against malicious nodes by using a mathematically unbreakable one-time pad (OTP) encryption scheme to provide data security. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, different simulation experiments are conducted using Network Simulator (NS3). It has been observed through experimental results that the proposed architecture outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of network lifetime, packet drop ratio, energy consumption, and transmission overhead.

The reconstructed EMF exposure map (EEM) in urban environment is obtained by using data from EMF sensor networks, drive testing and information accessible in a public database, e.g., locations and orientations of BSA. The performance of EEM is compared with Exposure Reference Map (ERM) based on simulations, in which parametric path loss models are used to reflect the complexity of urban cities. Then, a new hybrid ANN, which has the advantage of sorting and utilizing inputs from simulations efficiently, is proposed. Using both hybrid ANN and conventional regression ANN, the EEM is reconstructed and compared to the ERM first by the reconstruction approach considering only EMF exposure assessed from sensor networks, where the required number of sensors towards good reconstruction is explored; then, a new reconstruction approach using the sensors information combined with EMF along few streets from drive testing. Both reconstruction approaches use simulations to mimic measurements. The influence of city architecture on EMF exposure reconstruction is analyzed and the addition of noise is considered to test the robustness of ANN as well.

AB  - In the intelligent traffic system, real-time and accurate detections of vehicles in images and video data are very important and challenging work. Especially in situations with complex scenes, different models, and high density, it is difficult to accurately locate and classify these vehicles during traffic flows. Therefore, we propose a single-stage deep neural network YOLOv3-DL, which is based on the Tensorflow framework to improve this problem. The network structure is optimized by introducing the idea of spatial pyramid pooling, then the loss function is redefined, and a weight regularization method is introduced, for that, the real-time detections and statistics of traffic flows can be implemented effectively. The optimization algorithm we use is the DL-CAR data set for end-to-end network training and experiments with data sets under different scenarios and weathers. The analyses of experimental data show that the optimized algorithm can improve the vehicles&rsquo; detection accuracy on the test set by 3.86%. Experiments on test sets in different environments have improved the detection accuracy rate by 4.53%, indicating that the algorithm has high robustness. At the same time, the detection accuracy and speed of the investigated algorithm are higher than other algorithms, indicating that the algorithm has higher detection performance.

AB  - In this paper, a framework for user app behavior analysis using an automated supervised learning method in smartphone environments is proposed. This framework exploits the collective location data of users and their smartphone app logs. Based on these two datasets, the framework determines the apps with a high probability of usage in a geographic area. The framework extracts the app-usage behavior data of a mobile user from an Android phone and transmits them to a server. The server learns the representative trajectory patterns of the user by combining the collected app usage patterns and trajectory data. The proposed method performs supervised learning with automated labeled trajectory data using the user app data. Furthermore, it uses the behavioral characteristics data of users linked to the app usage data by area without a labeling cost.

AB  - Due to the increased awareness of issues ranging from green initiatives, sustainability, and occupant well-being, buildings are becoming smarter, but with smart requirements come increasing complexity and monitoring, ultimately carried out by humans. Building heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) units are one of the major units that consume large percentages of a building&rsquo;s energy, for example through their involvement in space heating and cooling, the greatest energy consumption in buildings. By monitoring such components effectively, the entire energy demand in buildings can be substantially decreased. Due to the complex nature of building management systems (BMS), many simultaneous anomalous behaviour warnings are not manageable in a timely manner; thus, many energy related problems are left unmanaged, which causes unnecessary energy wastage and deteriorates equipment&rsquo;s lifespan. This study proposes a machine learning based multi-level automatic fault detection system (MLe-AFD) focusing on remote HVAC fan coil unit (FCU) behaviour analysis. The proposed method employs sequential two-stage clustering to identify the abnormal behaviour of FCU. The model&rsquo;s performance is validated by implementing well-known statistical measures and further cross-validated via expert building engineering knowledge. The method was experimented on a commercial building based in central London, U.K., as a case study and allows remotely identifying three types of FCU faults appropriately and informing building management staff proactively when they occur; this way, the energy expenditure can be further optimized.

AB  - In healthcare, interoperability is widely adopted in the case of cross-departmental or specialization cases. As the human body demands multiple specialized and cross-disciplined medical experiments, interoperability of business entities like different departments, different specializations, the involvement of legal and government monitoring issues etc. are not sufficient to reduce the active medical cases. A patient-centric system with high capability to collect, retrieve, store or exchange data is the demand for present and future times. Such data-centric health processes would bring automated patient medication, or patient self-driven trusted and high satisfaction capabilities. However, data-centric processes are having a huge set of challenges such as security, technology, governance, adoption, deployment, integration etc. This work has explored the feasibility to integrate resource-constrained devices-based wearable kidney systems in the Industry 4.0 network and facilitates data collection, liquidity, storage, retrieval and exchange systems. Thereafter, a Healthcare 4.0 processes-based wearable kidney system is proposed that is having the blockchain technology advantages. Further, game theory-based consensus algorithms are proposed for resource-constrained devices in the kidney system. The overall system design would bring an example for the transition from the specialization or departmental-centric approach to data and patient-centric approach that would bring more transparency, trust and healthy practices in the healthcare sector. Results show a variation of 0.10 million GH/s to 0.18 million GH/s hash rate for the proposed approach. The chances of a majority attack in the proposed scheme are statistically proved to be minimum. Further Average Packet Delivery Rate (ADPR) lies between 95% to 97%, approximately, without the presence of outliers. In the presence of outliers, network performance decreases below 80% APDR (to a minimum of 41.3%) and this indicates that there are outliers present in the network. Simulation results show that the Average Throughput (AT) value lies between 120 Kbps to 250 Kbps.

TI  - Review: Deep Learning on 3D Point Clouds

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 11
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - A point cloud is a set of points defined in a 3D metric space. Point clouds have become one of the most significant data formats for 3D representation and are gaining increased popularity as a result of the increased availability of acquisition devices, as well as seeing increased application in areas such as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented and virtual reality. Deep learning is now the most powerful tool for data processing in computer vision and is becoming the most preferred technique for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and detection. While deep learning techniques are mainly applied to data with a structured grid, the point cloud, on the other hand, is unstructured. The unstructuredness of point clouds makes the use of deep learning for its direct processing very challenging. This paper contains a review of the recent state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, mainly focusing on raw point cloud data. The initial work on deep learning directly with raw point cloud data did not model local regions; therefore, subsequent approaches model local regions through sampling and grouping. More recently, several approaches have been proposed that not only model the local regions but also explore the correlation between points in the local regions. From the survey, we conclude that approaches that model local regions and take into account the correlation between points in the local regions perform better. Contrary to existing reviews, this paper provides a general structure for learning with raw point clouds, and various methods were compared based on the general structure. This work also introduces the popular 3D point cloud benchmark datasets and discusses the application of deep learning in popular 3D vision tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection.

TI  - Blended Multi-Modal Deep ConvNet Features for Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Prediction
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 6
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of visual impairment and blindness across the world. It is usually found in patients who suffer from diabetes for a long period. The major focus of this work is to derive optimal representation of retinal images that further helps to improve the performance of DR recognition models. To extract optimal representation, features extracted from multiple pre-trained ConvNet models are blended using proposed multi-modal fusion module. These final representations are used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) used for DR identification and severity level prediction. As each ConvNet extracts different features, fusing them using 1D pooling and cross pooling leads to better representation than using features extracted from a single ConvNet. Experimental studies on benchmark Kaggle APTOS 2019 contest dataset reveals that the model trained on proposed blended feature representations is superior to the existing methods. In addition, we notice that cross average pooling based fusion of features from Xception and VGG16 is the most appropriate for DR recognition. With the proposed model, we achieve an accuracy of 97.41%, and a kappa statistic of 94.82 for DR identification and an accuracy of 81.7% and a kappa statistic of 71.1% for severity level prediction. Another interesting observation is that DNN with dropout at input layer converges more quickly when trained using blended features, compared to the same model trained using uni-modal deep features.

SN  - 2624-8921

AB  - With the increase of vehicles in large urban centers, there is also an increase in the number of traffic jams and accidents on public roads. The development of a proper Intelligent Transport System (ITS) could help to alleviate these problems by assisting the drivers on route selections to avoid the most congested road sections. Therefore, to improve on this issue, this work proposes an architecture to aid an ITS to detect, analyze, and classify the traffic flow conditions in real time. This architecture also provides a control room dashboard to visualize the information and notify the users about the live traffic conditions. To this end, the proposed solution takes advantage of computer vision concepts to extract the maximum information about the roads to better assess and keep the drivers posted about the traffic conditions on selected highways. The main contribution of the proposed architecture is to perform the detection and classification of the flow of vehicles regardless of the luminosity conditions. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solution, a testbed was designed. The obtained results show that the accuracy of the traffic classification rate is up to 90% in daylight environments and up to 70% in low light environments when compared with the related literature.

TI  - Autonomous Shuttle Bus for Public Transportation: A Review

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 11
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The rapid evolution of autonomous technology in the field of automotive and information technology (IT) has made it possible to implement autonomous vehicles (AVs) for public passenger transport. Although the shuttle bus transport capacities currently in use are low (maximum 15 people), the use of these transport units in large urban agglomerations is beneficial for society. The current paper is written to review the current AV implementation with respect to shuttle buses with its direct implications in their scientific evolution, with direct links to the legal and social aspects of public transportation all over the world. A critical aspect that is presented in the paper is the legal framework of autonomous driving, which is extremely uneven around the globe, with the direct impact of autonomous shuttle bus exploitation. As the legislation on AVs presents some shortcomings in the approval, registration, and public road implementation of these vehicles, many of the world&rsquo;s major cities have found ways to integrate them into testing programs, establishing the basis for future comprehensive legislative measures in this highly dynamic scientific domain. The current technological solutions adopted by several autonomous shuttle bus producers will be presented with an exhaustive overview of each major component. The aspects of the control algorithm, with its complicated layers of security and perturbance factors, will be explained in detail. Thus, in some countries/cities, autonomous shuttle buses have been implemented on less-traveled routes where they can travel at speeds up to 25 km/h without hindering the public&rsquo;s circulation, such as university campuses, industrial areas, airports, and sports bases. Some countries/cities use autonomous shuttle buses for pilot programs related to passenger transport, while others use them in postal transport and others for scientific purposes. In all of these situations, the first step in autonomous driving has been taken. The paper also makes an evaluation of the social factors that are a consequence of the mass introduction of autonomous driving as a means of public transportation. Autonomous shuttle buses are becoming a part of everyday life in big cities. Their acceptance as a strategic means of transport depends on their efficiency in daily services; through its efficiency, this means of transport will become a game-changer once its benefits become not only known but experienced by a large number of users.

AB  - The logistics industry around the world has proliferated over recent years as a large number of business organizations have come to recognize the importance of logistics. Cost control used to be emphasized to remain competitive, but recently green logistics has gained attention with the awareness of the integration of economy and society as a whole. Nowadays, green logistics is a useful concept to improve the sustainability of logistics operations, and its related policies and theoretical research have been investigated and explored. However, the practical applications of green logistics are impeded by real-time data sharing, which is common in the logistics industry. Blockchain technology is adopted to address this challenge and enable data sharing among related stakeholders. This paper presents a reference framework for green logistics based on blockchain to reach the sustainable operations of logistics, with the integration of the Internet of Things and big data. Finally, potential benefits and limitations are analyzed when implementing this framework.

AB  - There are a number of significant changes taking place in modern city development and most of them are based on the number of recent technological progress. This paper provides a review and analysis of recent approaches of biotechnology that can find a place in today&rsquo;s cities and discusses how those technologies can be integrated into a city&rsquo;s Internet of Things (IoT). Firstly, several biotechnologies that focus on rain gardens, urban vertical farming systems, and city photobioreactors are discussed in the context of their integration in a city&rsquo;s IoT. The next possible application of biofuel cells to the sensor network&rsquo;s energy supply is discussed. It is shown that such devices can influence the low-power sensor network structure as an additional energy source for transmitters. This paper shows the possibility of bioelectrochemical biosensor applications, discusses self-powered biosensors, and shows that such a system can be widely applied to rainwater monitoring in rain gardens and green streets. Significant attention is paid to recent approaches in synthetic biology. Both cell-based biosensors and bioactuators with synthetic genetic circuits are discussed. The development of cell-based biosensors can significantly enhance the sensing possibilities of a city&rsquo;s IoT. We show the possible ways to develop cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with the systems mentioned above. Aspects of data handling for the discussed biotechnologies and the methods of intelligent systems, including those that are machine learning-based, applied to the IoT in a city are presented.

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT), the Internet of vehicles, and blockchain technology have become very popular these days because of their versatility. Road traffic, which is increasing day by day, is causing more and more deaths worldwide. The world needs a product that would reduce the number of road accidents. This paper suggests combining IoT and blockchain technology to mitigate road hazards. The new intelligent transportation system technologies and the subsequent emergence of 5G technologies will be a blessing, delivering the necessary speed to ensure both safety and quality of service (QoS). Hashgraph technology, a distributed ledger technology is used to create communication networks between the different vehicles and other relevant parameters. Scheduling the requests according to the priorities for ensuring better QoS quotient can be effectively done using hashgraph. We demonstrated how the hashgraph outstrips other equivalents platforms. The proposed model was simulated using OMNeT++ with proper design and network description files. A hardware implementation of the proposed model was also done. Messages were transferred between the vehicles and prioritized using a hashgraph. This paper proposes an effective model in reducing the accidents in terms of parameters like speed, security, stability, and fairness.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Borehole log is important data for urban geological 3D modeling. Most of the current borehole logs are stored in a papery form. The construction of a smart city puts forward requirements for the automatic and intelligent 3D modeling of urban geology. However, it is difficult to extract the information from the papery borehole log quickly. What is more, it is unreliable to rely entirely on automated algorithms for modeling without artificial participation, but there is no effective way to integrate geological knowledge into 3D geological modeling currently. Therefore, it is necessary to research how to use existing papery borehole logs efficiently. To overcome the above obstacles, we designed a method that combines structural analysis and layout understanding to extract information from the borehole log. Then, the knowledge-driven three-dimensional geological modeling is proposed based on dynamic profiles. With these methods, the papery borehole log can be converted into structured data which can be used for data analysis directly, and geological knowledge can be integrated into the process of 3D geological modeling. The 3D geological modeling of Xinyang City based on a papery borehole log has been taken as an example to verify the feasibility of the method.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Landslides are one of the most detrimental geological disasters that intimidate human lives along with severe damages to infrastructures and they mostly occur in the mountainous regions across the globe. Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) serves as a key step in assessing potential areas that are prone to landslides and could have an impact on decreasing the possible damages. The application of the fuzzy best-worst multi-criteria decision-making (FBWM) method was applied for LSM in Austria. Further, the role of employing a few numbers of pairwise comparisons on LSM was investigated by comparing the FBWM and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP). For this study, a wide range of data was sourced from the Geological Survey of Austria, the Austrian Land Information System, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, and remotely sensed data were collected. We used nine conditioning factors that were based on the previous studies and geomorphological characteristics of Austria, such as elevation, slope, slope aspect, lithology, rainfall, land cover, distance to drainage, distance to roads, and distance to faults. Based on the evaluation of experts, the slope conditioning factor was chosen as the best criterion (highest impact on LSM) and the distance to roads was considered as the worst criterion (lowest impact on LSM). LSM was generated for the region based on the best and worst criterion. The findings show the robustness of FBWM in landslide susceptibility mapping. Additionally, using fewer pairwise comparisons revealed that the FBWM can obtain higher accuracy as compared to FAHP. The finding of this research can help authorities and decision-makers to provide effective strategies and plans for landslide prevention and mitigation at the national level.

AB  - In a global world, the human population invariably increases while resources gradually decrease as cities and towns constantly consume resources to satisfy their needs and requirements. At this point, it is very necessary to focus on making these urban areas more sustainable and greener. The need for some advanced and automated systems improves the situation, which leads to the innovation of smart cities. Smart city is the concept that helps in developing sustainable cities via optimized resource utilization methods. In smart city development, various sensing technologies can be used that can sense and utilize natural resources in better ways, like storing rainwater to use afterward, intelligent and smart control system, smart infrastructure monitoring system, smart healthcare system, smart transportation system, and smart system for energy consumption and generation by various facilities. To make the city smart and sustainable with efficient energy consumption, we propose renewable solar and wind energy-enabled hybrid heating and cooling HVAC-DHW (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning-Domestic Hot Water) system in which energy consumption is evaluated using optimized NARX-ANN and fuzzy controller based on user needs, dynamic behavior of the atmospheric environment, and spatial distribution of energy supply. To achieve the proposed goal, first, via sensor, heating and cooling effect of environment and building is sensed and these sensed inputs are then fed into deep-learning-based NARX-ANN that forecast internal building temperature. This forecasted temperature is fed into a fuzzy controller for optimizing output based on user demand. This processed information leads to energy distribution based on their requirement using a smart energy sensing system. Based on the experimentation result and performance analysis, it was found that the proposed system is more robust and has a high control response in comparison to the existing systems with minimum energy consumption. The analytical results support the feasibility of the proposed framework architecture to facilitate energy conserving in smart city buildings.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) connects smart devices to enable various intelligent services. The deployment of IoT encounters several challenges, such as difficulties in controlling and managing IoT applications and networks, problems in programming existing IoT devices, long service provisioning time, underused resources, as well as complexity, isolation and scalability, among others. One fundamental concern is that current IoT networks lack flexibility and intelligence. A network-wide flexible control and management are missing in IoT networks. In addition, huge numbers of devices and large amounts of data are involved in IoT, but none of them have been tuned for supporting network management and control. In this paper, we argue that Software-defined Networking (SDN) together with the data generated by IoT applications can enhance the control and management of IoT in terms of flexibility and intelligence. We present a review for the evolution of SDN and IoT and analyze the benefits and challenges brought by the integration of SDN and IoT with the help of IoT data. We discuss the perspectives of knowledge-driven SDN for IoT through a new IoT architecture and illustrate how to realize Industry IoT by using the architecture. We also highlight the challenges and future research works toward realizing IoT with the knowledge-driven SDN.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Neural machine translation is a prominent field in the computational linguistics domain. By leveraging the recent developments of deep learning, it gave birth to powerful algorithms for translating text from one language to another. This study aims to assess the feasibility of transferring the neural machine translation approach into a completely different context, namely human mobility and trajectory analysis. Building a conceptual parallelism between sentences (sequences of words) and motion traces (sequences of locations), we aspire to translate individual trajectories generated by a certain category of users into the corresponding mobility traces potentially generated by a different category of users. The experiment is inserted in the background of tourist mobility analysis, with the goal of translating the motion behavior of tourists belonging to a specific nationality into the motion behavior of tourists belonging to a different nationality. The model adopted is based on the seq2seq approach and consists of an encoder&ndash;decoder architecture based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks and neural embeddings. The encoder turns an input location sequence into a corresponding hidden vector; the decoder reverses the process, turning the vector into an output location sequence. The proposed framework, tested on a real-world large-scale dataset, explores an effective attempt of motion transformation between different entities, arising as a potentially powerful source of mobility information disclosure, especially in the context of crowd management and smart city services.

AB  - The power system worldwide is going through a revolutionary transformation due to the integration with various distributed components, including advanced metering infrastructure, communication infrastructure, distributed energy resources, and electric vehicles, to improve the reliability, energy efficiency, management, and security of the future power system. These components are becoming more tightly integrated with IoT. They are expected to generate a vast amount of data to support various applications in the smart grid, such as distributed energy management, generation forecasting, grid health monitoring, fault detection, home energy management, etc. With these new components and information, artificial intelligence techniques can be applied to automate and further improve the performance of the smart grid. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques to support various applications in a distributed smart grid. In particular, we discuss how artificial techniques are applied to support the integration of renewable energy resources, the integration of energy storage systems, demand response, management of the grid and home energy, and security. As the smart grid involves various actors, such as energy produces, markets, and consumers, we also discuss how artificial intelligence and market liberalization can potentially help to increase the overall social welfare of the grid. Finally, we provide further research challenges for large-scale integration and orchestration of automated distributed devices to realize a truly smart grid.

AB  - The growing trend in electrical vehicle (EV) deployment has transformed independent power network and transportation network studies into highly congested interdependent network performance evaluations assessing their impact on power and transportation systems. Electrified transportation is highly capable of intensifying the interdependent correlations across charging service, transportation, and power networks. However, the evaluation of the complex coupled relationship across charging services, transportation, and power networks poses several challenges, including an impact on charging scheduling, traffic congestion, charging loads on the power grid, and high costs. Therefore, this article presents comparative survey analytics of large-scale EV integration&rsquo;s impact on charging service network scheduling, transportation networks, and power networks. Moreover, price mechanism strategies to determine the charging fares, minimize investment profits, diminish traffic congestion, and reduce power distribution constraints under the influence of various factors were carried out. Additionally, the survey analysis stipulates the interdependent network performance index, ascertaining travel distance, route selection, long-term and short-term planning, and different infrastructure strategies. Finally, the limitations of the proposed study, potential research trends, and critical technologies are demonstrated for future inquiries.

TI  - Improving Road Traffic Forecasting Using Air Pollution and Atmospheric Data: Experiments Based on LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 13
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is one of the most important use cases related to smart cities. In addition to assisting traffic management authorities, traffic forecasting can help drivers to choose the best path to their destinations. Accurate traffic forecasting is a basic requirement for traffic management. We propose a traffic forecasting approach that utilizes air pollution and atmospheric parameters. Air pollution levels are often associated with traffic intensity, and much work is already available in which air pollution has been predicted using road traffic. However, to the best of our knowledge, an attempt to improve forecasting road traffic using air pollution and atmospheric parameters is not yet available in the literature. In our preliminary experiments, we found out the relation between traffic intensity, air pollution, and atmospheric parameters. Therefore, we believe that addition of air pollutants and atmospheric parameters can improve the traffic forecasting. Our method uses air pollution gases, including     C O , N O , N  O 2  , N  O x  ,     and     O 3    . We chose these gases because they are associated with road traffic. Some atmospheric parameters, including pressure, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed have also been considered, as these parameters can play an important role in the dispersion of the above-mentioned gases. Data related to traffic flow, air pollution, and the atmosphere were collected from the open data portal of Madrid, Spain. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) was used in this paper to perform traffic forecasting.

AB  - Currently, there is great interest in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels (and other non-renewable energy sources) in order to preserve the environment; smart buildings are commonly proposed for this purpose as they are capable of producing their own energy and using it optimally. However, at times, solar energy is not able to supply the energy demand fully; it is mandatory to know the quantity of energy needed to optimize the system. This research focuses on the prediction of output temperature from a solar thermal collector. The aim is to measure solar thermal energy and optimize the energy system of a house (or building). The dataset used in this research has been taken from a real installation in a bio-climate house located on the Sotavento Experimental Wind Farm, in north-west Spain. A hybrid intelligent model has been developed by combining clustering and regression methods such as neural networks, polynomial regression, and support vector machines. The main findings show that, by dividing the dataset into small clusters on the basis of similarity in behavior, it is possible to create more accurate models. Moreover, combining different regression methods for each cluster provides better results than when a global model of the whole dataset is used. In temperature prediction, mean absolute error was lower than 4      ∘    C.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - The openness of the Android operating system and its immense penetration into the market makes it a hot target for malware writers. This work introduces Androtomist, a novel tool capable of symmetrically applying static and dynamic analysis of applications on the Android platform. Unlike similar hybrid solutions, Androtomist capitalizes on a wealth of features stemming from static analysis along with rigorous dynamic instrumentation to dissect applications and decide if they are benign or not. The focus is on anomaly detection using machine learning, but the system is able to autonomously conduct signature-based detection as well. Furthermore, Androtomist is publicly available as open source software and can be straightforwardly installed as a web application. The application itself is dual mode, that is, fully automated for the novice user and configurable for the expert one. As a proof-of-concept, we meticulously assess the detection accuracy of Androtomist against three different popular malware datasets and a handful of machine learning classifiers. We particularly concentrate on the classification performance achieved when the results of static analysis are combined with dynamic instrumentation vis-&agrave;-vis static analysis only. Our study also introduces an ensemble approach by averaging the output of all base classification models per malware instance separately, and provides a deeper insight on the most influencing features regarding the classification process. Depending on the employed dataset, for hybrid analysis, we report notably promising to excellent results in terms of the accuracy, F1, and AUC metrics.

AB  - Mobile edge computing (MEC) within 5G networks brings the power of cloud computing, storage, and analysis closer to the end user. The increased speeds and reduced delay enable novel applications such as connected vehicles, large-scale IoT, video streaming, and industry robotics. Machine Learning (ML) is leveraged within mobile edge computing to predict changes in demand based on cultural events, natural disasters, or daily commute patterns, and it prepares the network by automatically scaling up network resources as needed. Together, mobile edge computing and ML enable seamless automation of network management to reduce operational costs and enhance user experience. In this paper, we discuss the state of the art for ML within mobile edge computing and the advances needed in automating adaptive resource allocation, mobility modeling, security, and energy efficiency for 5G networks.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 7
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - One of the objectives of the medicine is to modify patients&rsquo; ways of living. In this context, a key role is played by the diagnosis. When dealing with acquisition systems consisting of multiple wireless devices located in different parts of the body, it becomes fundamental to ensure synchronization between the individual units. This task is truly a challenge, so one aims to limit the complexity of the calculation and ensure long periods of operation. In fact, in the absence of synchronization, it is impossible to relate all the measurements coming from the different subsystems on a single time scale for the extraction of complex characteristics. In this paper, we first analyze in detail all the possible causes that lead to have a system that is not synchronous and therefore not usable. Then, we propose a firmware implementation strategy and a simple but effective protocol that guarantees perfect synchrony between the devices while keeping computational complexity low. The employed network has a star topology with a master/slave architecture. In this paper a new approach to the synchronization problem is introduced to guarantee a precise but not necessarily accurate synchronization between the units. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, a platform consisting of two different types of units has been designed and built. In particular, a nine Degrees of Freedom (DoF) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used in one unit while a nine-DoF IMU and all circuits for the analysis of the superficial Electromyography (sEMG) are present on the other unit. The system is completed by an Android app that acts as a user interface for starting and stopping the logging operations. The paper experimentally demonstrates that the proposed solution overcomes all the limits set out and it guarantees perfect synchronization of the single measurement, even during long-duration acquisitions. In fact, a less than 30    &mu;   s time mismatch has been registered for a 24 h test, and the possibility to perform complex post-processing on the acquired data with a simple and effective system has been proven.

AB  - The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) notion pioneered the implementation of various smart environments. Smart environments intelligibly accommodate inhabitants&rsquo; requirements. With rapid resource shrinkage, energy management has recently become an essential concern for all smart environments. Energy management aims to assure ecosystem sustainability, while benefiting both consumers and utility providers. Although energy management emerged as a solution that addresses challenges that arise with increasing energy demand and resource deterioration, further evolution and expansion are hindered due to technological, economical, and social barriers. This review aggregates energy management approaches in smart environments and extensively reviews a variety of recent literature reports on peak load shaving and demand response. Significant benefits and challenges of these energy management strategies were identified through the literature survey. Finally, a critical discussion summarizing trends and opportunities is given as a thread for future research.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Under the vigorous development of global anticipatory computing in recent years, there have been numerous applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in people&rsquo;s daily lives. Learning analytics of big data can assist students, teachers, and school administrators to gain new knowledge and estimate learning information; in turn, the enhanced education contributes to the rapid development of science and technology. Education is sustainable life learning, as well as the most important promoter of science and technology worldwide. In recent years, a large number of anticipatory computing applications based on AI have promoted the training professional AI talent. As a result, this study aims to design a set of interactive robot-assisted teaching for classroom setting to help students overcoming academic difficulties. Teachers, students, and robots in the classroom can interact with each other through the ARCS motivation model in programming. The proposed method can help students to develop the motivation, relevance, and confidence in learning, thus enhancing their learning effectiveness. The robot, like a teaching assistant, can help students solving problems in the classroom by answering questions and evaluating students&rsquo; answers in natural and responsive interactions. The natural interactive responses of the robot are achieved through the use of a database of emotional big data (Google facial expression comparison dataset). The robot is loaded with an emotion recognition system to assess the moods of the students through their expressions and sounds, and then offer corresponding emotional responses. The robot is able to communicate naturally with the students, thereby attracting their attention, triggering their learning motivation, and improving their learning effectiveness.

AB  - Technological innovations have enabled the realization of a utopian world where all objects of everyday life, as well as humans, are interconnected to form an &ldquo;Internet of Things (IoT).&rdquo; These connected technologies and IoT solutions have led to the emergence of smart cities where all components are converted into a connected smart ecosystem. IoT has envisioned several areas of smart cities including the modern healthcare environment like real-time monitoring, patient information management, ambient-assisted living, ambient-intelligence, anomaly detection, and accelerated sensing. IoT has also brought a breakthrough in the medical domain by integrating stake holders, medical components, and hospitals to bring about holistic healthcare management. The healthcare domain is already witnessing promising IoT-based solutions ranging from embedded mobile applications to wearable devices and implantable gadgets. However, with all these exemplary benefits, there is a need to ensure the safety and privacy of the patient&rsquo;s personal and medical data communicated to and from the connected devices and systems. For a smart city, it is pertinent to have an accessible, effective, and secure healthcare system for its inhabitants. This paper discusses the various elements of technology-enabled healthcare and presents a privacy-preserved and secure &ldquo;Smart Medical System (SMS)&rdquo; framework for the smart city ecosystem. For providing real-time analysis and responses, this paper proposes to use the concept of secured Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) for performing critical time-bound computations on the edge itself. In order to protect the medical and personal data of the patients and to make the data tamper-proof, the concept of blockchain has been used. Finally, this paper highlights the ways to capture and store the medical big data generated from IoT devices and sensors.

The manuscript is structured to include technology, design, and human factor perspectives. The text is visualization/display-focused, that is, other modalities such as audio, haptic, smell, and touch, while important for XR, are beyond the scope of this paper. We further narrow our focus to mainly geospatial research, with necessary deviations to other domains where these technologies are widely researched. The main objective of the study is to provide an overview of broader research challenges and directions in XR, especially in spatial sciences. Aside from the research challenges identified based on a comprehensive literature review, we provide case studies with original results from our own studies in each section as examples to demonstrate the relevance of the challenges in the current research. We believe that this paper will be of relevance to anyone who has scientific interest in extended reality, and/or uses these systems in their research.

AB  - Rights, legal regulations, and practices often arise from societal and scientific developments, and societal transformations may originate from new legal regulations as well. Basic rights can be re-defined with advancements in science and technology. In such an evolutional loop, where mutual supply is obvious, combined legal and technological frameworks should be exercised and developed for practicing human rights. The main aim of this article is to propose a conceptual and methodological framework for the improvement of disability rights in the light of recent advancements in geographic information science (GIScience), in particular for those with motor disabilities, for whom questions related to &ldquo;where&rdquo; are essential. The concept of disability is discussed, considering different aspects, and a new methodological framework is proposed in which Geographic Information Systems (GIS), volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizen science are at the core. In order to implement the framework at the national and international levels, a spatial data model should be developed first. The new data collection and interpretation approaches based on VGI, citizen science, and machine learning methods may help to realize equal rights for people with motor disabilities, by enabling improved access to education, health, and travel.

AB  - Due to the severe climate, residents of winter cities tend not to utilize public open spaces inwinter. Temporary design interventions such as emblematic events are always proposed in wintercities to enhance pedestrian activity by celebrating the season and improving the perception ofwinter. In this study, we clarify the impact of the event on pedestrians&rsquo; perception to determinethe role of temporary design in improving the perception of public open spaces in winter cities.Using the example of event known as &ldquo;Ice Town&rdquo; on the Lenin Square in Khabarovsk, the contentof the Instagram images was analyzed to determine their perception during and after the event.The analysis includes classification of the images into clusters related to dierent urban elementsusing transfer learning with CNN (convolutional neural network). A total of 10,200 generated imageson the Lenin Square were considered, with 1700 images which relate the event itself. This accountsfor approximately 20% of all data, while those which related to the during the permanent use of LeninSquare accounted for just 6%. Temporary design of public open spaces has great potential to involvepedestrians in interacting with urban and natural environments in winter cities, even in severe coldclimate, by improving an impression of a place.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - As a green and sustainable travel mode, the bikeshare plays an important role in solving the &ldquo;last-mile&rdquo; problem. The new dockless bikeshare system (DBS) is widely favored by travelers, and the traditional docked bikeshare system (BS) is affected to a certain extent, but the specific circumstances of this impact are not yet known. To fill the knowledge gap, the objective of this study is to measure the impacts of DBS on London cycle hire, which is a type of BS. In this study, the travel data of 707 docking stations in two periods, i.e., March 2018 and March 2017, are included. A spatial-temporal analysis is first conducted to investigate the mobility pattern changes. A complex network analysis is then developed to explore the impact of DBS on network connectivity. The results suggest a significant decrease of 64% in the average trip amounts, with both origins and destinations in the affected area, and the trips with short and medium duration and short and medium distances are mainly replaced by DBS. DBS also has a considerable impact on the structure and properties of the mobility network. The connectivity and interaction strength between stations decrease after DBS appears. We also concluded that the observed changes are heterogeneously distributed in space, especially on weekends. The applied spatial-temporal analysis and complex network analysis provide a better understanding of the relationships between DBS and BS.

AB  - Sensor networks in real-world environments, such as smart cities or ambient intelligent platforms, provide applications with large and heterogeneous sets of data streams. Outliers—observations that do not conform to an expected behavior—has then turned into a crucial task to establish and maintain secure and reliable databases in this kind of platforms. However, the procedures to obtain accurate models for erratic observations have to operate with low complexity in terms of storage and computational time, in order to attend the limited processing and storage capabilities of the sensor nodes in these environments. In this work, we analyze three binary classifiers based on three statistical prediction models—ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average), GAM (Generalized Additive Model), and LOESS (LOcal RegrESSion)—for outlier detection with low memory consumption and computational time rates. As a result, we provide (1) the best classifier and settings to detect outliers, based on the ARIMA model, and (2) two real-world classified datasets as ground truths for future research.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The scope of the present paper is to promote social, cultural and environmental sustainability in cities by establishing a conceptual framework and the relationship amongst safety in urban public space (UPS), lighting and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-based surveillance. This framework uses available technologies and tools, as these can be found in urban equipment such as lighting posts, to enhance security and safety in UPS, ensuring protection against attempted criminal activity. Through detailed literary research, publications on security and safety concerning crime and lighting can be divided into two periods, the first one pre-1994, and the second one from 2004&ndash;2008. Since then, a significant reduction in the number of publications dealing with lighting and crime is observed, while at the same time, the urban nightscape has been reshaped with the immersion of light-emitting diode (LED) technologies. Especially in the last decade, where most municipalities in the EU28 (European Union of all the member states from the accession of Croatia in 2013 to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020) are refurbishing their road lighting with LED technology and the consideration of smart networks and surveillance is under development, the use of lighting to deter possible attempted felonies in UPS is not addressed. To capitalize on the potential of lighting as a deterrent, this paper proposes a framework that uses existing technology, namely, dimmable LED light sources, presence sensors, security cameras, as well as emerging techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled image recognition algorithms and big data analytics and presents a possible system that could be developed as a stand-alone product to alert possible dangerous situations, deter criminal activity and promote the perception of safety thus linking lighting and ICT-based surveillance towards safety and security in UPS.

AB  - During the last few years, various Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications have emerged with numerous network elements interconnected using wired and wireless communication technologies and equipped with strategically placed sensors and actuators. This paper justifies why non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) will bring the IIoT vision closer to reality by providing improved data acquisition and massive connectivity to sensor fields in large and remote areas. NTNs are engineered to utilize satellites, airships, and aircrafts, which can be employed to extend the radio coverage and provide remote monitoring and sensing services. Additionally, this paper describes indicative delay-tolerant massive IIoT and delay-sensitive mission-critical IIoT applications spanning a large number of vertical markets with diverse and stringent requirements. As the heterogeneous nature of NTNs and the complex and dynamic communications scenarios lead to uncertainty and a high degree of variability, conventional wireless communication technologies cannot sufficiently support ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) and offer ubiquitous and uninterrupted interconnectivity. In this regard, this paper sheds light on the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), in the provision of challenging NTN-based IIoT services and provides a thorough review of the relevant research works. By adding intelligence and facilitating the decision-making and prediction procedures, the NTNs can effectively adapt to their surrounding environment, thus enhancing the performance of various metrics with significantly lower complexity compared to typical optimization methods.

AB  - This paper addresses the voltage control problem in medium-voltage distribution networks. The objective is to cost-efficiently maintain the voltage profile within a safe range, in presence of uncertainties in both the future working conditions, as well as the physical parameters of the system. Indeed, the voltage profile depends not only on the fluctuating renewable-based power generation and load demand, but also on the physical parameters of the system components. In reality, the characteristics of loads, lines and transformers are subject to complex and dynamic dependencies, which are difficult to model. In such a context, the quality of the control strategy depends on the accuracy of the power flow representation, which requires to capture the non-linear behavior of the power network. Relying on the detailed analytical models (which are still subject to uncertainties) introduces a high computational power that does not comply with the real-time constraint of the voltage control task. To address this issue, while avoiding arbitrary modeling approximations, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning model to ensure an autonomous grid operational control. Outcomes show that the proposed model-free approach offers a promising alternative to find a compromise between calculation time, conservativeness and economic performance.

TI  - Waste Management and Prediction of Air Pollutants Using IoT and Machine Learning Approach
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 15
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Increasing waste generation has become a significant issue over the globe due to the rapid increase in urbanization and industrialization. In the literature, many issues that have a direct impact on the increase of waste and the improper disposal of waste have been investigated. Most of the existing work in the literature has focused on providing a cost-efficient solution for the monitoring of garbage collection system using the Internet of Things (IoT). Though an IoT-based solution provides the real-time monitoring of a garbage collection system, it is limited to control the spreading of overspill and bad odor blowout gasses. The poor and inadequate disposal of waste produces toxic gases, and radiation in the environment has adverse effects on human health, the greenhouse system, and global warming. While considering the importance of air pollutants, it is imperative to monitor and forecast the concentration of air pollutants in addition to the management of the waste. In this paper, we present and IoT-based smart bin using a machine and deep learning model to manage the disposal of garbage and to forecast the air pollutant present in the surrounding bin environment. The smart bin is connected to an IoT-based server, the Google Cloud Server (GCP), which performs the computation necessary for predicting the status of the bin and for forecasting air quality based on real-time data. We experimented with a traditional model (k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) and logistic reg) and a non-traditional (long short term memory (LSTM) network-based deep learning) algorithm for the creation of alert messages regarding bin status and forecasting the amount of air pollutant carbon monoxide (CO) present in the air at a specific instance. The recalls of logistic regression and k-NN algorithm is 79% and 83%, respectively, in a real-time testing environment for predicting the status of the bin. The accuracy of modified LSTM and simple LSTM models is 90% and 88%, respectively, to predict the future concentration of gases present in the air. The system resulted in a delay of 4 s in the creation and transmission of the alert message to a sanitary worker. The system provided the real-time monitoring of garbage levels along with notifications from the alert mechanism. The proposed works provide improved accuracy by utilizing machine learning as compared to existing solutions based on simple approaches.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Smart cities and smart buildings must provide their customers with many services, including those associated with health, productivity, and energy efficiency, among others. Short-range wireless systems can provide all of these services, but the significant growth of wireless networks operating within a smart building (SB) can produce the phenomenon of spectrum shortages. Spectrum shortages could be resolved using Cognitive Radio (CR)-based systems to improve the efficiency of electromagnetic spectrum use by taking advantage of the reusable spectrum available in the building&rsquo;s interior. This study proposes a mechanism using two interference conditions to quickly estimate the minimum amount of effective spectrum availability (ESA) inside an SB. The results show that an SB contains ESA distributed across 36% to 98% of the building&rsquo;s area for reuse, as a function of the height of the building and of the distance from the base station (BS) of the primary system.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental evaluation of real-time pedestrian detection algorithms and their tuning using the proposed universal performance index. With this index, the precise choice of various parameters is possible. Moreover, we determined the best resolution of the analysis window, which is much lower than the initial window. By such means, we can speed-up the processing (i.e., reduce the classification time by 74%). There are cases in which we increased both the processing speed and the classification accuracy. We made experiments with various baseline detectors and datasets in order to confirm versatility of the proposed ideas. The analyzed classifiers are those typically applied to detection of pedestrians, namely: aggregated channel feature (ACF), deep convolutional neural network (CNN), and support vector machine (SVM). We used a suite of five precisely chosen night (and day) IR vision datasets.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the rapid development and popularization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, an increasing number of cyber-attacks are targeting such devices. It was said that most of the attacks in IoT environments are botnet-based attacks. Many security weaknesses still exist on the IoT devices because most of them have not enough memory and computational resource for robust security mechanisms. Moreover, many existing rule-based detection systems can be circumvented by attackers. In this study, we proposed a machine learning (ML)-based botnet attack detection framework with sequential detection architecture. An efficient feature selection approach is adopted to implement a lightweight detection system with a high performance. The overall detection performance achieves around 99% for the botnet attack detection using three different ML algorithms, including artificial neural network (ANN), J48 decision tree, and Na&iuml;ve Bayes. The experiment result indicates that the proposed architecture can effectively detect botnet-based attacks, and also can be extended with corresponding sub-engines for new kinds of attacks.

TI  - Closed-Loop Elastic Demand Control under Dynamic Pricing Program in Smart Microgrid Using Super Twisting Sliding Mode Controller
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 16
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Electricity demand is rising due to industrialisation, population growth and economic development. To meet this rising electricity demand, towns are renovated by smart cities, where the internet of things enabled devices, communication technologies, dynamic pricing servers and renewable energy sources are integrated. Internet of things (IoT) refers to scenarios where network connectivity and computing capability is extended to objects, sensors and other items not normally considered computers. IoT allows these devices to generate, exchange and consume data without or with minimum human intervention. This integrated environment of smart cities maintains a balance between demand and supply. In this work, we proposed a closed-loop super twisting sliding mode controller (STSMC) to handle the uncertain and fluctuating load to maintain the balance between demand and supply persistently. Demand-side load management (DSLM) consists of agents-based demand response (DR) programs that are designed to control, change and shift the load usage pattern according to the price of the energy of a smart grid community. In smart grids, evolved DR programs are implemented which facilitate controlling of consumer demand by effective regulation services. The DSLM under price-based DR programs perform load shifting, peak clipping and valley filling to maintain the balance between demand and supply. We demonstrate a theoretical control approach for persistent demand control by dynamic price-based closed-loop STSMC. A renewable energy integrated microgrid scenario is discussed numerically to show that the demand of consumers can be controlled through STSMC, which regulates the electricity price to the DSLM agents of the smart grid community. The overall demand elasticity of the current study is represented by a first-order dynamic price generation model having a piece-wise linear price-based DR program. The simulation environment for this whole scenario is developed in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulations validate that the closed-loop price-based elastic demand control technique can trace down the generation of a renewable energy integrated microgrid.

AB  - This paper deals with the efficiency and sustainability of urban rail transit (URT) using exploratory data analytics (EDA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The first stage of the proposed methodology is EDA with already available indicators (e.g., the number of stations and passengers), and suggested indicators (e.g., weekly frequencies, link occupancy rates, and CO2 footprint per journey) to directly characterize the efficiency and sustainability of this transport mode. The second stage is to assess the efficiency of URT with two original models, based on a thorough selection of input and output variables, which is one of the key contributions of EDA to this methodology. The first model compares URT against other urban transport modes, applicable to route personalization, and the second scores the efficiency of URT lines. The main outcome of this paper is the proposed methodology, which has been experimentally validated using open data from the Transport for London (TfL) URT network and additional sources.

AB  - With the increasing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, the cyber security of these platforms is a highly active area of research. One key technology underpinning smart IoT systems is machine learning, which classifies and predicts events from large-scale data in IoT networks. Machine learning is susceptible to cyber attacks, particularly data poisoning attacks that inject false data when training machine learning models. Data poisoning attacks degrade the performances of machine learning models. It is an ongoing research challenge to develop trustworthy machine learning models resilient and sustainable against data poisoning attacks in IoT networks. We studied the effects of data poisoning attacks on machine learning models, including the gradient boosting machine, random forest, naive Bayes, and feed-forward deep learning, to determine the levels to which the models should be trusted and said to be reliable in real-world IoT settings. In the training phase, a label modification function is developed to manipulate legitimate input classes. The function is employed at data poisoning rates of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30% that allow the comparison of the poisoned models and display their performance degradations. The machine learning models have been evaluated using the ToN_IoT and UNSW NB-15 datasets, as they include a wide variety of recent legitimate and attack vectors. The experimental results revealed that the models&rsquo; performances will be degraded, in terms of accuracy and detection rates, if the number of the trained normal observations is not significantly larger than the poisoned data. At the rate of data poisoning of 30% or greater on input data, machine learning performances are significantly degraded.

AB  - Peak-load forecasting prevents energy waste and helps with environmental issues by establishing plans for the use of renewable energy. For that reason, the subject is still actively studied. Most of these studies are focused on improving predictive performance by using varying feature information, but most small industrial facilities cannot provide such information because of a lack of infrastructure. Therefore, we introduce a series of studies to implement a generalized prediction model that is applicable to these small industrial facilities. On the basis of the pattern of load information of most industrial facilities, new features were selected, and a generalized model was developed through the aggregation of ensemble models. In addition, a new method is proposed to improve prediction performance by providing additional compensation to the prediction results by reflecting the fewest opinions among the prediction results of each model. Actual data from two small industrial facilities were applied to our process, and the results proved the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB  - Several heterogeneous, intelligent, and distributed devices can be connected to interact with one another over the Internet in what is termed internet of things (IoT). Also, the concept of IoT can be exploited in the industrial environment for enhancing the production of goods and services and for mitigating the risk of disaster occurrences. This application of IoT for enhancing industrial production is known as industrial IoT (IIoT). Emergent configuration (EC) is a technology that can be adopted to enhance the operation and collaboration of IoT connected devices in order to improve the efficiency of the connected IoT systems for maximum user satisfaction. To meet user goals, the connected devices are required to cooperate with one another in an adaptive, interoperable, and homogeneous manner. In this paper, a survey of the concept of IoT is presented in addition to a review of IIoT systems. The application of ubiquitous computing-aided software define networking (SDN)-based EC architecture is propounded for enhancing the throughput of oil and gas production in the maritime ecosystems by managing the exploration process especially in emergency situations that involve anthropogenic oil and gas spillages.

AB  - This work compares Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) deep neural networks for the outdoor advertisement panel detection problem by handling multiple and combined variabilities in the scenes. Publicity panel detection in images offers important advantages both in the real world as well as in the virtual one. For example, applications like Google Street View can be used for Internet publicity and when detecting these ads panels in images, it could be possible to replace the publicity appearing inside the panels by another from a funding company. In our experiments, both SSD and YOLO detectors have produced acceptable results under variable sizes of panels, illumination conditions, viewing perspectives, partial occlusion of panels, complex background and multiple panels in scenes. Due to the difficulty of finding annotated images for the considered problem, we created our own dataset for conducting the experiments. The major strength of the SSD model was the almost elimination of False Positive (FP) cases, situation that is preferable when the publicity contained inside the panel is analyzed after detecting them. On the other side, YOLO produced better panel localization results detecting a higher number of True Positive (TP) panels with a higher accuracy. Finally, a comparison of the two analyzed object detection models with different types of semantic segmentation networks and using the same evaluation metrics is also included.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Human identity recognition has a wide range of application scenarios and a large number of application requirements. In recent years, the technology of collecting human biometrics through sensors for identification has become mature, but this kind of method needs additional equipment as assistance, which cannot be well applied to some scenarios. Using Wi-Fi for identity recognition has many advantages, such as no additional equipment as assistance, not affected by temperature, humidity, weather, light, and so on, so it has become a hot topic of research. The methods of individual identity recognition have been more mature; for example, gait information can be extracted as features. However, it is difficult to identify small-scale (2&ndash;5) group personnel at one time, and the tasks of fingerprint storage and classification are complex. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed a method of using the random forest as a fingerprint database classifier. The method is divided into two stages: the offline stage trains the random forest classifier through the collected training data set. In the online phase, the real-time data collected are input into the classifier to get the results. When extracting channel state information (CSI) features, multiple people are regarded as a whole to reduce the difficulty of feature selection. The use of random forest classifier in classification can give full play to the advantages of random forest, which can deal with a large number of multi-dimensional data and is easy to generalize. Experiments showed that WiGId has good recognition performance in both LOS (line of sight) and N LOS (None line of sight) environments.

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Situated in the main tracks of typhoons in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean, Taiwan frequently encounters disasters from heavy rainfall during typhoons. Accurate and timely typhoon rainfall prediction is an imperative topic that must be addressed. The purpose of this study was to develop a Hadoop Spark distribute framework based on big-data technology, to accelerate the computation of typhoon rainfall prediction models. This study used deep neural networks (DNNs) and multiple linear regressions (MLRs) in machine learning, to establish rainfall prediction models and evaluate rainfall prediction accuracy. The Hadoop Spark distributed cluster-computing framework was the big-data technology used. The Hadoop Spark framework consisted of the Hadoop Distributed File System, MapReduce framework, and Spark, which was used as a new-generation technology to improve the efficiency of the distributed computing. The research area was Northern Taiwan, which contains four surface observation stations as the experimental sites. This study collected 271 typhoon events (from 1961 to 2017). The following results were obtained: (1) in machine-learning computation, prediction errors increased with prediction duration in the DNN and MLR models; and (2) the system of Hadoop Spark framework was faster than the standalone systems (single I7 central processing unit (CPU) and single E3 CPU). When complex computation is required in a model (e.g., DNN model parameter calibration), the big-data-based Hadoop Spark framework can be used to establish highly efficient computation environments. In summary, this study successfully used the big-data Hadoop Spark framework with machine learning, to develop rainfall prediction models with effectively improved computing efficiency. Therefore, the proposed system can solve problems regarding real-time typhoon rainfall prediction with high timeliness and accuracy.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), pulse diagnosis is one of the most important methods for diagnosis. A pulse can be felt by applying firm fingertip pressure to the skin where the arteries travel. The pulse diagnosis has become an important tool not only for TCM practitioners but also for several areas of Western medicine. Many pulse measuring devices have been proposed to obtain objective pulse conditions. In the past, pulse diagnosis instruments were single-point sensing methods, which missed a lot of information. Later, multi-point sensing instruments were developed that resolved this issue but were much higher in cost and lacked mobility. In this article, based on the concept of sensor fusion, we describe a portable low-cost system for TCM pulse-type estimation using a smartphone connected to two sensors, including one photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and one galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor. As a proof of concept, we collected five-minute PPG pulse information and skin impedance on 24 acupoints from 80 subjects. Based on these collected data, we implemented a fully connected neural network (FCN), which was able to provide high prediction accuracy (&gt;90%) for patients with a TCM wiry pulse.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In this paper, a Mobility Assistive System (NOVA-MAS) and a model-driven development approach are proposed to support the acquisition and analysis of data, infrastructures control, and dissemination of information along public roads. A literature review showed that the work related to mobility assistance of pedestrians in wheelchairs has a gap in ensuring their safety on road. The problem is that pedestrians in wheelchairs and scooters often do not enjoy adequate and safe lanes for their circulation on public roads, having to travel sometimes side by side with vehicles and cars moving at high speed. With NOVA-MAS, city infrastructures can obtain information regarding the environment and provide it to their users/vehicles, increasing road safety in an inclusive way, contributing to the decrease of the accidents of pedestrians in wheelchairs. NOVA-MAS not only supports information dissemination, but also data acquisition from sensors and infrastructures control, such as traffic light signs. For that, it proposed a development approach that supports the acquisition of data from the environment and its control while using a tool framework, named IOPT-Tools (Input-Output Place-Transition Tools). IOPT-Tools support controllers&rsquo; specification, validation, and implementation, with remote operation capabilities. The infrastructures&rsquo; controllers are specified through IOPT Petri net models, which are then simulated using computational tools and verified using state-space-based model-checking tools. In addition, an automatic code generator tool generates the C code, which supports the controllers&rsquo; implementation, avoiding manual codification errors. A set of prototypes were developed and tested to validate and conclude on the feasibility of the proposals.

AB  - Railway turnout system is a key infrastructure to railway safety and efficiency. However, it is prone to failure in the field. Therefore, many railway departments have adopted a monitoring system to monitor the operation status of turnouts. With monitoring data collected, many researchers have proposed different fault-diagnosis methods. However, many of the existing methods cannot realize real-time updating or deal with new fault types. This paper—based on imbalanced data—proposes a Bayes-based online turnout fault-diagnosis method, which realizes incremental learning and scalable fault recognition. First, the basic conceptions of the turnout system are introduced. Next, the feature extraction and processing of the imbalanced monitoring data are introduced. Then, an online diagnosis method based on Bayesian incremental learning and scalable fault recognition is proposed, followed by the experiment with filed data from Guangzhou Railway. The results show that the scalable fault-recognition method can reach an accuracy of 99.11%, and the training time of the Bayesian incremental learning model reduces 29.97% without decreasing the accuracy, which demonstrates the high accuracy, adaptability and efficiency of the proposed model, of great significance for labor-saving, timely maintenance and further, safety and efficiency of railway transportation.

AB  - Flash flood is one of the most dangerous natural phenomena because of its high magnitudes and sudden occurrence, resulting in huge damages for people and properties. Our work aims to propose a state-of-the-art model for susceptibility mapping of the flash flood using the decision tree random subspace ensemble optimized by hybrid firefly&ndash;particle swarm optimization (HFPS), namely the HFPS-RSTree model. In this work, we used data from a flood inventory map consisting of 1866 polygons derived from Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and a field survey conducted in the northwest mountainous area of the Van Ban district, Lao Cai Province in Vietnam. A total of eleven flooding conditioning factors (soil type, geology, rainfall, river density, elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), plant curvature, and profile curvature) were used as explanatory variables. These indicators were compiled from a geological and mineral resources map, soil type map, and topographic map, ALOS PALSAR DEM 30 m, and Landsat-8 imagery. The HFPS-RSTree model was trained and verified using the inventory map and the eleven conditioning variables and then compared with four machine learning algorithms, i.e., the support vector machine (SVM), the random forests (RF), the C4.5 decision trees (C4.5 DT), and the logistic model trees (LMT) models. We employed a range of statistical standard metrics to assess the predictive performance of the proposed model. The results show that the HFPS-RSTree model had the best predictive performance and achieved better results than those of other benchmarks with the ability to predict flash flood, reaching an overall accuracy of over 90%. It can be concluded that the proposed approach provides new insights into flash flood prediction in mountainous regions.

AB  - The modern planning and management of urban spaces is an essential topic for smart cities and depends on up-to-date and reliable information on land use and the functional roles of the places that integrate urban areas. In the last few years, driven by the increased availability of geo-referenced data from social media, embedded sensors, and remote sensing images, various techniques have become popular for land use analysis. In this paper, we first highlight and discuss the different data types and methods usually adopted in this context, as well as their purposes. Then, based on a systematic state-of-the-art study, we focused on exploring the potential of points of interest (POIs) for land use classification, as one of the most common categories of crowdsourced data. We developed an application to automatically collect POIs for the study area, creating a dataset that was used to generate a large number of features. We used a ranking technique to select, among them, the most suitable features for classifying land use. As ground truth data, we used CORINE Land Cover (CLC), which is a solid and reliable dataset available for the whole European territory. It was used an artificial neural network (ANN) in different scenarios and our results reveal values of more than 90% for the accuracy and F-score in one experiment performed. Our analysis suggests that POI data have promising potential to characterize geographic spaces. The work described here aims to provide an alternative to the current methodologies for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, which are usually time-consuming and depend on expensive data types.

AB  - Traffic monitoring from closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras on embedded systems is the subject of the performed experiments. Solving this problem encounters difficulties related to the hardware limitations, and possible camera placement in various positions which affects the system performance. To satisfy the hardware requirements, vehicle detection is performed using a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), named SqueezeDet, while, for tracking, the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm is applied, allowing for real-time processing on an NVIDIA Jetson Tx2. To allow for adaptation of the system to the deployment environment, a procedure was implemented leading to generating labels in an unsupervised manner with the help of background modelling and the tracking algorithm. The acquired labels are further used for fine-tuning the model, resulting in a meaningful increase in the traffic estimation accuracy, and moreover, adding only minimal human effort to the process allows for further accuracy improvement. The proposed methods, and the results of experiments organised under real-world test conditions are presented in the paper.

AB  - One of the models in the literature for modeling the behavior of the brain is the Bayesian attractor model, which is a kind of machine-learning algorithm. According to this model, the brain assigns stochastic variables to possible decisions (attractors) and chooses one of them when enough evidence is collected from sensory systems to achieve a confidence level high enough to make a decision. In this paper, we introduce a software defined networking (SDN) application based on a brain-inspired Bayesian attractor model for identification of the current traffic pattern for the supervision and automation of Internet of things (IoT) networks that exhibit a limited number of traffic patterns. In a real SDN testbed, we demonstrate that our SDN application can identify the traffic patterns using a limited set of fluctuating network statistics of edge link utilization. Moreover, we show that our application can improve core link utilization and the power efficiency of IoT networks by immediately applying a pre-calculated network configuration optimized by traffic engineering with network slicing for the identified pattern.

AB  - Following the significant improvement of technology in terms of data collection and treatment during the last decades, the notion of a smart environment has widely taken an important pedestal in the science industry. Built in order to better manage assets, smart environments provide a livable environment for users or citizens through the deployment of sensors responsible for data collection. Much research has been done to provide security to the involved data, which are extremely sensitive. However, due to the small size and the memory constraint of the sensors, many of these works are difficult to implement. In this paper, a different concept for wireless sensor security in smart environments is presented. The proposed security system, which is based on the scaler distribution of a novel electronic device, the intrusion detection system (IDS), reduces the computational functions of the sensors and therefore maximizes their efficiency. The IDS also introduces the concept of the feedback signal and &ldquo;trust table&rdquo; used to trigger the detection and isolation mechanism in case of attacks. Generally, it ensures the whole network security through cooperation with other IDSs and, therefore, eliminates the problem of security holes that may occur while adopting such a security technique.

AB  - Emotion recognition based on physiological data classification has been a topic of increasingly growing interest for more than a decade. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis in literature regarding the selection of classifiers to use, sensor modalities, features and range of expected accuracy, just to name a few limitations. In this work, we evaluate emotion in terms of low/high arousal and valence classification through Supervised Learning (SL), Decision Fusion (DF) and Feature Fusion (FF) techniques using multimodal physiological data, namely, Electrocardiography (ECG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Respiration (RESP), or Blood Volume Pulse (BVP). The main contribution of our work is a systematic study across five public datasets commonly used in the Emotion Recognition (ER) state-of-the-art, namely: (1) Classification performance analysis of ER benchmarking datasets in the arousal/valence space; (2) Summarising the ranges of the classification accuracy reported across the existing literature; (3) Characterising the results for diverse classifiers, sensor modalities and feature set combinations for ER using accuracy and F1-score; (4) Exploration of an extended feature set for each modality; (5) Systematic analysis of multimodal classification in DF and FF approaches. The experimental results showed that FF is the most competitive technique in terms of classification accuracy and computational complexity. We obtain superior or comparable results to those reported in the state-of-the-art for the selected datasets.

AB  - In addition to air pollution, environmental noise has become one of the major hazards for citizens, being Road Traffic Noise (RTN) as its main source in urban areas. Recently, low-cost Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASNs) have become an alternative to traditional strategic noise mapping in cities. In order to monitor RTN solely, WASN-based approaches should automatize the off-line removal of those events unrelated to regular road traffic (e.g., sirens, airplanes, trams, etc.). Within the LIFE DYNAMAP project, 15 urban Anomalous Noise Events (ANEs) were described through an expert-based recording campaign. However, that work only focused on the overall analysis of the events gathered during non-sequential diurnal periods. As a step forward to characterize the temporal and local particularities of urban ANEs in real acoustic environments, this work analyses their distribution between day (06:00&ndash;22:00) and night (22:00&ndash;06:00) in narrow (1 lane) and wide (more than 1 lane) streets. The study is developed on a manually-labelled 151-h acoustic database obtained from the 24-nodes WASN deployed across DYNAMAP&rsquo;s Milan pilot area during a weekday and a weekend day. Results confirm the unbalanced nature of the problem (RTN represents 83.5% of the data), while identifying 26 ANE subcategories mainly derived from pedestrians, animals, transports and industry. Their presence depends more significantly on the time period than on the street type, as most events have been observed in the day-time during the weekday, despite being especially present in narrow streets. Moreover, although ANEs show quite similar median durations regardless of time and location in general terms, they usually present higher median signal-to-noise ratios at night, mainly on the weekend, which becomes especially relevant for the WASN-based computation of equivalent RTN levels.

AB  - The identification of roof surfaces is characterized by a sequence of several processing steps. The boundary detection of different types of roof is realized from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) cloud points and can confirm the real boundary of the roof. In the process of processing LiDAR data, shortcomings have been found regarding the inappropriate classification of points (class 6 &ldquo;buildings&rdquo;) concerning the roofs (the points of the building facade were marked as outliers and reclassified). In cases of insufficient point density, there is a problem with not being able to capture either the roof boundary or small roof objects, along with the possible occurrence of gaps inside the roof areas. This study proposes a processing procedure in a geographic information system (GIS) environment that advocates the identification of roof surfaces based on the LiDAR point cloud. We created the contours of a roof surface boundary with a simplified regular shape. From 824 roofs in the studied area, six different types of roof were selected, which this study presents in detail. The expected result of the study is the generation of segments inside the roof boundary. The study also includes the visualization of the outcomes of the spatial analyses of the identified roof surfaces, which forms the basis for determining the potential of solar systems with respect to green roofs for the development of smart city buildings.
