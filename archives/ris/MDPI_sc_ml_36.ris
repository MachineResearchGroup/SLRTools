AB  - Imaging spectroscopy has emerged as a reliable analytical method for effectively characterizing and quantifying quality attributes of agricultural products. By providing spectral information relevant to food quality properties, imaging spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be a potential method for rapid and non-destructive classification, authentication, and prediction of quality parameters of various categories of tubers, including potato and sweet potato. The imaging technique has demonstrated great capacities for gaining rapid information about tuber physical properties (such as texture, water binding capacity, and specific gravity), chemical components (such as protein, starch, and total anthocyanin), varietal authentication, and defect aspects. This paper emphasizes how recent developments in spectral imaging with machine learning have enhanced overall capabilities to evaluate tubers. The machine learning algorithms coupled with feature variable identification approaches have obtained acceptable results. This review briefly introduces imaging spectroscopy and machine learning, then provides examples and discussions of these techniques in tuber quality determinations, and presents the challenges and future prospects of the technology. This review will be of great significance to the study of tubers using spectral imaging technology.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In this study, a thorough and definitive evaluation of Predictive Optimal Energy Management Strategy (POEMS) applications in connected vehicles using 10 to 20 s predicted velocity is conducted for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). The presented methodology includes synchronous datasets gathered in Fort Collins, Colorado using a test vehicle equipped with sensors to measure ego vehicle position and motion and that of surrounding objects as well as receive Infrastructure to Vehicle (I2V) information. These datasets are utilized to compare the effect of different signal categories on prediction fidelity for different prediction horizons within a POEMS framework. Multiple artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms use the collected data to output future vehicle velocity prediction models. The effects of different combinations of signals and different models on prediction fidelity in various prediction windows are explored. All of these combinations are ultimately addressed where the rubber meets the road: fuel economy (FE) enabled from POEMS. FE optimization is performed using Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a Dynamic Programming (DP) optimizer. FE improvements from MPC control at various prediction time horizons are compared to that of full-cycle DP. All FE results are determined using high-fidelity simulations of an Autonomie 2010 Toyota Prius model. The full-cycle DP POEMS provides the theoretical upper limit on fuel economy (FE) improvement achievable with POEMS but is not currently practical for real-world implementation. Perfect prediction MPC (PP-MPC) represents the upper limit of FE improvement practically achievable with POEMS. Real-Prediction MPC (RP-MPC) can provide nearly equivalent FE improvement when used with high-fidelity predictions. Constant-Velocity MPC (CV-MPC) uses a constant speed prediction and serves as a “null” POEMS. Results showed that RP-MPC, enabled by high-fidelity ego future speed prediction, led to significant FE improvement over baseline nearly matching that of PP-MPC.

TI  - Using Multivariate Regression and ANN Models to Predict Properties of Concrete Cured under Hot Weather
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 18
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Concrete is an important construction material. Its characteristics depend on the environmental conditions, construction methods, and mix factors. Working with concrete is particularly tricky in a hot climate. This study predicts the properties of concrete in hot conditions using the case study of Rawalpindi, Pakistan. In this research, variable casting temperatures, design factors, and curing conditions are investigated for their effects on concrete characteristics. For this purpose, water–cement ratio (w/c), in-situ concrete temperature (T), and curing methods of the concrete are varied, and their effects on pulse velocity (PV), compressive strength (fc), depth of water penetration (WP), and split tensile strength (ft) were studied for up to 180 days. Quadratic regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models have been formulated to forecast the properties of concrete in the current study. The results show that T, curing period, and moist curing strongly influence fc, ft, and PV, while WP is adversely affected by T and moist curing. The ANN model shows better results compared to the quadratic regression model. Furthermore, a combined ANN model of fc, ft, and PV was also developed that displayed higher accuracy than the individual ANN models. These models can help construction site engineers select the appropriate concrete parameters when concreting under hot climates to produce durable and long-lasting concrete.

SN  - 1996-1944

AB  - The effect of reinforcements and thermal exposure on the tensile properties of aluminium AA 5083–silicon carbide (SiC)–fly ash composites were studied in the present work. The specimens were fabricated with varying wt.% of fly ash and silicon carbide and subjected to T6 thermal cycle conditions to enhance the properties through “precipitation hardening”. The analyses of the microstructure and the elemental distribution were carried out using scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The composite specimens thus subjected to thermal treatment exhibit uniform distribution of the reinforcements, and the energy dispersive spectrum exhibit the presence of Al, Si, Mg, O elements, along with the traces of few other elements. The effects of reinforcements and heat treatment on the tensile properties were investigated through a set of scientifically designed experimental trials. From the investigations, it is observed that the tensile and yield strength increases up to 160 °C, beyond which there is a slight reduction in the tensile and yield strength with an increase in temperature (i.e., 200 °C). Additionally, the % elongation of the composites decreases substantially with the inclusion of the reinforcements and thermal exposure, leading to an increase in stiffness and elastic modulus of the specimens. The improvement in the strength and elastic modulus of the composites is attributed to a number of factors, i.e., the diffusion mechanism, composition of the reinforcements, heat treatment temperatures, and grain refinement. Further, the optimisation studies and ANN modelling validated the experimental outcomes and provided the training models for the test data with the correlation coefficients for interpolating the results for different sets of parameters, thereby facilitating the fabrication of hybrid composite components for various automotive and aerospace applications.

TI  - Intelligent Vehicle Scheduling and Routing for a Chain of Retail Stores: A Case Study of Dhaka, Bangladesh
T2  - Logistics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 5
IS  - 3
SN  - 2305-6290

AB  - Background: Retail chains aim to maintain a competitive advantage by ensuring product availability and fulfilling customer demand on-time. However, inefficient scheduling and vehicle routing from the distribution center may cause delivery delays and, thus, stock-outs on the store shelves. Therefore, optimization of vehicle routing can play a vital role in fulfilling customer demand. Methods: In this research, a case study is formulated for a chain of retail stores in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Orders from various stores are combined, grouped, and scheduled for Region-1 and Region-2 of Dhaka City. The ‘vehicle routing add-on’ feature of Google Sheets is used for scheduling and navigation. An android application, Intelligent Route Optimizer, is developed using the shortest path first algorithm based on the Dijkstra algorithm. The vehicle navigation scheme is programmed to change the direction according to the shortest possible path in the google map generated by the intelligent routing optimizer. Results: With the application, the improvement of optimization results is evident from the reductions of traveled distance (8.1% and 12.2%) and time (20.2% and 15.0%) in Region-1 and Region-2, respectively. Conclusions: A smartphone-based application is developed to improve the distribution plan. It can be utilized for an intelligent vehicle routing system to respond to real-time traffic; hence, the overall replenishment process will be improved.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The collapse of overhead power line guyed towers is one of the leading causes of power grid failures, subjecting electricity companies to pay considerable, high-value fines. In this way, the current work proposes a novel and complete framework for the remote monitoring of mechanical stresses in guyed towers. The framework method comprises a mesh network for data forwarding and neural networks to improve the performance of Low-Power and Lossy Networks. The method also considers the use of multiple sensors in the sensor fusion technique. As a result, the risk of collapse of guyed cable towers reduces, due to the remote monitoring and preventive actions promoted by the framework. Furthermore, the proposed method uses multiple input variable fusions, such as accelerometers and tension sensors, to estimate the tower’s displacement. These estimations help address the structural health of the tower against failures (i.e., loosening of the stay cables, displacement, and vibrations) that can cause catastrophic events, such as tower collapse or even cable rupture.

SN  - 2624-8921

AB  - The autonomous vehicle (AVs) market is expanding at a rapid pace due to the advancement of information, communication, and sensor technology applications, offering a broad range of opportunities in terms of energy efficiency and addressing climate change concerns and safety. With regard to this last point, the rate of reduction in accidents is considerable when switching safety control tasks to machines from humans, which can be noted as having significantly slower response rates. This paper explores this thematic by focusing on the safety of AVs by thorough analysis of previously collected AV crash statistics and further discusses possible solutions for achieving increased autonomous vehicle safety. To achieve this, this technical paper develops a dynamic run-time safe assessment system, using the standard autonomous drive system (ADS), which is developed and simulated in case studies further in the paper. OpenCV methods for lane detection are developed and applied as robust control frameworks, which introduces the factor of vehicle crash predictability for the ego vehicle. The developed system is made to predict possible crashes by using a combination of machine learning and neural network methods, providing useful information for response mechanisms in risk scenarios. In addition, this paper explores the operational design domain (ODD) of the AV’s system and provides possible solutions to extend the domain in order to render vehicle operationality, even in safe mode. Additionally, three case studies are explored to supplement a discussion on the implementation of algorithms aimed at increasing curved lane detection ability and introducing trajectory predictability of neighbouring vehicles for an ego vehicle, resulting in lower collisions and increasing the safety of the AV overall. This paper thus explores the technical development of autonomous vehicles and is aimed at researchers and practitioners engaging in the conceptualisation, design, and implementation of safer AV systems focusing on lane detection and expanding AV safe state domains and vehicle trajectory predictability.

TI  - Hybrid Representation of Sensor Data for the Classification of Driving Behaviour

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 18
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Monitoring driving behaviour is important in controlling driving risk, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. Recent advances in machine learning, which include several variants of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks, could be valuable for the development of objective and efficient computational tools in this direction. The main idea in this work is to complement data-driven classification of driving behaviour with rules derived from domain knowledge. In this light, we present a hybrid representation approach, which employs NN-based time-series encoding and rule-guided event detection. Histograms derived from the output of these two components are concatenated, normalized, and used to train a standard support vector machine (SVM). For the NN-based component, CNN-based, LSTM-based, and GRU-based variants are investigated. The CNN-based variant uses image-like representations of sensor measurements, whereas the RNN-based variants (LSTM and GRU) directly process sensor measurements in the form of time-series. Experimental evaluation on three datasets leads to the conclusion that the proposed approach outperforms a state-of-the-art camera-based approaches in distinguishing between normal and aggressive driving behaviour without using data derived from a camera. Moreover, it is demonstrated that both NN-guided time-series encoding and rule-guided event detection contribute to overall classification accuracy.

SN  - 2076-3387

AB  - The expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) in public administration is generating numerous opportunities for governments. Current Spanish regulations have established electronic administration and support the expansion and implementation of this new technology, but they may not be adapted to the legal needs caused by AI. Consequently, this research aims to identify the risks associated with AI uses in Spanish public administration and if the legal mechanisms can solve them. We answer these questions by employing a qualitative research approach, conducting semi-structured interviews with several experts in the matter. Despite the benefits that this technology may involve, throughout this research we can confirm that the use of artificial intelligence can generate several problems such as opacity, legal uncertainty, biases, or breaches of personal data protection. The mechanisms already provided by Spanish law are not enough to avoid these risks as they have not been designed to face the use of artificial intelligence in public administration. In addition, a homogeneous legal definition of AI needs to be established.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - One of the important aspects of realizing smart cities is developing smart homes/buildings and, from the energy perspective, designing and implementing an efficient smart home area energy management system (HAEMS) is vital. To be effective, the HAEMS should include various electrical appliances as well as local distributed/renewable energy resources and energy storage systems, with the whole system as a microgrid. However, the collecting and processing of the data associated with these appliances/resources are challenging in terms of the required sensors/communication infrastructure and computational burden. Thanks to the internet-of-things and cloud computing technologies, the physical requirements for handling the data have been provided; however, they demand suitable optimization/management schemes. In this article, a HAEMS is developed using cloud services to increase the accuracy and speed of the data processing. A management protocol is proposed that provides an optimal schedule for a day-ahead operation of the electrical equipment of smart residential homes under welfare indicators. The proposed system comprises three layers: (1) sensors associated with the home appliances and generation/storage units, (2) local fog nodes, and (3) a cloud where the information is processed bilaterally with HAEMS and the hourly optimal operation of appliances/generation/storage units is planned. The neural network and genetic algorithm (GA) are used as part of the HAEMS program. The neural network is used to predict the amount of workload corresponding to users’ requests. Improving the load factor and the economic efficiency are considered as the objective function that is optimized using GA. Numerical studies are performed in the MATLAB platform and the results are compared with a conventional method.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 18
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The long-term electricity demand forecast of the consumer utilization is essential for the energy provider to analyze the future demand and for the accurate management of demand response. Forecasting the consumer electricity demand with efficient and accurate strategies will help the energy provider to optimally plan generation points, such as solar and wind, and produce energy accordingly to reduce the rate of depletion. Various demand forecasting models have been developed and implemented in the literature. However, an efficient and accurate forecasting model is required to study the daily consumption of the consumers from their historical data and forecast the necessary energy demand from the consumer’s side. The proposed recurrent neural network gradient boosting regression tree (RNN-GBRT) forecasting technique allows one to reduce the demand for electricity by studying the daily usage pattern of consumers, which would significantly help to cope with the accurate evaluation. The efficiency of the proposed forecasting model is compared with various conventional models. In addition, by the utilization of power consumption data, power theft detection in the distribution line is monitored to avoid financial losses by the utility provider. This paper also deals with the consumer’s energy analysis, useful in tracking the data consistency to detect any kind of abnormal and sudden change in the meter reading, thereby distinguishing the tampering of meters and power theft. Indeed, power theft is an important issue to be addressed particularly in developing and economically lagging countries, such as India. The results obtained by the proposed methodology have been analyzed and discussed to validate their efficacy.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Regular inspection of railway track health is crucial for maintaining safe and reliable train operations. Factors, such as cracks, ballast issues, rail discontinuity, loose nuts and bolts, burnt wheels, superelevation, and misalignment developed on the rails due to non-maintenance, pre-emptive investigations and delayed detection, pose a grave danger and threats to the safe operation of rail transport. The traditional procedure of manually inspecting the rail track using a railway cart is both inefficient and prone to human error and biases. In a country like Pakistan where train accidents have taken many lives, it is not unusual to automate such approaches to avoid such accidents and save countless lives. This study aims at enhancing the traditional railway cart system to address these issues by introducing an automatic railway track fault detection system using acoustic analysis. In this regard, this study makes two important contributions: data collection on Pakistan railway tracks using acoustic signals and the application of various classification techniques to the collected data. Initially, three types of tracks are considered, including normal track, wheel burnt and superelevation, due to their common occurrence. Several well-known machine learning algorithms are applied such as support vector machines, logistic regression, random forest and decision tree classifier, in addition to deep learning models like multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks. Results suggest that acoustic data can help determine the track faults successfully. Results indicate that the best results are obtained by RF and DT with an accuracy of 97%.

AB  - The role of forests is increasing because of rapid land use changes worldwide that have implications on ecosystems and the carbon cycle. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain accurate information about forests and build forest inventories. However, it is difficult to assess the internal structure of the forest through 2D remote sensing techniques and fieldwork. In this aspect, we proposed a method for estimating the vertical structure of forests based on full-waveform light detection and ranging (FW LiDAR) data in this study. Voxel-based tree point density maps were generated by estimating the number of canopy height points in each voxel grid from the raster digital terrain model (DTM) and canopy height points after pre-processing the LiDAR point clouds. We applied an unsupervised classification algorithm to the voxel-based tree point density maps and identified seven classes by profile pattern analysis for the forest vertical types. The classification accuracy was found to be 72.73% from the validation from 11 field investigation sites, which was additionally confirmed through comparative analysis with aerial images. Based on this pre-classification reference map, which is assumed to be ground truths, the deep neural network (DNN) model was finally applied to perform the final classification. As a result of accuracy assessment, it showed accuracy of 92.72% with a good performance. These results demonstrate the potential of vertical structure estimation for extensive forests using FW LiDAR data and that the distinction between one-storied and two-storied forests can be clearly represented. This technique is expected to contribute to efficient and effective management of forests based on accurate information derived from the proposed method.

AB  - Entering the 5G and internet of things (IoT) era, human–machine interfaces (HMIs) capable of providing humans with more intuitive interaction with the digitalized world have experienced a flourishing development in the past few years. Although the advanced sensing techniques based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) or microelectromechanical system (MEMS) solutions, e.g., camera, microphone, inertial measurement unit (IMU), etc., and flexible solutions, e.g., stretchable conductor, optical fiber, etc., have been widely utilized as sensing components for wearable/non-wearable HMIs development, the relatively high-power consumption of these sensors remains a concern, especially for wearable/portable scenarios. Recent progress on triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) self-powered sensors provides a new possibility for realizing low-power/self-sustainable HMIs by directly converting biomechanical energies into valuable sensory information. Leveraging the advantages of wide material choices and diversified structural design, TENGs have been successfully developed into various forms of HMIs, including glove, glasses, touchpad, exoskeleton, electronic skin, etc., for sundry applications, e.g., collaborative operation, personal healthcare, robot perception, smart home, etc. With the evolving artificial intelligence (AI) and haptic feedback technologies, more advanced HMIs could be realized towards intelligent and immersive human–machine interactions. Hence, in this review, we systematically introduce the current TENG HMIs in the aspects of different application scenarios, i.e., wearable, robot-related and smart home, and prospective future development enabled by the AI/haptic-feedback technology. Discussion on implementing self-sustainable/zero-power/passive HMIs in this 5G/IoT era and our perspectives are also provided.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - As the world population and its dependency on energy is growing exponentially day by day, the existing energy generating resources are not enough to fulfill their needs. In the conventional grid system, most of the generated energy is wasted because of improper demand side management (DSM). This leads to a difficulty in keeping the equilibrium between the user need and electric power production. To overcome these difficulties, smart grid (SG) is introduced, which is composed of the integration of two-way communication between the user and utility. To utilize the existing energy resources in a better way, SG is the best option since a large portion of the generated energy is consumed by the educational institutes. Such institutes also need un-interrupted power supply at the lowest cost. Therefore, in this paper, we have taken a university campus load. We have not only applied two bio-inspired heuristic algorithms for energy scheduling—namely, the Firefly Algorithm (FA) and the Lion Algorithm (LA)—but also proposed a hybrid version, FLA, for more optimal results. Our main objectives are a reduction in both, that is, the cost of energy and the waiting time of consumers or end users. For this purpose, in our proposed model, we have divided all appliances into two categories—shiftable appliances and non-shiftable appliances. Shiftable appliances are feasible to be used in any of the time slots and can be planned according to the day-ahead pricing signal (DAP), provided by the utility, while non-shiftable appliances can be used for a specified duration and cannot be planned with the respective DAP signal. So, we have scheduled shiftable appliances only. We have also used renewable energy sources (RES) for achieving maximum end user benefits. The simulation results show that our proposed hybrid algorithm, FLA, has reduced the cost excellently. We have also taken into consideration the consumers’ waiting times, due to scheduling of appliances.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have grown rapidly in recent years and are considered by both academia and industry to be key enablers for Industry 4.0. As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and human–robot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels. A route for AI-integration in multiscale/fidelity DTs with multiscale/fidelity data sources in Industry 4.0 is outlined.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The role of 5G-IoT has become indispensable in smart applications and it plays a crucial part in e-health applications. E-health applications require intelligent schemes and architectures to overcome the security threats against the sensitive data of patients. The information in e-healthcare applications is stored in the cloud which is vulnerable to security attacks. However, with deep learning techniques, these attacks can be detected, which needs hybrid models. In this article, a new deep learning model (CNN-DMA) is proposed to detect malware attacks based on a classifier—Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The model uses three layers, i.e., Dense, Dropout, and Flatten. Batch sizes of 64, 20 epoch, and 25 classes are used to train the network. An input image of 32 × 32 × 1 is used for the initial convolutional layer. Results are retrieved on the Malimg dataset where 25 families of malware are fed as input and our model has detected is Alueron.gen!J malware. The proposed model CNN-DMA is 99% accurate and it is validated with state-of-the-art techniques.

AB  - Significant portions of European cities’ population are still exposed to levels of air pollution deemed harmful by the World Health Organization. Given the high impact of air pollution both on human health and the economy, numerous low-cost electrochemical sensor monitoring systems are being installed. The market is forced to develop new air quality monitoring systems to meet the needs of providing forecasting services based on advanced technologies and protocols that utilize certain characteristics such as high accuracy, real-time monitoring, daily and yearly statistics, data access from both experts and simple users with the use of low-cost equipment. In this study, conducted in Athens, Greece, a comparison is attempted between the findings from a low-cost electrochemical sensor device and those of a static, fixed site measurement monitoring station; this comparison is based on the data quality and Air Quality Index (AQI) concerning data accuracy and quality on adverse health effects due to air pollution. With regard to the prediction of different AQI intervals, TPR ranges from 35.2% up to 100.0%, FPR from 0.0% up to 36.1% and FNR from 0.0% up to 38.1%. The outcome of this study reveals flexible and affordable alternatives adopted during the evaluation and calibration of low-cost gas sensors for monitoring.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 8
IS  - 10
SN  - 2076-3298

AB  - In this study, a mobile air pollution sensing unit based on the Internet of Things framework was designed for monitoring the concentration of fine particulate matter in three urban areas. This unit was developed using the NodeMCU-32S microcontroller, PMS5003-G5 (particulate matter sensing module), and Ublox NEO-6M V2 (GPS positioning module). The sensing unit transmits data of the particulate matter concentration and coordinates of a polluted location to the backend server through 3G and 4G telecommunication networks for data collection. This system will complement the government’s PM2.5 data acquisition system. Mobile monitoring stations meet the air pollution monitoring needs of some areas that require special observation. For example, an AIoT development system will be installed. At intersections with intensive traffic, it can be used as a reference for government transportation departments or environmental inspection departments for environmental quality monitoring or evacuation of traffic flow. Furthermore, the particulate matter distributions in three areas, namely Xinzhuang, Sanchong, and Luzhou Districts, which are all in New Taipei City of Taiwan, were estimated using machine learning models, the data of stationary monitoring stations, and the measurements of the mobile sensing system proposed in this study. Four types of learning models were trained, namely the decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and radial basis function neural network, and their prediction results were evaluated. The root mean square error was used as the performance indicator, and the learning results indicate that the random forest model outperforms the other models for both the training and testing sets. To examine the generalizability of the learning models, the models were verified in relation to data measured on three days: 15 February, 28 February, and 1 March 2019. A comparison between the model predicted and the measured data indicates that the random forest model provides the most stable and accurate prediction values and could clearly present the distribution of highly polluted areas. The results of these models are visualized in the form of maps by using a web application. The maps allow users to understand the distribution of polluted areas intuitively.

TI  - A Meta-Modeling Power Consumption Forecasting Approach Combining Client Similarity and Causality
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 19
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Power forecasting models offer valuable insights on the electricity consumption patterns of clients, enabling the development of advanced strategies and applications aimed at energy saving, increased energy efficiency, and smart energy pricing. The data collection process for client consumption models is not always ideal and the resulting datasets often lead to compromises in the implementation of forecasting models, as well as suboptimal performance, due to several challenges. Therefore, combinations of elements that highlight relationships between clients need to be investigated in order to achieve more accurate consumption predictions. In this study, we exploited the combined effects of client similarity and causality, and developed a power consumption forecasting model that utilizes ensembles of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Our novel approach enables the derivation of different representations of the predicted consumption based on feature sets influenced by similarity and causality metrics. The resulting representations were used to train a meta-model, based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), in order to combine the results of the LSTM ensembles optimally. This combinatorial approach achieved better overall performance and yielded lower mean absolute percentage error when compared to the standalone LSTM ensembles that do not include similarity and causality. Additional experiments indicated that the combination of similarity and causality resulted in more performant models when compared to implementations utilizing only one element on the same model structure.

We survey the last decade of experimentation and research in the field of mobile CrowdSensing, a paradigm centred on users’ devices as the primary source for collecting data from urban areas. To this purpose, we report the methodologies aimed at building information about users’ mobility and sociality in the form of ties among users and communities of users. We present two methodologies to identify communities: spatial and co-location-based. We also discuss some perspectives about the future of mobile CrowdSensing and its impact on four investigation areas: contact tracing, edge-based MCS architectures, digitalization in Industry 5.0 and community detection algorithms.

AB  - This paper surveys the deep learning (DL) approaches for intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) in Internet of Things (IoT) and the associated datasets toward identifying gaps, weaknesses, and a neutral reference architecture. A comparative study of IDSs is provided, with a review of anomaly-based IDSs on DL approaches, which include supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid methods. All techniques in these three categories have essentially been used in IoT environments. To date, only a few have been used in the anomaly-based IDS for IoT. For each of these anomaly-based IDSs, the implementation of the four categories of feature(s) extraction, classification, prediction, and regression were evaluated. We studied important performance metrics and benchmark detection rates, including the requisite efficiency of the various methods. Four machine learning algorithms were evaluated for classification purposes: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Therefore, we compared each via the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The study model exhibits promising outcomes for all classes of attacks. The scope of our analysis examines attacks targeting the IoT ecosystem using empirically based, simulation-generated datasets (namely the Bot-IoT and the IoTID20 datasets).

AB  - Urban traffic congestion has a significant detrimental impact on the environment, public health and the economy, with at a high cost to society worldwide. Moreover, it is not possible to continually modify urban road infrastructure in order to mitigate increasing traffic demand. Therefore, it is important to develop traffic control models that can handle high-volume traffic data and synchronize traffic lights in an urban network in real time, without interfering with other initiatives. Within this context, this study proposes a model, based on deep reinforcement learning, for synchronizing the traffic signals of an urban traffic network composed of two intersections. The calibration of this model, including training of its neural network, was performed using real traffic data collected at the approach to each intersection. The results achieved through simulations were very promising, yielding significant improvements in indicators measured in relation to the pre-existing conditions in the network. The model was able to deal with a broad spectrum of traffic flows and, in peak demand periods, reduced delays and queue lengths by more than 28% and 42%, respectively.

TI  - Comparative Traffic Flow Prediction of a Heuristic ANN Model and a Hybrid ANN-PSO Model in the Traffic Flow Modelling of Vehicles at a Four-Way Signalized Road Intersection

VL  - 13

AB  - The accurate and effective prediction of the traffic flow of vehicles plays a significant role in the construction and planning of signalized road intersections. The application of artificially intelligent predictive models in the prediction of the performance of traffic flow has yielded positive results. However, much uncertainty still exists in the determination of which artificial intelligence methods effectively resolve traffic congestion issues, especially from the perspective of the traffic flow of vehicles at a four-way signalized road intersection. A hybrid algorithm, an artificial neural network trained by a particle swarm optimization model (ANN-PSO), and a heuristic Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) were compared in the prediction of the flow of traffic of vehicles using the South Africa transportation system as a case study. Two hundred and fifty-nine (259) traffic datasets were obtained from the South African road network using inductive loop detectors, video cameras, and GPS-controlled equipment. For the ANN and ANN-PSO training and testing, 219 traffic data were used for the training, and 40 were used for the testing of the ANN-PSO model, while training (160), testing (40), and validation (59) was used for the ANN. The ANN result presented a logistic sigmoid transfer function with a 13–6–1 model and a testing R2 of 0.99169 compared to the ANN-PSO result, which showed a testing performance of R2 0.99710. This result shows that the ANN-PSO model is more efficient and effective than the ANN model in the prediction of the traffic flow of vehicles at a four-way signalized road intersection. Furthermore, the ANN and ANN-PSO models are robust enough to predict traffic flow due to their better testing performance. The modelling approaches proposed in this study will assist transportation engineers and urban planners in designing a traffic control system for traffic lights at four-way signalized road intersections. Finally, the results of this research will assist transportation engineers and traffic controllers in providing traffic flow information and travel guidance for motorists and pedestrians in the optimization of their travel time decision-making.

TI  - 3DLEB-Net: Label-Efficient Deep Learning-Based Semantic Segmentation of Building Point Clouds at LoD3 Level
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 19
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In current research, fully supervised Deep Learning (DL) techniques are employed to train a segmentation network to be applied to point clouds of buildings. However, training such networks requires large amounts of fine-labeled buildings’ point-cloud data, presenting a major challenge in practice because they are difficult to obtain. Consequently, the application of fully supervised DL for semantic segmentation of buildings’ point clouds at LoD3 level is severely limited. In order to reduce the number of required annotated labels, we proposed a novel label-efficient DL network that obtains per-point semantic labels of LoD3 buildings’ point clouds with limited supervision, named 3DLEB-Net. In general, it consists of two steps. The first step (Autoencoder, AE) is composed of a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) encoder and a folding-based decoder. It is designed to extract discriminative global and local features from input point clouds by faithfully reconstructing them without any label. The second step is the semantic segmentation network. By supplying a small amount of task-specific supervision, a segmentation network is proposed for semantically segmenting the encoded features acquired from the pre-trained AE. Experimentally, we evaluated our approach based on the Architectural Cultural Heritage (ArCH) dataset. Compared to the fully supervised DL methods, we found that our model achieved state-of-the-art results on the unseen scenes, with only 10% of labeled training data from fully supervised methods as input. Moreover, we conducted a series of ablation studies to show the effectiveness of the design choices of our model.

AB  - Real-time health monitoring of civil infrastructures is performed to maintain their structural integrity, sustainability, and serviceability for a longer time. With smart electronics and packaging technology, large amounts of complex monitoring data are generated, requiring sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for their processing. With the advancement of technology, more complex AI models have been applied, from simple models to sophisticated deep learning (DL) models, for structural health monitoring (SHM). In this article, a comprehensive review is performed, primarily on the applications of AI models for SHM to maintain the sustainability of diverse civil infrastructures. Three smart data capturing methods of SHM, namely, camera-based, smartphone-based, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based methods, are also discussed, having made the utilization of intelligent paradigms easier. UAV is found to be the most promising smart data acquisition technology, whereas convolution neural networks are the most impressive DL model reported for SHM. Furthermore, current challenges and future perspectives of AI-based SHM systems are also described separately. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city concepts are explained to elaborate on the contributions of intelligent SHM systems. The integration of SHM with IoT and cloud-based computing is leading us towards the evolution of future smart cities.

AB  - In this paper, comprehensive mPoint, a method for generating 3D (range, azimuth, and elevation) point cloud of human targets using a Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) signal and Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) millimeter wave radar is proposed. Distinct from the TI-mPoint method proposed by TI technology, a comprehensive mPoint method considering both the static and dynamic characteristics of radar reflected signals is utilized to generate a high precision point cloud, resulting in more comprehensive information of the target being detected. The radar possessing 60&ndash;64 GHz FMCW signal with two sets of different dimensional antennas is utilized in order to experimentally verify the results of the methodology. By using the proposed process, the point cloud data of human targets can be obtained based on six different postures of the underlying human body. The human posture cube and point cloud accuracy rates are defined in the paper in order to quantitively and qualitatively evaluate the quality of the generated point cloud. Benefitting from the proposed comprehensive mPoint, evidence shows that the point number and the accuracy rate of the generated point cloud compared with those from the popular TI-mPoint can be largely increased by 86% and 42%, respectively. In addition, the noise level of multipath reflection can be effectively reduced. Moreover, the length of the algorithm running time is only 1.6% longer than that of the previous method as a slight tradeoff.

AB  - In the era of big data, mass customization (MC) systems are faced with the complexities associated with information explosion and management control. Thus, it has become necessary to integrate the mass customization system and Social Internet of Things, in order to effectively connecting customers with enterprises. We should not only allow customers to participate in MC production throughout the whole process, but also allow enterprises to control all links throughout the whole information system. To gain a better understanding, this paper first describes the architecture of the proposed system from organizational and technological perspectives. Then, based on the nature of the Social Internet of Things, the main technological application of the mass customization–Social Internet of Things (MC–SIOT) system is introduced in detail. On this basis, the key problems faced by the mass customization–Social Internet of Things system are listed. Our findings are as follows: (1) MC–SIOT can realize convenient information queries and clearly understand the user’s intentions; (2) the system can predict the changing relationships among different technical fields and help enterprise R&amp;D personnel to find technical knowledge; and (3) it can interconnect deep learning technology and digital twin technology to better maintain the operational state of the system. However, there exist some challenges relating to data management, knowledge discovery, and human–computer interaction, such as data quality management, few data samples, a lack of dynamic learning, labor consumption, and task scheduling. Therefore, we put forward possible improvements to be assessed, as well as privacy issues and emotional interactions to be further discussed, in future research. Finally, we illustrate the behavior and evolutionary mechanism of this system, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This provides some idea of how to address the current issues pertaining to mass customization systems.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In modern times, ensuring social security has become the prime concern for security administrators. The widespread and recurrent use of social media sites is creating a huge risk for the lives of the general people, as these sites are frequently becoming potential sources of the organization of various types of immoral events. For protecting society from these dangers, a prior detection system which can effectively detect events by analyzing these social media data is essential. However, automating the process of event detection has been difficult, as existing processes must account for diverse writing styles, languages, dialects, post lengths, and et cetera. To overcome these difficulties, we developed an effective model for detecting events, which, for our purposes, were classified as either protesting, celebrating, religious, or neutral, using Bengali and Banglish Facebook posts. At first, the collected posts’ text were processed for language detection, and then, detected posts were pre-processed using stopwords removal and tokenization. Features were then extracted from these pre-processed texts using three sub-processes: filtering, phrase matching of specific events, and sentiment analysis. The collected features were ultimately used to train our Bernoulli Naive Bayes classification model, which was capable of detecting events with 90.41% accuracy (for Bengali-language posts) and 70% (for the Banglish-form posts). For evaluating the effectiveness of our proposed model more precisely, we compared it with two other classifiers: Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree.

More than 110 publications from top journals and conferences written in English were reviewed, and each of the research selected was fully examined to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach used, the dataset, and accuracy obtained. Results of the studies analyzed show that, in general, the process of time signature estimation is a difficult one. However, the success of this research area could be an added advantage in a broader area of music genre classification using deep learning techniques. Suggestions for improved estimates and future research projects are also discussed.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The design and development of wind turbines in low-wind-speed areas involves several technical and financial challenges related to maximizing conversion efficiency and minimizing cost. Unfortunately, much of the African continent is dominated by low-wind-speed resources. In this study, a multi-parameter optimization method is used to explore the design of a novel Ferris wheel wind turbine (FWT) technology, which has an 800-kW generation capability. We used the tip speed ratio, lift-to-drag ratio and power coefficient to determine the optimal efficiency by varying the number of blades and rim diameters. The capital cost estimates, as affected by rim diameter and the number of blades, are presented. This paper studies FWTs at their rated wind speeds because wind turbines have their maximum performance at the rated wind speeds, and this allows one to observe the effects of changing the rim diameter and the number of blades without the need to consider the location of the turbine. The results show that reducing the number of spokes by half (from 64 to 32) on the four rim diameters studied decreases the efficiency by less than 0.19%, while reducing the acquisition cost by 42%, installation cost by 42% and mass by 28%. Reducing the number of spokes to a quarter (i.e., from 32 to 16) decreases the efficiency by less than 0.31%, reduces the acquisition and installation costs by 36% and 35.5%, respectively, and the mass by 19.2%, of the four rim diameters studied. The reduction of the number of blades has a significant effect on the efficiency and capital cost with varying rim diameters. This paper shows the potential for Ferris-wheel-based wind turbines for low-wind-speed conditions, such as those that prevail in parts of Africa.

AB  - Water wave monitoring is a vital issue for coastal research and plays a key role in geomorphological changes, erosion and sediment transportation, coastal hazards, risk assessment, and decision making. However, despite missing data and the difficulty of capturing the data of nearshore fieldwork, the analysis of water wave surface parameters is still able to be discussed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for accurate detection and analysis of water wave surface from Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB) large-scale point clouds data. In our proposed method we combined the modified Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method with a connectivity constraint and a multi-level analysis of ocean water surface. We adapted for most types of wave shape anatomies in shallow waters, nearshore, and onshore of the coastal zone. We used a wavelet analysis filter to detect the water wave surface. Then, through the Fourier Transformation Approach, we estimated the parameters of wave height, wavelength, and wave orientation. The comparison between the LiDAR measure estimation technique and available buoy data was then presented. We quantified the performance of the algorithm by measuring the precision and recall for the waves identification without evaluating the degree of over-segmentation. The proposed method achieves 87% accuracy of wave identification in the shallow water of coastal zones.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Decision Support System Based on Artificial Neural Networks to Predict the Commercialization Time by the Evolution of Peach Quality

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Climacteric fruit such as peaches are stored in cold chambers after harvest and usually are maintained there until the desired ripening is reached to direct these fruit to market. Producers, food industries and or traders have difficulties in defining the period when fruit are at the highest level of quality desired by consumers in terms of the physical-chemical parameters (hardness –H–, soluble solids content –SSC–, and acidity –Ac–). The evolution of peach quality in terms of these parameters depends directly on storage temperature –T– and relative humidity –RH–, as well on the storage duration –t–. This paper describes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Decision Support System (DSS) designed to predict the evolution of the quality of peaches, namely the storage time required before commercialization as well as the late commercialization time. The peaches quality is stated in terms of the values of SSC, H and Ac that consumers most like for the storage T and RH. An Artificial neuronal network (ANN) is proposed to provide this prediction. The training and validation of the ANN were conducted with experimental data acquired in three different farmers’ cold storage facilities. A user interface was developed to provide an expedited and simple prediction of the marketable time of peaches, considering the storage temperature, relative humidity, and initial physical and chemical parameters. This AI DSS may help the vegetable sector (logistics and retailers), especially smaller neighborhood grocery stores, define the marketable period of fruit. It will contribute with advantages and benefits for all parties—producers, traders, retailers, and consumers—by being able to provide fruit at the highest quality and reducing waste in the process. In this sense, the ANN DSS proposed in this study contributes to new AI-based solutions for smart cities.

AB  - To assess critically the scientific literature is a very challenging task; in general it requires analysing a lot of documents to define the state-of-the-art of a research field and classifying them. The documents classifier systems have tried to address this problem by different techniques such as probabilistic, machine learning and neural networks models. One of the most popular document classification approaches is the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), a probabilistic topic model. One of the main issues of the LDA approach is that the retrieved topics are a collection of terms with their probabilities and it does not have a human-readable form. This paper defines an approach to make LDA topics comprehensible for humans by the exploitation of the Word2Vec approach.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Along with the rapid development of sensing systems and wireless transmission technology, the scope of application of the IoT has substantially increased, and research and innovation that integrate artificial intelligence. This study integrated civil engineering and electrical engineering to establish a universal and modularized long-term sensing system. Aiming at positive construction in civil engineering, the campus of National Taipei University of Technology was used as the experimental site as a green campus. This paper focused on the cooling effect of the green roof and the temperature difference of the solar panel to effectively isolate the direct sunlight on the roof of the building. To achieve long-term monitoring, energy consumption must be minimized. Considering that the distance between sensor nodes in the experimental site was over dozens of feet, LoRa transmission technology was selected for data transmission. LoRa only consumes a small amount of energy during data transmission, and it can freely switch between work modes, achieving optimal power utilization efficiency. The greening-related research results indicated that the shade from solar panels on the rooftop could effectively reduce the temperature increase caused by direct sunlight on concrete surfaces. The temperature reduction effect was positively correlated with whether the solar panels provided shade. After 1 week of monitoring, we observed that having plants on the rooftop for greening negatively correlated with temperature reduction efficiency. Permeable pavement on the ground was positively correlated with temperature reduction efficiency. However, its temperature reduction efficiency was inferior to that of solar panel shading. The temperature difference between high-rise buildings and the ground was approximately 1–2 °C. At the same elevation, the temperature difference between buildings with and without greening was approximately 0.8 °C. Regarding the sensing system designed for this site, both hardware and software could be flexibly set according to the research purposes, precision requirements of the sites, and the measurement scope, thereby enabling their application in more fields.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Ambient Intelligence (AmI) encompasses technological infrastructures capable of sensing data from environments and extracting high-level knowledge to detect or recognize users’ features and actions, as well as entities or events in their surroundings. Visual perception, particularly object detection, has become one of the most relevant enabling factors for this context-aware user-centered intelligence, being the cornerstone of relevant but complex tasks, such as object tracking or human action recognition. In this context, convolutional neural networks have proven to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy levels. However, they typically result in large and highly complex models that typically demand computation offloading onto remote cloud platforms. Such an approach has security- and latency-related limitations and may not be appropriate for some AmI use cases where the system response time must be as short as possible, and data privacy must be guaranteed. In the last few years, the on-device paradigm has emerged in response to those limitations, yielding more compact and efficient neural networks able to address inference directly on client machines, thus providing users with a smoother and better-tailored experience, with no need of sharing their data with an outsourced service. Framed in that novel paradigm, this work presents a review of the recent advances made along those lines in object detection, providing a comprehensive study of the most relevant lightweight CNN-based detection frameworks, discussing the most paradigmatic AmI domains where such an approach has been successfully applied, the different challenges arisen, the key strategies and techniques adopted to create visual solutions for image-based object classification and localization, as well as the most relevant factors to bear in mind when assessing or comparing those techniques, such as the evaluation metrics or the hardware setups used.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The advancements in sensor and communication technologies drive the rapid developments in the applications of occupancy and indoor environmental monitoring in buildings. Currently, the installation standards for sensors are scarce and the recommendations for sensor positionings are very general. However, inadequate sensor positioning might diminish the reliability of sensor data, which could have serious impacts on the intended applications such as the performance of demand-controlled HVAC systems and their energy use. Thus, there is a need to understand how sensor positioning may affect the sensor data, specifically when using multi-sensor devices in which several sensors are being bundled together. This study is based on the data collected from 18 multi-sensor devices installed in three single-occupant offices (six sensors in each office). Each multi-sensor device included sensors to measure passive infrared (PIR) radiation, temperature, CO2, humidity, and illuminance. The results show that the positions of PIR and CO2 sensors significantly affect the reliability of occupancy detection. The typical approach of positioning the sensors on the ceiling, in the middle of offices, may lead to relatively unreliable data. In this case, the PIR sensor in that position has only 60% accuracy of presence detection. Installing the sensors under office desks could increase the accuracy of presence detection to 84%. These two sensor positions are highlighted in sensor fusion analysis as they could reach the highest accuracy compared to other pairs of PIR sensors. Moreover, sensor positioning can affect various indoor environmental parameters, especially temperature and illuminance measurements.

AB  - With the emergence of fog and edge computing, new possibilities arise regarding the data-driven management of citizens’ mobility in smart cities. Internet of Things (IoT) analytics refers to the use of these technologies, data, and analytical models to describe the current status of the city traffic, to predict its evolution over the coming hours, and to make decisions that increase the efficiency of the transportation system. It involves many challenges such as how to deal and manage real and huge amounts of data, and improving security, privacy, scalability, reliability, and quality of services in the cloud and vehicular network. In this paper, we review the state of the art of IoT in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), identify challenges posed by cloud, fog, and edge computing in ITS, and develop a methodology based on agile optimization algorithms for solving a dynamic ride-sharing problem (DRSP) in the context of edge/fog computing. These algorithms allow us to process, in real time, the data gathered from IoT systems in order to optimize automatic decisions in the city transportation system, including: optimizing the vehicle routing, recommending customized transportation modes to the citizens, generating efficient ride-sharing and car-sharing strategies, create optimal charging station for electric vehicles and different services within urban and interurban areas. A numerical example considering a DRSP is provided, in which the potential of employing edge/fog computing, open data, and agile algorithms is illustrated.

AB  - Phishing detection with high-performance accuracy and low computational complexity has always been a topic of great interest. New technologies have been developed to improve the phishing detection rate and reduce computational constraints in recent years. However, one solution is insufficient to address all problems caused by attackers in cyberspace. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of various deep learning algorithms in detecting phishing activities. This analysis will help organizations or individuals select and adopt the proper solution according to their technological needs and specific applications’ requirements to fight against phishing attacks. In this regard, an empirical study was conducted using four different deep learning algorithms, including deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). To analyze the behaviors of these deep learning architectures, extensive experiments were carried out to examine the impact of parameter tuning on the performance accuracy of the deep learning models. In addition, various performance metrics were measured to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of DL models in detecting phishing activities. The results obtained from the experiments showed that no single DL algorithm achieved the best measures across all performance metrics. The empirical findings from this paper also manifest several issues and suggest future research directions related to deep learning in the phishing detection domain.

AB  - Today, the issue of economic circularity is certainly not a new concept. It represents an essential issue in any production system since it is an alternative to the current production and consumption model. The importance of the topic is confirmed worldwide. However, there is still a “circularity gap” that can be bridged in the short and medium term, probably with the use of innovative and digital technologies. In fact, many researchers agree that the sustainable future can be achieved in the long term thanks to digital technologies (i.e., IoT, artificial intelligence, quantum computing etc.) which, thanks to their speed of calculation, are able to identify the right solutions at the right time. The challenge, therefore, will be to develop innovative technologies and tools for the efficient use of resources in industries for sustainable production. Thus, the aim of this study is to define the current state of the art and future research developments in this very promising field. To achieve this goal, the integration of a “set” of tools, based on the AHP method and the PRISMA protocol, is proposed. The results aim to be a guideline for decision makers and researchers interested in this topic.

AB  - Recently, researchers have realized a number of achievements involving deep-learning-based neural networks for the tasks of segmentation and detection based on 2D images, 3D point clouds, etc. Using 2D and 3D information fusion for the advantages of compensation and accuracy improvement has become a hot research topic. However, there are no critical reviews focusing on the fusion strategies of 2D and 3D information integration based on various data for segmentation and detection, which are the basic tasks of computer vision. To boost the development of this research domain, the existing representative fusion strategies are collected, introduced, categorized, and summarized in this paper. In addition, the general structures of different kinds of fusion strategies were firstly abstracted and categorized, which may inspire researchers. Moreover, according to the methods included in this paper, the 2D information and 3D information of different methods come from various kinds of data. Furthermore, suitable datasets are introduced and comparatively summarized to support the relative research. Last but not least, we put forward some open challenges and promising directions for future research.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 20
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Accurate and timely wind power forecasting is essential for achieving large-scale wind power grid integration and ensuring the safe and stable operation of the power system. For overcoming the inaccuracy of wind power forecasting caused by randomness and volatility, this study proposes a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) model (GA–PSO–CNN) integrating genetic algorithm (GA) and a particle swarm optimization (PSO). The model can establish feature maps between factors affecting wind power such as wind speed, wind direction, and temperature. Moreover, a mix-encoding GA–PSO algorithm is introduced to optimize the network hyperparameters and weights collaboratively, which solves the problem of subjective determination of the optimal network in the CNN and effectively prevents local optimization in the training process. The prediction effectiveness of the proposed model is verified using data from a wind farm in Ningxia, China. The results show that the MAE, MSE, and MAPE of the proposed GA–PSO–CNN model decreased by 1.13–9.55%, 0.46–7.98%, and 3.28–19.29%, respectively, in different seasons, compared with Single–CNN, PSO–CNN, ISSO–CNN, and CHACNN models. The convolution kernel size and number in each convolution layer were reduced by 5–18.4% in the GA–PSO–CNN model.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 20
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the search for increased productivity and efficiency in the industrial sector, a new industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0, was promoted. In the electric sector, power plants seek to adapt these new concepts to optimize electric power generation processes, as well as to reduce operating costs and unscheduled downtime intervals. In these plants, PID control strategies are commonly used in water cooling systems, which use fans to perform the thermal exchange between water and the ambient air. However, as the nonlinearities of these systems affect the performance of the drivers, sometimes a greater number of fans than necessary are activated to ensure water temperature control which, consequently, increases energy expenditure. In this work, our objective is to develop digital twins for a water cooling system with auxiliary equipment, in terms of the decision making of the operator, to determine the correct number of fans. This model was developed based on the algorithm of automatic extraction of fuzzy rules, derived from the SCADA of a power plant located in the capital of Paraíba, Brazil. The digital twins can update the fuzzy rules in the case of new events, such as steady-state operation, starting and stopping ramps, and instability. The results from experimental tests using data from 11 h of plant operations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed digital twin model. Furthermore, in all scenarios, the average percentage error was less than 5% and the average absolute temperature error was below 3 °C.

AB  - In the last few years, jargon, such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), have been ubiquitous in both popular science media as well as the academic literature. Many industries have tried the current suite of ML and AI algorithms with various degrees of success. Mineral processing, as an industry, is looking at AI for two reasons. First of all, as with other industries, it is pertinent to know if AI algorithms can be used to enhance productivity. The second reason is specific to the mining industry. Of late, the grade of ores is reducing, and the demand for ethical mining (with as little effect on ecology as possible) is increasing. Thus, mineral processing industries also want to explore the possible use of AI in solving these challenges. In this review paper, first, the challenges in mineral processing that can potentially be solved by AI are presented. Then, some of the most pertinent developments in the domain of ML and AI (applied in the domain of mineral processing) are discussed. Lastly, a top-level modus operandi is presented for a mineral processing industry that might want to explore the possibilities of using AI in its processes. Following are some of the new paradigms added by this review. This review presents a holistic view of the domain of mineral processing with an AI lens. It is also one of the first reviews in this domain to thoroughly discuss the use of AI in ethical, green, and sustainable mineral processing. The AI process proposed in this paper is a comprehensive one. To ensure the relevance to industry, the flow was made agile with the spiral system engineering flow. This is expected to drive rapid and agile investigation of the potential of applying ML and AI in different mineral processing industries.

AB  - This article has reviewed international research, up to the first half of 2021, focused on sustainability, big data and the mathematical techniques used for its analysis. In addition, a study of the spatial component (city, region, nation and beyond) of the works has been carried out and an analysis has been made of which Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have received the most attention. A bibliometric analysis and a fractal cluster analysis were performed on the papers published in the Web of Science. The results show a continuous increase in the number of published articles and citations over the whole period, demonstrating a growing interest in this topic. China, the United States and India are the most productive countries and there are more papers at the regional level. It has been found that the environmental dimension is the most studied and the least studied is the social dimension. The mathematical techniques used in the empirical work are mainly regression analysis, neural networks and multi-criteria decision methods. SDG9 and SDG11 are the most worked on. The trend shows a convergence in recent years towards big data applied to supply chains, Industry 4.0 and the achievement of sustainable cities.

AB  - With growing evidence of deep learning-assisted smart process planning, there is an essential demand for comprehending whether cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) are adequate in managing complexity and flexibility, configuring the smart factory. In this research, prior findings were cumulated indicating that the interoperability between Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics and cyber-physical process monitoring systems can decide upon the progression of operations advancing a system to the intended state in CPPSs. We carried out a quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science throughout March and August 2021, with search terms including “cyber-physical production systems”, “cyber-physical manufacturing systems”, “smart process manufacturing”, “smart industrial manufacturing processes”, “networked manufacturing systems”, “industrial cyber-physical systems,” “smart industrial production processes”, and “sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing systems”. As we analyzed research published between 2017 and 2021, only 489 papers met the eligibility criteria. By removing controversial or unclear findings (scanty/unimportant data), results unsupported by replication, undetailed content, or papers having quite similar titles, we decided on 164, chiefly empirical, sources. Subsequent analyses should develop on real-time sensor networks, so as to configure the importance of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics by use of cyber-physical production networks.

SN  - 2072-666X

AB  - Logic-in-memory (LIM) circuits based on the material implication logic (IMPLY) and resistive random access memory (RRAM) technologies are a candidate solution for the development of ultra-low power non-von Neumann computing architectures. Such architectures could enable the energy-efficient implementation of hardware accelerators for novel edge computing paradigms such as binarized neural networks (BNNs) which rely on the execution of logic operations. In this work, we present the multi-input IMPLY operation implemented on a recently developed smart IMPLY architecture, SIMPLY, which improves the circuit reliability, reduces energy consumption, and breaks the strict design trade-offs of conventional architectures. We show that the generalization of the typical logic schemes used in LIM circuits to multi-input operations strongly reduces the execution time of complex functions needed for BNNs inference tasks (e.g., the 1-bit Full Addition, XNOR, Popcount). The performance of four different RRAM technologies is compared using circuit simulations leveraging a physics-based RRAM compact model. The proposed solution approaches the performance of its CMOS equivalent while bypassing the von Neumann bottleneck, which gives a huge improvement in bit error rate (by a factor of at least 108) and energy-delay product (projected up to a factor of 1010).

This review aims to show the current and future trends of UAV applications in weed detection in the crop field. This study systematically searched the original articles published from 1 January 2016 to 18 June 2021 in the databases of Scopus, ScienceDirect, Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux (CAB) Direct, and Web of Science (WoS) using Boolean string: “weed” AND “Unmanned Aerial Vehicle” OR “UAV” OR “drone”. Out of the papers identified, 144 eligible studies did meet our inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Most of the studies (i.e., 27.42%) on weed detection were carried out during the seedling stage of the growing cycle for the crop. Most of the weed images were captured using red, green, and blue (RGB) camera, i.e., 48.28% and main classification algorithm was machine learning techniques, i.e., 47.90%. This review initially highlighted articles from the literature that includes the crops’ typical phenology stage, reference data, type of sensor/camera, classification methods, and current UAV applications in detecting and mapping weed for different types of crop. This study then provides an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of each sensor and algorithm and tries to identify research gaps by providing a brief outlook at the potential areas of research concerning the benefit of this technology in agricultural industries. Integrated weed management, coupled with UAV application improves weed monitoring in a more efficient and environmentally-friendly way. Overall, this review demonstrates the scientific information required to achieve sustainable weed management, so as to implement UAV platform in the real agricultural contexts.

AB  - The recommendation algorithm is a very important and challenging issue for a personal recommender system. The collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm is one of the most popular and effective recommendation algorithms. However, the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm does not fully consider the impact of popular items and user characteristics on the recommendation results. To solve these problems, an improved collaborative filtering algorithm is proposed, which is based on the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method and user characteristics. In the proposed algorithm, an improved TF-IDF method is used to calculate the user similarity on the basis of rating data first. Secondly, the multi-dimensional characteristics information of users is used to calculate the user similarity by a fuzzy membership method. Then, the above two user similarities are fused based on an adaptive weighted algorithm. Finally, some experiments are conducted on the movie public data set, and the experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than that of the state of the art.

TI  - A Spatio-Temporal Schedule-Based Neural Network for Urban Taxi Waiting Time Prediction

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Taxi waiting times is an important criterion for taxi passengers to choose appropriate pick-up locations in urban environments. How to predict the taxi waiting time accurately at a certain time and location is the key solution for the imbalance between the taxis’ supplies and demands. Considering the life schedule of urban residents and the different functions of geogrid regions, the research developed in this paper introduces a spatio-temporal schedule-based neural network for urban taxi waiting time prediction. The approach integrates a series of multi-source data from taxi trajectories to city points of interest, different time frames and human behaviors in the city. We apply a grid-based and functional structuration of an urban space that provides a lower-level data representation. Overall, the neural network model can dynamically predict the waiting time of taxi passengers in real time under some given spatio-temporal constraints. The experimental results show that the granular-based grids and spatio-temporal neural network can effectively predict and optimize the accuracy of taxi waiting times. This work provides a decision support for intelligent travel predictions of taxi waiting time in a smart city.

AB  - Artificial neural networks (ANN) exhibit excellent performance in complex problems and have been increasingly applied in the research field of construction management (CM) over the last few decades. However, few papers draw up a systematic review to evaluate the state-of-the-art research on ANN in CM. In this paper, content analysis is performed to comprehensively analyze 112 related bibliographic records retrieved from seven selected top journals published between 2000 and 2020. The results indicate that the applications of ANN of interest in CM research have been significantly increasing since 2015. Back-propagation was the most widely used algorithm in training ANN. Integrated ANN with fuzzy logic/genetic algorithm was the most commonly employed way of addressing the CM problem. In addition, 11 application fields and 31 research topics were identified, with the primary research interests focusing on cost, performance, and safety. Lastly, challenges and future directions for ANN in CM were put forward from four main areas of input data, modeling, application fields, and emerging technologies. This paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the application of ANN in CM research and useful reference for the future.

VL  - 5
IS  - 4
SN  - 2504-2289

AB  - With the rapid development of 5G communications, enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine type communications and ultra-reliable low latency communications are widely supported. However, a 5G communication system is still based on Shannon’s information theory, while the meaning and value of information itself are not taken into account in the process of transmission. Therefore, it is difficult to meet the requirements of intelligence, customization, and value transmission of 6G networks. In order to solve the above challenges, we propose a 6G mailbox theory, namely a cognitive information carrier to enable distributed algorithm embedding for intelligence networking. Based on Mailbox, a 6G network will form an intelligent agent with self-organization, self-learning, self-adaptation, and continuous evolution capabilities. With the intelligent agent, redundant transmission of data can be reduced while the value transmission of information can be improved. Then, the features of mailbox principle are introduced, including polarity, traceability, dynamics, convergence, figurability, and dependence. Furthermore, key technologies with which value transmission of information can be realized are introduced, including knowledge graph, distributed learning, and blockchain. Finally, we establish a cognitive communication system assisted by deep learning. The experimental results show that, compared with a traditional communication system, our communication system performs less data transmission quantity and error.

AB  - Public transport has become one of the major transport options, especially when it comes to reducing motorized individual transport and achieving sustainability while reducing emissions, noise and so on. The use of public transport data has evolved and rapidly improved over the past decades. Indeed, the availability of data from different sources, coupled with advances in analytical and predictive approaches, has contributed to increased attention being paid to the exploitation of available data to improve public transport service. In this paper, we review the current state of the art of public transport data sources. More precisely, we summarize and analyze the potential and challenges of the main data sources. In addition, we show the complementary aspects of these data sources and how to merge them to broaden their contributions and face their challenges. This is complemented by an information management framework to enhance the use of data sources. Specifically, we seek to bridge the gap between traditional data sources and recent ones, present a unified overview of them and show how they can all leverage recent advances in data-driven methods and how they can help achieve a balance between transit service and passenger behavior.

AB  - The widespread use of mobile devices and sensors has motivated data-driven applications that can leverage the power of big data to benefit many aspects of our daily life, such as health, transportation, economy, and environment. Under the context of smart city, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), as a main building block of modern cities, and edge computing (EC), as an emerging computing service that targets addressing the limitations of cloud computing, have attracted increasing attention in the research community in recent years. It is well believed that the application of EC in ITS will have considerable benefits to transportation systems regarding efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Despite the growing trend in ITS and EC research, a big gap in the existing literature is identified: the intersection between these two promising directions has been far from well explored. In this paper, we focus on a critical part of ITS, i.e., sensing, and conducting a review on the recent advances in ITS sensing and EC applications in this field. The key challenges in ITS sensing and future directions with the integration of edge computing are discussed.

AB  - In recent years, the accident rate of urban rail transit PPP (public–private partnerships) project under construction has been relatively high, and the issue of security risks has attracted great attention from all walks of life. Therefore, it is necessary to identify, analyze, and evaluate the issue of security risks of the urban rail transit PPP project. This paper takes the PPP project of urban rail transit as the object. Through offline interviews and surveys and online questionnaires, this paper focuses on identifying and analyzing the risks brought by the introduction of PPP mode to the urban rail transit project and its action mechanism. The risk evaluation method based on Bayesian network model is studied, which is described from three dimensions: risk occurrence probability, risk reasoning, and risk sensitivity. Finally, an example of Xuzhou Metro Line 3 is given to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. This study provides a reference basis for relevant practitioners and promotes the healthy development of the industry.

AB  - This paper presents the application of simulation to assess and predict the influence of random factors of pedestrian flow and its continuity on the traffic capacity of a signal-controlled intersection during a right turn. The data were collected from the surveillance cameras of 25 signal-controlled intersections in the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia, and interpreted by a neural network. We considered the influence of both the intensity of the pedestrian flow and its continuity on the traffic capacity of a signal-controlled intersection in the stochastic approach, provided that the flow of vehicles is redundant. We used a reasonably minimized regression model as the basis for our intersection models. At the first stage, we obtained and tested a simulated continuous-stochastic intersection model that accounts for the dynamics of traffic flow. The second approach, due to the unpredictability of pedestrian flow, used a relevant method for analysing traffic flows based on the fuzzy logic theory. The second was also used as the foundation to build and graphically demonstrate a computer model in the fuzzy TECH suite for predictive visualization of the values of a traffic flow crossing a signal-controlled intersection. The results of this study can contribute to understanding the real conditions at a signal-controlled intersection and making grounded decisions on its focused control.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - High-resolution remote sensing image building target detection has wide application value in the fields of land planning, geographic monitoring, smart cities and other fields. However, due to the complex background of remote sensing imagery, some detailed features of building targets are less distinguishable from the background. When carrying out the detection task, it is prone to problems such as distortion and the missing of the building outline. To address this challenge, we developed a novel building target detection method. First, a building detection method based on rectangular approximation and region growth was proposed, and a saliency detection model based on the foreground compactness and local contrast of manifold ranking is used to obtain the saliency map of the building region. Then, the boundary prior saliency detection method based on the improved manifold ranking algorithm was proposed for the target area of buildings with low contrast with the background in remote sensing imagery. Finally, fusing the results of the rectangular approximation-based and saliency-based detection, the proposed fusion method improved the Recall and F1 value of building detection, indicating that this paper provides an effective and efficient high-resolution remote sensing image building target detection method.

AB  - In the context of hyper-connected cars and a growing heterogeneous digital ecosystem, we wish to make the most of the data available from the various sensors, devices and services that compose the ecosystem, in order to propose a proof of concept in-vehicle system that enhances the driving experience. We focus on improving the driving experience along three main directions, namely: (1) driving and trip planning, (2) health and well-being and (3) social and online activities. We approached the in-vehicle space as a smart interface to the intelligent driving environment. The digital data-producers in the ecosystem of the connected car are sources of raw data of various categories, such as data from the outside world, gathered from sensors or online services, data from the car itself and data from the driver gathered with various mobile and wearable devices, by means of observing his state and by means of his social media and online activity. Data is later processed into three information categories—driving, wellness, and social—and used to provide multi-modal interaction, namely visual, audio and gesture. The system is implemented to act in response to the trafficked information on different levels of autonomy, either in a reactive manner, by simple monitoring, or in a proactive manner. The system is designed to provide an in-vehicle system that assists the driver with planning the travel (Drive panel), by providing a comfortable environment for the driver while monitoring him (Wellness panel), and by adaptively managing interactions with their phone and the digital environment (Social panel). Heuristic evaluation of the system is performed, with respect to guidelines formulated for automated vehicles, and a SWOT analysis of the system is also presented in the paper.

AB  - This review describes a cloud-based intelligent power management system that uses analytics as a control signal and processes balance achievement pointer, and describes operator acknowledgments that must be shared quickly, accurately, and safely. The current study aims to introduce a conceptual and systematic structure with three main components: demand power (direct current (DC)-device), power mix between renewable energy (RE) and other power sources, and a cloud-based power optimization intelligent system. These methods and techniques monitor demand power (DC-device), load, and power mix between RE and other power sources. Cloud-based power optimization intelligent systems lead to an optimal power distribution solution that reduces power consumption or costs. Data has been collected from reliable sources such as Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed. The overall findings of these studies are visually explained in the proposed conceptual framework through the literature that are considered to be cloud computing based on storing and running the intelligent systems of power management and mixing.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper presents an enhanced PDR-BLE compensation mechanism for improving indoor localization, which is considerably resilient against variant uncertainties. The proposed method of ePDR-BLE compensation mechanism (EPBCM) takes advantage of the non-requirement of linearization of the system around its current state in an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and Kalman filter (KF) in smoothing of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values. In this paper, a fusion of conflicting information and the activity detection approach of an object in an indoor environment contemplates varying magnitude of accelerometer values based on the hidden Markov model (HMM). On the estimated orientation, the proposed approach remunerates the inadvertent body acceleration and magnetic distortion sensor data. Moreover, EPBCM can precisely calculate the velocity and position by reducing the position drift, which gives rise to a fault in zero-velocity and heading error. The developed EPBCM localization algorithm using Bluetooth low energy beacons (BLE) was applied and analyzed in an indoor environment. The experiments conducted in an indoor scenario shows the results of various activities performed by the object and achieves better orientation estimation, zero velocity measurements, and high position accuracy than other methods in the literature.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Cities are becoming increasingly complex to manage, as they increase in size and must provide higher living standards for their populations. New technology-based solutions must be developed towards attending this growth and ensuring that it is socially sustainable. This paper puts forward the notion that these solutions must share some properties: they should be anthropocentric, holistic, horizontal, multi-dimensional, multi-modal, and predictive. We propose an architecture in which streaming data sources that characterize the city context are used to feed a real-time graph of the city’s assets and states, as well as to train predictive models that hint into near future states of the city. This allows human decision-makers and automated services to take decisions, both for the present and for the future. To achieve this, multiple data sources about a city were gradually connected to a message broker, that enables increasingly rich decision-support. Results show that it is possible to predict future states of a city, in aspects such as traffic, air pollution, and other ambient variables. The key innovative aspect of this work is that, as opposed to the majority of existing approaches which focus on a real-time view of the city, we also provide insights into the near-future state of the city, thus allowing city services to plan ahead and adapt accordingly. The main goal is to optimize decision-making by anticipating future states of the city and make decisions accordingly.

AB  - Because cities worldwide have high population concentration, traffic congestion is a key problem that needs to be addressed. As modern technology advances, smart traffic management is able to collect data from the environment and uses a contextual signal assignment to determine the traffic flow at intersections and improve the traffic conditions. In this paper, we propose a green signal time allocation system based on a deep Q-network (DQN) that can maximize the capacity at intersections and assign the green light time according to the traffic conditions. The proposed system also aims to reduce the standard deviation of each lane at an intersection by considering the standard deviation of the waiting time. As a result, selfish green signal allocations can be reduced. Thus, the proposed system can achieve better experimental results in a dynamic environment than those of the green signal phase sequence allocation system.

AB  - Diverse forms of artificial intelligence (AI) are at the forefront of triggering digital security innovations based on the threats that are arising in this post-COVID world. On the one hand, companies are experiencing difficulty in dealing with security challenges with regard to a variety of issues ranging from system openness, decision making, quality control, and web domain, to mention a few. On the other hand, in the last decade, research has focused on security capabilities based on tools such as platform complacency, intelligent trees, modeling methods, and outage management systems in an effort to understand the interplay between AI and those issues. the dependence on the emergence of AI in running industries and shaping the education, transports, and health sectors is now well known in the literature. AI is increasingly employed in managing data security across economic sectors. Thus, a literature review of AI and system security within the current digital society is opportune. This paper aims at identifying research trends in the field through a systematic bibliometric literature review (LRSB) of research on AI and system security. the review entails 77 articles published in the Scopus® database, presenting up-to-date knowledge on the topic. the LRSB results were synthesized across current research subthemes. Findings are presented. the originality of the paper relies on its LRSB method, together with an extant review of articles that have not been categorized so far. Implications for future research are suggested.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) is playing a major role in smart cities to make a digital environment. Traffic congestion is a serious road issue because of an increasing number of vehicles in urban areas. Some crucial traffic problems include accidents and traffic jams that cause waste of fuel, health diseases, and a waste of time. Present traffic signaling systems are not efficient in resolving congestion problems because of the lack of traffic signals. Nowadays, traffic signaling systems are modeled with fixed time intervals in which no proper mechanism for emergency vehicles is available. Such traffic mechanisms failed to deal with traffic problems effectively. The major objective is to establish a robust traffic monitoring and signaling system that improves signal efficiency by providing a responsive scheme; appropriate routes; a mechanism for emergency vehicles and pedestrians in real-time using Vienna Development Method Specification Language (VDM-SL) formal method and graph theory. A formal model is constructed by considering objects, such as wireless sensors and cameras that are used for collecting information. Graph theory is used to represent the network and find appropriate routes. Unified Modeling Language is used to design the system requirements. The graph-based framework is converted into a formal model by using VDM-SL. The model has been validated and analyzed using many facilities available in the VDM-SL toolbox.

AB  - Sleep deficiency impacts the quality of life and may have serious health consequences in the long run. Questionnaire-based subjective assessment of sleep deficiency has many limitations. On the other hand, objective assessment of sleep deficiency is challenging. In this study, we propose a polysomnography-based mathematical model for computing baseline sleep deficiency severity score and then investigated the estimation of sleep deficiency severity using features available only from wearable sensor data including heart rate variability and single-channel electroencephalography for a dataset of 500 subjects. We used Monte-Carlo feature selection (MCFS) and inter-dependency discovery for selecting the best features and removing multi-collinearity. For developing the Regression model we investigated both the frequentist and the Bayesian approaches. An artificial neural network achieved the best performance of RMSE = 5.47 and an R-squared value of 0.67 for sleep deficiency severity estimation. The developed method is comparable to conventional methods of Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale for assessing the impact of sleep apnea on sleep deficiency. Moreover, the results pave the way for reliable and interpretable sleep deficiency severity estimation using single-channel EEG.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 21
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Predicting the travel demand plays an indispensable role in urban transportation planning. Data collection methods for estimating the origin–destination (OD) demand matrix are being extensively shifted from traditional survey techniques to the pre-collected data from intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). This shift is partly due to the high cost of conducting traditional surveys and partly due to the diversity of scattered data produced by ITSs and the opportunity to derive extra benefits out of this big data. This study attempts to predict the OD matrix of Tehran metropolis using a set of ITS data, including the data extracted from automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, smart fare cards, loop detectors at intersections, global positioning systems (GPS) of navigation software, socio-economic and demographic characteristics as well as land-use features of zones. For this purpose, five models based on machine learning (ML) techniques are developed for training and test. In evaluating the performance of the models, the statistical methods show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to the best performance in terms of accuracy in predicting the OD matrix and has the lowest error in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Moreover, the predicted OD matrix was structurally compared with the ground truth matrix, and the CNN model also shows the highest structural similarity with the ground truth OD matrix in the presented case.

AB  - The fast growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its diverse applications increase the risk of cyberattacks, one type of which is malware attacks. Due to the IoT devices’ different capabilities and the dynamic and ever-evolving environment, applying complex security measures is challenging, and applying only basic security standards is risky. Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are intrusion-detecting algorithms inspired by the human body’s adaptive immune system techniques. Most of these algorithms imitate the human’s body B-cell and T-cell defensive mechanisms. They are lightweight, adaptive, and able to detect malware attacks without prior knowledge. In this work, we review the recent advances in employing AIS for the improved detection of malware in IoT networks. We present a critical analysis that highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art in AIS research and offer insights into promising new research directions.

AB  - In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become an inseparable part of our lives. With the growing demand for Smart Applications, it becomes clear that IoT will bring regular automation and intelligent sensing to a new level thus improving quality of life. The core component of the IoT ecosystem is data which exists in various forms and formats. The collected data is then later used to create context awareness and make meaningful decisions. Besides an undoubtedly large number of advantages from the usage of IoT, there exist numerous challenges attributed to the security of objects that cannot be neglected for uninterrupted services. The Mirai botnet attack demonstrated that the IoT system is susceptible to different forms of cyberattacks. While advanced data analytics and Machine Learning have proved efficiency in various applications of cybersecurity, those still have not been explored enough in the literature from the applicability perspective in the domain of resource-constrained IoT. Several architectures and frameworks have been proposed for defining the ways for analyzing the data, yet mostly investigating off-chip analysis. In this contribution, we show how an Artificial Neural Network model can be trained and deployed on trivial IoT nodes for detecting intelligent similarity-based network attacks. This article proposes a concept of the resource-constrained intelligent system as a part of the IoT infrastructure to be able to harden the cybersecurity on microcontrollers. This work will serve as a stepping stone for the application of Artificial Intelligence on devices with limited computing capabilities such as end-point IoT nodes.

PY  - 2021

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In recent years, Environmental Sound Recognition (ESR) has become a relevant capability for urban monitoring applications. The techniques for automated sound recognition often rely on machine learning approaches, which have increased in complexity in order to achieve higher accuracy. Nonetheless, such machine learning techniques often have to be deployed on resource and power-constrained embedded devices, which has become a challenge with the adoption of deep learning approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are power efficient and highly suitable for computationally intensive algorithms like CNNs. By fully exploiting their parallel nature, they have the potential to accelerate the inference time as compared to other embedded devices. Similarly, dedicated architectures to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) promise to deliver high accuracy while achieving high performance. In this work, we evaluate existing tool flows to deploy CNN models on FPGAs as well as on TPU platforms. We propose and adjust several CNN-based sound classifiers to be embedded on such hardware accelerators. The results demonstrate the maturity of the existing tools and how FPGAs can be exploited to outperform TPUs.

VL  - 9

SN  - 2077-1312

AB  - Renewable energy resources are gaining a lot of popularity. Several researchers have worked on the tracking and extraction of energy from these sources. In the past few decades, among the available green energy resources, wind energy has been the most attractive option among the resources available. It is imperative to use the maximum power available in the wind to achieve the wind turbine (WT) operation at maximum power. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms are a pioneer in this context. Many research papers are contributed in this domain which necessitates a thorough review while choosing an appropriate technique. This paper comprehensively focuses on reviewing different algorithms in the past and present for tracking maximum power point, and capturing maximized output power from the wind energy conversion system (WECS). In this paper, the algorithms are classified based on the direct and indirect power measurement, hybrid and smart algorithms for tracking maximum power point, and they are compared, considering the parameters like complexity, convergence speed, use of sensors, memory requirement, need for knowledge of system parameters, etc. The immense popularity of the different versions of perturb and observe (P&amp;O) based algorithms due to their various features is evident from the literature. The review reveals that the hybrid maximum power point tracking algorithms can use the advantages of the conventional methods and eliminate their drawbacks.

TI  - A User-Oriented Local Coastal Flooding Early Warning System Using Metamodelling Techniques
T2  - Journal of Marine Science and Engineering

PY  - 2021
VL  - 9
IS  - 11
SN  - 2077-1312

AB  - Given recent scientific advances, coastal flooding events can be properly modelled. Nevertheless, such models are computationally expensive (requiring many hours), which prevents their use for forecasting and warning. In addition, there is a gap between the model outputs and information actually needed by decision makers. The present work aims to develop and test a method capable of forecasting coastal flood information adapted to users’ needs. The method must be robust and fast and must integrate the complexity of coastal flood processes. The explored solution relies on metamodels, i.e., mathematical functions that precisely and efficiently (within minutes) estimate the results that would provide the numerical model. While the principle of relying on metamodel solutions is not new, the originality of the present work is to tackle and validate the entire process from the identification of user needs to the establishment and validation of the rapid forecast and early warning system (FEWS) while relying on numerical modelling, metamodelling, the development of indicators, and information technologies. The development and validation are performed at the study site of Gâvres (France). This site is subject to wave overtopping, so the numerical phase-resolving SWASH model is used to build the learning dataset required for the metamodel setup. Gaussian process- and random forest classifier-based metamodels are used and post-processed to estimate 14 indicators of interest for FEWS users. These metamodelling and post-processing schemes are implemented in an FEWS prototype, which is employed by local users and exhibits good warning skills during the validation period. Based on this experience, we provide recommendations for the improvement and/or application of this methodology and individual steps to other sites.

SN  - 2227-9709

AB  - The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic still involves many struggles and challenges. The greatest challenge that most governments are currently facing is the lack of a precise, accurate, and automated mechanism for detecting and tracking new COVID-19 cases. In response to this challenge, this study proposes the first blockchain-based system, called the COVID-19 contact tracing system (CCTS), to verify, track, and detect new cases of COVID-19. The proposed system consists of four integrated components: an infection verifier subsystem, a mass surveillance subsystem, a P2P mobile application, and a blockchain platform for managing all transactions between the three subsystem models. To investigate the performance of the proposed system, CCTS has been simulated and tested against a created dataset consisting of 300 confirmed cases and 2539 contacts. Based on the metrics of the confusion matrix (i.e., recall, precision, accuracy, and F1 Score), the detection evaluation results proved that the proposed blockchain-based system achieved an average of accuracy of 75.79% and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.004 in recognizing persons in contact with COVID-19 patients within two different areas of infection covered by GPS. Moreover, the simulation results also demonstrated the success of the proposed system in performing self-estimation of infection probabilities and sending and receiving infection alerts in P2P communications in crowds of people by users. The infection probability results have been calculated using the binomial distribution function technique. This result can be considered unique compared with other similar systems in the literature. The new system could support governments, health authorities, and citizens in making critical decisions regarding infection detection, prediction, tracking, and avoiding the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, the functionality of the proposed CCTS can be adapted to work against any other similar pandemics in the future.

SN  - 2504-4990

AB  - The two-part series of papers provides a survey on recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an approach to simulate the human’s natural learning process, whose key is to let the agent learn by interacting with the stochastic environment. The fact that the agent has limited access to the information of the environment enables AI to be applied efficiently in most fields that require self-learning. It’s essential to have an organized investigation—we can make good comparisons and choose the best structures or algorithms when applying DRL in various applications. The first part of the overview introduces Markov Decision Processes (MDP) problems and Reinforcement Learning and applications of DRL for solving POMDP problems in games, robotics, and natural language processing. In part two, we continue to introduce applications in transportation, industries, communications and networking, etc. and discuss the limitations of DRL.

AB  - This study analyses the main challenges, trends, technological approaches, and artificial intelligence methods developed by new researchers and professionals in the field of machine learning, with an emphasis on the most outstanding and relevant works to date. This literature review evaluates the main methodological contributions of artificial intelligence through machine learning. The methodology used to study the documents was content analysis; the basic terminology of the study corresponds to machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data between the years 2017 and 2021. For this study, we selected 181 references, of which 120 are part of the literature review. The conceptual framework includes 12 categories, four groups, and eight subgroups. The study of data management using AI methodologies presents symmetry in the four machine learning groups: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforced learning. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence methods with more symmetry in all groups are artificial neural networks, Support Vector Machines, K-means, and Bayesian Methods. Finally, five research avenues are presented to improve the prediction of machine learning.

VL  - 21
IS  - 21
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Automakers manage vast fleets of connected vehicles and face an ever-increasing demand for their sensor readings. This demand originates from many stakeholders, each potentially requiring different sensors from different vehicles. Currently, this demand remains largely unfulfilled due to a lack of systems that can handle such diverse demands efficiently. Vehicles are usually passive participants in data acquisition, each continuously reading and transmitting the same static set of sensors. However, in a multi-tenant setup with diverse data demands, each vehicle potentially needs to provide different data instead. We present a system that performs such vehicle-specific minimization of data acquisition by mapping individual data demands to individual vehicles. We collect personal data only after prior consent and fulfill the requirements of the GDPR. Non-personal data can be collected by directly addressing individual vehicles. The system consists of a software component natively integrated with a major automaker’s vehicle platform and a cloud platform brokering access to acquired data. Sensor readings are either provided via near real-time streaming or as recorded trip files that provide specific consistency guarantees. A performance evaluation with over 200,000 simulated vehicles has shown that our system can increase server capacity on-demand and process streaming data within 269 ms on average during peak load. The resulting architecture can be used by other automakers or operators of large sensor networks. Native vehicle integration is not mandatory; the architecture can also be used with retrofitted hardware such as OBD readers.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 21
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The use of sensor applications has been steadily increasing, leading to an urgent need for efficient data compression techniques to facilitate the storage, transmission, and processing of digital signals generated by sensors. Unlike other sequential data such as text sequences, sensor signals have more complex statistical characteristics. Specifically, in every signal point, each bit, which corresponds to a specific precision scale, follows its own conditional distribution depending on its history and even other bits. Therefore, applying existing general-purpose data compressors usually leads to a relatively low compression ratio, since these compressors do not fully exploit such internal features. What is worse, partitioning a bit stream into groups with a preset size will sometimes break the integrity of each signal point. In this paper, we present a lossless data compressor dedicated to compressing sensor signals which is built upon a novel recurrent neural architecture named multi-channel recurrent unit (MCRU). Each channel in the proposed MCRU models a specific precision range of each signal point without breaking data integrity. During compressing and decompressing, the mirrored network will be trained on observed data; thus, no pre-training is needed. The superiority of our approach over other compressors is demonstrated experimentally on various types of sensor signals.

AB  - As part of the recent electrification of the transportation industry, internal combustion engines are being coupled with or replaced by electric motors. This movement towards an electrified drivetrain poses new noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) challenges related to electric motors. In this paper, the acoustic signature of an electric motor was analyzed to obtain a better understanding of the sound generated by these motors. This work provides an insight into an acoustic measurement technique that can be used to identify certain frequency bands that significantly contribute to the perceived sound. In the first part, the structural response of the motor was correlated with its acoustic spectra. Furthermore, data from acoustic and structural measurements were used to analyze the order content of the signal and identify critical contributors to the overall perceived sound. The differences between data captured by microphones in different positions around the motor helped to localize components of the overall sound. The results provide some discussion about techniques to decrease the overall sound. The technique described in this paper can be extended to fan-cooled motors that are used in vehicles such as golf carts or as auxiliary motors in electric/hybrid vehicles, as well as across a wide range of industrial applications.

However, the percentage of older adults who comply with the recommendations for physical activity levels is low when compared to the same percentages on younger groups. The SmartWalk system aims to encourage older adults to perform physical activity (i.e., walking in the city), which is monitored and adjusted by healthcare providers for best results. The study reported in this article focused on the implementation of SmartWalk security services to keep personal data safe during communications and while at rest, which were validated considering a comprehensive use case. The security framework offers various mechanisms, including an authentication system that was designed to complement the pairs of usernames and passwords with trusted execution environments and token-based features, authorization with different access levels, symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography, critical transactions review, and logging supported by blockchain technology. The resulting implementation contributes for a common understanding of the security features of trustful smart cities’ applications, which conforms with existing legislation and regulations.

AB  - Air pollution has become the most important issue concerning human evolution in the last century, as the levels of toxic gases and particles present in the air create health problems and affect the ecosystems of the planet. Scientists and environmental organizations have been looking for new ways to combat and control the air pollution, developing new solutions as technologies evolves. In the last decade, devices able to observe and maintain pollution levels have become more accessible and less expensive, and with the appearance of the Internet of Things (IoT), new approaches for combating pollution were born. The focus of the research presented in this paper was predicting behaviours regarding the air quality index using machine learning. Data were collected from one of the six atmospheric stations set in relevant areas of Bucharest, Romania, to validate our model. Several algorithms were proposed to study the evolution of temperature depending on the level of pollution and on several pollution factors. In the end, the results generated by the algorithms are presented considering the types of pollutants for two distinct periods. Prediction errors were highlighted by the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for each of the three machine learning algorithms used.

AB  - Monitoring the progress on a construction site during the construction phase is crucial. An inadequate understanding of the project status can lead to mistakes and inappropriate actions, causing delays and increased costs. Monitoring and controlling projects via digital tools would reduce the risk of error and enable timely corrective actions. Although there is currently a wide range of technologies for these purposes, these technologies and interoperability between them are still limited. Because of this, it is important to know the possibilities of integration and interoperability regarding their implementation. This article presents a bibliographic synthesis and interpretation of 30 nonconventional digital tools for monitoring progress in terms of field data capture technologies (FDCT) and communication and collaborative technologies (CT) that are responsible for information processing and management. This research aims to perform an integration and interoperability analysis of technologies to demonstrate their potential for monitoring and controlling construction projects during the execution phase. A network analysis was conducted, and the results suggest that the triad formed by building information modeling (BIM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and photogrammetry is an effective tool; the use of this set extends not only to monitoring and control, but also to all phases of a project.

AB  - Owing to climate change and human indiscriminate development, the population of endangered species has been decreasing. To protect endangered species, many countries worldwide have adopted the CITES treaty to prevent the extinction of endangered plants and animals. Moreover, research has been conducted using diverse approaches, particularly deep learning-based animal and plant image recognition methods. In this paper, we propose an automated image classification method for 11 endangered parrot species included in CITES. The 11 species include subspecies that are very similar in appearance. Data images were collected from the Internet and built in cooperation with Seoul Grand Park Zoo to build an indigenous database. The dataset for deep learning training consisted of 70% training set, 15% validation set, and 15% test set. In addition, a data augmentation technique was applied to reduce the data collection limit and prevent overfitting. The performance of various backbone CNN architectures (i.e., VGGNet, ResNet, and DenseNet) were compared using the SSD model. The experiment derived the test set image performance for the training model, and the results show that the DenseNet18 had the best performance with an mAP of approximately 96.6% and an inference time of 0.38 s.

In this paper, zero-crossing points of a sinusoidal signal are detected using deep neural networks. In order to train and evaluate the deep neural network model, new datasets for sinusoidal signals having noise levels from 5% to 50% and harmonic distortion from 10% to 50% are developed.

SN  - 2077-0472

AB  - Mechanical damages of sugar beet during harvesting affects the quality of the final products and sugar yield. The mechanical damage of sugar beet is assessed randomly by operators of harvesters and can depend on the subjective opinion and experience of the operator due to the complexity of the harvester machines. Thus, the main aim of this study was to determine whether a digital two-dimensional imaging system coupled with convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques could be utilized to detect visible mechanical damage in sugar beet during harvesting in a harvester machine. In this research, various detector models based on the CNN, including You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4, region-based fully convolutional network (R-FCN) and faster regions with convolutional neural network features (Faster R-CNN) were developed. Sugar beet image data during harvesting from a harvester in different farming conditions were used for training and validation of the proposed models. The experimental results showed that the YOLO v4 CSPDarknet53 method was able to detect damage in sugar beet with better performance (recall, precision and F1-score of about 92, 94 and 93%, respectively) and higher speed (around 29 frames per second) compared to the other developed CNNs. By means of a CNN-based vision system, it was possible to automatically detect sugar beet damage within the sugar beet harvester machine.

AB  - There is a significant interest in facial emotion recognition in the fields of human–computer interaction and social sciences. With the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the field of human behavioral prediction and analysis, especially human emotion, has evolved significantly. The most standard methods of emotion recognition are currently being used in models deployed in remote servers. We believe the reduction in the distance between the input device and the server model can lead us to better efficiency and effectiveness in real life applications. For the same purpose, computational methodologies such as edge computing can be beneficial. It can also encourage time-critical applications that can be implemented in sensitive fields. In this study, we propose a Raspberry-Pi based standalone edge device that can detect real-time facial emotions. Although this edge device can be used in variety of applications where human facial emotions play an important role, this article is mainly crafted using a dataset of employees working in organizations. A Raspberry-Pi-based standalone edge device has been implemented using the Mini-Xception Deep Network because of its computational efficiency in a shorter time compared to other networks. This device has achieved 100% accuracy for detecting faces in real time with 68% accuracy, i.e., higher than the accuracy mentioned in the state-of-the-art with the FER 2013 dataset. Future work will implement a deep network on Raspberry-Pi with an Intel Movidious neural compute stick to reduce the processing time and achieve quick real time implementation of the facial emotion recognition system.

AB  - To further implement decentralized renewable energy resources, blockchain based peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is gaining attention and its architecture has been proposed with virtual demonstrations. In this paper, to further socially implement this concept, a blockchain based peer to peer energy trading system which could coordinate with energy control hardware was constructed, and a demonstration experiment was conducted. Previous work focused on virtually matching energy supply and demand via blockchain P2P energy markets, and our work pushes this forward by demonstrating the possibility of actual energy flow control. In this demonstration, Plug-in Hybrid Electrical Vehicles(PHEVs) and Home Energy Management Systems(HEMS) actually used in daily life were controlled in coordination with the blockchain system. In construction, the need of a multi-tagged continuous market was found and proposed. In the demonstration experiment, the proposed blockchain market and hardware control interface was proven capable of securing and stably transmitting energy within the P2P energy system. Also, by the implementation of multi-tagged energy markets, the number of transactions required to secure the required amount of electricity was reduced.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is the main driving force behind smart manufacturing, industrial automation, and industry 4.0. Conversely, industrial IoT as the evolving technological paradigm is also becoming a compelling target for cyber adversaries. Particularly, advanced persistent threats (APT) and especially botnets are the foremost promising and potential attacks that may throw the complete industrial IoT network into chaos. IIoT-enabled botnets are highly scalable, technologically diverse, and highly resilient to classical and conventional detection mechanisms. Subsequently, we propose a deep learning (DL)-enabled novel hybrid architecture that can efficiently and timely tackle distributed, multivariant, lethal botnet attacks in industrial IoT. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated on a current state-of-the-art, publicly available dataset using standard performance evaluation metrics. Moreover, our proposed technique has been precisely verified with our constructed hybrid DL-enabled architectures and current benchmark DL algorithms. Our devised mechanism shows promising results in terms of high detection accuracy with a trivial trade-off in speed efficiency, assuring the proposed scheme as an optimal and legitimate cyber defense in prevalent IIoTs. Besides, we have cross-validated our results to show utterly unbiased performance.

TI  - Review of the Estimation Methods of Energy Consumption for Battery Electric Buses
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 22
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In the transportation sector, electric battery bus (EBB) deployment is considered to be a potential solution to reduce global warming because no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are directly produced by EBBs. In addition to the required charging infrastructure, estimating the energy consumption of buses has become a crucial precondition for the deployment and planning of electric bus fleets. Policy and decision-makers may not have the specific tools needed to estimate the energy consumption of a particular bus network. Therefore, many state-of-the-art studies have proposed models to determine the energy demand of electric buses. However, these studies have not critically reviewed, classified and discussed the challenges of the approaches that are applied to estimate EBBs’ energy demands. Thus, this manuscript provides a detailed review of the forecasting models used to estimate the energy consumption of EBBs. Furthermore, this work fills the gap by classifying the models for estimating EBBs’ energy consumption into small-town depot and big-city depot networks. In brief, this review explains and discusses the models and formulations of networks associated with well-to-wheel (WTW) assessment, which can determine the total energy demand of a bus network. This work also reviews a survey of the most recent optimization methods that could be applied to achieve the optimal pattern parameters of EBB fleet systems, such as the bus battery capacity, charger rated power and the total number of installed chargers in the charging station. This paper highlights the issues and challenges, such as the impact of external factors, replicating real-world data, big data analytics, validity index, and bus routes’ topography, with recommendations on each issue. Also, the paper proposes a generic framework based on optimization algorithms, namely, artificial neural network (ANN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), which will be significant for future development in implementing new energy consumption estimation approaches. Finally, the main findings of this manuscript further our understanding of the determinants that contribute to managing the energy demand of EBBs networks.

AB  - Smart seaside cities can fully exploit the capabilities brought by Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of city services in traditional smart city applications: smart home, smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart surveillance, smart environment, cyber security, etc. However, smart coastal cities are characterized by their specific application domain, namely, beach monitoring. Beach attendance prediction is a beach monitoring application of particular importance for coastal managers to successfully plan beach services in terms of security, rescue, health and environmental assistance. In this paper, an experimental study that uses IoT data and deep learning to predict the number of beach visitors at Castelldefels beach (Barcelona, Spain) was developed. Images of Castelldefels beach were captured by a video monitoring system. An image recognition software was used to estimate beach attendance. A deep learning algorithm (deep neural network) to predict beach attendance was developed. The experimental results prove the feasibility of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for beach attendance prediction. For each beach, a classification of occupancy was estimated, depending on the number of beach visitors. The proposed model outperforms other machine learning models (decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest) and can successfully classify seven beach occupancy levels with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of 0.03, 92.7%, 92.9%, 92.7%, and 92.7%, respectively.

AB  - Forests play a fundamental role in preserving the environment and fighting global warming. Unfortunately, they are continuously reduced by human interventions such as deforestation, fires, etc. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework for automatically detecting illegal tree-cutting activity in forests through audio event classification. We envisage ultra-low-power tiny devices, embedding edge-computing microcontrollers and long-range wireless communication to cover vast areas in the forest. To reduce the energy footprint and resource consumption for effective and pervasive detection of illegal tree cutting, an efficient and accurate audio classification solution based on convolutional neural networks is proposed, designed specifically for resource-constrained wireless edge devices. With respect to previous works, the proposed system allows for recognizing a wider range of threats related to deforestation through a distributed and pervasive edge-computing technique. Different pre-processing techniques have been evaluated, focusing on a trade-off between classification accuracy with respect to computational resources, memory, and energy footprint. Furthermore, experimental long-range communication tests have been conducted in real environments. Data obtained from the experimental results show that the proposed solution can detect and notify tree-cutting events for efficient and cost-effective forest monitoring through smart IoT, with an accuracy of 85%.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Medium-term electricity consumption and load forecasting in smart grids is an attractive topic of study, especially using innovative data analysis approaches for future energy consumption trends. Loss of electricity during generation and use is also a problem to be addressed. Both consumers and utilities can benefit from a predictive study of electricity demand and pricing. In this study, we used a new machine learning approach called AdaBoost to identify key features from an ISO-NE dataset that includes daily consumption data over eight years. Moreover, the DT classifier and RF are widely used to extract the best features from the dataset. Moreover, we predicted the electricity load and price using machine learning techniques including support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning techniques such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). Coronavirus herd immunity optimization (CHIO), a novel optimization approach, was used to modify the hyperparameters to increase efficiency, and it used classifiers to improve the performance of our classifier. By adding additional layers to the CNN and fine-tuning its parameters, the probability of overfitting the classifier was reduced. For method validation, we compared our proposed models with several benchmarks. MAE, MAPE, MSE, RMSE, the f1 score, recall, precision, and accuracy were the measures used for performance evaluation. Moreover, seven different forms of statistical analysis were given to show why our proposed approaches are preferable. The proposed CNN-CHIO and SVM techniques had the lowest MAPE error rates of 6% and 8%, respectively, and the highest accuracy rates of 95% and 92%, respectively.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Price forecasting (PF) is the primary concern in distributed power generation. This paper presents a novel and improved technique to forecast electricity prices. The data of various power producers, Capacity Purchase Price (CPP), Power Purchase Price (PPP), Tariff rates, and load demand from National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) are considered for MAPE reduction in PF. Eight time-series and auto-regression algorithms are developed for data fetching and setting the objective function. The feed-forward ANFIS based on the ML approach and space vector regression (SVR) is introduced to PF by taking the input from time series and auto-regression (AR) algorithms. Best-feature selection is conducted by adopting the Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA)-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach that ultimately minimizes the complexity and computational time of the model. The proposed integration strategy computes the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the overall improvement percentage is 9.24%, which is valuable in price forecasting of the energy management system (EMS). In the end, EMS based on the Firefly algorithm (FA) has been presented, and by implementing FA, the cost of electricity has been reduced by 21%, 19%, and 20% for building 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

AB  - The modulus of type N=p2q is often used in many variants of factoring-based cryptosystems due to its ability to fasten the decryption process. Faster decryption is suitable for securing small devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment or securing fast-forwarding encryption services used in mobile applications. Taking this into account, the security analysis of such modulus is indeed paramount. This paper presents two cryptanalyses that use new enabling conditions to factor the modulus N=p2q of the factoring-based cryptosystem. The first cryptanalysis considers a single user with a public key pair (e,N) related via an arbitrary relation to equation er−(Ns+t)=αp2+βq2, where r,s,t are unknown parameters. The second cryptanalysis considers two distinct cases in the situation of k-users (i.e., multiple users) for k≥2, given the instances of (Ni,ei) where i=1,…,k. By using the lattice basis reduction algorithm for solving simultaneous Diophantine approximation, the k-instances of (Ni,ei) can be successfully factored in polynomial time.

AB  - As the number of users increased over the years, pioneering technologies and solutions in given areas ceased to be sufficient even in terms of performance. Therefore, there was a need for their development or even redesign and redefinition. One of the issues that undoubtedly has a huge impact on the current shape of the global network and the way information is processed in it is the issue of traffic balancing, especially the one in the server infrastructure related to the WWW service, providing users with the possibility of efficient and reliable web browsing. The paper presents a comparative analysis of selected open-source solutions used for traffic balancing in server infrastructures providing WWW service based on selected criteria. The designed architecture of the test environment and the test results of selected tools implementing the traffic-balancing functionality are presented. Methodologies, test plans, and comparison criteria are proposed. A comparative analysis of results based on specific criteria was performed. The balance between network traffic optimization and load balancing distribution among servers is crucial for the development of energy-efficient data processing centers.

AB  - Despite the significance and growth of wind energy as a major source of renewable energy, research on the risks of wind turbines in the form of accidents and failures has attracted limited attention. Research that applies data analytics methodologically in this context is scarce. The research presented here, upon construction of a text corpus of 721 selected wind turbine accident and failure news reports, develops and applies a custom-developed data analytics framework that integrates tabular analysis, visualization, text mining, and machine learning. Topic modeling was applied for the first time to identify and classify recurring themes in wind turbine accident news, and association mining was applied to identify contextual terms associated with death and injury. The tabular and visual analyses relate accidents to location (offshore vs. onshore), wind turbine life cycle phases (transportation, construction, operation, and maintenance), and the incidence of death and injury. As one of the insights, more incidents were found to occur during operation and transportation. Through topic modeling, topics associated most with deaths and injuries were revealed. The results could benefit wind turbine manufacturers, service providers, energy companies, insurance companies, government bodies, non-profit organizations, researchers, and other stakeholders in the wind energy sector.

AB  - To accurately predict the economic development of each industry in different types of regions, a deep convolutional neural network model was designed for predicting the annual GDP; GDP growth index; and primary, secondary and tertiary industry growth values of each. In the model, raw industrial data are preprocessed by a normalization operation and subsequently transformed by the BoxCox method to approach the normal distribution. Panel data of consecutive years are constructed and used as input to the deep convolutional neural network, and industrial data of year t + 1 are used as the output of the network. Simulation experiments were conducted to analyze 23 years of industrial economic data from 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. The experimental results show that R-squared value is larger than 0.91 for all 31 provinces and root mean squared log errors (RMSLE) of all regions are less than 0.1, which demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high prediction accuracy with generalization capability and can accurately predict the economic growth trends of different types of regions.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Available digital maps of indoor environments are limited to a description of the geometrical environment, despite there being an urgent need for more accurate information, particularly data about the electromagnetic (EM) properties of the materials used for walls. Such data would enable new possibilities in the design and optimization of wireless networks and the development of new radio services. In this paper, we introduce, formalize, and evaluate a framework for machine learning (ML) based wireless sensing of indoor surface materials in the form of EM properties. We apply the radio-environment (RE) signatures of the wireless link, which inherently contains environmental information due to the interaction of the radio waves with the environment. We specify the content of the RE signature suitable for surface-material classification as a set of multipath components given by the received power, delay, phase shift, and angle of arrival. The proposed framework applies an ML approach to construct a classification model using RE signatures labeled with the environmental information. The ML method exploits the data obtained from measurements or simulations. The performance of the framework in different scenarios is evaluated based on standard ML performance metrics, such as classification accuracy and F-score. The results of the elementary case prove that the proposed approach can be applied for the classification of the surface material for a plain environment, and can be further extended for the classification of wall materials in more complex indoor environments.

AB  - Recently, 5G networks have emerged as a new technology that can control the advancement of telecommunication networks and transportation systems. Furthermore, 5G networks provide better network performance while reducing network traffic and complexity compared to current networks. Machine-learning techniques (ML) will help symmetric IoT applications become a significant new data source in the future. Symmetry is a widely studied pattern in various research areas, especially in wireless network traffic. The study of symmetric and asymmetric faults and outliers (anomalies) in network traffic is an important topic. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) is an advanced approach in challenging wireless networks such as network management and optimization, anomaly detection, predictive analysis, lifetime value prediction, etc. However, its performance depends on the efficiency of training samples. DL is designed to work with large datasets and uses complex algorithms to train the model. The occurrence of outliers in the raw data reduces the reliability of the training models. In this paper, the performance of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) traffic was estimated using the DL algorithm. A set of robust statistical estimators, called M-estimators, have been proposed as robust loss functions as an alternative to the traditional MSE loss function, to improve the training process and robustize DL in the presence of outliers. We demonstrate their robustness in the presence of outliers on V2X traffic datasets.

AB  - With the rapid growth and development of cities, Intelligent Traffic Management and Control (ITMC) is becoming a fundamental component to address the challenges of modern urban traffic management, where a wide range of daily problems need to be addressed in a prompt and expedited manner. Issues such as unpredictable traffic dynamics, resource constraints, and abnormal events pose difficulties to city managers. ITMC aims to increase the efficiency of traffic management by minimizing the odds of traffic problems, by providing real-time traffic state forecasts to better schedule the intersection signal controls. Reliable implementations of ITMC improve the safety of inhabitants and the quality of life, leading to economic growth. In recent years, researchers have proposed different solutions to address specific problems concerning traffic management, ranging from image-processing and deep-learning techniques to forecasting the traffic state and deriving policies to control intersection signals. This review article studies the primary public datasets helpful in developing models to address the identified problems, complemented with a deep analysis of the works related to traffic state forecast and intersection-signal-control models. Our analysis found that deep-learning-based approaches for short-term traffic state forecast and multi-intersection signal control showed reasonable results, but lacked robustness for unusual scenarios, particularly during oversaturated situations, which can be resolved by explicitly addressing these cases, potentially leading to significant improvements of the systems overall. However, there is arguably a long path until these models can be used safely and effectively in real-world scenarios.

VL  - 11
IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - A reverse vending machine motivates citizens to bring recyclable waste by rewarding them, which is a viable solution to increase the recycling rate. Reverse vending machines generally use near-infrared sensors, barcode sensors, or cameras to classify recycling resources. However, sensor-based reverse vending machines suffer from a high configuration cost and the limited scope of target objects, and conventional single image-based reverse vending machines usually make erroneous predictions about intentional fraud objects. This paper proposes a dual image-based convolutional neural network ensemble model to address these problems. For this purpose, we first created a prototype reverse vending machine and constructed an image dataset containing two cross-sections of objects, top and front view. Then, we chose convolutional neural network models widely used in image classification as the candidates for building an accurate and lightweight ensemble model. Considering the size and classification performance of candidates, we constructed the best-fit ensemble combination and evaluated its classification performance. The final ensemble model showed a classification accuracy higher than 95% for all target classes, including fraud objects. This result proves that our approach achieves better robustness against intentional fraud objects than single image-based models and thus can broaden the scope for target resources. The measurement results on lightweight embedded platforms also demonstrated that our model provides a short inference time that is enough to facilitate the real-time execution of reverse vending machines based on low-cost edge artificial intelligence devices.

AB  - The high level of energy consumption of buildings is significantly influencing occupant behavior changes towards improved energy efficiency. This paper introduces a systematic literature review with two objectives: to understand the more relevant factors affecting energy consumption of buildings and to find the best intelligent computing (IC) methods capable of classifying and predicting energy consumption of different types of buildings. Adopting the PRISMA method, the paper analyzed 822 manuscripts from 2013 to 2020 and focused on 106, based on title and abstract screening and on manuscripts with experiments. A text mining process and a bibliometric map tool (VOS viewer) were adopted to find the most used terms and their relationships, in the energy and IC domains. Our approach shows that the terms &ldquo;consumption,&rdquo; &ldquo;residential,&rdquo; and &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; are the more relevant terms in the energy domain, in terms of the ratio of important terms (TITs), whereas &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; is the more commonly used term in the IC domain. The paper also shows that there are strong relations between &ldquo;Residential Energy Consumption&rdquo; and &ldquo;Electricity Consumption,&rdquo; &ldquo;Heating&rdquo; and &ldquo;Climate. Finally, we checked and analyzed 41 manuscripts in detail, summarized their major contributions, and identified several research gaps that provide hints for further research.

AB  - As a result of environmental pollution and the ever-growing demand for energy, there has been a shift from conventional vehicles towards electric vehicles (EVs). Public acceptance of EVs and their large-scale deployment raises requires a fully operational charging infrastructure. Charging infrastructure planning is an intricate process involving various activities, such as charging station placement, charging demand prediction, and charging scheduling. This planning process involves interactions between power distribution and the road network. The advent of machine learning has made data-driven approaches a viable means for solving charging infrastructure planning problems. Consequently, researchers have started using machine learning techniques to solve the aforementioned problems associated with charging infrastructure planning. This work aims to provide a comprehensive review of the machine learning applications used to solve charging infrastructure planning problems. Furthermore, three case studies on charging station placement and charging demand prediction are presented. This paper is an extension of: Deb, S. (2021, June). Machine Learning for Solving Charging Infrastructure Planning: A Comprehensive Review. In the 2021 5th International Conference on Smart Grid and Smart Cities (ICSGSC) (pp. 16&ndash;22). IEEE.

AB  - Recent developments in cloud computing and the Internet of Things have enabled smart environments, in terms of both monitoring and actuation. Unfortunately, this often results in unsustainable cloud-based solutions, whereby, in the interest of simplicity, a wealth of raw (unprocessed) data are pushed from sensor nodes to the cloud. Herein, we advocate the use of machine learning at sensor nodes to perform essential data-cleaning operations, to avoid the transmission of corrupted (often unusable) data to the cloud. Starting from a public pollution dataset, we investigate how two machine learning techniques (kNN and missForest) may be embedded on Raspberry Pi to perform data imputation, without impacting the data collection process. Our experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of edge-learning methods for filling in missing data values in corrupted data series. We find that kNN and missForest correctly impute up to 40% of randomly distributed missing values, with a density distribution of values that is indistinguishable from the benchmark. We also show a trade-off analysis for the case of bursty missing values, with recoverable blocks of up to 100 samples. Computation times are shorter than sampling periods, allowing for data imputation at the edge in a timely manner.

AB  - In order to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of the world started to implement measures regarding social distance and social contacts, including closures of cities, work and study relocations, and work suspension. The epidemical situation and the lockdown of the economy by governments in various countries caused changes in production, changes in the habits of energy consumers and other energy-related changes. This article analyses the impact of the global pandemic on the energy sector and the relationship with the progress to the sustainability of the energy sector. The systematic literature review was performed in the Web of Science (WoS) database. The research follows recommendations of the SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis and Analysis) and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) approaches. A total of 113 relevant articles were selected for the analysis. All selected articles were categorized according to their application and impact areas. The five main impact areas of the COVID-19 pandemic to the sustainability of the energy sector were identified: consumption and energy demand; air pollution; investments in renewable energy; energy poverty; and energy system flexibility. Based on the current research findings and perception of the problem, the main insights for future research in the field are provided.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In this article, a systematic literature review of 419 articles on energy demand modeling, published between 2015 and 2020, is presented. This provides researchers with an exhaustive overview of the examined literature and classification of techniques for energy demand modeling. Unlike in existing literature reviews, in this comprehensive study all of the following aspects of energy demand models are analyzed: techniques, prediction accuracy, inputs, energy carrier, sector, temporal horizon, and spatial granularity. Readers benefit from easy access to a broad literature base and find decision support when choosing suitable data-model combinations for their projects. Results have been compiled in comprehensive figures and tables, providing a structured summary of the literature, and containing direct references to the analyzed articles. Drawbacks of techniques are discussed as well as countermeasures. The results show that among the articles, machine learning (ML) techniques are used the most, are mainly applied to short-term electricity forecasting on a regional level and rely on historic load as their main data source. Engineering-based models are less dependent on historic load data and cover appliance consumption on long temporal horizons. Metaheuristic and uncertainty techniques are often used in hybrid models. Statistical techniques are frequently used for energy demand modeling as well and often serve as benchmarks for other techniques. Among the articles, the accuracy measured by mean average percentage error (MAPE) proved to be on similar levels for all techniques. This review eases the reader into the subject matter by presenting the emphases that have been made in the current literature, suggesting future research directions, and providing the basis for quantitative testing of hypotheses regarding applicability and dominance of specific methods for sub-categories of demand modeling.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The article presents issues regarding the impact of operating conditions on the functional reliability of representative fire alarm systems (FASs) in selected critical infrastructure buildings (CIB). FAS should operate correctly under variable environmental conditions. FASs ensure the safety of people and CIB. Operational measurements for 10 representative systems were conducted in order to determine the impact of environmental conditions on FAS reliability. Selected operational indices were also determined. The next stage involved developing two models of representative FASs and the availability, pre-ageing time and operating process security indices. Determining operational indices is a rational selection of FAS technical and organizational solutions that enables the reliability level to be increased. Identifying the course of the FAS operating process security hazard changes in individual system lines, particularly at the initial operation stage, enables people that supervise the operation to affect operating parameters on an ongoing basis. The article is structured in the following order: issue analysis, FAS power supply in CIB, operational test results, selected FAS operating process models, determination of operational and security indices, and conclusions.

AB  - Nowadays, pavement management systems (PMS) are mainly based on monitoring processes that have been established for a long time, and strongly depend on acquired experience. However, with the emergence of smart technologies, such as internet of things and artificial intelligence, PMS could be improved by applying these new smart technologies to their decision support systems, not just by updating their data collection methodologies, but also their data analysis tools. The application of these smart technologies to the field of pavement monitoring and condition evaluation will undoubtedly contribute to more efficient, less costly, safer, and environmentally friendly methodologies. Thus, the main drive of the present work is to provide insight for the development of future decision support systems for smart pavement management by conducting a systematic literature review of the developed works that apply smart technologies to this field. The conclusions drawn from the analysis allowed for the identification of a series of future direction recommendations for researchers. In fact, future PMS should tend to be capable of collecting and analyzing data at different levels, both externally at the surface or inside the pavement, as well as to detect and predict all types of functional and structural flaws and defects.

TI  - Smart Homes as Enablers for Depression Pre-Diagnosis Using PHQ-9 on HMI through Fuzzy Logic Decision System
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Depression is a common mental illness characterized by sadness, lack of interest, or pleasure. According to the DSM-5, there are nine symptoms, from which an individual must present 4 or 5 in the last two weeks to fulfill the diagnosis criteria of depression. Nevertheless, the common methods that health care professionals use to assess and monitor depression symptoms are face-to-face questionnaires leading to time-consuming or expensive methods. On the other hand, smart homes can monitor householders&rsquo; health through smart devices such as smartphones, wearables, cameras, or voice assistants connected to the home. Although the depression disorders at smart homes are commonly oriented to the senior sector, depression affects all of us. Therefore, even though an expert needs to diagnose the depression disorder, questionnaires as the PHQ-9 help spot any depressive symptomatology as a pre-diagnosis. Thus, this paper proposes a three-step framework; the first step assesses the nine questions to the end-user through ALEXA or a gamified HMI. Then, a fuzzy logic decision system considers three actions based on the nine responses. Finally, the last step considers these three actions: continue monitoring through Alexa and the HMI, suggest specialist referral, and mandatory specialist referral.

AB  - Currently, a smart city is an emerging field in urban cities to improve the quality of life through information and communication technology (ICT). In general, the traditional solid waste management (SWM) approach taken by municipal authorities for waste collection in urban areas must be enhanced to achieve the green and smart city goals. This article is primarily focused on the progress of ICT technologies in solid waste management. With that aim, a thorough analysis is carried out in the article, and from the analysis, we have identified distinct ICT technologies that have been implemented in SWM. The function, application, and limitations of each technology are presented in the article. From the review, it is concluded that the implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role in minimizing the negative impact of waste on the environment. It is also identified that selection of the appropriate wireless communication protocol is critical during the implementation of IoT-based system because the sensor node at the bins is battery-powered. In addition, it is analysed that blockchain technology plays an essential role in realizing the waste&ndash;money model, as this model includes transactions between users and recyclers. Finally, in this article, we propose that the waste-to-money model, local network and gateway architecture, vision node, and customized prototype improve solid waste management system in terms of communication, energy consumption, and real-time monitoring.

AB  - The detection of buildings in the city is essential in several geospatial domains and for decision-making regarding intelligence for city planning, tax collection, project management, revenue generation, and smart cities, among other areas. In the past, the classical approach used for building detection was by using the imagery and it entailed human&ndash;computer interaction, which was a daunting proposition. To tackle this task, a novel network based on an end-to-end deep learning framework is proposed to detect and classify buildings features. The proposed CNN has three parallel stream channels: the first is the high-resolution aerial imagery, while the second stream is the digital surface model (DSM). The third was fixed on extracting deep features using the fusion of channel one and channel two, respectively. Furthermore, the channel has eight group convolution blocks of 2D convolution with three max-pooling layers. The proposed model&rsquo;s efficiency and dependability were tested on three different categories of complex urban building structures in the study area. Then, morphological operations were applied to the extracted building footprints to increase the uniformity of the building boundaries and produce improved building perimeters. Thus, our approach bridges a significant gap in detecting building objects in diverse environments; the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of the proposed method are greater than 80% and 0.605, respectively. The findings support the proposed framework and methodologies&rsquo; efficacy and effectiveness at extracting buildings from complex environments.

AB  - The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as base station (BS) is gaining popularity. In this paper, we consider maximization of the overall data rate by intelligent deployment of UAV BS in the downlink of a cellular system. We investigate a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided approach to optimize the position of flying BSs mounted on board UAVs to support a macro BS (MBS). We propose an algorithm to avoid collision between multiple UAVs undergoing exploratory movements and to restrict UAV BSs movement within a predefined area. Q-learning technique is used to optimize UAV BS position, where the reward is equal to sum of user equipment (UE) data rates. We consider a framework where the UAV BSs carry out exploratory movements in the beginning and exploitary movements in later stages to maximize the overall data rate. Our results show that a cellular system with three UAV BSs and one MBS serving 72 UE reaches 69.2% of the best possible data rate, which is identified by brute force search. Finally, the RL algorithm is compared with a K-means algorithm to study the need of accurate UE locations. Our results show that the RL algorithm outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm when the measure of imperfection is higher. The proposed algorithm can be made use of by a practical MBS&ndash;UAV BSs&ndash;UEs system to provide protection to UAV BSs while maximizing data rate.

AB  - The paper addresses the problem of insufficient knowledge on the impact of noise on the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model identification. The work offers a simulation-based solution to the analysis of the tolerance to noise of ARIMA models in electrical load forecasting. In the study, an idealized ARIMA model obtained from real load data of the Polish power system was disturbed by noise of different levels. The model was then re-identified, its parameters were estimated, and new forecasts were calculated. The experiment allowed us to evaluate the robustness of ARIMA models to noise in their ability to predict electrical load time series. It could be concluded that the reaction of the ARIMA model to random disturbances of the modeled time series was relatively weak. The limiting noise level at which the forecasting ability of the model collapsed was determined. The results highlight the key role of the data preprocessing stage in data mining and learning. They contribute to more accurate decision making in an uncertain environment, help to shape energy policy, and have implications for the sustainability and reliability of power systems.

TI  - DCRN: An Optimized Deep Convolutional Regression Network for Building Orientation Angle Estimation in High-Resolution Satellite Images

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Recently, remote sensing satellite image analysis has received significant attention from geo-information scientists. However, the current geo-information systems lack automatic detection of several building characteristics inside the high-resolution satellite images. The accurate extraction of buildings characteristics helps the decision-makers to optimize urban planning and achieve better decisions. Furthermore, Building orientation angle is a very critical parameter in the accuracy of automated building detection algorithms. However, the traditional computer vision techniques lack accuracy, scalability, and robustness for building orientation angle detection. This paper proposes two different approaches to deep building orientation angle estimation in the high-resolution satellite image. Firstly, we propose a transfer deep learning approach for our estimation task. Secondly, we propose a novel optimized DCRN network consisting of pre-processing, scaled gradient layer, deep convolutional units, dropout layers, and regression end layer. The early proposed gradient layer helps the DCRN network to extract more helpful information and increase its performance. We have collected a building benchmark dataset that consists of building images in Riyadh city. The images used in the experiments are 15,190 buildings images. In our experiments, we have compared our proposed approaches and the other approaches in the literature. The proposed system has achieved the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) value of 1.24, the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16, and the highest adjusted R-squared value of 0.99 using the RMS optimizer. The cost of processing time of our proposed DCRN architecture is 0.0113 &plusmn; 0.0141 s. Our proposed approach has proven its stability with the input building image contrast variation for all orientation angles. Our experimental results are promising, and it is suggested to be utilized in other building characteristics estimation tasks in high-resolution satellite images.

AB  - Recently, more and more solutions have utilised artificial intelligence approaches in order to enhance or optimise processes to achieve greater sustainability. One of the most pressing issues is the emissions caused by cars; in this paper, the problem of optimising the route of delivery cars is tackled. In this paper, the applicability of the deep reinforcement learning algorithms with regards to the aforementioned problem is tested on a simulation game designed and implemented to pose various challenges such as constant change of delivery locations. The algorithms chosen for this task are Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) with and without Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). These novel and advanced reinforcement learning algorithms have yet not been utilised in similar scenarios. The differences in performance and learning process of those are visualised and discussed. It is demonstrated that both of those algorithms present a slow but steady learning curve, which is an expected effect of reinforcement learning algorithms, leading to a conclusion that the algorithms would discover an optimal policy with an adequately long learning process. Additionally, the benefits of the Proximal Policy Optimisation algorithm are proven by the enhanced learning curve with comparison to the Advantage Actor-Critic approach, as the learning process is characterised by faster growth with a significantly smaller variation. Finally, the applicability of such algorithms in the described scenarios is discussed, alongside the possible improvements and future work.

AB  - Investigating the coil&ndash;magnet structure plays a significant role in the design process of the electromagnetic energy harvester due to the effect on the harvester&rsquo;s performance. In this paper, the performance of four different electromagnetic vibration energy harvesters with cylindrical shapes constrained in the same volume were under investigation. The utilized structures are (i) two opposite polarized magnets spaced by a mild steel; (ii) a Halbach array with three magnets and one coil; (iii) a Halbach array with five magnets and one coil; and (iv) a Halbach array with five magnets and three coils. We utilized a completely automatic optimization procedure with the help of an optimization algorithm implemented in Python, supported by simulations in ANSYS Maxwell and MATLAB Simulink to obtain the maximum output power for each configuration. The simulation results show that the Halbach array with three magnets and one coil is the best for configurations with the Halbach array. Additionally, among all configurations, the harvester with two opposing magnets provides the highest output power and volume power density, while the Halbach array with three magnets and one coil provides the highest mass power density. The paper also demonstrates limitations of using the electromagnetic coupling coefficient as a metric for harvester optimization, if the ultimate goal is maximization of output power.

AB  - Object counting is an active research area that gained more attention in the past few years. In smart cities, vehicle counting plays a crucial role in urban planning and management of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to address this problem. However, the resulting detection accuracy is still not adequate. This paper proposes an efficient approach that uses deep learning concepts and correlation filters for multi-object counting and tracking. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using a dataset consisting of 16 videos with different features to examine the impact of object density, image quality, angle of view, and speed of motion towards system accuracy. Performance evaluation exhibits promising results in normal traffic scenarios and adverse weather conditions. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms the performance of two recent approaches from the literature.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has already gained the attention of the researchers involved in smart city (SC) initiatives, along with other advanced technologies such as IoT, big data, cloud computing, or analytics. In this context, researchers also realized that data can help in making the SC happen but also, the open data movement has encouraged more research works using machine learning. Based on this line of reasoning, the aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review to investigate open data-based machine learning applications in the six different areas of smart cities. The results of this research reveal that: (a) machine learning applications using open data came out in all the SC areas and specific ML techniques are discovered for each area, with deep learning and supervised learning being the first choices. (b) Open data platforms represent the most frequently used source of data. (c) The challenges associated with open data utilization vary from quality of data, to frequency of data collection, to consistency of data, and data format. Overall, the data synopsis as well as the in-depth analysis may be a valuable support and inspiration for the future smart city projects.

AB  - The role of energy is cardinal for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the enhancement and modernization of energy generation and management practices. The smart grid enables efficient communication between utilities and the end- users, and enhances the user experience by monitoring and controlling the energy transmission. The smart grid deals with an enormous amount of energy data, and the absence of proper techniques for data collection, processing, monitoring and decision-making ultimately makes the system ineffective. Big data analytics, in association with the smart grid, enable better grid visualization and contribute toward the attainment of sustainability. The current research work deals with the achievement of sustainability in the smart grid and efficient data management using big data analytics, that has social, economic, technical and political impacts. This study provides clear insights into energy data generated in the grid and the possibilities of energy theft affecting the sustainable future. The paper provides insights about the importance of big data analytics, with their effects on the smart grids&rsquo; performance towards the achievement of SDGs. The work highlights efficient real-time energy data management involving artificial intelligence and machine learning for a better future, to short out the effects of the conventional smart grid without big data analytics. Finally, the work discusses the challenges and future directions to improve smart grid technologies with big data analytics in action.

TI  - A Survey of Recent Indoor Localization Scenarios and Methodologies
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recently, various novel scenarios have been studied for indoor localization. The trilateration is known as a classic theoretical model of geometric-based indoor localization, with uniform RSSI data that can be transferred directly into distance ranges. Then, a trilateration solution can be algebraically acquired from theses ranges, in order to fix user&rsquo;s actual location. However, the collected RSSI or other measurement data should be further processed and classified to lower the localization error rate, instead of using the raw data influenced by multi-path effect, multiple nonlinear interference and noises. In this survey, a large number of existing techniques are presented for different indoor network structures and channel conditions, divided as LOS (light-of-sight) and NLOS (non light-of-sight). Besides, the input measurement data such as RSSI (received signal strength indication), TDOA (time difference of arrival), DOA (distance of arrival), and RTT (round trip time) are studied towards different application scenarios. The key localization techniques like RSSI-based fingerprinting technique are presented using supervised machine learning methods, namely SVM (support vector machine), KNN (K nearest neighbors) and NN (neural network) methods, especially in an offline training phase. Other unsupervised methods as isolation forest, k-means, and expectation maximization methods are utilized to further improve the localization accuracy in online testing phase. For Bayesian filtering methods, apart from the basic linear Kalman filter (LKF) methods, nonlinear stochastic filters such as extended KF, cubature KF, unscented KF and particle filters are introduced. These nonlinear methods are more suitable for dynamic localization models. In addition to the localization accuracy, the other important performance features and evaluation aspects are presented in our paper: scalability, stability, reliability, and the complexity of proposed algorithms is compared in this survey. Our paper provides a comprehensive perspective to compare the existing techniques and related practical localization models, with the aim of improving localization accuracy and reducing the complexity of the system.

AB  - LiDAR sensors are needed for use in vehicular applications, particularly due to their good behavior in low-light environments, as they represent a possible solution for the safety systems of vehicles that have a long braking distance, such as trams. The testing of long-range LiDAR dynamic responses is very important for vehicle applications because of the presence of difficult operation conditions, such as different weather conditions or fake targets between the sensor and the tracked vehicle. The goal of the authors in this paper was to develop an experimental model for indoor testing, using a scaled vehicle that can measure the distances and the speeds relative to a fixed or a moving obstacle. This model, containing a LiDAR sensor, was developed to operate at variable speeds, at which the software functions were validated by repeated tests. Once the software procedures are validated, they can be applied on the full-scale model. The findings of this research include the validation of the frontal distance and relative speed measurement methodology, in addition to the validation of the independence of the measurements to the color of the obstacle and to the ambient light.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 24
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The recent development in the area of IoT technologies is likely to be implemented extensively in the next decade. There is a great increase in the crime rate, and the handling officers are responsible for dealing with a broad range of cyber and Internet issues during investigation. IoT technologies are helpful in the identification of suspects, and few technologies are available that use IoT and deep learning together for face sketch synthesis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other constructs of deep learning have become major tools in recent approaches. A new-found architecture of the neural network is anticipated in this work. It is called Spiral-Net, which is a modified version of U-Net fto perform face sketch synthesis (the phase is known as the compiler network C here). Spiral-Net performs in combination with a pre-trained Vgg-19 network called the feature extractor F. It first identifies the top n matches from viewed sketches to a given photo. F is again used to formulate a feature map based on the cosine distance of a candidate sketch formed by C from the top n matches. A customized CNN configuration (called the discriminator D) then computes loss functions based on differences between the candidate sketch and the feature. Values of these loss functions alternately update C and F. The ensemble of these nets is trained and tested on selected datasets, including CUFS, CUFSF, and a part of the IIT photo&ndash;sketch dataset. Results of this modified U-Net are acquired by the legacy NLDA (1998) scheme of face recognition and its newer version, OpenBR (2013), which demonstrate an improvement of 5% compared with the current state of the art in its relevant domain.

TI  - Stormwater Runoff Treatment Using Rain Garden: Performance Monitoring and Development of Deep Learning-Based Water Quality Prediction Models
T2  - Water

VL  - 13

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Twenty-three rainfall events were monitored to determine the characteristics of the stormwater runoff entering a rain garden facility and evaluate its performance in terms of pollutant removal and volume reduction. Data gathered during the five-year monitoring period were utilized to develop a deep learning-based model that can predict the concentrations of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Total Phosphorus (TP). Findings revealed that the rain garden was capable of effectively reducing solids, organics, nutrients, and heavy metals from stormwater runoff during the five-year period when hydrologic and climate conditions have changed. Volume reduction was also high but can decrease over time due to the accumulation of solids in the facility which reduced the infiltration capacity and increased ponding and overflows especially during heavy rainfalls. A preliminary development of a water quality prediction model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture was also developed to be able to potentially reduce the labor and costs associated with on-site monitoring in the future. The LSTM model predicted pollutant concentrations that are close to the actual values with a mean square error of 0.36 during calibration and a less than 10% difference from the measured values during validation. The study showed the potential of using deep learning architecture for the prediction of stormwater quality parameters entering rain gardens. While this study is still in the preliminary stage, it can potentially be improved for use in performance monitoring, decision-making regarding maintenance, and design of similar technologies in the future.

AB  - Since 2020, the world is still facing a global economic and health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One approach to fighting this global crisis is to track COVID-19 cases by wireless technologies, which requires receiving reliable, efficient, and accurate data. Consequently, this article proposes a model based on Lagrange optimization and a distributed deep learning model to assure that all required data for tracking any suspected COVID-19 patient is received efficiently and reliably. Finding the optimum location of the Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) reader relevant to the base station results in the reliable transmission of data. The proposed deep learning model, developed using the one-dimensional convolutional neural network and a fully connected network, resulted in lower mean absolute squared errors when compared to state-of-the-art regression benchmarks. The proposed model based on Lagrange optimization and deep learning algorithms is evaluated when changing different network parameters, such as requiring signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio, reader transmission power, and the required system quality-of-service. The analysis of the obtained results, which indicates the appropriate transmission distance between an RFID reader and a base station, shows the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed approach, which leads to an easy and efficient tracking system.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The role of a service that is dedicated to road weather analysis is to issue forecasts and warnings to users regarding roadway conditions, thereby making it possible to anticipate dangerous traffic conditions, especially during the winter period. It is important to define pavement conditions at all times. In this paper, a new data acquisition approach is proposed that is based upon the analysis and combination of two sensors in real time by nanocomputer. The first sensor is a camera that records images and videos of the road network. The second sensor is a microphone that records the tire&ndash;pavement interaction, to characterize each surface&rsquo;s condition. The two low-cost sensors were fed to different deep learning architectures that are specialized in surface state analysis; the results were combined using an evidential theory-based data fusion approach. This study is a proof of concept, to test an evidential approach for improving classification with deep learning, applied to only two sensors; however, one could very well add more sensors and make the nanocomputers communicate together, to analyze a larger urban environment.

AB  - Vehicle Re-identification (re-id) over surveillance camera network with non-overlapping field of view is an exciting and challenging task in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Due to its versatile applicability in metropolitan cities, it gained significant attention. Vehicle re-id matches targeted vehicle over non-overlapping views in multiple camera network. However, it becomes more difficult due to inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, viewpoint changes, and spatio-temporal uncertainty. In order to draw a detailed picture of vehicle re-id research, this paper gives a comprehensive description of the various vehicle re-id technologies, applicability, datasets, and a brief comparison of different methodologies. Our paper specifically focuses on vision-based vehicle re-id approaches, including vehicle appearance, license plate, and spatio-temporal characteristics. In addition, we explore the main challenges as well as a variety of applications in different domains. Lastly, a detailed comparison of current state-of-the-art methods performances over VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets is summarized with future directions. We aim to facilitate future research by reviewing the work being done on vehicle re-id till to date.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Modern cities require a tighter integration with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for bringing new services to the citizens. The Smart City is the revolutionary paradigm aiming at integrating the ICT with the citizen life; among several urban services, transports are one of the most important in modern cities, introducing several challenges to the Smart City paradigm. In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of new vehicular applications and services, Edge Computing (EC) is one of the most promising technologies when integrated into the Vehicular Networks (VNs). EC-enabled VNs can facilitate new latency-critical and data-intensive applications and services. However, ground-based EC platforms (i.e., Road Side Units&mdash;RSUs, 5G Base Stations&mdash;5G BS) can only serve a reduced number of Vehicular Users (VUs), due to short coverage ranges and resource shortage. In the recent past, several new aerial platforms with integrated EC facilities have been deployed for achieving global connectivity. Such air-based EC platforms can complement the ground-based EC facilities for creating a futuristic VN able to deploy several new applications and services. The goal of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a novel joint air-ground EC platform within a VN architecture for helping VUs with new intelligent applications and services. By exploiting most modern technologies, with particular attention towards network softwarization, vehicular edge computing, and machine learning, we propose here three possible layered air-ground EC-enabled VN scenarios. For each of the discussed scenarios, a list of the possible challenges is considered, as well possible solutions allowing to overcome all or some of the considered challenges. A proper comparison is also done, through the use of tables, where all the proposed scenarios, and the proposed solutions, are discussed.

AB  - Through recent progress, the forms of modern supply chains have evolved into complex networks. The supply chain management systems face a variety of challenges. These include lack of visibility of the upstream party (Provider) to the downstream party (Client); lack of flexibility in the face of sudden variations in demand and control of operating costs; lack of reliance on safety stakeholders; ineffective management of supply chain risks. Blockchain (BC) is used in the supply chain to overcome the growing demands for items. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a profoundly encouraging innovation that can help companies observe, track, and monitor products, activities, and processes within their respective value chain networks. Research establishments and logical gatherings are ceaselessly attempting to answer IoT gadgets in supply chain management. This paper presents orderly writing on and reviewing of Blockchain-based IoT advances and their current usage. We discuss the smart devices used in this system and which device is the most appropriate in the supply chain. This paper also looks at future examination themes in blockchain-based IoT, referred to as the executive&rsquo;s framework production network. The essential deliberate writing audit has been consolidated by surveying research articles circulated in highly reputable publications between 2016 and 2021. Lastly, current issues and challenges are present to provide researchers with promising future directions in IoT supply chain management systems.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of Indoor Spatial Information from Floor Plan Image: A Patch-Based Deep Learning Methodology Application on Large-Scale Complex Buildings

AB  - Automatic floor plan analysis has gained increased attention in recent research. However, numerous studies related to this area are mainly experiments conducted with a simplified floor plan dataset with low resolution and a small housing scale due to the suitability for a data-driven model. For practical use, it is necessary to focus more on large-scale complex buildings to utilize indoor structures, such as reconstructing multi-use buildings for indoor navigation. This study aimed to build a framework using CNN (Convolution Neural Networks) for analyzing a floor plan with various scales of complex buildings. By dividing a floor plan into a set of normalized patches, the framework enables the proposed CNN model to process varied scale or high-resolution inputs, which is a barrier for existing methods. The model detected building objects per patch and assembled them into one result by multiplying the corresponding translation matrix. Finally, the detected building objects were vectorized, considering their compatibility in 3D modeling. As a result, our framework exhibited similar performance in detection rate (87.77%) and recognition accuracy (85.53%) to that of existing studies, despite the complexity of the data used. Through our study, the practical aspects of automatic floor plan analysis can be expanded.

AB  - Statistical reports say that, from 2011 to 2021, more than 11,915 stray animals, such as cats, dogs, goats, cows, etc., and wild animals were wounded in road accidents. Most of the accidents occurred due to negligence and doziness of drivers. These issues can be handled brilliantly using stray and wild animals-vehicle interaction and the pedestrians&rsquo; awareness. This paper briefs a detailed forum on GPU-based embedded systems and ODT real-time applications. ML trains machines to recognize images more accurately than humans. This provides a unique and real-time solution using deep-learning real 3D motion-based YOLOv3 (DL-R-3D-YOLOv3) ODT of images on mobility. Besides, it discovers methods for multiple views of flexible objects using 3D reconstruction, especially for stray and wild animals. Computer vision-based IoT devices are also besieged by this DL-R-3D-YOLOv3 model. It seeks solutions by forecasting image filters to find object properties and semantics for object recognition methods leading to closed-loop ODT.

AB  - Maintaining a healthy cyber society is a great challenge due to the users&rsquo; freedom of expression and behavior. This can be solved by monitoring and analyzing the users&rsquo; behavior and taking proper actions. This research aims to present a platform that monitors the public content on Twitter by extracting tweet data. After maintaining the data, the users&rsquo; interactions are analyzed using graph analysis methods. Then, the users&rsquo; behavioral patterns are analyzed by applying metadata analysis, in which the timeline of each profile is obtained; also, the time-series behavioral features of users are investigated. Then, in the abnormal behavior detection and filtering component, the interesting profiles are selected for further examinations. Finally, in the contextual analysis component, the contents are analyzed using natural language processing techniques; a binary text classification model (SVM (Support Vector Machine) + TF-IDF (Term Frequency&mdash;Inverse Document Frequency) with 88.89% accuracy) is used to detect if a tweet is related to crime or not. Then, a sentiment analysis method is applied to the crime-related tweets to perform aspect-based sentiment analysis (DistilBERT + FFNN (Feed-Forward Neural Network) with 80% accuracy), because sharing positive opinions about a crime-related topic can threaten society. This platform aims to provide the end-user (the police) with suggestions to control hate speech or terrorist propaganda.

AB  - Smart cities support the enhancement of the quality of life of their residents, for which the use of a robust integrated platform of information and communication technology is required. However, not all cities have similar technology infrastructure and a similar understanding of the quality of life. Therefore, holistic planning, resource support, security, continuous updates, and dynamic operational enhancements should be considered while planning smart cities. However, a smart city could be vulnerable to security threats and a loss of personal or classified information due to the complexity of technology integration. Therefore, understanding and assessing different risks and embedding risk management mechanisms would be required to minimize vulnerability exposure in smart cities. This paper proposes a risk assessment method using the Dempster&ndash;Shafer theory for smart city planning. The Dempster&ndash;Shafer theory is used here to analyze the risks perceptions of experts. The principal component analysis method is used to analyze the data obtained from risk assessment. The application of this method is determined through a smart city test case in Qatar.

AB  - Owing to the hasty growth of communication technologies in the Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT), many researchers and industries focus on enhancing the existing technologies of UIoT systems for developing numerous applications such as oceanography, diver networks monitoring, deep-sea exploration and early warning systems. In a constrained UIoT environment, communication media such as acoustic, infrared (IR), visible light, radiofrequency (RF) and magnet induction (MI) are generally used to transmit information via digitally linked underwater devices. However, each medium has its technical limitations: for example, the acoustic medium has challenges such as narrow-channel bandwidth, low data rate, high cost, etc., and optical medium has challenges such as high absorption, scattering, long-distance data transmission, etc. Moreover, the malicious node can steal the underwater data by employing blackhole attacks, routing attacks, Sybil attacks, etc. Furthermore, due to heavyweight, the existing privacy and security mechanism of the terrestrial internet of things (IoT) cannot be applied directly to UIoT environment. Hence, this paper aims to provide a systematic review of recent trends, applications, communication technologies, challenges, security threats and privacy issues of UIoT system. Additionally, this paper highlights the methods of preventing the technical challenges and security attacks of the UIoT environment. Finally, this systematic review contributes much to the profit of researchers to analyze and improve the performance of services in UIoT applications.

AB  - The bulk of water pipes experience major degradation and deterioration problems. This research aims at estimating the condition of water pipes in Shattora and Shaker Al-Bahery&rsquo;s water distribution networks, in Egypt. The developed models involve training the Elman neural network (ENN) and feed-forward neural network (FFNN) coupled with particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithms (GA), the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), and the teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm. For the Shattora network, the inputs to these models are pipe characteristics such as length, wall thickness, diameter, material, lining and coating, surface type, traffic distribution, cathodic protection, flow velocity, and c-factor. For the Shaker Al-Bahery network, the data gathered include length, material, age, diameter, depth, and wall thickness. Three assessment criteria are used to evaluate the suggested machine learning models, namely index of agreement (IOA), correlation coefficient (R), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The results reveal that coupling FFNN with the TLBO algorithm outperforms other prediction models. Therefore, the FFNN-TLBO model can be a valuable tool for simulating the water network pipe condition. This study could help the water municipality allocate the available budget effectively and plan the required maintenance and rehabilitation actions.

AB  - The increasing role of emerging technologies, such as big data, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive technologies, cloud computing, and mobile technologies, is essential to the business process manager profession&rsquo;s sustainable development. Nevertheless, these technologies could involve new challenges in labor markets. The era of intelligent business process management (BPM) has begun, but how does it look in real labor markets? This paper examines the hypothesis that the transformation of the business process manager profession has been caused by certain determinants that involve the need for an improvement in BPM skills. The main contribution is a model of the dimensions of the impact of digital technologies on business process management supplemented with skills that influence the business process manager profession. The paper fills the gap in research on perspectives of the impact of digital technologies on business process management, considering both a literature analysis and labor market research. The purpose of the literature review was to identify the core dimensions that drive the use of emerging technologies in business process management. The labor market study was conducted in order to analyze the current demand for core skills of business process managers in the Polish labor market with a particular emphasis on the intelligent BPM concept. Additionally, to study the determinants that slow down the iBPM concept&rsquo;s development, the digital intensity level of the enterprises and public administration units in Poland was studied. Finally, a fuzzy cognitive map presenting the core determinants of the business process manager profession&rsquo;s transformation is described.

Unlike traditional information technology (I.T.) systems, the IoT environment is challenging to secure due to resource constraints, heterogeneity, and distributed nature of the smart devices. This makes it impossible to apply host-based prevention mechanisms such as anti-malware and anti-virus. These challenges and the nature of IoT applications call for a monitoring system such as anomaly detection both at device and network levels beyond the organisational boundary. This suggests an anomaly detection system is strongly positioned to secure IoT devices better than any other security mechanism. In this paper, we aim to provide an in-depth review of existing works in developing anomaly detection solutions using machine learning for protecting an IoT system. We also indicate that blockchain-based anomaly detection systems can collaboratively learn effective machine learning models to detect anomalies.

TI  - Developing a Scoring System to Evaluate the Level of Smartness in Commercial Buildings: A Case of Sri Lanka
T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Smart buildings (SBs) are developed in many different ways and are self-proclaimed smart. There are a great number of publications introducing smart systems using a wider range of tools and sensors. However, the level of smartness, functions of the smart system, and the usefulness of the system are not the same, which may give a wrong impression to clients or potential buyers of a building. Developing a scoring system that enables determining the overall smartness of a building is necessary. Despite the necessity, there is a dearth of studies in this area. Hence, the purpose of this study is to develop a scoring system to evaluate the level of smartness of Sri Lankan commercial buildings. Thus, initially, smart criteria were identified, defined, and categorized through a literature survey. Subsequently, 35 experts in the commercial building sector were interviewed. Finally, the relative importance of the smart criteria was derived through the AHP technique, and accordingly, a scoring system was developed. The study identified six main criteria to evaluate the smartness of buildings in the scoring system. The automation criterion with the highest relative weight was concluded to be the dominant criterion (45.59%) in the scoring system. Communication and data sharing were placed at second with a relative weight of 18.76% and indicates the importance given by the study findings in establishing the backbones of SBs. Occupants&rsquo; comfort, energy management, occupants&rsquo; health and safety, and sustainability criterion were ranked third, fourth, fifth, and sixth within the scoring system. This study is one of the first to investigate in detail the contribution of both soft and hard services of a facility in determining the overall smartness of a building. Property developers in the commercial building sector can benefit from this study by recognizing the necessary criteria to be embedded in their SB development projects in order to attract more tenants and customers.

TI  - A Multi-Provider End-to-End Dynamic Orchestration Architecture Approach for 5G and Future Communication Systems
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 24
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Network segregation is the solution adopted in the IMT-2020 standardization of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), better known as 5G networks (Fifth Generation Mobile Networks), under development to meet the requirements of performance, reliability, energy, and economic efficiency required by applications in the various verticals of current and near-future economic activities. The philosophy adopted for the IMT-2020 standardization relies on the use of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and Software-Defined Radio (SDR), i.e., the softwarization of the network. Softwarization allows network segregation through its slicing, which is discussed herein this work. Network slicing is performed by a novel Orchestrator, as provided in IMT-2020, which maintains the end-to-end network slices independent of each other and performs horizontal handover when the possibility of a loss of Quality of Service (QoS) is predictively detected by monitoring quality parameters during operation. Therefore, the Orchestrator is dynamic, operates in uptime, and allows horizontal handover. Hence, it chooses the most appropriate telecommunication infrastructure provider and network operator to guarantee QoS and Quality of Experience (QoE) to end-users in each network segment. These features make this work modern and keep it aligned with the actions being carried out by ITU. Based on this objective, as the main result of this paper, we propose an effective architecture for implementing the Orchestrator, not only to contribute to the state of the art for 5G and beyond communication systems but also to generate economic, technological, and social impacts.

AB  - Companies are increasingly gathering and analyzing time-series data, driven by the rising number of IoT devices. Many works in literature describe analysis systems built using either data-driven or semantic (knowledge-driven) techniques. However, little to no works describe hybrid combinations of these two. Dyversify, a collaborative project between industry and academia, investigated how event and anomaly detection can be performed on time-series data in such a hybrid setting. We built a proof-of-concept analysis platform, using a microservice architecture to ensure scalability and fault-tolerance. The platform comprises time-series ingestion, long term storage, data semantification, event detection using data-driven and semantic techniques, dynamic visualization, and user feedback. In this work, we describe the system architecture of this hybrid analysis platform and give an overview of the different components and their interactions. As such, the main contribution of this work is an experience report with challenges faced and lessons learned.

AB  - Recently released research about deep learning applications related to perception for autonomous driving focuses heavily on the usage of LiDAR point cloud data as input for the neural networks, highlighting the importance of LiDAR technology in the field of Autonomous Driving (AD). In this sense, a great percentage of the vehicle platforms used to create the datasets released for the development of these neural networks, as well as some AD commercial solutions available on the market, heavily invest in an array of sensors, including a large number of sensors as well as several sensor modalities. However, these costs create a barrier to entry for low-cost solutions for the performance of critical perception tasks such as Object Detection and SLAM. This paper explores current vehicle platforms and proposes a low-cost, LiDAR-based test vehicle platform capable of running critical perception tasks (Object Detection and SLAM) in real time. Additionally, we propose the creation of a deep learning-based inference model for Object Detection deployed in a resource-constrained device, as well as a graph-based SLAM implementation, providing important considerations, explored while taking into account the real-time processing requirement and presenting relevant results demonstrating the usability of the developed work in the context of the proposed low-cost platform.

AB  - Advancement in network technology has vastly increased the usage of the Internet. Consequently, there has been a rise in traffic volume and data sharing. This has made securing a network from sophisticated intrusion attacks very important to preserve users&rsquo; information and privacy. Our research focuses on combating and detecting intrusion attacks and preserving the integrity of online systems. In our research we first create a benchmark model for detecting intrusions and then employ various combinations of feature selection techniques based upon ensemble machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of the intrusion detection system. The performance of our model was investigated using three evaluation metrics namely: elimination time, accuracy and F1-score. The results of the experiment indicated that the random forest feature selection technique had the minimum elimination time, whereas the support vector machine model had the best accuracy and F1-score. Therefore, conclusive evidence could be drawn that the combination of random forest and support vector machine is suitable for low latency and highly accurate intrusion detection systems.

AB  - The purpose of the current investigation is to find the numerical solutions of the novel fractional order pantograph singular system (FOPSS) using the applications of Meyer wavelets as a neural network. The FOPSS is presented using the standard form of the Lane&ndash;Emden equation and the detailed discussions of the singularity, shape factor terms along with the fractional order forms. The numerical discussions of the FOPSS are described based on the fractional Meyer wavelets (FMWs) as a neural network (NN) with the optimization procedures of global/local search procedures of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and interior-point algorithm (IPA), i.e., FMWs-NN-PSOIPA. The FMWs-NN strength is pragmatic and forms a merit function based on the differential system and the initial conditions of the FOPSS. The merit function is optimized, using the integrated capability of PSOIPA. The perfection, verification and substantiation of the FOPSS using the FMWs is pragmatic for three cases through relative investigations from the true results in terms of stability and convergence. Additionally, the statics&rsquo; descriptions further authorize the presentation of the FMWs-NN-PSOIPA in terms of reliability and accuracy.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper introduces an integrated IoT architecture to handle the problem of cyber attacks based on a developed deep neural network (DNN) with a rectified linear unit in order to provide reliable and secure online monitoring for automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The developed IoT architecture based on a DNN introduces a new approach for the online monitoring of AGVs against cyber attacks with a cheap and easy implementation instead of the traditional cyber attack detection schemes in the literature. The proposed DNN is trained based on experimental AGV data that represent the real state of the AGV and different types of cyber attacks including a random attack, ramp attack, pulse attack, and sinusoidal attack that is injected by the attacker into the internet network. The proposed DNN is compared with different deep learning and machine learning algorithms such as a one dimension convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), a supported vector machine model (SVM), random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a decision tree for greater validation. Furthermore, the proposed IoT architecture based on a DNN can provide an effective detection for the AGV status with an excellent accuracy of 96.77% that is significantly greater than the accuracy based on the traditional schemes. The AGV status based on the proposed IoT architecture with a DNN is visualized by an advanced IoT platform named CONTACT Elements for IoT. Different test scenarios with a practical setup of an AGV with IoT are carried out to emphasize the performance of the suggested IoT architecture based on a DNN. The results approve the usefulness of the proposed IoT to provide effective cybersecurity for data visualization and tracking of the AGV status that enhances decision-making and improves industrial productivity.

AB  - To equip computers with human communication skills and to enable natural interaction between the computer and a human, intelligent solutions are required based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods, algorithms, and sensor technology. This study aimed at identifying and analyzing the state-of-the-art AI methods and algorithms and sensors technology in existing human&ndash;computer intelligent interaction (HCII) research to explore trends in HCII research, categorize existing evidence, and identify potential directions for future research. We conduct a systematic mapping study of the HCII body of research. Four hundred fifty-four studies published in various journals and conferences between 2010 and 2021 were identified and analyzed. Studies in the HCII and IUI fields have primarily been focused on intelligent recognition of emotion, gestures, and facial expressions using sensors technology, such as the camera, EEG, Kinect, wearable sensors, eye tracker, gyroscope, and others. Researchers most often apply deep-learning and instance-based AI methods and algorithms. The support sector machine (SVM) is the most widely used algorithm for various kinds of recognition, primarily an emotion, facial expression, and gesture. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is the often-used deep-learning algorithm for emotion recognition, facial recognition, and gesture recognition solutions.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has changed the worldwide network of people, smart devices, intelligent things, data, and information as an emergent technology. IoT development is still in its early stages, and numerous interrelated challenges must be addressed. IoT is the unifying idea of embedding everything. The Internet of Things offers a huge opportunity to improve the world&rsquo;s accessibility, integrity, availability, scalability, confidentiality, and interoperability. However, securing the Internet of Things is a difficult issue. The IoT aims to connect almost everything within the framework of a common infrastructure. This helps in controlling devices and, will allow device status to be updated everywhere and at any time. To develop technology via IoT, several critical scientific studies and inquiries have been carried out. However, many obstacles and problems remain to be tackled in order to reach IoT&rsquo;s maximum potential. These problems and concerns must be taken into consideration in different areas of the IoT, such as implementation in remote areas, threats to the system, development support, social and environmental impacts, etc. This paper reviews the current state of the art in different IoT architectures, with a focus on current technologies, applications, challenges, IoT protocols, and opportunities. As a result, a detailed taxonomy of IoT is presented here which includes interoperability, scalability, security and energy efficiency, among other things. Moreover, the significance of blockchains and big data as well as their analysis in relation to IoT, is discussed. This article aims to help readers and researchers understand the IoT and its applicability to the real world.

AB  - Cloud computing provides the flexible architecture where data and resources are dispersed at various locations and are accessible from various industrial environments. Cloud computing has changed the using, storing, and sharing of resources such as data, services, and applications for industrial applications. During the last decade, industries have rapidly switched to cloud computing for having more comprehensive access, reduced cost, and increased performance. In addition, significant improvement has been observed in the internet of things (IoT) with the integration of cloud computing. However, this rapid transition into the cloud raised various security issues and concerns. Traditional security solutions are not directly applicable and sometimes ineffective for cloud-based systems. Cloud platforms&rsquo; challenges and security concerns have been addressed during the last three years, despite the successive use and proliferation of multifaceted cyber weapons. The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) in the artificial intelligence (AI) domain has brought many benefits that can be utilized to address industrial security issues in the cloud. The findings of the proposed research include the following: we present a comprehensive survey of enabling cloud-based IoT architecture, services, configurations, and security models; the classification of cloud security concerns in IoT into four major categories (data, network and service, applications, and people-related security issues), which are discussed in detail; we identify and inspect the latest advancements in cloud-based IoT attacks; we identify, discuss, and analyze significant security issues in each category and present the limitations from a general, artificial intelligence and deep learning perspective; we provide the technological challenges identified in the literature and then identify significant research gaps in the IoT-based cloud infrastructure to highlight future research directions to blend cybersecurity in cloud.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The rapid development of industrialization and urbanization has had a substantial impact on the increasing air pollution in many populated cities around the globe. Intensive research has shown that ambient aerosols, especially the fine particulate matter PM2.5, are highly correlated with human respiratory diseases. It is critical to analyze, forecast, and mitigate PM2.5 concentrations. One of the typical meteorological phenomena seducing PM2.5 concentrations to accumulate is temperature inversion which forms a warm-air cap to blockade the surface pollutants from dissipating. This paper analyzes the meteorological patterns which coincide with temperature inversion and proposes two machine learning classifiers for temperature inversion classification. A separate multivariate regression model is trained for the class with or without manifesting temperature inversion phenomena, in order to improve PM2.5 forecasting performance. We chose Puli township as the studied site, which is a basin city easily trapping PM2.5 concentrations. The experimental results with the dataset spanning from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019 show that the proposed temperature inversion classifiers exhibit satisfactory performance in F1-Score, and the regression models trained from the classified datasets can significantly improve the PM2.5 concentration forecast as compared to the model using a single dataset without considering the temperature inversion factor.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid PSO Enhanced ANFIS Model in Prediction of Traffic Flow of Vehicles on Freeways: Traffic Data Evidence from South Africa
T2  - Infrastructures

PY  - 2022
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
SN  - 2412-3811

AB  - In the last few years, there has been a significant rise in the number of private vehicles ownership, migration of people from rural areas to urban cities, and the rise in the number of under-maintained freeways; all these have added to the perennial problem of traffic congestion. Traffic flow prediction has been recognized as the solution in alleviating and reducing the problem of traffic congestion. In this research, we developed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system trained by particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO) by performing an evaluative performance of the model through traffic flow modelling of vehicles on five freeways (N1,N3,N12,N14&nbsp;and&nbsp;N17) using South Africa Transportation System as a case study. Six hundred and fifty (650) traffic data were collected using inductive loop detectors and video cameras from the five freeways. The traffic data used for developing these models comprises traffic volume, traffic density, speed of vehicles, time, and different types of vehicles. The traffic data were divided into 70% and 30% for the training and validation of the model. The model results show a positively correlated optimal performance between the inputs and the output with a regression value R2&nbsp; of 0.9978 and 0.9860 for the training and testing. The result of this research shows that the soft computing model ANFIS-PSO used in this research can model vehicular traffic flow on freeways. Furthermore, the evidence from this research suggests that the on-peak and off-peak hours are significant determinants of vehicular traffic flow on freeways. The modelling approach developed in this research will assist urban planners in developing practical ways to tackle traffic congestion and assist motorists and pedestrians in travel behaviour decision-making. Finally, the approach used in this study will assist transportation engineers in making constructive and safety dependent guidelines for drivers and pedestrians on freeways.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A fire is an extraordinary event that can damage property and have a notable effect on people&rsquo;s lives. However, the early detection of smoke and fire has been identified as a challenge in many recent studies. Therefore, different solutions have been proposed to approach the timely detection of fire events and avoid human casualties. As a solution, we used an affordable visual detection system. This method is possibly effective because early fire detection is recognized. In most developed countries, CCTV surveillance systems are installed in almost every public location to take periodic images of a specific area. Notwithstanding, cameras are used under different types of ambient light, and they experience occlusions, distortions of view, and changes in the resulting images from different camera angles and the different seasons of the year, all of which affect the accuracy of currently established models. To address these problems, we developed an approach based on an attention feature map used in a capsule network designed to classify fire and smoke locations at different distances outdoors, given only an image of a single fire and smoke as input. The proposed model was designed to solve two main limitations of the base capsule network input and the analysis of large-sized images, as well as to compensate the absence of a deep network using an attention-based approach to improve the classification of the fire and smoke results. In term of practicality, our method is comparable with prior strategies based on machine learning and deep learning methods. We trained and tested the proposed model using our datasets collected from different sources. As the results indicate, a high classification accuracy in comparison with other modern architectures was achieved. Further, the results indicate that the proposed approach is robust and stable for the classification of images from outdoor CCTV cameras with different viewpoints given the presence of smoke and fire.

PY  - 2022

AB  - In order to realize the real-time and accurate detection of potted flowers on benches, in this paper we propose a method based on the ZED 2 stereo camera and the YOLO V4-Tiny deep learning algorithm for potted flower detection and location. First, an automatic detection model of flowers was established based on the YOLO V4-Tiny convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and the center points on the pixel plane of the flowers were obtained according to the prediction box. Then, the real-time 3D point cloud information obtained by the ZED 2 camera was used to calculate the actual position of the flowers. The test results showed that the mean average precision (MAP) and recall rate of the training model was 89.72% and 80%, respectively, and the real-time average detection frame rate of the model deployed under Jetson TX2 was 16 FPS. The results of the occlusion experiment showed that when the canopy overlap ratio between the two flowers is more than 10%, the recognition accuracy will be affected. The mean absolute error of the flower center location based on 3D point cloud information of the ZED 2 camera was 18.1 mm, and the maximum locating error of the flower center was 25.8 mm under different light radiation conditions. The method in this paper establishes the relationship between the detection target of flowers and the actual spatial location, which has reference significance for the machinery and automatic management of potted flowers on benches.

TI  - Inspecting Buildings Using Drones and Computer Vision: A Machine Learning Approach to Detect Cracks and Damages
T2  - Drones

PY  - 2022
VL  - 6

SN  - 2504-446X

AB  - Manual inspection of infrastructure damages such as building cracks is difficult due to the objectivity and reliability of assessment and high demands of time and costs. This can be automated using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery of damages. Numerous computer vision-based approaches have been applied to address the limitations of crack detection but they have their limitations that can be overcome by using various hybrid approaches based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs), an application of the deep learning (DL) method, display remarkable potential for automatically detecting image features such as damages and are less sensitive to image noise. A modified deep hierarchical CNN architecture has been used in this study for crack detection and damage assessment in civil infrastructures. The proposed architecture is based on 16 convolution layers and a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). For this study, the crack images were collected using UAVs and open-source images of mid to high rise buildings (five stories and above) constructed during 2000 in Sydney, Australia. Conventionally, a CNN network only utilizes the last layer of convolution. However, our proposed network is based on the utility of multiple layers. Another important component of the proposed CNN architecture is the application of guided filtering (GF) and conditional random fields (CRFs) to refine the predicted outputs to get reliable results. Benchmarking data (600 images) of Sydney-based buildings damages was used to test the proposed architecture. The proposed deep hierarchical CNN architecture produced superior performance when evaluated using five methods: GF method, Baseline (BN) method, Deep-Crack BN, Deep-Crack GF, and SegNet. Overall, the GF method outperformed all other methods as indicated by the global accuracy (0.990), class average accuracy (0.939), mean intersection of the union overall classes (IoU) (0.879), precision (0.838), recall (0.879), and F-score (0.8581) values. Overall, the proposed CNN architecture provides the advantages of reduced noise, highly integrated supervision of features, adequate learning, and aggregation of both multi-scale and multilevel features during the training procedure along with the refinement of the overall output predictions.

AB  - Electricity loads are basic and important information for power generation facilities and traders, especially in terms of production plans, daily operations, unit commitments, and economic dispatches. Short-term load forecasting (STLF), which predicts power loads for a few days, plays a vital role in the reliable, safe, and efficient operation of a power system. Currently, two main challenges are faced by existing STLF prediction models. The first involves how to fuse multiscale electricity load data to obtain a high-performance model and remove data noise after integration. The second involves how to improve the local optimal solution despite the sample quality problem. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multiscale electricity load data fusion- and STLF-based short time series prediction model built on a sparse deep autoencoder and self-paced learning (SPL). A sparse deep autoencoder was used to solve the multiscale data fusion problem with data noise. Furthermore, SPL was utilized to solve the local optimal solution problem. The experimental results showed that our model was better than the existing STLF prediction models by more than 15.89% in terms of the mean squared error (MSE) indicator.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The rapid expansion of a country&rsquo;s economy is highly dependent on timely product distribution, which is hampered by terrible traffic congestion. Additional staff are also required to follow the delivery vehicle while it transports documents or records to another destination. This study proposes Delicar, a self-driving product delivery vehicle that can drive the vehicle on the road and report the current geographical location to the authority in real-time through a map. The equipped camera module captures the road image and transfers it to the computer via socket server programming. The raspberry pi sends the camera image and waits for the steering angle value. The image is fed to the pre-trained deep learning model that predicts the steering angle regarding that situation. Then the steering angle value is passed to the raspberry pi that directs the L298 motor driver which direction the wheel should follow. Based upon this direction, L298 decides either forward or left or right or backwards movement. The 3-cell 12V LiPo battery handles the power supply to the raspberry pi and L298 motor driver. A buck converter regulates a 5V 3A power supply to the raspberry pi to be working. Nvidia CNN architecture has been followed, containing nine layers including five convolution layers and three dense layers to develop the steering angle predictive model. Geoip2 (a python library) retrieves the longitude and latitude from the equipped system&rsquo;s IP address to report the live geographical position to the authorities. After that, Folium is used to depict the geographical location. Moreover, the system&rsquo;s infrastructure is far too low-cost and easy to install.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In the construction of new smart cities, traditional fire-detection systems can be replaced with vision-based systems to establish fire safety in society using emerging technologies, such as digital cameras, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. In this study, we developed a fire detector that accurately detects even small sparks and sounds an alarm within 8 s of a fire outbreak. A novel convolutional neural network was developed to detect fire regions using an enhanced You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4network. Based on the improved YOLOv4 algorithm, we adapted the network to operate on the Banana Pi M3 board using only three layers. Initially, we examined the originalYOLOv4 approach to determine the accuracy of predictions of candidate fire regions. However, the anticipated results were not observed after several experiments involving this approach to detect fire accidents. We improved the traditional YOLOv4 network by increasing the size of the training dataset based on data augmentation techniques for the real-time monitoring of fire disasters. By modifying the network structure through automatic color augmentation, reducing parameters, etc., the proposed method successfully detected and notified the incidence of disastrous fires with a high speed and accuracy in different weather environments&mdash;sunny or cloudy, day or night. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method can be used successfully for the protection of smart cities and in monitoring fires in urban areas. Finally, we compared the performance of our method with that of recently reported fire-detection approaches employing widely used performance matrices to test the fire classification results achieved.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal 3D Residual Correlation Network for Urban Traffic Status Prediction
T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Accurate traffic status prediction is of great importance to improve the security and reliability of the intelligent transportation system. However, urban traffic status prediction is a very challenging task due to the tight symmetry among the Human&ndash;Vehicle&ndash;Environment (HVE). The recently proposed spatial&ndash;temporal 3D convolutional neural network (ST-3DNet) effectively extracts both spatial and temporal characteristics in HVE, but ignores the essential long-term temporal characteristics and the symmetry of historical data. Therefore, a novel spatial&ndash;temporal 3D residual correlation network (ST-3DRCN) is proposed for urban traffic status prediction in this paper. The ST-3DRCN firstly introduces the Pearson correlation coefficient method to extract a high correlation between traffic data. Then, a dynamic spatial feature extraction component is constructed by using 3D convolution combined with residual units to capture dynamic spatial features. After that, based on the idea of long short-term memory (LSTM), a novel architectural unit is proposed to extract dynamic temporal features. Finally, the spatial and temporal features are fused to obtain the final prediction results. Experiments have been performed using two datasets from Chengdu, China (TaxiCD) and California, USA (PEMS-BAY). Taking the root mean square error (RMSE) as the evaluation index, the prediction accuracy of ST-3DRCN on TaxiCD dataset is 21.4%, 21.3%, 11.7%, 10.8%, 4.7%, 3.6% and 2.3% higher than LSTM, convolutional neural network (CNN), 3D-CNN, spatial&ndash;temporal residual network (ST-ResNet), spatial&ndash;temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), dynamic global-local spatial&ndash;temporal network (DGLSTNet), and ST-3DNet, respectively.

SN  - 2075-1702

AB  - Using extensive databases and known algorithms to predict short-term energy consumption comprises most computational solutions based on artificial intelligence today. State-of-the-art approaches validate their prediction models in offline environments that disregard automation, quality monitoring, and retraining challenges present in online scenarios. The existing demand response initiatives lack personalization, thus not engaging consumers. Obtaining specific and valuable recommendations is difficult for most digital platforms due to their solution pattern: extensive database, specialized algorithms, and using profiles with similar aspects. The challenges and present personalization tactics have been researched by adopting a digital twin model. This study creates a different approach by adding structural topology to build a new category of recommendation platform using the digital twin model with real-time data collected by IoT sensors to improve machine learning methods. A residential study case with 31 IoT smart meter and smart plug devices with 19-month data (measurements performed each second) validated Digital Twin MLOps architecture for personalized demand response suggestions based on online short-term energy consumption prediction.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Due to the wide availability and usage of connected devices in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the number of attacks on these networks is continually increasing. A particularly serious and dangerous type of attack in the IoT environment is the botnet attack, where the attackers can control the IoT systems to generate enormous networks of &ldquo;bot&rdquo; devices for generating malicious activities. To detect this type of attack, several Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been proposed for IoT networks based on machine learning and deep learning methods. As the main characteristics of IoT systems include their limited battery power and processor capacity, maximizing the efficiency of intrusion detection systems for IoT networks is still a research challenge. It is important to provide efficient and effective methods that use lower computational time and have high detection rates. This paper proposes an aggregated mutual information-based feature selection approach with machine learning methods to enhance detection of IoT botnet attacks. In this study, the N-BaIoT benchmark dataset was used to detect botnet attack types using real traffic data gathered from nine commercial IoT devices. The dataset includes binary and multi-class classifications. The feature selection method incorporates Mutual Information (MI) technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and ANOVA f-test at finely-granulated detection level to select the relevant features for improving the performance of IoT Botnet classifiers. In the classification step, several ensemble and individual classifiers were used, including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), Gaussian Na&iuml;ve Bayes (GNB), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results showed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperformed other techniques using various evaluation metrics.

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Ground-level ozone is a pollutant that is harmful to urban populations, particularly in developing countries where it is present in significant quantities. It greatly increases the risk of heart and lung diseases and harms agricultural crops. This study hypothesized that, as a secondary pollutant, ground-level ozone is amenable to 24 h forecasting based on measurements of weather conditions and primary pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. We developed software to analyze hourly records of 12 air pollutants and 5 weather variables over the course of one year in Delhi, India. To determine the best predictive model, eight machine learning algorithms were tuned, trained, tested, and compared using cross-validation with hourly data for a full year. The algorithms, ranked by R2 values, were XGBoost (0.61), Random Forest (0.61), K-Nearest Neighbor Regression (0.55), Support Vector Regression (0.48), Decision Trees (0.43), AdaBoost (0.39), and linear regression (0.39). When trained by separate seasons across five years, the predictive capabilities of all models increased, with a maximum R2 of 0.75 during winter. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory was the least accurate model for annual training, but had some of the best predictions for seasonal training. Out of five air quality index categories, the XGBoost model was able to predict the correct category 24 h in advance 90% of the time when trained with full-year data. Separated by season, winter is considerably more predictable (97.3%), followed by post-monsoon (92.8%), monsoon (90.3%), and summer (88.9%). These results show the importance of training machine learning methods with season-specific data sets and comparing a large number of methods for specific applications.

AB  - This paper proposes enhanced prediction and control design methods for improving traffic flow with human-driven and automated vehicles. To achieve accurate prediction for the entire time horizon, data-driven and model-based prediction methods were integrated. The goal of the integration was to accurately predict the outflow of the traffic network, which was selected as the highway section in this paper. The proposed novel prediction method was used in the optimal design for calculating controlled inflows on highway ramps. The goal of the design was to reach the maximum outflow of the traffic network, even against disturbances on uncontrolled inflows of the network. The control design leads to an optimization problem based on the min&ndash;max principle, i.e., the traffic outflow is considered to be maximized by controlled inflows and to be minimized by uncontrolled inflows. The effectiveness of the prediction and the control methods through simulation examples are illustrated, i.e., traffic outflow can be maximized by the control system under various uncontrolled inflow values.

AB  - Particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is an effective metaheuristic that can determine Pareto-optimal solutions. We propose an extended PSO by introducing quantum gates in order to ensure the diversity of particle populations that are looking for efficient alternatives. The quality of solutions was verified in the issue of assignment of resources in the computing cloud to improve the live migration of virtual machines. We consider the multi-criteria optimization problem of deep learning-based models embedded into virtual machines. Computing clouds with deep learning agents can support several areas of education, smart city or economy. Because deep learning agents require lots of computer resources, seven criteria are studied such as electric power of hosts, reliability of cloud, CPU workload of the bottleneck host, communication capacity of the critical node, a free RAM capacity of the most loaded memory, a free disc memory capacity of the most busy storage, and overall computer costs. Quantum gates modify an accepted position for the current location of a particle. To verify the above concept, various simulations have been carried out on the laboratory cloud based on the OpenStack platform. Numerical experiments have confirmed that multi-objective quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization algorithm provides better solutions than the other metaheuristics.

AB  - Intelligent traffic management is an important issue for smart cities. City councils try to implement the newest techniques and performant technologies in order to avoid traffic congestion, to optimize the use of traffic lights, to efficiently use car parking, etc. To find the best solution to this problem, Birmingham City Council decided to allow open-source predictive traffic forecasting by making the real-time datasets available. This paper proposes a multi-agent system (MAS) approach for intelligent urban traffic management in Birmingham using forecasting and classification techniques. The designed agents have the following tasks: forecast the occupancy rates for traffic flow, road junctions and car parking; classify the faults; control and monitor the entire process. The experimental results show that k-nearest neighbor forecasts with high accuracy rates for the traffic data and decision trees build the most accurate model for classifying the faults for their detection and repair in the shortest possible time. The whole learning process is coordinated by a monitoring agent in order to automate Birmingham city&rsquo;s traffic management.

AB  - Fifth-generation (5G) technology will play a vital role in future wireless networks. The breakthrough 5G technology will unleash a massive Internet of Everything (IoE), where billions of connected devices, people, and processes will be simultaneously served. The services provided by 5G include several use cases enabled by the enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine-type communications, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication. Fifth-generation networks potentially merge multiple networks on a single platform, providing a landscape for seamless connectivity, particularly for high-mobility devices. With their enhanced speed, 5G networks are prone to various research challenges. In this context, we provide a comprehensive survey on 5G technologies that emphasize machine learning-based solutions to cope with existing and future challenges. First, we discuss 5G network architecture and outline the key performance indicators compared to the previous and upcoming network generations. Second, we discuss next-generation wireless networks and their characteristics, applications, and use cases for fast connectivity to billions of devices. Then, we confer physical layer services, functions, and issues that decrease the signal quality. We also present studies on 5G network technologies, 5G propelling trends, and architectures that help to achieve the goals of 5G. Moreover, we discuss signaling techniques for 5G massive multiple-input and multiple-output and beam-forming techniques to enhance data rates with efficient spectrum sharing.

AB  - Identifying changes in ambient air pollution levels and establishing causation is a research area of strategic importance to assess the effectiveness of air quality interventions. A major challenge in pursuing these objectives is represented by the confounding effects of the meteorological conditions which easily mask or emphasize changes in pollutants concentrations. In this study, a methodological procedure to analyze changes in pollutants concentrations levels after accounting for changes in meteorology over time was developed. The procedure integrated several statistical tools, such as the change points detection and trend analysis that are applied to the pollutants concentrations meteorologically normalized using a machine learning model. Data of air pollutants and meteorological parameters, collected over the period 2013&ndash;2019 in a rural area affected by anthropic emissive sources, were used to test the procedure. The joint analysis of the obtained results with the available metadata allowed providing plausible explanations of the observed air pollutants behavior. Consequently, the procedure appears promising in elucidating those changes in the air pollutant levels not easily identifiable in the original data, supplying valuable information to identify an atmospheric response after an intervention or an unplanned event.

AB  - The ever-growing ecosystem of the Internet of Things (IoT) integrating with the ever-evolving wireless communication technology paves the way for adopting new applications in a smart society. The core concept of smart society emphasizes utilizing information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure to improve every aspect of life. Among the variety of smart services, eHealth is at the forefront of these promises. eHealth is rapidly gaining popularity to overcome the insufficient healthcare services and provide patient-centric treatment for the rising aging population with chronic diseases. Keeping in view the sensitivity of medical data, this interfacing between healthcare and technology has raised many security concerns. Among the many contemporary solutions, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is the dominant technology because of its inherent support for one-to-many transfer and fine-grained access control mechanisms to confidential medical data. ABE uses costly bilinear pairing operations, which are too heavy for eHealth&rsquo;s tiny wireless body area network (WBAN) devices despite its proper functionality. We present an efficient and secure ABE architecture with outsourcing intense encryption and decryption operations in this work. For practical realization, our scheme uses elliptic curve scalar point multiplication as the underlying technology of ABE instead of costly pairing operations. In addition, it provides support for attribute/users revocation and verifiability of outsourced medical data. Using the selective-set security model, the proposed scheme is secure under the elliptic curve decisional Diffie&ndash;Hellman (ECDDH) assumption. The performance assessment and top-ranked value via the help of fuzzy logic&rsquo;s evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method show that the proposed scheme is efficient and suitable for access control in eHealth smart societies.

AB  - With the advancement of artificial intelligence, deep learning technology is applied in many fields. The autonomous car system is one of the most important application areas of artificial intelligence. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is one of the most critical components of self-driving cars. LiDAR can quickly scan the environment to obtain a large amount of high-precision three-dimensional depth information. Self-driving cars use LiDAR to reconstruct the three-dimensional environment. The autonomous car system can identify various situations in the vicinity through the information provided by LiDAR and choose a safer route. This paper is based on Velodyne HDL-64 LiDAR to decode data packets of LiDAR. The decoder we designed converts the information of the original data packet into X, Y, and Z point cloud data so that the autonomous vehicle can use the decoded information to reconstruct the three-dimensional environment and perform object detection and object classification. In order to prove the performance of the proposed LiDAR decoder, we use the standard original packets used for the comparison of experimental data, which are all taken from the Map GMU (George Mason University). The average decoding time of a frame is 7.678 milliseconds. Compared to other methods, the proposed LiDAR decoder has higher decoding speed and efficiency.

AB  - Wind energy has become one of the world&rsquo;s most renewable energy sources in recent years. It is regarded as a clean energy source because it produces no greenhouse gas emissions. The assessment of wind energy resources is an important step in the development of any wind energy conversion system (WECS). As a result, this article examines the wind energy potential of nine Jordanian wind locations: Queen Alia Airport, Civil Amman Airport, King Hussein Airport, Irbid, Mafraq, Ma&rsquo;an, Ghor Al Safi, Safawi, and Irwaished. The available wind speed data were implemented using three statistical distribution models, Weibull, Rayleigh, and Gamma distributions, and one traditional estimation method, the Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM). Three optimization techniques were used to assign parameters to each distribution model: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). To determine the optimal distribution model, the performance of these distribution models was tested. According to the findings, King Hussein Airport features the highest wind power density, followed by Queen Alia Airport, while Irbid features the lowest, followed by Ghor Al Safi.

AB  - Marine hydrological elements are of vital importance in marine surveys. The evolution of these elements can have a profound effect on the relationship between human activities and marine hydrology. Therefore, the detection and explanation of the evolution laws of marine hydrological elements are urgently needed. In this paper, a novel method, named Evolution Trend Recognition (ETR), is proposed to recognize the trend of ocean fronts, being the most important information in the ocean dynamic process. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the task of ocean-front trend classification. A novel classification algorithm is first proposed for recognizing the ocean-front trend, in terms of the ocean-front scale and strength. Then, the GoogLeNet Inception network is trained to classify the ocean-front trend, i.e., enhancing or attenuating. The ocean-front trend is classified using the deep neural network, as well as a physics-informed classification algorithm. The two classification results are combined to make the final decision on the trend classification. Furthermore, two novel databases were created for this research, and their generation method is described, to foster research in this direction. These two databases are called the Ocean-Front Tracking Dataset (OFTraD) and the Ocean-Front Trend Dataset (OFTreD). Moreover, experiment results show that our proposed method on OFTreD achieves a higher classification accuracy, which is 97.5%, than state-of-the-art networks. This demonstrates that the proposed ETR algorithm is highly promising for trend classification.

TI  - Improved Mask R-CNN for Rural Building Roof Type Recognition from UAV High-Resolution Images: A Case Study in Hunan Province, China

AB  - Accurate roof information of buildings can be obtained from UAV high-resolution images. The large-scale accurate recognition of roof types (such as gabled, flat, hipped, complex and mono-pitched roofs) of rural buildings is crucial for rural planning and construction. At present, most UAV high-resolution optical images only have red, green and blue (RGB) band information, which aggravates the problems of inter-class similarity and intra-class variability of image features. Furthermore, the different roof types of rural buildings are complex, spatially scattered, and easily covered by vegetation, which in turn leads to the low accuracy of roof type identification by existing methods. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a method for identifying roof types of complex rural buildings based on visible high-resolution remote sensing images from UAVs. First, the fusion of deep learning networks with different visual features is investigated to analyze the effect of the different feature combinations of the visible difference vegetation index (VDVI) and Sobel edge detection features and UAV visible images on model recognition of rural building roof types. Secondly, an improved Mask R-CNN model is proposed to learn more complex features of different types of images of building roofs by using the ResNet152 feature extraction network with migration learning. After we obtained roof type recognition results in two test areas, we evaluated the accuracy of the results using the confusion matrix and obtained the following conclusions: (1) the model with RGB images incorporating Sobel edge detection features has the highest accuracy and enables the model to recognize more and more accurately the roof types of different morphological rural buildings, and the model recognition accuracy (Kappa coefficient (KC)) compared to that of RGB images is on average improved by 0.115; (2) compared with the original Mask R-CNN, U-Net, DeeplabV3 and PSPNet deep learning models, the improved Mask R-CNN model has the highest accuracy in recognizing the roof types of rural buildings, with F1-score, KC and OA averaging 0.777, 0.821 and 0.905, respectively. The method can obtain clear and accurate profiles and types of rural building roofs, and can be extended for green roof suitability evaluation, rooftop solar potential assessment, and other building roof surveys, management and planning.

AB  - Analyzing data related to the conditions of city streets and avenues could help to make better decisions about public spending on mobility. Generally, streets and avenues are fixed as soon as they have a citizen report or when a major incident occurs. However, it is uncommon for cities to have real-time reactive systems that detect the different problems they have to fix on the pavement. This work proposes a solution to detect anomalies in streets through state analysis using sensors within the vehicles that travel daily and connecting them to a fog-computing architecture on a V2I network. The system detects and classifies the main road problems or abnormal conditions in streets and avenues using Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA), comparing roughness against a flat reference. An instrumented vehicle obtained the reference through accelerometry sensors and then sent the data through a mid-range communication system. With these data, the system compared an Artificial Neural Network (supervised MLA) and a K-Nearest Neighbor (Supervised MLA) to select the best option to handle the acquired data. This system makes it desirable to visualize the streets&rsquo; quality and map the areas with the most significant anomalies.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) provides large-scale solutions for efficient resource monitoring and management. As such, the technology has been heavily integrated into domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and utilities, which led to the emergence of sustainable smart cities. The success of smart cities depends on the availability of data, as well as the quality of the data management infrastructure. IoT introduced numerous new software, hardware, and networking technologies designed for efficient and low-cost data transport, storage, and processing. However, proper selection and integration of the correct technologies is crucial to ensuring a positive return on investment for such systems. This paper presents a novel end-to-end infrastructure for solar energy analysis and prediction via edge-based analytics.

AB  - Traffic accident detection is an important strategy governments can use to implement policies intended to reduce accidents. They usually use techniques such as image processing, RFID devices, among others. Social network mining has emerged as a low-cost alternative. However, social networks come with several challenges such as informal language and misspellings. This paper proposes a method to extract traffic accident data from Twitter in Spanish. The method consists of four phases. The first phase establishes the data collection mechanisms. The second consists of vectorially representing the messages and classifying them as accidents or non-accidents. The third phase uses named entity recognition techniques to detect the location. In the fourth phase, locations pass through a geocoder that returns their geographic coordinates. This method was applied to Bogota city and the data on Twitter were compared with the official traffic information source; comparisons showed some influence of Twitter on the commercial and industrial area of the city. The results reveal how effective the information on accidents reported on Twitter can be. It should therefore be considered as a source of information that may complement existing detection methods.

AB  - With the emergence of networked devices, from the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes and cellular phones to vehicles connected to the Internet, there has been an ever-growing expansion of attack surfaces in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In the past decade, there has been a rapid growth in the automotive industry as network-enabled and electronic devices are now integral parts of vehicular ecosystems. These include the development of automobile technologies, namely, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and electric vehicles. Attacks on IoV may lead to malfunctioning of Electronic Control Unit (ECU), brakes, control steering issues, and door lock issues that can be fatal in CAV. To mitigate these risks, there is need for a lightweight model to identify attacks on vehicular systems. In this article, an efficient model of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to detect anomalies in the vehicular system. The dataset used in this study is an In-Vehicle Network (IVN) communication protocol, i.e., Control Area Network (CAN) dataset generated in a real-time environment. The model classifies different types of attacks on vehicles into reconnaissance, Denial of Service (DoS), and fuzzing attacks. Experimentation with performance metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score are compared across a variety of classification models. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other classification models.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In recent years, technology has advanced to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), where the Internet of things (IoTs), fog computing, computer security, and cyberattacks have evolved exponentially on a large scale. The rapid development of IoT devices and networks in various forms generate enormous amounts of data which in turn demand careful authentication and security. Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the most promising methods for addressing cybersecurity threats and providing security. In this study, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) that categorize, map and survey the existing literature on AI methods used to detect cybersecurity attacks in the IoT environment. The scope of this SLR includes an in-depth investigation on most AI trending techniques in cybersecurity and state-of-art solutions. A systematic search was performed on various electronic databases (SCOPUS, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI). Out of the identified records, 80 studies published between 2016 and 2021 were selected, surveyed and carefully assessed. This review has explored deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques used in IoT security, and their effectiveness in detecting attacks. However, several studies have proposed smart intrusion detection systems (IDS) with intelligent architectural frameworks using AI to overcome the existing security and privacy challenges. It is found that support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) are among the most used methods, due to high accuracy detection another reason may be efficient memory. In addition, other methods also provide better performance such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural networks (NN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). This analysis also provides an insight into the AI roadmap to detect threats based on attack categories. Finally, we present recommendations for potential future investigations.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Manual work accounts for one of the largest workgroups in the European manufacturing sector, and improving the training capacity, quality, and speed brings significant competitive benefits to companies. In this context, this paper presents an informed tree search on top of a Markov chain that suggests possible next assembly steps as a key component of an innovative assembly training station for manual operations. The goal of the next step suggestions is to provide support to inexperienced workers or to assist experienced workers by providing choices for the next assembly step in an automated manner without the involvement of a human trainer on site. Data stemming from 179 experiment participants, 111 factory workers, and 68 students, were used to evaluate different prediction methods. From our analysis, Markov chains fail in new scenarios and, therefore, by using an informed tree search to predict the possible next assembly step in such situations, the prediction capability of the hybrid algorithm increases significantly while providing robust solutions to unseen scenarios. The proposed method proved to be the most efficient for next assembly step prediction among all the evaluated predictors and, thus, the most suitable method for an adaptive assembly support system such as for manual operations in industry.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 15
IS  - 2
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - As wireless local area networks grow in size to provide access to users, power consumption becomes an important issue. Power savings in a large-scale Wi-Fi network, with low impact to user service, is undoubtedly desired. In this work, we propose and evaluate the eSCIFI energy saving mechanism for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). eSCIFI is an energy saving mechanism that uses machine learning algorithms as occupancy demand estimators. The eSCIFI mechanism is designed to cope with a broader range of WLANs, which includes Wi-Fi networks such as the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) SCIFI network. The eSCIFI can cope with WLANs that cannot acquire data in a real time manner and/or possess a limited CPU power. The eSCIFI design also includes two clustering algorithms, named cSCIFI and cSCIFI+, that help to guarantee the network&rsquo;s coverage. eSCIFI uses those network clusters and machine learning predictions as input features to an energy state decision algorithm that then decides which Access Points (AP) can be switched off during the day. To evaluate eSCIFI performance, we conducted several trace-driven simulations comparing the eSCIFI mechanism using both clustering algorithms with other energy saving mechanisms found in the literature using the UFF SCIFI network traces. The results showed that eSCIFI mechanism using the cSCIFI+ clustering algorithm achieves the best performance and that it can save up to 64.32% of the UFF SCIFI network energy without affecting the user coverage.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 15

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Accurate short-term load forecasting can ensure the safe operation of the grid. Decomposing load data into smooth components by decomposition algorithms is a common approach to address data volatility. However, each component of the decomposition must be modeled separately for prediction, which leads to overly complex models. To solve this problem, a VMD-WSLSTM load prediction model based on Shapley values is proposed in this paper. First, the Shapley value is used to select the optimal set of special features, and then the VMD decomposition method is used to decompose the original load into several smooth components. Finally, WSLSTM is used to predict each component. Unlike the traditional LSTM model, WSLSTM can simplify the prediction model and extract common features among the components by sharing the parameters among the components. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, several control groups were used for experiments. The results show that the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy and training speed compared with traditional prediction methods.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Due to the value and importance of patient health records (PHR), security is the most critical feature of encryption over the Internet. Users that perform keyword searches to gain access to the PHR stored in the database are more susceptible to security risks. Although a blockchain-based healthcare system can guarantee security, present schemes have several flaws. Existing techniques have concentrated exclusively on data storage and have utilized blockchain as a storage database. In this research, we developed a unique deep-learning-based secure search-able blockchain as a distributed database using homomorphic encryption to enable users to securely access data via search. Our suggested study will increasingly include secure key revocation and update policies. An IoT dataset was used in this research to evaluate our suggested access control strategies and compare them to benchmark models. The proposed algorithms are implemented using smart contracts in the hyperledger tool. The suggested strategy is evaluated in comparison to existing ones. Our suggested approach significantly improves security, anonymity, and monitoring of user behavior, resulting in a more efficient blockchain-based IoT system as compared to benchmark models.

AB  - The construction sector is in continuous evolution due to the digitalisation and integration into daily activities of the building information modelling approach and methods that impact on the overall life cycle. This study investigates the topic of BIM/GIS integration with the adoption of ontologies and metamodels, providing a critical analysis of the existing literature. Ontologies and metamodels share several similarities and could be combined for potential solutions to address BIM/GIS integration for complex tasks, such as asset management, where heterogeneous sources of data are involved. The research adopts a systematic literature review (SLR), providing a formal approach to retrieve scientific papers from dedicated online databases. The results found are then analysed, in order to describe the state of the art and suggest future research paths, which is useful for both researchers and practitioners. From the SLR, it emerged that several studies address ontologies as a promising way to overcome the semantic barriers of the BIM/GIS integration. On the other hand, metamodels (and MDE and MDA approaches, in general) are rarely found in relation to the integration topic. Moreover, the joint application of ontologies and metamodels for BIM/GIS applications is an unexplored field. The novelty of this work is the proposal of the joint application of ontologies and metamodels to perform BIM/GIS integration, for the development of software and systems for asset management.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Networks Used to Date Photographs

PY  - 2022
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Nowadays, the information provided by digital photographs is very complete and very relevant in different professional fields, such as scientific or forensic photography. Taking this into account, it is possible to determine the date when they were taken, as well as the type of device that they were taken with, and thus be able to locate the photograph in a specific context. This is not the case with analog photographs, which lack any information regarding the date they were taken. Extracting this information is a complicated task, so classifying each photograph according to the date it was taken is a laborious task for a human expert. Artificial intelligence techniques make it possible to determine the characteristics and classify the images automatically. Within the field of artificial intelligence, convolutional neural networks are one of the most widely used methods today. This article describes the application of convolutional neural networks to automatically classify photographs according to the year they were taken. To do this, only the photograph is used, without any additional information. The proposed method divides each photograph into several segments that are presented to the network so that it can estimate a year for each segment. Once all the segments of a photograph have been processed, a general year for the photograph is calculated from the values generated by the network for each of its segments. In this study, images taken between 1960 and 1999 were analyzed and classified using different architectures of a convolutional neural network. The computational results obtained indicate that 44% of the images were classified with an error of less than 5 years, 20.25% with a marginal error between 5 and 10 years, and 35.75% with a higher marginal error of more than 10 years. Due to the complexity of the problem, the results obtained are considered good since 64.25% of the photographs were classified with an error of less than 10 years. Another important result of the study carried out is that it was found that the color is a very important characteristic when classifying photographs by date. The results obtained show that the approach given in this study is an important starting point for this type of task and that it allows placing a photograph in a specific temporal context, thus facilitating the work of experts dedicated to scientific and forensic photography.

AB  - Since the outbreak of the corona virus in the end of 2019, many worldwide attempts have been made to monitor and control the COVID-19 pandemic. A wealth of empirical data has been collected and used by national health authorities to understand and mitigate the spread and impacts of the corona virus. In various countries this serious health concern has led to the development of corona dashboards monitoring the COVID-19 evolution. The present study aims to design and test an extended corona dashboard, in which&mdash;beside up-to-date daily core data on infections, hospital and intensive care admissions, and numbers of deceased people&mdash;also the evolution of vaccinations in a country is mapped out. This dashboard system is next extended with time-dependent contextual information on lockdown and policy stringency measures, while disaggregate information on the geographic spread of the COVID-19 disease is provided by means of big data on contact intensity and mobility motives based on detailed Google Mobility data. Finally, this context-specific corona dashboard, named &lsquo;Dutchboard&rsquo;, is further extended towards the regional and local level so as to allow also for space-specific &lsquo;health checks&rsquo; and assessments.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Household appliances, climate control machines, vehicles, elevators, cash counting machines, etc., are complex machines with key contributions to the smart city. Those devices have limited memory and processing power, but they are not just actuators; they embed tens of sensors and actuators managed by several microcontrollers and microprocessors communicated by control buses. On the other hand, predictive maintenance and the capability of identifying failures to avoid greater damage of machines is becoming a topic of great relevance in Industry 4.0, and the large amount of data to be processed is a concern. This article proposes a layered methodology to enable complex machines with automatic fault detection or predictive maintenance. It presents a layered structure to perform the collection, filtering and extraction of indicators, along with their processing. The aim is to reduce the amount of data to work with, and to optimize them by generating indicators that concentrate the information provided by data. To test its applicability, a prototype of a cash counting machine has been used. With this prototype, different failure cases have been simulated by introducing defective elements. After the extraction of the indicators, using the Kullback&ndash;Liebler divergence, it has been possible to visualize the differences between the data associated with normal and failure operation. Subsequently, using a neural network, good results have been obtained, being able to correctly classify the failure in 90% of the cases. The result of this application demonstrates the proper functioning of the proposed approach in complex machines.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the energy sector. The new behavior of industrial and non-commercial consumers changes the energy consumption model. In addition, the constraints associated with the coronavirus crisis have led to environmental effects from declining economic activity. The research is based on evidence from around the world showing significant reductions in emissions and improved air quality. This situation requires rethinking the energy development strategy, particularly the construction of smart grids as a leading direction of energy development. Evaluating the efficiency of smart grids is a vital tool for disseminating successful experience in improving their management. This paper proposes an approach to a comprehensive assessment of smart grids based on a comparative analysis of existing methods, taking into account the changes that need to be considered after the experience gained from the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach provides an accurate set of efficiency indicators for assessing smart grids to account for the direct and indirect effects of smart grids&rsquo; implementation. This evaluation approach can be helpful to policymakers in developing energy efficiency programs and implementing energy policy.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Data hiding is the technique of embedding data into video or audio media. With the development of deep neural networks (DNN), the quality of images generated by novel data hiding methods based on DNN is getting better. However, there is still room for the similarity between the original images and the images generated by the DNN models which were trained based on the existing hiding frameworks to improve, and it is hard for the receiver to distinguish whether the container image is from the real sender. We propose a framework by introducing a key_img for using the over-fitting characteristic of DNN and combined with difference image grafting symmetrically, named difference image grafting deep hiding (DIGDH). The key_img can be used to identify whether the container image is from the real sender easily. The experimental results show that without changing the structures of networks, the models trained based on the proposed framework can generate images with higher similarity to original cover and secret images. According to the analysis results of the steganalysis tool named StegExpose, the container images generated by the hiding model trained based on the proposed framework is closer to the random distribution.

However, it is a largely complex and versatile methodology which hinders its broader uptake by researchers as well as improved results. This state-of-the-art review focuses on the application of agent-based modelling for exploring policy interventions that facilitate the decarbonisation (i.e., energy transition) of districts and neighbourhoods while considering stakeholders&rsquo; social characteristics and interactions. We systematically select and analyse peer-reviewed literature and discuss the key modelling aspects, such as model purpose, agents and decision-making logic, spatial and temporal aspects, and empirical grounding. The analysis reveals that the most established agent-based models&rsquo; focus on innovation diffusion (e.g., adoption of solar panels) and dissemination of energy-saving behaviour among a group of buildings in urban areas. We see a considerable gap in exploring the decisions and interactions of agents other than residential households, such as commercial and even industrial energy consumers (and prosumers). Moreover, measures such as building retrofits and conversion to district energy systems involve many stakeholders and complex interactions between them that up to now have hardly been represented in the agent-based modelling environment. Hence, this work contributes to better understanding and further improving the research on transition towards decarbonised society.

TI  - A Probabilistic Approach to Estimating Allowed SNR Values for Automotive LiDARs in &ldquo;Smart Cities&rdquo; under Various External Influences

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The paper proposes an approach to assessing the allowed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for light detection and ranging (LiDAR) of unmanned autonomous vehicles based on the predetermined probability of false alarms under various intentional and unintentional influencing factors. The focus of this study is on the relevant issue of the safe use of LiDAR data and measurement systems within the &ldquo;smart city&rdquo; infrastructure. The research team analyzed and systematized various external impacts on the LiDAR systems, as well as the state-of-the-art approaches to improving their security and resilience. It has been established that the current works on the analysis of external influences on the LiDARs and methods for their mitigation focus mainly on physical (hardware) approaches (proposing most often other types of modulation and optical signal frequencies), and less often software approaches, through the use of additional anomaly detection techniques and data integrity verification systems, as well as improving the efficiency of data filtering in the cloud point. In addition, the sources analyzed in this paper do not offer methodological support for the design of the LiDAR in the very early stages of their creation, taking into account a priori assessment of the allowed SNR threshold and probability of detecting a reflected pulse and the requirements to minimize the probability of &ldquo;missing&rdquo; an object when scanning with no a priori assessments of the detection probability characteristics of the LiDAR. The authors propose a synthetic approach as a mathematical tool for designing a resilient LiDAR system. The approach is based on the physics of infrared radiation, the Bayesian theory, and the Neyman&ndash;Pearson criterion. It features the use of a predetermined threshold for false alarms, the probability of interference in the analytics, and the characteristics of the LiDAR&rsquo;s receivers. The result is the analytical solution to the problem of calculating the allowed SNR while stabilizing the level of &ldquo;false alarms&rdquo; in terms of background noise caused by a given type of interference. The work presents modelling results for the &ldquo;false alarm&rdquo; probability values depending on the selected optimality criterion. The efficiency of the proposed approach has been proven by the simulation results of the received optical power of the LiDAR&rsquo;s signal based on the calculated SNR threshold and noise values.

TI  - An Efficient Hyperparameter Control Method for a Network Intrusion Detection System Based on Proximal Policy Optimization
T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - The complexity of network intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is increasing due to the continuous increases in network traffic, various attacks and the ever-changing network environment. In addition, network traffic is asymmetric with few attack data, but the attack data are so complex that it is difficult to detect one. Many studies on improving intrusion detection performance using feature engineering have been conducted. These studies work well in the dataset environment; however, it is challenging to cope with a changing network environment. This paper proposes an intrusion detection hyperparameter control system (IDHCS) that controls and trains a deep neural network (DNN) feature extractor and k-means clustering module as a reinforcement learning model based on proximal policy optimization (PPO). An IDHCS controls the DNN feature extractor to extract the most valuable features in the network environment, and identifies intrusion through k-means clustering. Through iterative learning using the PPO-based reinforcement learning model, the system is optimized to improve performance automatically according to the network environment, where the IDHCS is used. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the system performance using the CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 datasets. In CICIDS2017, an F1-score of 0.96552 was achieved and UNSW-NB15 achieved an F1-score of 0.94268. An experiment was conducted by merging the two datasets to build a more extensive and complex test environment. By merging datasets, the attack types in the experiment became more diverse and their patterns became more complex. An F1-score of 0.93567 was achieved in the merged dataset, indicating 97% to 99% performance compared with CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15. The results reveal that the proposed IDHCS improved the performance of the IDS by automating learning new types of attacks by managing intrusion detection features regardless of the network environment changes through continuous learning.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has emerged in many aspects of life, such as transportation, healthcare, and even education. IoT technology incorporates several tasks to achieve the goals for which it was developed through smart services. These services are intelligent activities that allow devices to interact with the physical world to provide suitable services to users anytime and anywhere. However, the remarkable advancement of this technology has increased the number and the mechanisms of attacks. Attackers often take advantage of the IoTs&rsquo; heterogeneity to cause trust problems and manipulate the behavior to delude devices&rsquo; reliability and the service provided through it. Consequently, trust is one of the security challenges that threatens IoT smart services. Trust management techniques have been widely used to identify untrusted behavior and isolate untrusted objects over the past few years. However, these techniques still have many limitations like ineffectiveness when dealing with a large amount of data and continuously changing behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes a model for trust management in IoT devices and services based on the simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm. The SMART is used for calculating the trust value, while LSTM is used for identifying changes in the behavior based on the trust threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using accuracy, loss rate, precision, recall, and F-measure on different data samples with different sizes. Comparisons with existing deep learning and machine learning models show superior performance with a different number of iterations. With 100 iterations, the proposed model achieved 99.87% and 99.76% of accuracy and F-measure, respectively.

AB  - Long-term prediction of hour-concentration of PM2.5 (particles in atmospheric suspension with effective dimensions equal or lower than 2.5 microns) is of great significance for environmental protection and people&rsquo;s health. At present, the prediction of hour-concentration of PM2.5 is mostly single-step prediction, which is to predict PM2.5 concentration at a future time point based on a period of historical data. In this paper, a model based on multi-time scale fusion is proposed to study single-step prediction and multi-step prediction, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed model is better than stacked LSTM and CNN-LSTM in predicting PM2.5 hour-concentration.

AB  - Behavior modeling has multiple applications in the intelligent environment domain. It has been used in different tasks, such as the stratification of different pathologies, prediction of the user actions and activities, or modeling the energy usage. Specifically, behavior prediction can be used to forecast the future evolution of the users and to identify those behaviors that deviate from the expected conduct. In this paper, we propose the use of embeddings to represent the user actions, and study and compare several behavior prediction approaches. We test multiple model (LSTM, CNNs, GCNs, and transformers) architectures to ascertain the best approach to using embeddings for behavior modeling and also evaluate multiple embedding retrofitting approaches. To do so, we use the Kasteren dataset for intelligent environments, which is one of the most widely used datasets in the areas of activity recognition and behavior modeling.

AB  - Saffron, one of the most expensive crops on earth, having a vast domain of applications, has the potential to boost the economy of India. The cultivation of saffron has been immensely affected in the past few years due to the changing climate. Despite the use of different artificial methods for cultivation, hydroponic approaches using the IoT prove to give the best results. The presented study consists of potential artificial approaches used for cultivation and the selection of hydroponics as the best approach out of these based on different parameters. This paper also provides a comparative analysis of six present hydroponic approaches. The research work on different factors of saffron, such as the parameters responsible for growth, reasons for the decline in growth, and different agronomical variables, has been shown graphically. A smart hydroponic system for saffron cultivation has been proposed using the NFT (nutrient film technique) and renewable sources of energy.

AB  - The growing importance and widespread adoption of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies have helped the enhancement of smart environments in numerous sectors such as manufacturing, smart cities, transportation and Internet of Things by providing pervasive real-time applications. In this survey, we analyze the existing research trends with respect to Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in WSN and the possible use of these methods for WSN enhancement. The main goal of data collection, aggregation and dissemination algorithms is to gather and aggregate data in an energy efficient manner so that network lifetime is enhanced. In this paper, we highlight data collection, aggregation and dissemination challenges in WSN and present a comprehensive discussion on the recent studies that utilized various AI methods to meet specific objectives of WSN, during the span of 2010 to 2021. We compare and contrast different algorithms on the basis of optimization criteria, simulation/real deployment, centralized/distributed kind, mobility and performance parameters. We conclude with possible future research directions. This would guide the reader towards an understanding of up-to-date applications of AI methods with respect to data collection, aggregation and dissemination challenges in WSN. Then, we provide a general evaluation and comparison of different AI methods used in WSNs, which will be a guide for the research community in identifying the mostly adapted methods and the benefits of using various AI methods for solving the challenges related to WSNs. Finally, we conclude the paper stating the open research issues and new possibilities for future studies.

TI  - Applying Federated Learning in Software-Defined Networks: A Survey
T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Federated learning (FL) is a type of distributed machine learning approacs that trains global models through the collaboration of participants. It protects data privacy as participants only contribute local models instead of sharing private local data. However, the performance of FL highly relies on the number of participants and their contributions. When applying FL over conventional computer networks, attracting more participants, encouraging participants to contribute more local resources, and enabling efficient and effective collaboration among participants become very challenging. As software-defined networks (SDNs) enable open and flexible networking architecture with separate control and data planes, SDNs provide standardized protocols and specifications to enable fine-grained collaborations among devices. Applying FL approaches over SDNs can take use such advantages to address challenges. A SDN control plane can have multiple controllers organized in layers; the controllers in the lower layer can be placed in the network edge to deal with the asymmetries in the attached switches and hosts, and the controller in the upper layer can supervise the whole network centrally and globally. Applying FL in SDNs with a layered-distributed control plane may be able to protect the data privacy of each participant while improving collaboration among participants to produce higher-quality models over asymmetric networks. Accordingly, this paper aims to make a comprehensive survey on the related mechanisms and solutions that enable FL in SDNs. It highlights three major challenges, an incentive mechanism, privacy and security, and model aggregation, which affect the quality and quantity of participants, the security and privacy in model transferring, and the performance of the global model, respectively. The state of the art in mechanisms and solutions that can be applied to address such challenges in the current literature are categorized based on the challenges they face, followed by suggestions of future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first effort in surveying the state of the art in combining FL with SDNs.

TI  - Interpolation-Based Fusion of Sentinel-5P, SRTM, and Regulatory-Grade Ground Stations Data for Producing Spatially Continuous Maps of PM2.5 Concentrations Nationwide over Thailand
T2  - Atmosphere

PY  - 2022
VL  - 13

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Atmospheric pollution has recently drawn significant attention due to its proven adverse effects on public health and the environment. This concern has been aggravated specifically in Southeast Asia due to increasing vehicular use, industrial activity, and agricultural burning practices. Consequently, elevated PM2.5 concentrations have become a matter of intervention for national authorities who have addressed the needs of monitoring air pollution by operating ground stations. However, their spatial coverage is limited and the installation and maintenance are costly. Therefore, alternative approaches are necessary at national and regional scales. In the current paper, we investigated interpolation models to fuse PM2.5 measurements from ground stations and satellite data in an attempt to produce spatially continuous maps of PM2.5 nationwide over Thailand. Four approaches are compared, namely the inverse distance weighted (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), random forest (RF), and random forest combined with OK (RFK) leveraging on the NO2, SO2, CO, HCHO, AI, and O3 products from the Sentinel-5P satellite, regulatory-grade ground PM2.5 measurements, and topographic parameters. The results suggest that RFK is the most robust, especially when the pollution levels are moderate or extreme, achieving an RMSE value of 7.11 &mu;g/m3 and an R2 value of 0.77 during a 10-day long period in February, and an RMSE of 10.77 &mu;g/m3 and R2 and 0.91 during the entire month of March. The proposed approach can be adopted operationally and expanded by leveraging regulatory-grade stations, low-cost sensors, as well as upcoming satellite missions such as the GEMS and the Sentinel-5.

VL  - 8

SN  - 2313-433X

AB  - The proper inspection of a cracks pattern over time is a critical diagnosis step to provide a thorough knowledge of the health state of a structure. When monitoring cracks propagating on a planar surface, adopting a single-image-based approach is a more convenient (costly and logistically) solution compared to subjective operators-based solutions. Machine learning (ML)- based monitoring solutions offer the advantage of automation in crack detection; however, complex and time-consuming training must be carried out. This study presents a simple and automated ML-based crack monitoring approach implemented in open sources software that only requires a single image for training. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed conducting work in controlled and real case study sites. For both sites, the generated outputs are significant in terms of accuracy (~1 mm), repeatability (sub-mm) and precision (sub-pixel). The presented results highlight that the successful detection of cracks is achievable with only a straightforward ML-based training procedure conducted on only a single image of the multi-temporal sequence. Furthermore, the use of an innovative camera kit allowed exploiting automated acquisition and transmission fundamental for Internet of Things (IoTs) for structural health monitoring and to reduce user-based operations and increase safety.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Uncertainties are the most significant challenges in the smart power system, necessitating the use of precise techniques to deal with them properly. Such problems could be effectively solved using a probabilistic optimization strategy. It is further divided into stochastic, robust, distributionally robust, and chance-constrained optimizations. The topics of probabilistic optimization in smart power systems are covered in this review paper. In order to account for uncertainty in optimization processes, stochastic optimization is essential. Robust optimization is the most advanced approach to optimize a system under uncertainty, in which a deterministic, set-based uncertainty model is used instead of a stochastic one. The computational complexity of stochastic programming and the conservativeness of robust optimization are both reduced by distributionally robust optimization.Chance constrained algorithms help in solving the constraints optimization problems, where finite probability get violated. This review paper discusses microgrid and home energy management, demand-side management, unit commitment, microgrid integration, and economic dispatch as examples of applications of these techniques in smart power systems. Probabilistic mathematical models of different scenarios, for which deterministic approaches have been used in the literature, are also presented. Future research directions in a variety of smart power system domains are also presented.

TI  - Drivers for Digital Twin Adoption in the Construction Industry: A Systematic Literature Review
T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2022
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Digital twin (DT) is gaining increasing attention due to its ability to present digital replicas of existing assets, processes and systems. DT can integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create real-time simulation models. These models learn and update from multiple data sources to predict their physical counterparts&rsquo; current and future conditions. This has promoted its relevance in various industries, including the construction industry (CI). However, recognising the existence of a distinct set of factors driving its adoption has not been established. Therefore, this study aims to identify the drivers and integrate them into a classification framework to enhance its understanding. Utilising popular databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, a systematic literature review of 58 relevant DT adoptions in the CI research was conducted. From the review, the drivers for DT adoption in the CI were identified and classified. The results show that developed countries such as the UK, US, Australia, and Italy have been the top countries in advancing DT adoption in the CI, while developing countries have made commendable contributions. A conceptual framework has been developed to enhance the successful adoption of DT in the CI based on 50 identified drivers. The major categories of the framework include concept-oriented drivers, production-driven drivers, operational success drivers, and preservation-driven drivers. The developed framework serves as a guide to propel DT adoption in the CI. Furthermore, this study contributes to the body of knowledge about DT adoption drivers, which is essential for DT promotion in the CI.

AB  - The design of adaptive fa&ccedil;ades as complex systems that dynamically respond to weather conditions and occupants&rsquo; demands is rapidly increasing in modern constructions since they are highly energy efficient. Adaptive Dynamic Building Envelopes (ADBEs) exploit the benefits of technologies that manage the energy and mass transfer between building and outdoor environments actively and selectively. There is a wide range of technologies used in the design of ADBEs that differ from one another in terms of user controllability and the level of how active or passive their technologies are. This paper provides a systematic search in literature on the technologies devised in the ADBEs, specifying the most prevalent practices, and highlights the most cutting-edge research approximations. The analysis shows more than half of the studies use photovoltaics (PVs) in their design. Using mechanical ventilation and heat pumps were the next popular choices. Moreover, approximately half of the studies were carried out using simulation methods alone, whereas only 13% of studies couple simulations with experimental work. This highlights a clear gap in coupling digital modeling and simulation software with practical field testing and successful mass production.

AB  - Electrical load forecasting study is required in electric power systems for different applications with respect to the specific time horizon, such as optimal operations, grid stability, Demand Side Management (DSM) and long-term strategic planning. In this context, machine learning and data analytics models represent a valuable tool to cope with the intrinsic complexity and especially design future demand-side advanced services. The main novelty in this paper is that the combination of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques is proposed to improve the forecasting capability of the hourly load on an electric power substation. A historical dataset of measured loads related to a 33/11 kV MV substation is considered in India as a case study, in order to properly validate the designed method. Based on the presented numerical results, the proposed approach proved itself to accurately predict loads with a reduced dimensionality of input data, thus minimizing the overall computational effort.
