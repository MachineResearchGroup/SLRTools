TI  - Vehicle Counting in Video Sequences: An Incremental Subspace Learning Approach

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The counting of vehicles plays an important role in measuring the behavior patterns of traffic flow in cities, as streets and avenues can get crowded easily. To address this problem, some Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) have been implemented in order to count vehicles with already established video surveillance infrastructure. With this in mind, in this paper, we present an on-line learning methodology for counting vehicles in video sequences based on Incremental Principal Component Analysis (Incremental PCA). This incremental learning method allows us to identify the maximum variability (i.e., motion detection) between a previous block of frames and the actual one by using only the first projected eigenvector. Once the projected image is obtained, we apply dynamic thresholding to perform image binarization. Then, a series of post-processing steps are applied to enhance the binary image containing the objects in motion. Finally, we count the number of vehicles by implementing a virtual detection line in each of the road lanes. These lines determine the instants where the vehicles pass completely through them. Results show that our proposed methodology is able to count vehicles with 96.6% accuracy at 26 frames per second on average&mdash;dealing with both camera jitter and sudden illumination changes caused by the environment and the camera auto exposure.

AB  - This paper presents a survey of recent developments using Doppler radar sensor in searching and locating an alive person under debris or behind a wall. Locating a human and detecting the vital signs such as breathing rate and heartbeat using a microwave sensor is a non-invasive technique. Recently, many hardware structures, signal processing approaches, and integrated systems have been introduced by researchers in this field. The purpose is to enhance the accuracy of vital signs&rsquo; detection and location detection and reduce energy consumption. This work concentrates on the representative research on sensing systems that can find alive people under rubble when an earthquake or other disasters occur. In this paper, various operating principles and system architectures for finding survivors using the microwave radar sensors are reviewed. A comparison between these systems is also discussed.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.

VL  - 19
IS  - 13
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a way to use social resources to solve high-precision environmental awareness problems in real time. Publishers hope to collect as much sensed data as possible at a relatively low cost, while users want to earn more revenue at a low cost. Low-quality data will reduce the efficiency of MCS and lead to a loss of revenue. However, existing work lacks research on the selection of user revenue under the premise of ensuring data quality. In this paper, we propose a Publisher-User Evolutionary Game Model (PUEGM) and a revenue selection method to solve the evolutionary stable equilibrium problem based on non-cooperative evolutionary game theory. Firstly, the choice of user revenue is modeled as a Publisher-User Evolutionary Game Model. Secondly, based on the error-elimination decision theory, we combine a data quality assessment algorithm in the PUEGM, which aims to remove low-quality data and improve the overall quality of user data. Finally, the optimal user revenue strategy under different conditions is obtained from the evolutionary stability strategy (ESS) solution and stability analysis. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed solutions, extensive experiments using some real data sets are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has high accuracy of data quality assessment and a reasonable selection of user revenue.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Smart cities can effectively improve the quality of urban life. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is an important part of smart cities. The accurate and real-time prediction of traffic flow plays an important role in ITSs. To improve the prediction accuracy, we propose a novel traffic flow prediction method, called AutoEncoder Long Short-Term Memory (AE-LSTM) prediction method. In our method, the AutoEncoder is used to obtain the internal relationship of traffic flow by extracting the characteristics of upstream and downstream traffic flow data. Moreover, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network utilizes the acquired characteristic data and the historical data to predict complex linear traffic flow data. The experimental results show that the AE-LSTM method had higher prediction accuracy. Specifically, the Mean Relative Error (MRE) of the AE-LSTM was reduced by 0.01 compared with the previous prediction methods. In addition, AE-LSTM method also had good stability. For different stations and different dates, the prediction error and fluctuation of the AE-LSTM method was small. Furthermore, the average MRE of AE-LSTM prediction results was 0.06 for six different days.

AB  - In recent years, air pollution has become an important public health concern. The high concentration of fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) is known to be associated with lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and metabolic disease. Predicting PM2.5 concentrations can help governments warn people at high risk, thus mitigating the complications. Although attempts have been made to predict PM2.5 concentrations, the factors influencing PM2.5 prediction have not been investigated. In this work, we study feature importance for PM2.5 prediction in Tehran’s urban area, implementing random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and deep learning machine learning (ML) approaches. We use 23 features, including satellite and meteorological data, ground-measured PM2.5, and geographical data, in the modeling. The best model performance obtained was R2 = 0.81 (R = 0.9), MAE = 9.93 µg/m3, and RMSE = 13.58 µg/m3 using the XGBoost approach, incorporating elimination of unimportant features. However, all three ML methods performed similarly and R2 varied from 0.63 to 0.67, when Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 3 km resolution was included, and 0.77 to 0.81, when AOD at 3 km resolution was excluded. Contrary to the PM2.5 lag data, satellite-derived AODs did not improve model performance.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the key factors that enables, drives and accelerates the digital transformation all over the world. The vision of the IoT is not only the immediate access to the data but also the ability to turning data into intelligence. As such, there is a growing number of public cloud computing providers offering IoT related services, including data processing, data analyzing and data visualization. However, with tens of billions of microcontroller-powered devices getting involved in the era of IoT, the concerns for overall security, privacy and cost are rising constantly and exponentially. Furthermore, these issues cannot be solved by public cloud computing providers since they mainly focus on the software and services rather than on the end devices. In this article, an integrated solution including Azure Sphere devices and Azure cloud services is proposed to provide a comprehensive and efficient way to ensure security that starts in the device and extends to the cloud with limited budgets. Moreover, the implementation details including hardware components, software design and Azure cloud integration are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution.

AB  - The ongoing digital transformation has the potential to revolutionize nearly all industrial manufacturing processes. However, its concrete requirements and implications are still not sufficiently investigated. In order to establish a common understanding, a multitude of initiatives have published guidelines, reference frameworks and specifications, all intending to promote their particular interpretation of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). As a result of the inconsistent use of terminology, heterogeneous structures and proposed processes, an opaque landscape has been created. The consequence is that both new users and experienced experts can hardly manage to get an overview of the amount of information and publications, and make decisions on what is best to use and to adopt. This work contributes to the state of the art by providing a structured analysis of existing reference frameworks, their classifications and the concerns they target. We supply alignments of shared concepts, identify gaps and give a structured mapping of regarded concerns at each part of the respective reference architectures. Furthermore, the linking of relevant industry standards and technologies to the architectures allows a more effective search for specifications and guidelines and supports the direct technology adoption.

AB  - Recently, the development of smart home technologies has played a crucial role in enhancing several real-life smart applications. They help improve the quality of life through systems designed to enhance convenience, comfort, entertainment, health of the householders, and security. Note, however, that malware attacks on smart home devices are increasing in frequency and volume. As people seek to improve and optimize comfort in their home and minimize their daily home responsibilities at the same time, this makes them attractive targets for a malware attack. Thus, attacks on smart home-based devices have emerged. The goals of this paper are to analyze the different aspects of cyber-physical threats on the smart home from a security perspective, discuss the types of attacks including advanced cyber-attacks and cyber-physical system attacks, and evaluate the impact on a smart home system in daily life. We have come up with a taxonomy focusing on cyber threat attacks that can also have potential impact on a smart home system and identify some key issues about VPNFilter malware that constitutes large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)-based botnet malware infection. We also discuss the defense mechanism against this threat and mention the most infected routers. The specific objective of this paper is to provide efficient task management and knowledge related to VPNFilter malware attack.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 13
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - There is strong demand for real-time suspicious tracking across multiple cameras in intelligent video surveillance for public areas, such as universities, airports and factories. Most criminal events show that the nature of suspicious behavior are carried out by un-known people who try to hide themselves as much as possible. Previous learning-based studies collected a large volume data set to train a learning model to detect humans across multiple cameras but failed to recognize newcomers. There are also several feature-based studies aimed to identify humans within-camera tracking. It would be very difficult for those methods to get necessary feature information in multi-camera scenarios and scenes. It is the purpose of this study to design and implement a suspicious tracking mechanism across multiple cameras based on correlation filters, called suspicious tracking across multiple cameras based on correlation filters (STAM-CCF). By leveraging the geographical information of cameras and YOLO object detection framework, STAM-CCF adjusts human identification and prevents errors caused by information loss in case of object occlusion and overlapping for within-camera tracking cases. STAM-CCF also introduces a camera correlation model and a two-stage gait recognition strategy to deal with problems of re-identification across multiple cameras. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well with highly acceptable accuracy. The evidences also show that the proposed STAM-CCF method can continuously recognize suspicious behavior within-camera tracking and re-identify it successfully across multiple cameras.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Understanding human behavior can assist in the adoption of satisfactory health interventions and improved care. One of the main problems relies on the definition of human behaviors, as human activities depend on multiple variables and are of dynamic nature. Although smart homes have advanced in the latest years and contributed to unobtrusive human behavior tracking, artificial intelligence has not coped yet with the problem of variability and dynamism of these behaviors. Process mining is an emerging discipline capable of adapting to the nature of high-variate data and extract knowledge to define behavior patterns. In this study, we analyze data from 25 in-house residents acquired with indoor location sensors by means of process mining clustering techniques, which allows obtaining workflows of the human behavior inside the house. Data are clustered by adjusting two variables: the similarity index and the Euclidean distance between workflows. Thereafter, two main models are created: (1) a workflow view to analyze the characteristics of the discovered clusters and the information they reveal about human behavior and (2) a calendar view, in which common behaviors are rendered in the way of a calendar allowing to detect relevant patterns depending on the day of the week and the season of the year. Three representative patients who performed three different behaviors: stable, unstable, and complex behaviors according to the proposed approach are investigated. This approach provides human behavior details in the manner of a workflow model, discovering user paths, frequent transitions between rooms, and the time the user was in each room, in addition to showing the results into the calendar view increases readability and visual attraction of human behaviors, allowing to us detect patterns happening on special days.

AB  - A new generation of smart meters are called cognitive meters, which are essentially based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and load disaggregation methods for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). Thus, modern NILM may recognize appliances connected to the grid during certain periods, while providing much more information than the traditional monthly consumption. Therefore, this article presents a new load disaggregation methodology with microscopic characteristics collected from current and voltage waveforms. Initially, the novel NILM algorithm&mdash;called the Power Signature Blob (PSB)&mdash;makes use of a state machine to detect when the appliance has been turned on or off. Then, machine learning is used to identify the appliance, for which attributes are extracted from the Conservative Power Theory (CPT), a contemporary power theory that enables comprehensive load modeling. Finally, considering simulation and experimental results, this paper shows that the new method is able to achieve 95% accuracy considering the applied data set.

AB  - The edge platform has evolved to become a part of a distributed computing environment. While typical edges do not have enough processing power to train machine learning models in real time, it is common to generate models in the cloud for use on the edge. The pattern of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) data is dependent on individual circumstances. It is not easy to guarantee prediction performance when a monolithic model is used without considering the spatial characteristics of the space generating those data. In this paper, we propose a collaborative framework using a new method to select the best model for the edge from candidate models of cloud based on sample data correlation. This method lets the edge use the most suitable model without any training tasks on the edge side, and it also minimizes privacy issues. We apply the proposed method to predict future fine particulate matter concentration in an individual space. The results suggest that our method can provide better performance than the previous method.

SN  - 2504-2289

AB  - In this work, we build a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system of breast cancer for high risk patients considering the breast imaging reporting and data system (BIRADS), mapping main expert concepts and rules. Therefore, a bag of words is built based on the ontology of breast cancer analysis. For a more reliable characterization of the lesion, a feature selection based on Choquet integral is applied aiming at discarding the irrelevant descriptors. Then, a set of well-known machine learning tools are used for semantic annotation to fill the gap between low level knowledge and expert concepts involved in the BIRADS classification. Indeed, expert rules are implicitly modeled using a set of classifiers for severity diagnosis. As a result, the feature selection gives a a better assessment of the lesion and the semantic analysis context offers an attractive frame to include external factors and meta-knowledge, as well as exploiting more than one modality. Accordingly, our CAD system is intended for diagnosis of breast cancer for high risk patients. It has been then validated based on two complementary modalities, MRI and dual energy contrast enhancement mammography (DECEDM), the proposed system leads a correct classification rate of 99%.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - There are few network resources in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs). Compressing media data can reduce the reliance of user&rsquo;s Quality of Experience (QoE) on network resources. Existing video coding software, such as H.264 and H.265, focuses only on spatial and short-term information redundancy. However, video usually contains redundancy over a long period of time. Therefore, compressing video information redundancy with a long period of time without compromising the user experience and adaptive delivery is a challenge in WMSNs. In this paper, a semantic-aware super-resolution transmission for adaptive video streaming system (SASRT) for WMSNs is presented. In the SASRT, some deep learning algorithms are used to extract video semantic information and enrich the video quality. On the multimedia sensor, different bit-rate semantic information and video data are encoded and uploaded to user. Semantic information can also be identified on the user side, further reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred. However, identifying semantic information on the user side may increase the computational cost of the user side. On the user side, video quality is enriched with super-resolution technologies. The major challenges faced by SASRT include where the semantic information is identified, how to choose the bit rates of semantic and video information, and how network resources should be allocated to video and semantic information. The optimization problem is formulated as a complexity-constrained nonlinear NP-hard problem. Three adaptive strategies and a heuristic algorithm are proposed to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that SASRT can compress video information redundancy with a long period of time effectively and enrich the user experience with limited network resources while simultaneously improving the utilization of these network resources.

AB  - Efficient and reliable systems are required to detect and monitor disasters such as wildfires as well as to notify the people in the disaster-affected areas. Internet of Things (IoT) is the key paradigm that can address the multitude problems related to disaster management. In addition, an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled IoT platform connected via cellular network can further enhance the robustness of the disaster management system. The UAV-enabled IoT platform is based on three main research areas: (i) ground IoT network; (ii) communication technologies for ground and aerial connectivity; and (iii) data analytics. In this paper, we provide a holistic view of a UAVs-enabled IoT platform which can provide ubiquitous connectivity to both aerial and ground users in challenging environments such as wildfire management. We then highlight key challenges for the design of an efficient and reliable IoT platform. We detail a case study targeting the design of an efficient ground IoT network that can detect and monitor fire and send notifications to people using named data networking (NDN) architecture. The use of NDN architecture in a sensor network for IoT integrates pull-based communication to enable reliable and efficient message dissemination in the network and to notify the users as soon as possible in case of disastrous situations. The results of the case study show the enormous impact on the performance of IoT platform for wildfire management. Lastly, we draw the conclusion and outline future research directions in this field.

AB  - There are many factors that may have a significant effect on the skin wound healing process. The environment is one of them. Although different previous research woks have highlighted the role of environmental elements such as humidity, temperature, dust, etc., in the process of skin wound healing, there is no predefined method available to identify the favourable or adverse environment conditions that seriously affect (positively or negatively) the skin wound healing process. In the current research work, an IoT-based approach is used to design an AQSS (Air Quality Sensing System) using sensors for the acquisition of real-time environment data, and the SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier is applied to classify environments into one of the two categories, i.e., &ldquo;favourable&rdquo;, and &ldquo;unfavourable&rdquo;. The proposed system is also supported with an Android application to provide an easy-to-use interface. The proposed system provides an easy and simple means for patients to evaluate the environmental parameters and monitor their effects in the process of open skin wound healing.

AB  - The ubiquity of smartphones and the growth of computing resources, such as connectivity, processing, portability, and power of sensing, have greatly changed people&rsquo;s lives. Today, many smartphones contain a variety of powerful sensors, including motion, location, network, and direction sensors. Motion or inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer), specifically, have been widely used to recognize users&rsquo; physical activities. This has opened doors for many different and interesting applications in several areas, such as health and transportation. In this perspective, this work provides a comprehensive, state of the art review of the current situation of human activity recognition (HAR) solutions in the context of inertial sensors in smartphones. This article begins by discussing the concepts of human activities along with the complete historical events, focused on smartphones, which shows the evolution of the area in the last two decades. Next, we present a detailed description of the HAR methodology, focusing on the presentation of the steps of HAR solutions in the context of inertial sensors. For each step, we cite the main references that use the best implementation practices suggested by the scientific community. Finally, we present the main results about HAR solutions from the perspective of the inertial sensors embedded in smartphones.

AB  - NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) is emerging as a promising communication technology offering a reliable wireless connection to a large number of devices employed in pervasive monitoring scenarios, such as Smart City, Precision Agriculture, and Industry 4.0. Since most of the NB-IoT transmissions occur in the uplink, the random access channel (that is the primary interface between devices and the base station) may usually become the main bottleneck of the entire system. For this reason, analytical models and simulation tools able to investigate its behavior in different scenarios are of the utmost importance for driving current and future research activities. Unfortunately, scientific literature partially addresses the current open issues by means of simplified and, in many cases, not standard-compliant approaches. To provide a significant step forward in this direction, the contribution of this paper is three-folded. First, it presents a flexible, open-source, and 3GPP-compliant implementation of the NB-IoT random access procedure. Second, it formulates an analytical model capturing both collision and success probabilities associated with the aforementioned procedure. Third, it presents the cross-validation of both the analytical model and the simulation tool, by taking into account reference applications scenarios of sensor networks enabling periodic reporting in monitoring infrastructures. Obtained results prove the remarkable accuracy, demonstrating a well-calibrated instrument, which will be also useful for future research activities.

AB  - Major metropolitan cities worldwide have extensively invested to secure utilities and build state-of-the-art infrastructure related to underground fluid transportation. Sewer and water pipelines make our lives extremely convenient when they function appropriately. However, leakages in underground pipe mains causes sinkholes and drinking-water scarcity. Sinkholes are the complex problems stemming from the interaction of leaked water and ground. The aim of this work is to review the existing methods for monitoring leakage in underground pipelines, the sinkholes caused by these leakages, and the viability of wireless sensor networking (WSN) for monitoring leakages and sinkholes. Herein, the authors have discussed the methods based on different objectives and their applicability via various approaches&mdash;(1) patent analysis; (2) web-of-science analysis; (3) WSN-based pipeline leakage and sinkhole monitoring. The study shows that the research on sinkholes due to leakages in sewer and water pipelines by using WSN is still in a premature stage and needs extensive investigation and research contributions. Additionally, the authors have suggested prospects for future research by comparing, analyzing, and classifying the reviewed methods. This study advocates collocating WSN, Internet of things, and artificial intelligence with pipeline monitoring methods to resolve the issues of the sinkhole occurrence.

TI  - TIR-MS: Thermal Infrared Mean-Shift for Robust Pedestrian Head Tracking in Dynamic Target and Background Variations

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) pedestrian tracking is one of the major issues in computer vision. Mean-shift is a powerful and versatile non-parametric iterative algorithm for finding local maxima in probability distributions. In existing infrared data, and mean-shift-based tracking is generally based on the brightness feature values. Unfortunately, the brightness is distorted by the target and background variations. This paper proposes a novel pedestrian tracking algorithm, thermal infrared mean-shift (TIR-MS), by introducing radiometric temperature data in mean-shift tracking. The thermal brightness image (eight-bits) was distorted by the automatic contrast enhancement of the scene such as hot objects in the background. On the other hand, the temperature data was unaffected directly by the background change, except for variations by the seasonal effect, which is more stable than the brightness. The experimental results showed that the TIR-MS outperformed the original mean-shift-based brightness when tracking a pedestrian head with successive background variations.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now considered one of the best remote sensing techniques for gathering data over large areas. They are now being used in the industry sector as sensing tools for proactively solving or preventing many issues, besides quantifying production and helping to make decisions. UAVs are a highly consistent technological platform for efficient and cost-effective data collection and event monitoring. The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) sends data from systems that monitor and control the physical world to data processing systems that cloud computing has shown to be important tools for meeting processing requirements. In fog computing, the IoT gateway links different objects to the internet. It can operate as a joint interface for different networks and support different communication protocols. A great deal of effort has been put into developing UAVs and multi-UAV systems. This paper introduces a smart IIoT monitoring and control system based on an unmanned aerial vehicle that uses cloud computing services and exploits fog computing as the bridge between IIoT layers. Its novelty lies in the fact that the UAV is automatically integrated into an industrial control system through an IoT gateway platform, while UAV photos are systematically and instantly computed and analyzed in the cloud. Visual supervision of the plant by drones and cloud services is integrated in real-time into the control loop of the industrial control system. As a proof of concept, the platform was used in a case study in an industrial concrete plant. The results obtained clearly illustrate the feasibility of the proposed platform in providing a reliable and efficient system for UAV remote control to improve product quality and reduce waste. For this, we studied the communication latency between the different IIoT layers in different IoT gateways.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus must monitor their blood glucose levels in order to control the glycaemia. Consequently, they must perform a capillary test at least three times per day and, besides that, a laboratory test once or twice per month. These standard methods pose difficulty for patients since they need to prick their finger in order to determine the glucose concentration, yielding discomfort and distress. In this paper, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based framework for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring is described. The system is based on Raspberry Pi Zero (RPi) energised with a power bank, using a visible laser beam and a Raspberry Pi Camera, all implemented in a glove. Data for the non-invasive monitoring is acquired by the RPi Zero taking a set of pictures of the user fingertip and computing their histograms. Generated data is processed by an artificial neural network (ANN) implemented on a Flask microservice using the Tensorflow libraries. In this paper, all measurements were performed in vivo and the obtained data was validated against laboratory blood tests by means of the mean absolute error (10.37%) and Clarke grid error (90.32% in zone A). Estimated glucose values can be harvested by an end device such as a smartphone for monitoring purposes.

AB  - The rapid evolution towards future telecommunications infrastructures (e.g., 5G, the fifth generation of mobile networks) and the internet is renewing a strong interest for artificial intelligence (AI) methods, systems, and networks. Processing big data to infer patterns at high speeds and with low power consumption is becoming an increasing central technological challenge. Electronics are facing physically fundamental bottlenecks, whilst nanophotonics technologies are considered promising candidates to overcome the limitations of electronics. Today, there are evidences of an emerging research field, rooted in quantum optics, where the technological trajectories of deep neural networks (DNNs) and nanophotonics are crossing each other. This paper elaborates on these topics and proposes a theoretical architecture for a Complex DNN made from programmable metasurfaces; an example is also provided showing a striking correspondence between the equivariance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the invariance principle of gauge transformations.

VL  - 12

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The pervasive and increasing deployment of smart meters allows collecting a huge amount of fine-grained energy data in different urban scenarios. The analysis of such data is challenging and opening up a variety of interesting and new research issues across energy and computer science research areas. The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches. This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption. SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets. As a case study, SPEC has been tested on real data of an heating distribution network and power consumption data collected in a major Italian city. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SPEC to forecast both fine-grained values and coarse levels of power consumption of buildings.

VL  - 9
IS  - 15
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Psycho-acoustic parameters have been extensively used to evaluate the discomfort or pleasure produced by the sounds in our environment. In this context, wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) can be an interesting solution for monitoring subjective annoyance in certain soundscapes, since they can be used to register the evolution of such parameters in time and space. Unfortunately, the calculation of the psycho-acoustic parameters involved in common annoyance models implies a significant computational cost, and makes difficult the acquisition and transmission of these parameters at the nodes. As a result, monitoring psycho-acoustic annoyance becomes an expensive and inefficient task. This paper proposes the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large urban sound dataset capable of efficiently predicting psycho-acoustic annoyance from raw audio signals continuously. We evaluate the proposed regression model and compare the resulting computation times with the ones obtained by the conventional direct calculation approach. The results confirm that the proposed model based on CNN achieves high precision in predicting psycho-acoustic annoyance, predicting annoyance values with an average quadratic error of around 3%. It also achieves a very significant reduction in processing time, which is up to 300 times faster than direct calculation, making CNN designed a clear exponent to work in IoT devices.

AB  - An exemplary paradigm of how an AI can be a disruptive technological paragon via the utilization of blockchain comes straight from the world of deep learning. Data scientists have long struggled to maintain the quality of a dataset for machine learning by an AI entity. Datasets can be very expensive to purchase, as, depending on both the proper selection of the elements and the homogeneity of the data contained within, constructing and maintaining the integrity of a dataset is difficult. Blockchain as a highly secure storage medium presents a technological quantum leap in maintaining data integrity. Furthermore, blockchain&rsquo;s immutability constructs a fruitful environment for creating high quality, permanent and growing datasets for deep learning. The combination of AI and blockchain could impact fields like Internet of things (IoT), identity, financial markets, civil governance, smart cities, small communities, supply chains, personalized medicine and other fields, and thereby deliver benefits to many people.

AB  - Alzheimer&rsquo;s is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that frequently occurs in many people today. It has a major effect on the routine activities of affected people. Previous advancement in smartphone sensors technology enables us to help people suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s. For people in the Muslim community, where it is mandatory to offer prayers five times a day, it may mean that they are struggling in their daily life prayers due to Alzheimer&rsquo;s or lack of concentration. To deal with such a problem, automated mobile sensor-based activity recognition applications can be supportive to design accurate and precise solutions with an objective to direct the Namazi (worshipper). In this paper, a Salah activities recognition model (SARM) using a mobile sensor is proposed with the aim to recognize specific activities, such as Al-Qayam (standing), Ruku (standing to bowing), and Sujud (standing to prostration). This model entails the collection of data, selection and placement of sensor, data preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The proposed model will provide a stepping edge to develop an application for observing prayer. For these activities&rsquo; recognition, data sets were collected from ten subjects, and six different features sets were used to get improved results. Extensive experiments were performed to test and validate the model features to train random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayes (NB), and decision tree (DT). The predicted average accuracy of RF, KNN, NB, and DT was 97%, 94%, 71.6%, and 95% respectively.

AB  - Mobile health research field aims to provide access to healthcare anytime and anywhere through mobile computing technologies while using a cost-effective approach. Mobile health is closely related to ambient assisted living as both research fields address independence in elderly adults. Aging has become a relevant challenge, as it is anticipated that 20% of world population will be aged 60 years and older in 2050. Most people spend more than 90% of their time indoors, therefore the indoor environmental quality has a relevant impact on occupant&rsquo;s health and well-being. We intended to provide real-time indoor quality monitoring for enhanced living environments and occupational health. This paper presents the AirPlus real-time indoor environmental quality monitoring system, which incorporates several advantages when compared to other systems, such as scalability, flexibility, modularity, easy installation, and configuration, as well as mobile computing software for data consulting and notifications. The results that were obtained are promising and present a significant contribution to the monitoring solutions available in the literature. AirPlus provides a rich dataset to plan interventions for enhanced indoor quality, but also to support clinical diagnostics and correlate occupant&rsquo;s health problems with their living environment conditions.

AB  - The blockchain technique is becoming more and more popular due to its advantages such as stability and dispersed nature. This is an idea based on blockchain activity paradigms. Another important field is machine learning, which is increasingly used in practice. Unfortunately, the training or overtraining artificial neural networks is very time-consuming and requires high computing power. In this paper, we proposed using a blockchain technique to train neural networks. This type of activity is important due to the possible search for initial weights in the network, which affect faster training, due to gradient decrease. We performed the tests with much heavier calculations to indicate that such an action is possible. However, this type of solution can also be used for less demanding calculations, i.e., only a few iterations of training and finding a better configuration of initial weights.

AB  - The IoT describes a development field where new approaches and trends are in constant change. In this scenario, new devices and sensors are offering higher precision in everyday life in an increasingly less invasive way. In this work, we propose the use of spatial-temporal features by means of fuzzy logic as a general descriptor for heterogeneous sensors. This fuzzy sensor representation is highly efficient and enables devices with low computing power to develop learning and evaluation tasks in activity recognition using light and efficient classifiers. To show the methodology&rsquo;s potential in real applications, we deploy an intelligent environment where new UWB location devices, inertial objects, wearable devices, and binary sensors are connected with each other and describe daily human activities. We then apply the proposed fuzzy logic-based methodology to obtain spatial-temporal features to fuse the data from the heterogeneous sensor devices. A case study developed in the UJAmISmart Lab of the University of Jaen (Jaen, Spain) shows the encouraging performance of the methodology when recognizing the activity of an inhabitant using efficient classifiers.

AB  - Intelligent infrastructure, including smart cities and intelligent buildings, must learn and adapt to the variable needs and requirements of users, owners and operators in order to be future proof and to provide a return on investment based on Operational Expenditure (OPEX) and Capital Expenditure (CAPEX). To address this challenge, this article presents a biological algorithm based on neural networks and deep reinforcement learning that enables infrastructure to be intelligent by making predictions about its different variables. In addition, the proposed method makes decisions based on real time data. Intelligent infrastructure must be able to proactively monitor, protect and repair itself: this includes independent components and assets working the same way any autonomous biological organisms would. Neurons of artificial neural networks are associated with a prediction or decision layer based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that takes into consideration all of its previous learning. The proposed method was validated against an intelligent infrastructure dataset with outstanding results: the intelligent infrastructure was able to learn, predict and adapt to its variables, and components could make relevant decisions autonomously, emulating a living biological organism in which data flow exhaustively.

AB  - To build sustainable smart energy cities (SECs) around the world, many countries are now combining customized services and businesses within their energy infrastructure and urban environments. Such changes could then promote the development of platforms that ultimately provide benefits for citizens such as convenience, safety, and cost savings. Currently, the development of technologies for SECs focuses on independent products and unit technology. However, this is problematic, as it may not be possible to develop sustainable cities if there is a lack of connectivity between various elements within the SEC. To solve such problems, this paper presents an AI-based physical and virtual platform using a 5-layer architecture to develop a sustainable smart energy city (SSEC). The architecture employs both a top-down and bottom-up approach and the links between each energy element in the SSEC can readily be analyzed. The economic analysis based on return on investment (ROI) is carried out by comparing the economic benefits before and after the application of this system. Deploying the proposed platform will enable the speedy development and application of new services for SSECs and will provide SSECs with measures to ensure sustainable development, such as rapid urban development, and cost reductions.

AB  - Dockless bike-sharing programs (DBSPs) are typical representatives of the new era of the internet economy. These schemes alleviate urban traffic congestion, reduce carbon emissions, and change people&rsquo;s preferred travel modes, but they also suffer from a series of problems related to unsustainability. The sustainability performance of a DBSP is closely related to its influencing factors, which can be used to understand the main challenges of the program and consider what useful measures should be taken to overcome these issues. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the related factors that are critical to the sustainability of DBSPs from a systems-level perspective. In this paper, we explored publicly available data sources (i.e., literature, institutional reports, and announcements) to determine the intrinsic influencing factors and understand their interactions and feedback relationships. A taxonomy of the key challenges with respect to the fundamental pillars of DBSP sustainability (i.e., environment, society, and economy) was provided. System dynamics methodology was employed to map the critical factors and links in order to analyze the key challenges in facilitating the sustainability of DBSPs. Based on this approach, we put forward proposals to mitigate the severe challenges for governments and DBSP operators. The findings provide a theoretical basis and guiding role to develop improvement strategies for DBSP sustainability.

AB  - The accurate measurement of pipeline centerline coordinates is of great significance to the management of oil and gas pipelines and energy transportation security. The main method for pipeline centerline measurement is in-line inspection technology based on multi-sensor data fusion, which combines the inertial measurement unit (IMU), above-ground marker, and odometer. However, the observation of velocity is not accurate because the odometer often slips in the actual inspection, which greatly affects the accuracy of centerline measurement. In this paper, we propose a new compensation method for oil and gas pipeline centerline measurement based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network during the occurrence of odometer slip. The field test results indicated that the mean of absolute position errors reduced from 8.75 to 2.02 m. The proposed method could effectively reduce the errors and improve the accuracy of pipeline centerline measurement during odometer slips.

AB  - The integration of different networks has attracted significant attention in academia. Both terrestrial and maritime communications systems have been attracting keen interest for ways to deal with various applications. As the environment of cognitive vehicular and maritime networks is extremely dynamic, these networks suffer with a long delay because of intermittent links while providing services for different applications. To this end, here we introduce the integration of cognitive vehicular and maritime networks to design a coastal smart city by utilizing software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and fog computing under the same infrastructure. This novel integrated cognitive coastal city fulfills the demand of each application user in a hybrid environment with a quicker response time. The idea is to combine vehicular and maritime communications to meet different user demands. Different virtual networks are launched by network function virtualization, and are managed and controlled by a software-defined networking controller. From the integration of software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and fog computing, both vehicular and marine users are provided with stable paths to meet each application&rsquo;s demands.

AB  - In recent years, the contrast against energy waste and pollution has become mandatory and widely endorsed. Among the many actors at stake, the building sector energy management is one of the most critical. Indeed, buildings are responsible for     40 %     of total energy consumption only in Europe, affecting more than a third of the total pollution produced. Therefore, energy control policies of buildings (for example, forecast-based policies such as Demand Response and Demand Side Management) play a decisive role in reducing energy waste. On these premises, this paper presents an innovative methodology based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology for smart building indoor air-temperature forecasting. In detail, our methodology exploits a specialized Non-linear Autoregressive neural network for short- and medium-term predictions, envisioning two different exploitation: (i) on realistic artificial data and (ii) on real data collected by IoT devices deployed in the building. For this purpose, we designed and optimized four neural models, focusing respectively on three characterizing rooms and on the whole building. Experimental results on both a simulated and a real sensors dataset demonstrate the prediction accuracy and robustness of our proposed models.

AB  - We propose a high-performance algorithm while using a promoted and modified form of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, which is based on the TensorFlow framework, to enhance the real-time monitoring of traffic-flow problems by an intelligent transportation system. Real-time detection and traffic-flow statistics were realized by adjusting the network structure, optimizing the loss function, and introducing weight regularization. This model, which we call YOLO-UA, was initialized based on the weight of a YOLO model pre-trained while using the VOC2007 data set. The UA-CAR data set with complex weather conditions was used for training, and better model parameters were selected through tests and subsequent adjustments. The experimental results showed that, for different weather scenarios, the accuracy of the YOLO-UA was ~22% greater than that of the YOLO model before optimization, and the recall rate increased by about 21%. On both cloudy and sunny days, the accuracy, precision, and recall rate of the YOLO-UA model were more than 94% above the floating rate, which suggested that the precision and recall rate achieved a good balance. When used for video testing, the YOLO-UA model yielded traffic statistics with an accuracy of up to 100%; the time to count the vehicles in each frame was less than 30 ms and it was highly robust in response to changes in scenario and weather.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Urban development in recent decades has had a significant impact on climate change. Cities have implemented traffic monitoring systems to sustain the new building code in meeting the target for environmental indicators. Timisoara is the second city in Romania and manages over 60% of the development and pollution of Timis County. The analysis of large volumes of data provided by local sensors and databases requires big data analytics. In this research, for the first time, we simultaneously developed two parallel scenario-based decision-making support models to assess a CO2 sequestration index. The model is based on a tree inventory for traffic area and car flow using Roegenian processes with borders. The first scenario (dt1) analyzes the real O2-pollution car flows for process streets as receivers of pollution. The second scenario (dt2) analyzes O2-pollution flows for the same streets from the perspective of streets that garage the cars. We modeled the parallel integration of actual O2 production and pollution flows for 160 main streets that account for over 50% of the urban mileage of Timisoara city. The carbon sequestration indexes of the streets are in the range of 0.0000043&ndash;0.437 (dt1) and 0.0000092&ndash;11.78 (dt2). The results can be used to support local decision making regarding the environment CO2-O2 balances by optimizing the local fiscal policies. The research could be extended to secondary streets and separately for the pollution of heating-cooling devices for residential building areas.

VL  - 9
IS  - 18
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The need to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, as well as the use of local renewable heat sources has caused heat meters to be used not only to calculate the consumed energy, but also for the active management of central heating systems. Increasing the reading frequency and the use of measurement data to control the heating system expands the requirements for the reliability of heat meters. The aim of the research is to analyze a large set of meters in the real network and predict their faults to avoid inaccurate readings, incorrect billing, heating system disruption, and unnecessary maintenance. The reliability analysis of heat meters, based on historical data collected over several years, shows some regularities, which cannot be easily described by physics-based models. The failure rate is almost constant and does depend on the past, but is a non-linear combination of state variables. To predict meters&rsquo; failures in the next billing period, three independent machine learning models are implemented and compared with selected metrics, because even the high performance of a single model (87% true positive for neural network) may be insufficient to make a maintenance decision. Additionally, performing hyperparameter optimization boosts the models&rsquo; performance by a few percent. Finally, three improved models are used to build an ensemble classifier, which outperforms the individual models. The proposed procedure ensures the high efficiency of fault detection (&gt;95%), while maintaining overfitting at the minimum level. The methodology is universal and can be utilized to study the reliability and predict faults of other types of meters and different objects with the constant failure rate.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Traffic sign detection and recognition are crucial in the development of intelligent vehicles. An improved traffic sign detection and recognition algorithm for intelligent vehicles is proposed to address problems such as how easily affected traditional traffic sign detection is by the environment, and poor real-time performance of deep learning-based methodologies for traffic sign recognition. Firstly, the HSV color space is used for spatial threshold segmentation, and traffic signs are effectively detected based on the shape features. Secondly, the model is considerably improved on the basis of the classical LeNet-5 convolutional neural network model by using Gabor kernel as the initial convolutional kernel, adding the batch normalization processing after the pooling layer and selecting Adam method as the optimizer algorithm. Finally, the traffic sign classification and recognition experiments are conducted based on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. The favorable prediction and accurate recognition of traffic signs are achieved through the continuous training and testing of the network model. Experimental results show that the accurate recognition rate of traffic signs reaches 99.75%, and the average processing time per frame is 5.4 ms. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm has remarkable accuracy and real-time performance, strong generalization ability and high training efficiency. The accurate recognition rate and average processing time are markedly improved. This improvement is of considerable importance to reduce the accident rate and enhance the road traffic safety situation, providing a strong technical guarantee for the steady development of intelligent vehicle driving assistance.

AB  - It is widely recognized that nanoscience and nanotechnology and their subfields, such as nanophotonics, nanoelectronics, and nanomechanics, have had a tremendous impact on recent advances in sensing, imaging, and communication, with notable developments, including novel transistors and processor architectures. For example, in addition to being supremely fast, optical and photonic components and devices are capable of operating across multiple orders of magnitude length, power, and spectral scales, encompassing the range from macroscopic device sizes and kW energies to atomic domains and single-photon energies. The extreme versatility of the associated electromagnetic phenomena and applications, both classical and quantum, are therefore highly appealing to the rapidly evolving computing and communication realms, where innovations in both hardware and software are necessary to meet the growing speed and memory requirements. Development of all-optical components, photonic chips, interconnects, and processors will bring the speed of light, photon coherence properties, field confinement and enhancement, information-carrying capacity, and the broad spectrum of light into the high-performance computing, the internet of things, and industries related to cloud, fog, and recently edge computing. Conversely, owing to their extraordinary properties, 0D, 1D, and 2D materials are being explored as a physical basis for the next generation of logic components and processors. Carbon nanotubes, for example, have been recently used to create a new processor beyond proof of principle. These developments, in conjunction with neuromorphic and quantum computing, are envisioned to maintain the growth of computing power beyond the projected plateau for silicon technology. We survey the qualitative figures of merit of technologies of current interest for the next generation computing with an emphasis on edge computing.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The core of intelligent virtual geographical environments (VGEs) is the formal expression of geographic knowledge. Its purpose is to transform the data, information, and scenes of a virtual geographic environment into &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; that can be recognized by computer, so that the computer can understand the virtual geographic environment more easily. A geographic knowledge graph (GeoKG) is a large-scale semantic web that stores geographical knowledge in a structured form. Based on a geographic knowledge base and a geospatial database, intelligent interactions with virtual geographical environments can be realized by natural language question answering, entity links, and so on. In this paper, a knowledge-enhanced Virtual geographical environments service framework is proposed. We construct a multi-level semantic parsing model and an enhanced GeoKG for structured geographic information data, such as digital maps, 3D virtual scenes, and unstructured information data. Based on the GeoKG, we propose a bilateral LSTM-CRF (long short-term memory- conditional random field) model to achieve natural language question answering for VGEs and conduct experiments on the method. The results prove that the method of intelligent interaction based on the knowledge graph can bridge the distance between people and virtual environments.

TI  - AE-GAN-Net: Learning Invariant Feature Descriptor to Match Ground Camera Images and a Large-Scale 3D Image-Based Point Cloud for Outdoor Augmented Reality

AB  - Establishing the spatial relationship between 2D images captured by real cameras and 3D models of the environment (2D and 3D space) is one way to achieve the virtual&ndash;real registration for Augmented Reality (AR) in outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose to match the 2D images captured by real cameras and the rendered images from the 3D image-based point cloud to indirectly establish the spatial relationship between 2D and 3D space. We call these two kinds of images as cross-domain images, because their imaging mechanisms and nature are quite different. However, unlike real camera images, the rendered images from the 3D image-based point cloud are inevitably contaminated with image distortion, blurred resolution, and obstructions, which makes image matching with the handcrafted descriptors or existing feature learning neural networks very challenging. Thus, we first propose a novel end-to-end network, AE-GAN-Net, consisting of two AutoEncoders (AEs) with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) embedding, to learn invariant feature descriptors for cross-domain image matching. Second, a domain-consistent loss function, which balances image content and consistency of feature descriptors for cross-domain image pairs, is introduced to optimize AE-GAN-Net. AE-GAN-Net effectively captures domain-specific information, which is embedded into the learned feature descriptors, thus making the learned feature descriptors robust against image distortion, variations in viewpoints, spatial resolutions, rotation, and scaling. Experimental results show that AE-GAN-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance for image patch retrieval with the cross-domain image patch dataset, which is built from real camera images and the rendered images from 3D image-based point cloud. Finally, by evaluating virtual&ndash;real registration for AR on a campus by using the cross-domain image matching results, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying the proposed virtual&ndash;real registration to AR in outdoor environments.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - 3D modelling of indoor environment is essential in smart city applications such as building information modelling (BIM), spatial location application, energy consumption estimation, and signal simulation, etc. Fast and stable reconstruction of 3D models from point clouds has already attracted considerable research interest. However, in the complex indoor environment, automated reconstruction of detailed 3D models still remains a serious challenge. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel method that couples linear structures with three-dimensional geometric surfaces to automatically reconstruct 3D models using point cloud data from mobile laser scanning. In our proposed approach, a fully automatic room segmentation is performed on the unstructured point clouds via multi-label graph cuts with semantic constraints, which can overcome the over-segmentation in the long corridor. Then, the horizontal slices of point clouds with individual room are projected onto the plane to form a binary image, which is followed by line extraction and regularization to generate floorplan lines. The 3D structured models are reconstructed by multi-label graph cuts, which is designed to combine segmented room, line and surface elements as semantic constraints. Finally, this paper proposed a novel application that 5G signal simulation based on the output structural model to aim at determining the optimal location of 5G small base station in a large-scale indoor scene for the future. Four datasets collected using handheld and backpack laser scanning systems in different locations were used to evaluate the proposed method. The results indicate our proposed methodology provides an accurate and efficient reconstruction of detailed structured models from complex indoor scenes.

AB  - Pervasive healthcare services have undergone a great evolution in recent years. The technological development of communication networks, including the Internet, sensor networks, and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) have given rise to new architectures, applications, and standards related to addressing almost all current e-health challenges. Among the standards, the importance of OpenEHR has been recognized, since it enables the separation of medical semantics from data representation of electronic health records. However, it does not meet the requirements related to interoperability of e-health devices in M2M networks, or in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Moreover, the lack of interoperability hampers the application of new data-processing techniques, such as data mining and online analytical processing, due to the heterogeneity of the data and the sources. This article proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform for pervasive healthcare that ensures interoperability, quality of the detection process, and scalability in an M2M-based architecture, and provides functionalities for the processing of high volumes of data, knowledge extraction, and common healthcare services. The platform uses the semantics described in OpenEHR for both data quality evaluation and standardization of healthcare data stored by the association of IoMT devices and observations defined in OpenEHR. Moreover, it enables the application of big data techniques and online analytic processing (OLAP) through Hadoop Map/Reduce and content-sharing through fast healthcare interoperability resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs).

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Yield prediction is of great significance for yield mapping, crop market planning, crop insurance, and harvest management. Remote sensing is becoming increasingly important in crop yield prediction. Based on remote sensing data, great progress has been made in this field by using machine learning, especially the Deep Learning (DL) method, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Recent experiments in this area suggested that CNN can explore more spatial features and LSTM has the ability to reveal phenological characteristics, which both play an important role in crop yield prediction. However, very few experiments combining these two models for crop yield prediction have been reported. In this paper, we propose a deep CNN-LSTM model for both end-of-season and in-season soybean yield prediction in CONUS at the county-level. The model was trained by crop growth variables and environment variables, which include weather data, MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, and MODIS Surface Reflectance (SR) data; historical soybean yield data were employed as labels. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), all these training data were combined and transformed into histogram-based tensors for deep learning. The results of the experiment indicate that the prediction performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM model can outperform the pure CNN or LSTM model in both end-of-season and in-season. The proposed method shows great potential in improving the accuracy of yield prediction for other crops like corn, wheat, and potatoes at fine scales in the future.

AB  - The electric energy consumption prediction (EECP) is an essential and complex task in intelligent power management system. EECP plays a significant role in drawing up a national energy development policy. Therefore, this study proposes an Electric Energy Consumption Prediction model utilizing the combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) that is named EECP-CBL model to predict electric energy consumption. In this framework, two CNNs in the first module extract the important information from several variables in the individual household electric power consumption (IHEPC) dataset. Then, Bi-LSTM module with two Bi-LSTM layers uses the above information as well as the trends of time series in two directions including the forward and backward states to make predictions. The obtained values in the Bi-LSTM module will be passed to the last module that consists of two fully connected layers for finally predicting the electric energy consumption in the future. The experiments were conducted to compare the prediction performances of the proposed model and the state-of-the-art models for the IHEPC dataset with several variants. The experimental results indicate that EECP-CBL framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of several performance metrics for electric energy consumption prediction on several variations of IHEPC dataset in real-time, short-term, medium-term and long-term timespans.

AB  - The purpose of this descriptive research paper is to initiate discussions on the use of innovative technologies and their potential to support the research and development of pan-Canadian monitoring and surveillance activities associated with environmental impacts on health and within the health system. Its primary aim is to provide a review of disruptive technologies and their current uses in the environment and in healthcare. Drawing on extensive experience in population-level surveillance through the use of technology, knowledge from prior projects in the field, and conducting a review of the technologies, this paper is meant to serve as the initial steps toward a better understanding of the research area. In doing so, we hope to be able to better assess which technologies might best be leveraged to advance this unique intersection of health and environment. This paper first outlines the current use of technologies at the intersection of public health and the environment, in particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The paper provides a description for each of these technologies, along with a summary of their current applications, and a description of the challenges one might face with adopting them. Thereafter, a high-level reference architecture, that addresses the challenges of the described technologies and could potentially be incorporated into the pan-Canadian surveillance system, is conceived and presented.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 20
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Since the signals of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) are blocked by buildings, accurate positioning cannot be achieved in an indoor environment. Pseudolite can simulate similar outdoor satellite signals and can be used as a stable and reliable positioning signal source in indoor environments. Therefore, it has been proposed as a good substitute and has become a research hotspot in the field of indoor positioning. There are still some problems in the pseudolite positioning field, such as: Integer ambiguity of carrier phase, initial position determination, and low signal coverage. To avoid the limitation of these factors, an indoor positioning system based on fingerprint database matching of homologous array pseudolite is proposed in this paper, which can achieve higher positioning accuracy. The realization of this positioning system mainly includes the offline phase and the online phase. In the offline phase, the carrier phase data in the indoor environment is first collected, and a fingerprint database is established. Then a variational auto-encoding (VAE) network with location information is used to learn the probability distribution characteristics of the carrier phase difference of pseudolite in the latent space to realize feature clustering. Finally, the deep neural network is constructed by using the hidden features learned to further study the mapping relationship between different carrier phases of pseudolite and different indoor locations. In the online phase, the trained model and real-time carrier phases of pseudolite are used to predict the location of the positioning terminal. In this paper, by a large number of experiments, the performance of the pseudolite positioning system is evaluated under dynamic and static conditions. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated by the comparison experiments, the experimental results show that the average positioning accuracy of the positioning system in a real indoor scene is 0.39 m, and the 95% positioning error is less than 0.85 m, which outperforms the traditional fingerprint positioning algorithms.

AB  - Accurate prediction of mercury content emitted from fossil-fueled power stations is of the utmost importance for environmental pollution assessment and hazard mitigation. In this paper, mercury content in the output gas of power stations’ boilers was predicted using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) method integrated with particle swarm optimization (PSO). The input parameters of the model included coal characteristics and the operational parameters of the boilers. The dataset was collected from 82 sample points in power plants and employed to educate and examine the proposed model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid model of the ANFIS-PSO, the statistical meter of MARE% was implemented, which resulted in 0.003266 and 0.013272 for training and testing, respectively. Furthermore, relative errors between the acquired data and predicted values were between −0.25% and 0.1%, which confirm the accuracy of the model to deal non-linearity and represent the dependency of flue gas mercury content into the specifications of coal and the boiler type.

AB  - Recently, power systems are facing the challenges of growing power demand, depleting fossil fuel and aggravating environmental pollution (caused by carbon emission from fossil fuel based power generation). The incorporation of alternative low carbon energy generation, i.e., Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), becomes crucial for energy systems. Effective Demand Side Management (DSM) and RES incorporation enable power systems to maintain demand, supply balance and optimize energy in an environmentally friendly manner. The wind power is a popular energy source because of its environmental and economical benefits. However, the uncertainty of wind power makes its incorporation in energy systems really difficult. To mitigate the risk of demand-supply imbalance, an accurate estimation of wind power is essential. Recognizing this challenging task, an efficient deep learning based prediction model is proposed for wind power forecasting. The proposed model has two stages. In the first stage, Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) is used to decompose the past wind power signals. Other than decomposed signals and lagged wind power, multiple exogenous inputs (such as, calendar variable and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)) are also used as input to forecast wind power. In the second stage, a new prediction model, Efficient Deep Convolution Neural Network (EDCNN), is employed to forecast wind power. A DSM scheme is formulated based on forecasted wind power, day-ahead demand and price. The proposed forecasting model&rsquo;s performance was evaluated on big data of Maine wind farm ISO NE, USA.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are increasingly embraced around the world to advance smart mobility and more broadly, smart, and sustainable cities. Algorithms form the basis of decision-making in AVs, allowing them to perform driving tasks autonomously, efficiently, and more safely than human drivers and offering various economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, algorithmic decision-making in AVs can also introduce new issues that create new safety risks and perpetuate discrimination. We identify bias, ethics, and perverse incentives as key ethical issues in the AV algorithms&rsquo; decision-making that can create new safety risks and discriminatory outcomes. Technical issues in the AVs&rsquo; perception, decision-making and control algorithms, limitations of existing AV testing and verification methods, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can also undermine the performance of the AV system. This article investigates the ethical and technical concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making in AVs by exploring how driving decisions can perpetuate discrimination and create new safety risks for the public. We discuss steps taken to address these issues, highlight the existing research gaps and the need to mitigate these issues through the design of AV&rsquo;s algorithms and of policies and regulations to fully realise AVs&rsquo; benefits for smart and sustainable cities.

TI  - A Cooperative Machine Learning Approach for Pedestrian Navigation in Indoor IoT
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper presents a system based on pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) for localization of networked mobile users, which relies only on sensors embedded in the devices and device- to-device connectivity. The user trajectory is reconstructed by measuring step by step the user displacements. Though step length can be estimated rather accurately, heading evaluation is extremely problematic in indoor environments. Magnetometer is typically used, however measurements are strongly perturbed. To improve the location accuracy, this paper proposes a novel cooperative system to estimate the direction of motion based on a machine learning approach for perturbation detection and filtering, combined with a consensus algorithm for performance augmentation by cooperative data fusion at multiple devices. A first algorithm filters out perturbed magnetometer measurements based on a-priori information on the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. A second algorithm aggregates groups of users walking in the same direction, while a third one combines the measurements of the aggregated users in a distributed way to extract a more accurate heading estimate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that combines machine learning with consensus algorithms for cooperative PDR. Compared to other methods in the literature, the method has the advantage of being infrastructure-free, fully distributed and robust to sensor failures thanks to the pre-filtering of perturbed measurements. Extensive indoor experiments show that the heading error is highly reduced by the proposed approach thus leading to noticeable enhancements in localization performance.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Factories of the future are foreseen to evolve into smart factories with autonomous and adaptive manufacturing processes. However, the increasing complexity of the network of manufacturing processes is expected to complicate the rapid detection of process anomalies in real time. This paper proposes an architecture framework and method for the implementation of the Scalable On-line Anomaly Detection System (SOADS), which can detect process anomalies via real-time processing and analyze large amounts of process execution data in the context of autonomous and adaptive manufacturing processes. The design of this system architecture framework entailed the derivation of standard subsequence patterns using the PrefixSpan algorithm, a sequential pattern algorithm. The anomalies of the real-time event streams and derived subsequence patterns were scored using the Smith-Waterman algorithm, a sequence alignment algorithm. The excellence of the proposed system was verified by measuring the time for deriving subsequence patterns and by obtaining the anomaly scoring time from large event logs. The proposed system succeeded in large-scale data processing and analysis, one of the requirements for a smart factory, by using Apache Spark streaming and Apache Hbase, and is expected to become the basis of anomaly detection systems of smart factories.

AB  - It is crucial to predict PM2.5 concentration for early warning regarding and the control of air pollution. However, accurate PM2.5 prediction has been challenging, especially in long-term prediction. PM2.5 monitoring data comprise a complex time series that contains multiple components with different characteristics; therefore, it is difficult to obtain an accurate prediction by a single model. In this study, an integrated predictor is proposed, in which the original data are decomposed into three components, that is, trend, period, and residual components, and then different sub-predictors including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and two gated recurrent units are used to separately predict the different components. Finally, all the predictions from the sub-predictors are combined in fusion node to obtain the final prediction for the original data. The results of predicting the PM2.5 time series for Beijing, China showed that the proposed predictor can effectively improve prediction accuracy for long-term prediction.

AB  - The development and high growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) have improved quality of life and strengthened different areas in society. Many cities worldwide are looking forward to becoming smart. One of the most popular use cases in smart cities is the implementation of smart parking solutions, as they allow people to optimize time, reduce fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions. Smart parking solutions have a defined architecture with particular components (sensors, communication protocols, and software solutions). Although there are only three components that compose a smart parking solution, it is important to mention that each component has many types that can be used in the deployment of these solutions. This paper identifies the most used types of every component and highlights usage trends in the established analysis period. It provides a complementary perspective and represents a very useful source of information. The scientific community could use this information to decide regarding the selection of types of components to implement a smart parking solution. For this purpose, herein we review several works related to smart parking solutions deployment. To achieve this goal, a semi-cyclic adaptation of the action research methodology combined with a systematic review is used to select papers related to the subject of study. The most relevant papers were reviewed to identify subcategories for each component; these classifications are presented in tables to mark the relevance of each paper accordingly. Trends of usage in terms of sensors, protocols and software solutions are analyzed and discussed in every section. In addition to the trends of usage, this paper determines a guide of complementary features from the type of components that should be considered when implementing a smart parking solution.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and algorithms are increasingly being utilized in energy and renewable research to tackle various engineering problems. However, a majority of the AI studies in the energy domain have been focusing on solving specific technical issues. There is limited discussion on how AI can be utilized to enhance the energy system operations, particularly the electricity market, with a holistic view. The purpose of the study is to introduce the platform architectural logic that encompasses both technical and economic perspectives to the development of AI-enabled energy platforms for the future electricity market with massive and distributed renewables. A constructive and inductive approach for theory building is employed for the concept proposition of the AI energy platform by using the aggregated data from a European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 project and a Finnish national innovation project. Our results are presented as a systemic framework and high-level representation of the AI-enabled energy platform design with four integrative layers that could enable not only value provisioning but also value utilization for a distributed energy system and electricity market as the new knowledge and contribution to the extant research. Finally, the study discusses the potential use cases of the AI-enabled energy platform.

AB  - The search and rescue (SAR) scenario is complex and uncertain where a robot needs to understand the scenario to make smart decisions. Aiming at the knowledge representation (KR) in the field of SAR, this paper builds an ontology model that enables a robot to understand how to make smart decisions. The ontology is divided into three parts, namely entity ontology, environment ontology, and task ontology. Web Ontology Language (OWL) is adopted to represent these three types of ontology. Through ontology and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules, the robot infers the tasks to be performed according to the environment state and at the same time obtains the semantic information of the victims. Then, the paper proposes an ontology-based algorithm for task planning to get a sequence of atomic actions so as to complete the high-level inferred task. In addition, an indoor experiment was designed and built for the SAR scenario using a real robot platform&mdash;TurtleBot3. The correctness and usability of the ontology and the proposed methods are verified by experiments.

AB  - Optical sensing that integrates communication and sensing functions is playing a more and more important role in both military and civil applications. Incorporating optical sensing and optical communication, optical sensor networks (OSNs) that undertake the task of high-speed and large-capacity applications and sensing data transmissions have become an important communication infrastructure. However, multiple failures and disasters in OSNs can cause serious sensing provisioning problems. To ensure uninterrupted sensing data transmission, survivability has always been an important research emphasis. This paper focuses on the survivable deployment of OSNs against multiple failures and disasters. We first review and evaluate the existing survivability technologies developed for or applied to OSNs, such as fiber bus protection, self-healing architecture, and 1 + 1 protection. We then elaborate on the disaster-resilient survivability requirement of OSNs. Moreover, we propose a new k-node (edge) sensing connectivity concept, which ensures the connectivity between sensing data and users. Based on k-node (edge) sensing connectivity, the disaster-resilient survivability technologies are developed. The key technologies necessary to implement k-node (edge) sensing connectivity are also elaborated. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly. It can be used to improve the survivability of OSNs. This paper details potential development directions of survivability technologies of optical sensing in OSNs employing AI.

AB  - Smart Cities are approaching the Internet of Things (IoT) World. Most of the first-generation Smart City solutions are based on Extract Transform Load (ETL); processes and languages that mainly support pull protocols for data gathering. IoT solutions are moving forward to event-driven processes using push protocols. Thus, the concept of IoT applications has turned out to be widespread; but it was initially &ldquo;implemented&rdquo; with ETL; rule-based solutions; and finally; with true data flows. In this paper, these aspects are reviewed, highlighting the requirements for smart city IoT applications and in particular, the ones that implement a set of specific MicroServices for IoT Applications in Smart City contexts. Moreover; our experience has allowed us to implement a suite of MicroServices for Node-RED; which has allowed for the creation of a wide range of new IoT applications for smart cities that includes dashboards, IoT Devices, data analytics, discovery, etc., as well as a corresponding Life Cycle. The proposed solution has been validated against a large number of IoT applications, as it can be verified by accessing the https://www.Snap4City.org portal; while only three of them have been described in the paper. In addition, the reported solution assessment has been carried out by a number of smart city experts. The work has been developed in the framework of the Select4Cities PCP (PreCommercial Procurement), funded by the European Commission as Snap4City platform.

AB  - Device-to-device (D2D) communication, as one of the promising candidates for the fifth generation mobile network, can afford effective service of new mobile applications and business models. In this paper, we study the resource management strategies for D2D communication underlying the cellular networks. To cater for green communications, our design goal is to the maximize ergodic energy efficiency (EE) of all D2D links taking into account the fact that it may be tricky for the base station (BS) to receive all the real-time channel state information (CSI) while guaranteeing the stability and the power requirements for D2D links. We formulate the optimization problem which is difficult to resolve directly because of its non-convex nature. Then a novel maximum weighted ergodic energy efficiency (MWEEE) algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated optimization problem which consists of two sub-problems: the power control (PC) sub-problem which can be solved by employing convex optimization theory for both cellular user equipment (CUE) and D2D user equipment (DUE) and the channel allocation (CA) sub-problem which can be solved by obtaining the weighted allocation matrix. In particular, we shed light into the impact on EE metric of D2D communication by revealing the nonlinear power relationship between CUE and DUE and taking the QoS of CUEs into account. Furthermore, simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is superior to the existing algorithms.

VL  - 8

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In recent years, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have made important advances in civil, maritime, and military applications. With the continuous improvement of autonomy, the increasing complexity of tasks, and the emergence of various types of advanced sensors, higher requirements are imposed on the computing performance of USV clusters, especially for latency sensitive tasks. However, during the execution of marine operations, due to the relative movement of the USV cluster nodes and the network topology of the cluster, the wireless channel states are changing rapidly, and the computing resources of cluster nodes may be available or unavailable at any time. It is difficult to accurately predict in advance. Therefore, we propose an optimized offloading mechanism based on the classic multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory. This mechanism enables USV cluster nodes to dynamically make offloading decisions by learning the potential computing performance of their neighboring team nodes to minimize average computation task offloading delay. It is an optimized algorithm named Adaptive Upper Confidence Boundary (AUCB) algorithm, and corresponding simulations are designed to evaluate the performance. The algorithm enables the USV cluster to effectively adapt to the marine vehicular fog computing networks, balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation (EE). The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can quickly converge to the optimal computation task offloading combination strategy under heavy and light input data loads.

AB  - With the expansion of smart agriculture, wireless sensor networks are being increasingly applied. These networks collect environmental information, such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 rates. However, if a faulty sensor node operates continuously in the network, unnecessary data transmission adversely impacts the network. Accordingly, a data-based fault-detection algorithm was implemented in this study to analyze data of sensor nodes and determine faults, to prevent the corresponding nodes from transmitting data; thus, minimizing damage to the network. A cloud-based &ldquo;farm as a service&rdquo; optimized for smart farms was implemented as an example, and resource management of sensors and actuators was provided using the oneM2M common platform. The effectiveness of the proposed fault-detection model was verified on an integrated management platform based on the Internet of Things by collecting and analyzing data. The results confirm that when a faulty sensor node is not separated from the network, unnecessary data transmission of other sensor nodes occurs due to continuous abnormal data transmission; thus, increasing energy consumption and reducing the network lifetime.

AB  - Earthmoving is an integral civil engineering operation of significance, and tracking its productivity requires the statistics of loads moved by dump trucks. Since current truck loads&rsquo; statistics methods are laborious, costly, and limited in application, this paper presents the framework of a novel, automated, non-contact field earthmoving quantity statistics (FEQS) for projects with large earthmoving demands that use uniform and uncovered trucks. The proposed FEQS framework utilizes field surveillance systems and adopts vision-based deep learning for full/empty-load truck classification as the core work. Since convolutional neural network (CNN) and its transfer learning (TL) forms are popular vision-based deep learning models and numerous in type, a comparison study is conducted to test the framework&rsquo;s core work feasibility and evaluate the performance of different deep learning models in implementation. The comparison study involved 12 CNN or CNN-TL models in full/empty-load truck classification, and the results revealed that while several provided satisfactory performance, the VGG16-FineTune provided the optimal performance. This proved the core work feasibility of the proposed FEQS framework. Further discussion provides model choice suggestions that CNN-TL models are more feasible than CNN prototypes, and models that adopt different TL methods have advantages in either working accuracy or speed for different tasks.

SN  - 1660-4601

AB  - Particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5      &mu; m      (PM2.5) has damaged public health globally for a decade. Accurate forecasts of PM2.5 concentration can provide early warnings to prevent the public from hazard exposure. However, existing methods have not considered the available spatiotemporal data sufficiently due to their architecture or inadequate input, and most neglected wind impact on spatiotemporal correlation when selecting related sites. To fill this gap, we proposed a long short-term memory-convolutional neural network based on dynamic wind field distance (LSTM-CNN-DWFD) to predict PM2.5 concentration of a specific site for the next 24 h. A KNN method based on dynamic wind field distance was developed and applied to select highly related sites considering wind impact. A local stateful LSTM model was employed to capture temporal correlations in historical air quality and meteorological data for each related site. Then, these temporal features were integrated as a spatiotemporal matrix, and input into CNN for extracting spatiotemporal correlation features. Weather forecasts were also integrated into the model to promote accuracy. Hourly PM2.5 data from 36 monitoring sites in Beijing, China collected from 1 May 2014 to 30 April 2015 were used as experimental dataset. Six-fold rolling origin method was employed to conduct experiments on each site, and the results of 216 experiments validated the performance of the proposed LSTM-CNN-DWFD model. The mean      R 2      values of the next 1&ndash;6 h prediction were 0.85, 0.81, 0.76, 0.70, 0.64, and 0.59, respectively, showing a decrease trend, indicating that the prediction accuracy decreases as the prediction time increases. Comparisons of LSTM-CNN-DWFD results to results from six other methods show that it delivered higher accuracy PM2.5 predictions, with the mean RMSE (MAE) of 1&ndash;6, 7&ndash;12, and 13&ndash;24 h prediction were 43.90 (29.17), 57.89 (42.16), and 63.14 (47.64), respectively. The results also demonstrate that the sites selected based on dynamic wind field distance are more related to the central site than that based on geographical distance, also contributing to prediction accuracy.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Due to limited computation resources of a vehicle terminal, it is impossible to meet the demands of some applications and services, especially for computation-intensive types, which not only results in computation burden and delay, but also consumes more energy. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emerging architecture in which computation and storage services are extended to the edge of a network, which is an advanced technology to support multiple applications and services that requires ultra-low latency. In this paper, a task offloading approach for an MEC-assisted vehicle platooning is proposed, where the Lyapunov optimization algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem under the condition of stability of task queues. The proposed approach dynamically adjusts the offloading decisions for all tasks according to data parameters of current task, and judge whether it is executed locally, in other platooning member or at an MEC server. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce energy consumption of task execution and greatly improve the offloading efficiency compared with the shortest queue waiting time algorithm and the full offloading to an MEC algorithm.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Cattle, buffalo and cow identification plays an influential role in cattle traceability from birth to slaughter, understanding disease trajectories and large-scale cattle ownership management. Muzzle print images are considered discriminating cattle biometric identifiers for biometric-based cattle identification and traceability. This paper presents an exploration of the performance of the bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) approach in cattle identification using local invariant features extracted from a database of muzzle print images. Two local invariant feature detectors&mdash;namely, speeded-up robust features (SURF) and maximally stable extremal regions (MSER)&mdash;are used as feature extraction engines in the BoVW model. The performance evaluation criteria include several factors, namely, the identification accuracy, processing time and the number of features. The experimental work measures the performance of the BoVW model under a variable number of input muzzle print images in the training, validation, and testing phases. The identification accuracy values when utilizing the SURF feature detector and descriptor were 75%, 83%, 91%, and 93% for when 30%, 45%, 60%, and 75% of the database was used in the training phase, respectively. However, using MSER as a points-of-interest detector combined with the SURF descriptor achieved accuracies of 52%, 60%, 67%, and 67%, respectively, when applying the same training sizes. The research findings have proven the feasibility of deploying the BoVW paradigm in cattle identification using local invariant features extracted from muzzle print images.

AB  - The circular economy (CE) is widely known as a way to implement and achieve sustainability, mainly due to its contribution towards the separation of biological and technical nutrients under cyclic industrial metabolism. The incorporation of the principles of the CE in the links of the value chain of the various sectors of the economy strives to ensure circularity, safety, and efficiency. The framework proposed is aligned with the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development regarding the orientation towards the mitigation and regeneration of the metabolic rift by considering a double perspective. Firstly, it strives to conceptualize the CE as a paradigm of sustainability. Its principles are established, and its techniques and tools are organized into two frameworks oriented towards causes (cradle to cradle) and effects (life cycle assessment), and these are structured under the three pillars of sustainability, for their projection within the proposed framework. Secondly, a framework is established to facilitate the implementation of the CE with the use of standards, which constitute the requirements, tools, and indicators to control each life cycle phase, and of key enabling technologies (KETs) that add circular value 4.0 to the socio-ecological transition.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Movies have become one of the major sources of entertainment in the current era, which are based on diverse ideas. Action movies have received the most attention in last few years, which contain violent scenes, because it is one of the undesirable features for some individuals that is used to create charm and fantasy. However, these violent scenes have had a negative impact on kids, and they are not comfortable even for mature age people. The best way to stop under aged people from watching violent scenes in movies is to eliminate these scenes. In this paper, we proposed a violence detection scheme for movies that is comprised of three steps. First, the entire movie is segmented into shots, and then a representative frame from each shot is selected based on the level of saliency. Next, these selected frames are passed from a light-weight deep learning model, which is fine-tuned using a transfer learning approach to classify violence and non-violence shots in a movie. Finally, all the non-violence scenes are merged in a sequence to generate a violence-free movie that can be watched by children and as well violence paranoid people. The proposed model is evaluated on three violence benchmark datasets, and it is experimentally proved that the proposed scheme provides a fast and accurate detection of violent scenes in movies compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - As urbanization continues to accelerate, the number of cities and their growing populations have created problems, such as the congestion and noise related to transportation, the pollution from industry, and the difficulty of disposing of garbage. An emerging urban strategy is to make use of digital technologies and big data to help improve the quality of life of urban residents. In the past decade, more and more researchers have studied smart cities, and the number of literature in this field grows rapidly, making it &ldquo;big data&rdquo;. With the aim of better understanding the contexts of smart-city research, including the distribution of topics, knowledge bases, and the research frontiers in the field, this paper is based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection, and the method used is that of comprehensive scientometric analysis and knowledge mapping in terms of diversity, time slicing, and dynamics, using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to study the literature in the field. The main research topics can be divided into three areas&mdash;&ldquo;the concepts and elements of the smart city&rdquo;, &ldquo;the smart city and the Internet of Things&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the smart city of the future&rdquo;&mdash;through document co-citation analysis.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Once diagnosed with cancer, a patient goes through a series of diagnosis and tests, which are referred to as &ldquo;after cancer treatment&rdquo;. Due to the nature of the treatment and side effects, maintaining quality of life (QoL) in the home environment is a challenging task. Sometimes, a cancer patient&rsquo;s situation changes abruptly as the functionality of certain organs deteriorates, which affects their QoL. One way of knowing the physiological functional status of a cancer patient is to design an occupational therapy. In this paper, we propose a blockchain and off-chain-based framework, which will allow multiple medical and ambient intelligent Internet of Things sensors to capture the QoL information from one&rsquo;s home environment and securely share it with their community of interest. Using our proposed framework, both transactional records and multimedia big data can be shared with an oncologist or palliative care unit for real-time decision support. We have also developed blockchain-based data analytics, which will allow a clinician to visualize the immutable history of the patient&rsquo;s data available from an in-home secure monitoring system for a better understanding of a patient&rsquo;s current or historical states. Finally, we will present our current implementation status, which provides significant encouragement for further development.

AB  - The avalanche of (both user- and device-generated) multimedia data published in online social networks poses serious challenges to researchers seeking to analyze such data for many different tasks, like recommendation, event recognition, and so on. For some such tasks, the classical &ldquo;batch&rdquo; approach of big data analysis is not suitable, due to constraints of real-time or near-real-time processing. This led to the rise of stream processing big data platforms, like Storm and Flink, that are able to process data with a very low latency. However, this complicates the task of data analysis since any implementation has to deal with the technicalities of such platforms, like distributed processing, synchronization, node faults, etc. In this paper, we show how the RAM     3    S framework could be profitably used to easily implement a variety of applications (such as clothing recommendations, job suggestions, and alert generation for dangerous events), being independent of the particular stream processing big data platforms used. Indeed, by using RAM     3    S, researchers can concentrate on the development of their data analysis application, completely ignoring the details of the underlying platform.

AB  - Nowadays, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and this number continues increasing. Consequently, there are more and more scientific publications that analyze health problems of people associated with living in these highly urbanized locations. In particular, some of the recent work has focused on relating people’s health to the quality and quantity of urban green areas. In this context, and considering the huge amount of land area in large cities that must be supervised, our work seeks to develop a deep learning-based solution capable of determining the level of health of the land and to assess whether it is contaminated. The main purpose is to provide health institutions with software capable of creating updated maps that indicate where these phenomena are presented, as this information could be very useful to guide public health goals in large cities. Our software is released as open source code, and the data used for the experiments presented in this paper are also freely available.

VL  - 9

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The exponential growth of cities has brought important challenges such as waste management, pollution and overpopulation, and the administration of transportation. To mitigate these problems, the idea of the smart city was born, seeking to provide robust solutions integrating sensors and electronics, information technologies, and communication networks. More particularly, to face transportation challenges, intelligent transportation systems are a vital component in this quest, helped by vehicular communication networks, which offer a communication framework for vehicles, road infrastructure, and pedestrians. The extreme conditions of vehicular environments, nonetheless, make communication between nodes that may be moving at very high speeds very difficult to achieve, so non-deterministic approaches are necessary to maximize the chances of packet delivery. In this paper, we address this problem using artificial intelligence from a hybrid perspective, focusing on both the best next message to replicate and the best next hop in its path. Furthermore, we propose a deep learning&ndash;based router (DLR+), a router with a prioritized type of message scheduler and a routing algorithm based on deep learning. Simulations done to assess the router performance show important gains in terms of network overhead and hop count, while maintaining an acceptable packet delivery ratio and delivery delays, with respect to other popular routing protocols in vehicular networks.

TI  - Pole-Like Street Furniture Segmentation and Classification in Mobile LiDAR Data by Integrating Multiple Shape-Descriptor Constraints
T2  - Remote Sensing

VL  - 11

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Nowadays, mobile laser scanning is widely used for understanding urban scenes, especially for extraction and recognition of pole-like street furniture, such as lampposts, traffic lights and traffic signs. However, the start-of-art methods may generate low segmentation accuracy in the overlapping scenes, and the object classification accuracy can be highly influenced by the large discrepancy in instance number of different objects in the same scene. To address these issues, we present a complete paradigm for pole-like street furniture segmentation and classification using mobile LiDAR (light detection and ranging) point cloud. First, we propose a 3D density-based segmentation algorithm which considers two different conditions including isolated furniture and connected furniture in overlapping scenes. After that, a vertical region grow algorithm is employed for component splitting and a new shape distribution estimation method is proposed to obtain more accurate global shape descriptors. For object classification, an integrated shape constraint based on the splitting result of pole-like street furniture (SplitISC) is introduced and integrated into a retrieval procedure. Two test datasets are used to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better classification results from both sites than the existing shape distribution method.

VL  - 8
IS  - 12
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Metropolitan cities are facing many socio-economic problems (e.g., frequent traffic congestion, unexpected emergency events, and even human-made disasters) related to urban crowd flows, which can be described in terms of the gathering process of a flock of moving objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) towards specific destinations during a given time period via different travel routes. Understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban crowd flows is therefore of critical importance to traffic management and public safety, yet it is very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, including spatial dependencies, temporal dependencies, and environmental conditions. In this research, we propose a novel matrix-computation-based method for modeling the morphological evolutionary patterns of urban crowd flows. The proposed methodology consists of four connected steps: (1) defining urban crowd levels, (2) deriving urban crowd regions, (3) quantifying their morphological changes, and (4) delineating the morphological evolution patterns. The proposed methodology integrates urban crowd visualization, identification, and correlation into a unified and efficient analytical framework. We validated the proposed methodology under both synthetic and real-world data scenarios using taxi mobility data in Wuhan, China as an example. Results confirm that the proposed methodology can enable city planners, municipal managers, and other stakeholders to identify and understand the gathering process of urban crowd flows in an informative and intuitive manner. Limitations and further directions with regard to data representativeness, data sparseness, pattern sensitivity, and spatial constraint are also discussed.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the rapid development of information technology, the problem of the network security of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become increasingly prominent. In order to solve the intrusion detection problem of massive, high-dimensional, and nonlinear data, this paper proposes an intrusion detection method based on the deep belief network (DBN) optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). First, a classification model based on the DBN is constructed, and the PSO algorithm is then used to optimize the number of hidden layer nodes of the DBN, to obtain the optimal DBN structure. The simulations are conducted on a benchmark intrusion dataset, and the results show that the accuracy of the DBN-PSO algorithm reaches 92.44%, which is higher than those of the support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), deep neural network (DNN), and Adaboost. It can be seen from comparative experiments that the optimization effect of PSO is better than those of the genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, and Bayesian optimization algorithm. The method of PSO-DBN provides an effective solution to the problem of intrusion detection of UAV networks.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Two main approaches exist when deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on resource-constrained IoT devices: either scale a large model down or use a small model designed specifically for resource-constrained environments. Small architectures typically trade accuracy for computational cost by performing convolutions as depth-wise convolutions rather than standard convolutions like in large networks. Large models focus primarily on state-of-the-art performance and often struggle to scale down sufficiently. We propose a new model, namely IoTNet, designed for resource-constrained environments which achieves state-of-the-art performance within the domain of small efficient models. IoTNet trades accuracy with computational cost differently from existing methods by factorizing standard 3 &times; 3 convolutions into pairs of 1 &times; 3 and 3 &times; 1 standard convolutions, rather than performing depth-wise convolutions. We benchmark IoTNet against state-of-the-art efficiency-focused models and scaled-down large architectures on data sets which best match the complexity of problems faced in resource-constrained environments. We compare model accuracy and the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) performed as a measure of efficiency. We report state-of-the-art accuracy improvement over MobileNetV2 on CIFAR-10 of 13.43% with 39% fewer FLOPs, over ShuffleNet on Street View House Numbers (SVHN) of 6.49% with 31.8% fewer FLOPs and over MobileNet on German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) of 5% with 0.38% fewer FLOPs.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The advancement of hardware and software technologies makes it possible to use smartphones or Internet of things for monitoring environments in realtime. In recent years, much effort has been made to develop a smartphone based earthquake early warning system, where low-cost acceleration sensors inside a smartphones are used for capturing earthquake signals. However, because a smartphone comes with a powerful CPU, spacious memory, and several sensors, it is waste of such resources to use it only for detecting earthquakes. Furthermore, because a smartphone is mostly in use during the daytime, the acquired data cannot be used for detecting earthquakes due to human activities. Therefore, in this article, we introduce a stand-alone device equipped with a low-cost acceleration sensor and least computing resources to detect earthquakes. To that end, we first select an appropriate acceleration sensor by assessing the performance and accuracy of four different sensors. Then, we design and develop an earthquake alert device. To detect earthquakes, we employ a simple machine learning technique which trains an earthquake detection model with daily motions, noise data recorded in buildings, and earthquakes recorded in the past. Furthermore, we evaluate the four acceleration sensors by recording two realistic earthquakes on a shake-table. In the experiments, the results show that the developed earthquake alert device can successfully detect earthquakes and send a warning message to nearby devices, thereby enabling proactive responses to earthquakes.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Flying ad hoc network (FANET) is a self-organizing wireless network that enables inexpensive, flexible, and easy-to-deploy flying nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to communicate among themselves in the absence of fixed network infrastructure. FANET is one of the emerging networks that has an extensive range of next-generation applications. Hence, FANET plays a significant role in achieving application-based goals. Routing enables the flying nodes to collaborate and coordinate among themselves and to establish routes to radio access infrastructure, particularly FANET base station (BS). With a longer route lifetime, the effects of link disconnections and network partitions reduce. Routing must cater to two main characteristics of FANETs that reduce the route lifetime. Firstly, the collaboration nature requires the flying nodes to exchange messages and to coordinate among themselves, causing high energy consumption. Secondly, the mobility pattern of the flying nodes is highly dynamic in a three-dimensional space and they may be spaced far apart, causing link disconnection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the limited research work of routing schemes in FANETs. Different aspects, including objectives, challenges, routing metrics, characteristics, and performance measures, are covered. Furthermore, we present open issues.

AB  - Traditional handcrafted crowd-counting techniques in an image are currently transformed via machine-learning and artificial-intelligence techniques into intelligent crowd-counting techniques. This paradigm shift offers many advanced features in terms of adaptive monitoring and the control of dynamic crowd gatherings. Adaptive monitoring, identification/recognition, and the management of diverse crowd gatherings can improve many crowd-management-related tasks in terms of efficiency, capacity, reliability, and safety. Despite many challenges, such as occlusion, clutter, and irregular object distribution and nonuniform object scale, convolutional neural networks are a promising technology for intelligent image crowd counting and analysis. In this article, we review, categorize, analyze (limitations and distinctive features), and provide a detailed performance evaluation of the latest convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. We also highlight the potential applications of convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. Finally, we conclude this article by presenting our key observations, providing strong foundation for future research directions while designing convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. Further, the article discusses new advancements toward understanding crowd counting in smart cities using the Internet of Things (IoT).

AB  - Automatic License Plate Recognition has been a recurrent research topic due to the increasing number of cameras available in cities, where most of them, if not all, are connected to the Internet. The video traffic generated by the cameras can be analyzed to provide useful insights for the transportation segment. This paper presents the development of an intelligent vehicle identification system based on optical character recognition (OCR) method to be used on intelligent transportation systems. The proposed system makes use of an intelligent parking system named Smart Parking Service (SPANS), which is used to manage public or private spaces. Using computer vision techniques, the SPANS system is used to detect if the parking slots are available or not. The proposed system makes use of SPANS framework to capture images of the parking spaces and identifies the license plate number of the vehicles that are moving around the parking as well as parked in the parking slots. The recognition of the license plate is made in real-time, and the performance of the proposed system is evaluated in real-time.

AB  - The standard manufacturing organizations follow certain rules. The highest ubiquitous organizing principles in infrastructure design are modular idea and symmetry, both of which are of the utmost importance. Symmetry is a substantial principle in the manufacturing industry. Symmetrical procedures act as the structural apparatus for manufacturing design. The rapid growth of population needs outstrip infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railway lines, commercial, residential buildings, etc. Numerous underground facilities are also installed to fulfill different requirements of the people. In these facilities one of the most important facility is water supply pipelines. Therefore, it is essential to regularly analyze the water supply pipelines&rsquo; risk index in order to escape from economic and human losses. In this paper, we proposed a simplified hierarchical fuzzy logic (SHFL) model to reduce the set of rules. To this end, we have considered four essential factors of water supply pipelines as input to the proposed SHFL model that are: leakage, depth, length and age. Different numbers of membership functions are defined for each factor according to its distribution. The proposed SHFL model takes only 95 rules as compared to the traditional mamdani fuzzy logic method that requires 1225 rules. It is very hard and time consuming for experts to design 1225 rules accurately and precisely. Further, we proposed a Do-it-Yourself (DIY) system for the proposed SHFL method. The purpose of the DIY system is that one can design the FIS model according to his or her need.

AB  - Connected cars and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication scenarios are attracting more researchers. There will be numerous possibilities offered by V2X in the future. For instance, in the case of vehicles that move in a column, they could react to the braking of those in front of it through the rapid information exchanges, and most chain collisions could be avoided. V2X will be desiderated for routes optimizations, travel time reductions, and accident rate decrease in cases such as communication with infrastructures, traffic information exchanges, functioning of traffic lights, possible situations of danger, and the presence of construction sites or traffic jams. Furthermore, there could be massive conversations between smartphones and vehicles performing real-time dialogues. It is relatively reasonable to expect a connection system in which a pedestrian can report its position to all surrounding vehicles. Regarding this, it is compelling to perceive the positive effects of the driver being aware of the presence of pedestrians when vehicles are moving on the roads. This paper introduces the concepts for the development of a solution based on V2X communications aimed at vehicle and pedestrian safety. A potential system architecture for the development of a real system, concerning the safety of vehicles and pedestrians, is suggested to draft some guidelines that could be followed in new applications.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper presents a sound source distance estimation (SSDE) method using a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). We approach the sound source distance estimation task as an image classification problem, and we aim to classify a given audio signal into one of three predefined distance classes—one meter, two meters, and three meters—irrespective of its orientation angle. For the purpose of training, we create a dataset by recording audio signals at the three different distances and three angles in different rooms. The CRNN is trained using time-frequency representations of the audio signals. Specifically, we transform the audio signals into log-scaled mel spectrograms, allowing the convolutional layers to extract the appropriate features required for the classification. When trained and tested with combined datasets from all rooms, the proposed model exhibits high classification accuracies; however, training and testing the model in separate rooms results in lower accuracies, indicating that further study is required to improve the method’s generalization ability. Our experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to estimate sound source distances in known environments by classification using the log-scaled mel spectrogram.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The increasing availability of trajectory recordings has led to the mining of a massive amount of historical track data, allowing for a better understanding of travel behaviors by revealing meaningful motion patterns. In the context of human mobility analysis, the problem of motion prediction assumes a central role and is beneficial for a wide range of applications, including for touristic purposes, such as personalized services or targeted recommendations, and sustainability studies related to crowd management and resource redistribution. This paper tackles a particular case of the trajectory prediction problem, focusing on large-scale mobility traces of short-term foreign tourists. These sparse trajectories, short and non-repetitive, lack spatial and temporal regularity, making prediction analysis based on individual historical motion data unreliable. To face this issue, we hereby propose a deep learning-based approach, taking into account the collective mobility of tourists over the territory. The underlying semantics of motion patterns are captured by means of a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model trained on pre-processed location sequences, aiming to predict the next visited place in the trajectory. We tested the methodology on a real-world big dataset, demonstrating its higher feasibility with respect to traditional approaches.

TI  - Automatic Indoor as-Built Building Information Models Generation by Using Low-Cost RGB-D Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - To generate indoor as-built building information models (AB BIMs) automatically and economically is a great technological challenge. Many approaches have been developed to address this problem in recent years, but it is far from being settled, particularly for the point cloud segmentation and the extraction of the relationship among different elements due to the complicated indoor environment. This is even more difficult for the low-quality point cloud generated by low-cost scanning equipment. This paper proposes an automatic as-built BIMs generation framework that transforms the noisy 3D point cloud produced by a low-cost RGB-D sensor (about 708 USD for data collection equipment, 379 USD for the Structure sensor and 329 USD for iPad) to the as-built BIMs, without any manual intervention. The experiment results show that the proposed method has competitive robustness and accuracy, compared to the high-quality Terrestrial Lidar System (TLS), with the element extraction accuracy of 100%, mean dimension reconstruction accuracy of 98.6% and mean area reconstruction accuracy of 93.6%. Also, the proposed framework makes the BIM generation workflows more efficient in both data collection and data processing. In the experiments, the time consumption of data collection for a typical room, with an area of 45&ndash;67      m 2     , is reduced to 4&ndash;6 min with an RGB-D sensor from 50&ndash;60 min with TLS. The processing time to generate BIM models is about half minutes automatically, from around 10 min with a conventional semi-manual method.

AB  - Everyday life of the elderly and impaired population living in smart homes is challenging because of possible accidents that may occur due to daily activities. In such activities, persons often lean over (to reach something) and, if they not cautious, are prone to falling. To identify fall incidents, which could stochastically cause serious injuries or even death, we propose specific temporal inference models; namely, CM-I and CM-II. These models can infer a fall incident based on classification methods by exploiting wearable Internet of Things (IoT) altimeter sensors adopted by seniors. We analyzed real and synthetic data of fall and lean over incidents to test the proposed models. The results are promising for incorporating such inference models to assist healthcare for fall verification of seniors in smart homes. Specifically, the CM-II model achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.98, which is the highest accuracy when compared to other models in the literature under the McNemar&rsquo;s test criterion. These models could be incorporated in wearable IoT devices to provide early warning and prediction of fall incidents to clinical doctors.

AB  - With the rise of Internet of Things (IoT), low-cost resource-constrained devices have to be more capable than traditional embedded systems, which operate on stringent power budgets. In order to add new capabilities such as learning, the power consumption planning has to be revised. Approximate computing is a promising paradigm for reducing power consumption at the expense of inaccuracy introduced to the computations. In this paper, we set forth approximate computing features of a processor that will exist in the next generation low-cost resource-constrained learning IoT devices. Based on these features, we design an approximate IoT processor which benefits from RISC-V ISA. Targeting machine learning applications such as classification and clustering, we have demonstrated that our processor reinforced with approximate operations can save power up to 23% for ASIC implementation while at least 90% top-1 accuracy is achieved on the trained models and test data set.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In post-disaster scenarios, such as after floods, earthquakes, and in war zones, the cellular communication infrastructure may be destroyed or seriously disrupted. In such emergency scenarios, it becomes very important for first aid responders to communicate with other rescue teams in order to provide feedback to both the central office and the disaster survivors. To address this issue, rapidly deployable systems are required to re-establish connectivity and assist users and first responders in the region of incident. In this work, we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a rapidly deployable system for first response applications in post-disaster situations, named RDSP. The proposed system helps early rescue responders and victims by sharing their location information to remotely located servers by utilizing a novel routing scheme. This novel routing scheme consists of the Dynamic ID Assignment (DIA) algorithm and the Minimum Maximum Neighbor (MMN) algorithm. The DIA algorithm is used by relay devices to dynamically select their IDs on the basis of all the available IDs of networks. Whereas, the MMN algorithm is used by the client and relay devices to dynamically select their next neighbor relays for the transmission of messages. The RDSP contains three devices; the client device sends the victim&rsquo;s location information to the server, the relay device relays information between client and server device, the server device receives messages from the client device to alert the rescue team. We deployed and evaluated our system in the outdoor environment of the university campus. The experimental results show that the RDSP system reduces the message delivery delay and improves the message delivery ratio with lower communication overhead.

TI  - Incorporating Worker Awareness in the Generation of Hazard Proximity Warnings
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 3
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Proximity warning systems for construction sites do not consider whether workers are already aware of the hazard prior to issuing warnings. This can generate redundant and distracting alarms that interfere with worker ability to adopt timely and appropriate avoidance measures; and cause alarm fatigue, which instigates workers to habitually disable the system or ignore the alarms; thereby increasing the risk of injury. Thus, this paper integrates the field-of-view of workers as a proxy for hazard awareness to develop an improved hazard proximity warning system for construction sites. The research first developed a rule-based model for the warning generation, which was followed by a virtual experiment to evaluate the integration of worker field-of-view in alarm generation. Based on these findings, an improved hazard proximity warning system incorporating worker field-of-view was developed for field applications that utilizes wearable inertial measurement units and localization sensors. The system&rsquo;s effectiveness is illustrated through several case studies. This research provides a fresh perspective to the growing adoption of wearable sensors by incorporating the awareness of workers into the generation of hazard alarms. The proposed system is anticipated to reduce unnecessary and distracting alarms which can potentially lead to superior safety performance in construction.

The aim of this paper is to identify current research challenges and solutions in relation to 5G-enabled Industrial IoT, based on the initial requirements and promises of both domains. The methodology of the paper follows the steps of surveying state-of-the art, comparing results to identify further challenges, and drawing conclusions as lessons learned for each research domain.

AB  - Though the technological advancement of smart city infrastructure has significantly improved urban pedestrians&rsquo; health and safety, there remains a large number of road traffic accident victims, making it a pressing current transportation concern. In particular, unsignalized crosswalks present a major threat to pedestrians, but we lack dense behavioral data to understand the risks they face. In this study, we propose a new model for potential pedestrian risky event (PPRE) analysis, using video footage gathered by road security cameras already installed at such crossings. Our system automatically detects vehicles and pedestrians, calculates trajectories, and extracts frame-level behavioral features. We use k-means clustering and decision tree algorithms to classify these events into six clusters, then visualize and interpret these clusters to show how they may or may not contribute to pedestrian risk at these crosswalks. We confirmed the feasibility of the model by applying it to video footage from unsignalized crosswalks in Osan city, South Korea.

The output of the solar panels is linked to input parameters such as irradiation, module temperature, ambient temperature, and windspeed. The benchmarking and accuracy metrics are calculated for 1 h, 1 day, and 1 week for the CNN based methods which are then compared with the results from the autoregressive moving average and multiple linear regression models in order to demonstrate its efficacy in making short-term and medium-term forecasts.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The prediction of electrical power produced in combined cycle power plants is a key challenge in the electrical power and energy systems field. This power production can vary depending on environmental variables, such as temperature, pressure, and humidity. Thus, the business problem is how to predict the power production as a function of these environmental conditions, in order to maximize the profit. The research community has solved this problem by applying Machine Learning techniques, and has managed to reduce the computational and time costs in comparison with the traditional thermodynamical analysis. Until now, this challenge has been tackled from a batch learning perspective, in which data is assumed to be at rest, and where models do not continuously integrate new information into already constructed models. We present an approach closer to the Big Data and Internet of Things paradigms, in which data are continuously arriving and where models learn incrementally, achieving significant enhancements in terms of data processing (time, memory and computational costs), and obtaining competitive performances. This work compares and examines the hourly electrical power prediction of several streaming regressors, and discusses about the best technique in terms of time processing and predictive performance to be applied on this streaming scenario.

AB  - Noise pollution is one of the major urban environmental pollutions, and it is increasingly becoming a matter of crucial public concern. Monitoring and predicting environmental noise are of great significance for the prevention and control of noise pollution. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, urban noise monitoring is emerging in the direction of a small interval, long time, and large data amount, which is difficult to model and predict with traditional methods. In this study, an IoT-based noise monitoring system was deployed to acquire the environmental noise data, and a two-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) network was proposed for the prediction of environmental noise under the condition of large data volume. The optimal hyperparameters were selected through testing, and the raw data sets were processed. The urban environmental noise was predicted at time intervals of 1 s, 1 min, 10 min, and 30 min, and their performances were compared with three classic predictive models: random walk (RW), stacked autoencoder (SAE), and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed model outperforms the other three existing classic methods. The time interval of the data set has a close connection with the performance of all models. The results revealed that the LSTM network could reflect changes in noise levels within one day and has good prediction accuracy. Impacts of monitoring point location on prediction results and recommendations for environmental noise management were also discussed in this paper.

However, implementing an environment where active learning takes place requires a great deal of effort given the number of variables involved in this objective. To identify these variables, it is necessary to analyze the data generated by the students in search of patterns that allow them to be classified according to their needs. Once these needs are identified, it is possible to make decisions that contribute to the learning of each student; for this, the use of artificial intelligence is considered. These techniques emulate the processes of human thought using structures that contain knowledge and experience of human experts.

AB  - The neighborhood rough set theory was adopted for attributes reduction and the weight distribution of condition attributes based on the concept of importance level. Smart elderly care coverage rate is low in China. A decisive role in the adoption of smart elderly care is still a problem that needs to be addressed. This study contributes to the adoption of smart elderly care was selected as the decision attribute. The remaining attributes are used as conditional attributes and the multi-level symmetric attribute set for assessing acceptance of smart elderly care. Prior studies are not included smart elderly care adoption attributes in multi-levels; hence, this problem needs to be addressed. The results of this study indicate that the condition attribute of gender has the greatest influence on the decision attribute. The condition attribute of living expenses for smart elderly care has the second largest impact on decision attribute. Children&rsquo;s support for the elderly decency of the novel elderly care system and the acceptance of non-traditional elderly care methods belong to the primary condition attribute of traditional concept. The result indicates traditional concepts have a certain impact on the adoption of smart elderly care and a condition attribute of residence also has a slight influence on the symmetric decision attribute. The sensitivity analysis shows the insights for uncertainties and provides as a basis for the analysis of the attributes in the smart elderly care service adoption.

AB  - AI (artificial intelligence)-based analysis of geospatial data has gained a lot of attention. Geospatial datasets are multi-dimensional; have spatiotemporal context; exist in disparate formats; and require sophisticated AI workflows that include not only the AI algorithm training and testing, but also data preprocessing and result post-processing. This complexity poses a huge challenge when it comes to full-stack AI workflow management, as researchers often use an assortment of time-intensive manual operations to manage their projects. However, none of the existing workflow management software provides a satisfying solution on hybrid resources, full file access, data flow, code control, and provenance. This paper introduces a new system named Geoweaver to improve the efficiency of full-stack AI workflow management. It supports linking all the preprocessing, AI training and testing, and post-processing steps into a single automated workflow. To demonstrate its utility, we present a use case in which Geoweaver manages end-to-end deep learning for in-time crop mapping using Landsat data. We show how Geoweaver effectively removes the tedium of managing various scripts, code, libraries, Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, servers, and platforms, greatly reducing the time, cost, and effort researchers must spend on such AI-based workflows. The concepts demonstrated through Geoweaver serve as an important building block in the future of cyberinfrastructure for AI research.

AB  - Precision Agriculture (PA) is an ever-expanding field that takes modern technological advancements and applies it to farming practices to reduce waste and increase output. One advancement that can play a significant role in achieving precision agriculture is wireless technology, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Small, inch scale and low-cost devices can be used to monitor great agricultural areas. In this paper, a system for precision viticulture which uses IoT devices for real-time monitoring is proposed. The different components of the system are programmed properly and the interconnection between them is designed to minimize energy consumption. Wireless sensor nodes measure soil moisture and soil temperature in the field and transmit the information to a base station. If the conditions are optimal for a disease or pest to occur, a drone flies towards the area. When the drone is over the node, pictures are captured and then it returns to the base station for further processing. The feasibility of the system is examined through experimentation in a realistic scenario.

AB  - Being the necessary data of the city-scale seismic damage simulations, structural types of buildings of a city need to be collected. To this end, a prediction method of structural types of buildings based on machine learning (ML) is proposed herein. Specifically, using the training data of 230,683 buildings in Tangshan city, China, a supervised ML solution based on a decision forest model was designed for the prediction. The scale sensitivity and regional applicability of the designed solution are discussed, respectively, and the results show that the supervised ML solution can maintain high accuracy for different scales; however, it is only suitable for cities similar to the sample city. For wide applicability for various cities, a semi-supervised ML solution was designed based on sampling investigation and self-training procedures. The downtowns of Daxing and Tongzhou districts in Beijing were selected as a case study for the designed semi-supervised ML solution. The overall prediction accuracies of structural types for Daxing and Tongzhou downtowns can reach 94.8% and 99.5%, respectively, which are acceptable for seismic damage simulations. Based on the predicted results, the distributions of seismic damage in Daxing and Tongzhou downtown were output. This study provides a smart and efficient method for obtaining structural types for a city-scale seismic damage simulation.

AB  - The transition of the energy system into a more efficient state requires innovative ideas to finance new schemes and engage people into adjusting their behavioural patterns concerning consumption. Effective energy management combined with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) open new opportunities for local and regional authorities, but also for energy suppliers, utilities and other obligated parties, or even energy cooperatives, to implement mechanisms that allow people to become more efficient either by producing and trading energy or by reducing their energy consumption. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed connecting energy savings with a digital energy currency. This framework builds reward schemes where the energy end-users could benefit financially from saving energy, by receiving coins according to their real consumption compared to the predicted consumption if no actions were to take place. A pilot appraisal of such a scheme is presented for the case of Bahrain, so as to simulate the behaviour of the proposed framework in order for it to become a viable choice for intelligent energy management in future action plans.

TI  - Urban PM2.5 Concentration Prediction via Attention-Based CNN–LSTM
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 6
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Urban particulate matter forecasting is regarded as an essential issue for early warning and control management of air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, existing methods for PM2.5 concentration prediction neglect the effects of featured states at different times in the past on future PM2.5 concentration, and most fail to effectively simulate the temporal and spatial dependencies of PM2.5 concentration at the same time. With this consideration, we propose a deep learning-based method, AC-LSTM, which comprises a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and attention-based network, for urban PM2.5 concentration prediction. Instead of only using air pollutant concentrations, we also add meteorological data and the PM2.5 concentrations of adjacent air quality monitoring stations as the input to our AC-LSTM. Hence, the spatiotemporal correlation and interdependence of multivariate air quality-related time-series data are learned by the CNN&ndash;LSTM network in AC-LSTM. The attention mechanism is applied to capture the importance degrees of the effects of featured states at different times in the past on future PM2.5 concentration. The attention-based layer can automatically weigh the past feature states to improve prediction accuracy. In addition, we predict the PM2.5 concentrations over the next 24 h by using air quality data in Taiyuan city, China, and compare it with six baseline methods. To compare the overall performance of each method, the mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) are applied to the experiments in this paper. The experimental results indicate that our method is capable of dealing with PM2.5 concentration prediction with the highest performance.

AB  - Sustainability has become one of the challenges of today&rsquo;s banks. Since sustainable business models are responsible for the environment and society along with generating economic benefits, they are an attractive approach to sustainability. Sustainable business models also offer banks competitive advantages such as increasing brand reputation and cost reduction. However, no framework is presented to evaluate the sustainability of banking business models. To bridge this theoretical gap, the current study using A Delphi-Analytic Hierarchy Process method, firstly, developed a sustainable business model to evaluate the sustainability of the business model of banks. In the second step, the sustainability performance of sixteen banks from eight European countries including Norway, The UK, Poland, Hungary, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy, assessed. The proposed business model components of this study were ranked in terms of their impact on achieving sustainability goals. Consequently, the proposed model components of this study, based on their impact on sustainability, are respectively value proposition, core competencies, financial aspects, business processes, target customers, resources, technology, customer interface, and partner network. The results of the comparison of the banks studied by each country disclosed that the sustainability of the Norwegian and German banks&rsquo; business models is higher than in other counties. The studied banks of Hungary and Spain came in second, the banks of The UK, Poland, and France ranked third, and finally, the Italian banks ranked fourth in the sustainability of their business models.

AB  - The number of publications on acoustic scene classification (ASC) in environmental audio recordings has constantly increased over the last few years. This was mainly stimulated by the annual Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) competition with its first edition in 2013. All competitions so far involved one or multiple ASC tasks. With a focus on deep learning based ASC algorithms, this article summarizes and groups existing approaches for data preparation, i.e., feature representations, feature pre-processing, and data augmentation, and for data modeling, i.e., neural network architectures and learning paradigms. Finally, the paper discusses current algorithmic limitations and open challenges in order to preview possible future developments towards the real-life application of ASC systems.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In urban areas, the accuracy and reliability of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) vehicle positioning decline due to substantial non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals and multipath effects. Recently, positioning enhancement approaches with supervised GNSS signal type classification based on 3D building model-aided labelling have received widespread attention. Despite the reduced computing costs and improved real-time performance, the strict requirements of 3D building models on accuracy and timeliness limit the popularization of the technology to some extent. Meanwhile, the diversity of anomalous observation sources is beyond the reach of NLOS/multipath detection methods. This paper attempts to construct an alternative framework for quality identification of GNSS observations combining clustering-based anomaly detection and supervised classification, in which the hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm is used to label the offline dataset as normal and anomalous observations without the aid of 3D building models, and the supervised classifier in the online system learns the classification rule for real-time anomaly detection. The experimental results based on the measured vehicle GPS/BeiDou data show that after excluding anomalous observations the single point positioning accuracy of the offline dataset is improved by 87.0%, 45.9%, and 69.6% in the east, north, and up directions, respectively, and the positioning accuracy of two online datasets is improved by 48.4%/45.7%, 39.6%/63.3%, and 49.6%/49.1% in the three directions. Through a large number of comparative experiments and discussion on key issues, it is certified that the proposed method is highly feasible and has great potential in the practical application of urban GNSS vehicle positioning.

AB  - High-speed wired and wireless Internet are one of the useful ways to acquire various types of media data easily. In this circumstance, people also can easily get media data including objects with exposed personal information through the Internet. Exposure of personal information emerges as a social issue. This paper proposes an effective blocking technique that makes it possible to robustly detect target objects with exposed personal information from various types of input images with the use of deep neural computing and to effectively block the detected objects&rsquo; regions. The proposed technique first utilizes the neural computing-based learning algorithm to robustly detect the target object including personal information from an image. It next generates a grid-type mosaic and lets the mosaic overlap the target object region detected in the previous step so as to effectively block the object region that includes personal information. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm robustly detects the target object region with exposed personal information from a variety of input images and effectively blocks the detected region through grid-type mosaic processing. The object blocking technique proposed in this paper is expected to be applied to various application fields such as image security, sustainable anticipatory computing, object tracking, and target blocking.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Due to the increasing consumption of food products and demand for food quality and safety, most food processing facilities in the United States utilize machines to automate their processes, such as cleaning, inspection and grading, packing, storing, and shipping. Machine vision technology has been a proven solution for inspection and grading of food products since the late 1980s. The remaining challenges, especially for small to midsize facilities, include the system and operating costs, demand for high-skilled workers for complicated configuration and operation and, in some cases, unsatisfactory results. This paper focuses on the development of an embedded solution with learning capability to alleviate these challenges. Three simple application cases are included to demonstrate the operation of this unique solution. Two datasets of more challenging cases were created to analyze and demonstrate the performance of our visual inspection algorithm. One dataset includes infrared images of Medjool dates of four levels of skin delamination for surface quality grading. The other one consists of grayscale images of oysters with varying shape for shape quality evaluation. Our algorithm achieved a grading accuracy of 95.0% on the date dataset and 98.6% on the oyster dataset, both easily surpassed manual grading, which constantly faces the challenges of human fatigue or other distractions. Details of the design and functions of our smart camera and our simple visual inspection algorithm are discussed in this paper.

VL  - 10
IS  - 6
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Nowadays, traffic infrastructures and vehicles are connected through the network benefiting from the development of Internet of Things (IoT). Connected automated cars can provide some useful traffic information. An architecture and algorithm of mobile service computing are proposed for traffic state sensing by integration between IoT and transport system models (TSMs). The formation process of queue at this intersection is analyzed based on the state information of connected vehicles and the velocity of shockwave is calculated to predict queue length. The computing results can be delivered to the traffic information edge server. However, not all the vehicles are capable of connecting to the network and will affect the queue length estimation accuracy. At the same time, traffic cameras transmit the traffic image to the edge server and a deep neuron network (DNN) is constructed on the edge server to tackle the traffic image. It can recognize and classify the vehicles in the image but takes several seconds to work with the complex DNN. At last, the final queue length is determined according to the weight of the two computing results. The integrated result is delivered to the traffic light controller and traffic monitoring center cloud. It reveals that the estimation from DNN can compensate the estimation from shockwave when the penetration rate of connected vehicles is low. A testbed is built based on VISSIM, and the evaluation results demonstrate the availability and accuracy of the integrated queue length estimation algorithm.

AB  - This paper elucidates the development of a deep learning&ndash;based driver assistant that can prevent driving accidents arising from drowsiness. As a precursor to this assistant, the relationship between the sensation of sleep depravity among drivers during long journeys and CO2 concentrations in vehicles is established. Multimodal signals are collected by the assistant using five sensors that measure the levels of CO, CO2, and particulate matter (PM), as well as the temperature and humidity. These signals are then transmitted to a server via the Internet of Things, and a deep neural network utilizes this information to analyze the air quality in the vehicle. The deep network employs long short-term memory (LSTM), skip-generative adversarial network (GAN), and variational auto-encoder (VAE) models to build an air quality anomaly detection model. The deep learning models gather data via LSTM, while the semi-supervised deep learning models collect data via GANs and VAEs. The purpose of this assistant is to provide vehicle air quality information, such as PM alerts and sleep-deprived driving alerts, to drivers in real time and thereby prevent accidents.

AB  - The convergence of fifth-generation (5G) communication and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has dramatically increased the diversity and complexity of the network. This change diversifies the attacker&rsquo;s attack vectors, increasing the impact and damage of cyber threats. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) technology is a proof-based security system which responds to these advanced cyber threats proactively by analyzing and sharing security-related data. However, the performance of CTI systems can be significantly compromised by creating and disseminating improper security policies if an attacker intentionally injects malicious data into the system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based CTI framework that improves confidence in the source and content of the data and can quickly detect and eliminate inaccurate data for resistance to a Sybil attack. The proposed framework collects CTI by a procedure validated through smart contracts and stores information about the metainformation of data in a blockchain network. The proposed system ensures the validity and reliability of CTI data by ensuring traceability to the data source and proposes a system model that can efficiently operate and manage CTI data in compliance with the de facto standard. We present the simulation results to prove the effectiveness and Sybil-resistance of the proposed framework in terms of reliability and cost to attackers.

AB  - The significant increase of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart homes and other smart infrastructure, and the recent attacks on these IoT devices, are motivating factors to secure and protect IoT networks. The primary security challenge to develop a methodology to identify a malicious activity correctly and mitigate the impact of such activity promptly. In this paper, we propose a two-level anomalous activity detection model for intrusion detection system in IoT networks. The level-1 model categorizes the network flow as normal flow or abnormal flow, while the level-2 model classifies the category or subcategory of detected malicious activity. When the network flow classified as an anomaly by the level-1 model, then the level-1 model forwards the stream to the level-2 model for further investigation to find the category or subcategory of the detected anomaly. Our proposed model constructed on flow-based features of the IoT network. Flow-based detection methodologies only inspect packet headers to classify the network traffic. Flow-based features extracted from the IoT Botnet dataset and various machine learning algorithms were investigated and tested via different cross-fold validation tests to select the best algorithm. The decision tree classifier yielded the highest predictive results for level-1, and the random forest classifier produced the highest predictive results for level-2. Our proposed model Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F score for level-1 were measured as 99.99% and 99.90% for level-2. A two-level anomalous activity detection system for IoT networks we proposed will provide a robust framework for the development of malicious activity detection system for IoT networks. It would be of interest to researchers in academia and industry.

AB  - Along with environmental pollution, urban planning has been connected to public health. The research indicates that the quality of built environments plays an important role in reducing mental disorders and overall health. The structure and shape of the city are considered as one of the factors influencing happiness and health in urban communities and the type of the daily activities of citizens. The aim of this study was to promote physical activity in the main structure of the city via urban design in a way that the main form and morphology of the city can encourage citizens to move around and have physical activity within the city. Functional, physical, cultural-social, and perceptual-visual features are regarded as the most important and effective criteria in increasing physical activities in urban spaces, based on literature review. The environmental quality of urban spaces and their role in the physical activities of citizens in urban spaces were assessed by using the questionnaire tool and analytical network process (ANP) of structural equation modeling. Further, the space syntax method was utilized to evaluate the role of the spatial integration of urban spaces on improving physical activities. Based on the results, consideration of functional diversity, spatial flexibility and integration, security, and the aesthetic and visual quality of urban spaces plays an important role in improving the physical health of citizens in urban spaces. Further, more physical activities, including motivation for walking and the sense of public health and happiness, were observed in the streets having higher linkage and space syntax indexes with their surrounding texture.

AB  - The current methods that aim at monitoring the structural health status (SHS) of road pavements allow detecting surface defects and failures. This notwithstanding, there is a lack of methods and systems that are able to identify concealed cracks (particularly, bottom-up cracks) and monitor their growth over time. For this reason, the objective of this study is to set up a supervised machine learning (ML)-based method for the identification and classification of the SHS of a differently cracked road pavement based on its vibro-acoustic signature. The method aims at collecting these signatures (using acoustic-sensors, located at the roadside) and classifying the pavement&rsquo;s SHS through ML models. Different ML classifiers (i.e., multilayer perceptron, MLP, convolutional neural network, CNN, random forest classifier, RFC, and support vector classifier, SVC) were used and compared. Results show the possibility of associating with great accuracy (i.e., MLP = 91.8%, CNN = 95.6%, RFC = 91.0%, and SVC = 99.1%) a specific vibro-acoustic signature to a differently cracked road pavement. These results are encouraging and represent the bases for the application of the proposed method in real contexts, such as monitoring roads and bridges using wireless sensor networks, which is the target of future studies.

AB  - This paper mainly formulates the problem of predicting context-aware smartphone apps usage based on machine learning techniques. In the real world, people use various kinds of smartphone apps differently in different contexts that include both the user-centric context and device-centric context. In the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning, decision tree model is one of the most popular approaches for predicting context-aware smartphone usage. However, real-life smartphone apps usage data may contain higher dimensions of contexts, which may cause several issues such as increases model complexity, may arise over-fitting problem, and consequently decreases the prediction accuracy of the context-aware model. In order to address these issues, in this paper, we present an effective principal component analysis (PCA) based context-aware smartphone apps prediction model, &ldquo;ContextPCA&rdquo; using decision tree machine learning classification technique. PCA is an unsupervised machine learning technique that can be used to separate symmetric and asymmetric components, and has been adopted in our &ldquo;ContextPCA&rdquo; model, in order to reduce the context dimensions of the original data set. The experimental results on smartphone apps usage datasets show that &ldquo;ContextPCA&rdquo; model effectively predicts context-aware smartphone apps in terms of precision, recall, f-score and ROC values in various test cases.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - The amalgamation of Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) with the Internet of Things (IoT) leads to the concept of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). IoV forms a solid backbone for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which paves the way for technologies that better explain about traffic efficiency and their management applications. IoV architecture is seen as a big player in different areas such as the automobile industry, research organizations, smart cities and intelligent transportation for various commercial and scientific applications. However, as VANET is vulnerable to various types of security attacks, the IoV structure should ensure security and efficient performance for vehicular communications. To address these issues, in this article, an authentication-based protocol (A-MAC) for smart vehicular communication is proposed along with a novel framework towards an IoV architecture model. The scheme requires hash operations and uses cryptographic concepts to transfer messages between vehicles to maintain the required security. Performance evaluation helps analyzing its strength in withstanding various types of security attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that A-MAC outshines other protocols in terms of communication cost, execution time, storage cost, and overhead.

AB  - The Internet of Things refers (IoT) to the billions of physical devices around the globe that are connected to the Internet, collecting and sharing data. The overall Internet of Things market is projected to be worth more than 50.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. IoT devices possess low processing capabilities, limited memory, limited storage, and minimal network protocol support. With the help of cloud computing technology, we can overcome the limited resources of IoT devices. A lot of research has been conducted on IoT device virtualization to facilitate remote access and control. The concept of virtualization in IoT is to provide a virtual representation of physical devices in the form of virtual objects. IoT devices are more likely to be accessed and communicate through virtual objects in the near future. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of building a virtual IoT network for a smart home. The virtual network is based on virtual objects and IoT controller. We derived the concept from Software Defined Network (SDN) and separated the control plane and data plane in the virtual IoT network. This enhanced the rapid development of diverse applications on top of the virtualization layer by establishing a dynamic end-to-end connection between IoT devices. This article briefly explains the design and development of the virtual network. Results achieved during experiments and performance analysis show that IoT controller enhances the capabilities of a virtual network by dynamically controlling the traffic congestion, handling mapping requests, and routing mechanisms.

AB  - School bullying is a serious problem among teenagers. School violence is one type of school bullying and considered to be the most harmful. As AI (Artificial Intelligence) techniques develop, there are now new methods to detect school violence. This paper proposes a video-based school violence detecting algorithm. This algorithm first detects foreground moving targets via the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) method and then preprocesses the detected targets via morphological processing methods. Then, this paper proposes a circumscribed rectangular frame integrating method to optimize the circumscribed rectangular frame of moving targets. Rectangular frame features and optical-flow features were extracted to describe the differences between school violence and daily-life activities. We used the Relief-F and Wrapper algorithms to reduce the feature dimension. SVM (Support Vector Machine) was applied as the classifier, and 5-fold cross validation was performed. The accuracy was 89.6%, and the precision was 94.4%. To further improve the recognition performance, we developed a DT&ndash;SVM (Decision Tree&ndash;SVM) two-layer classifier. We used boxplots to determine some features of the DT layer that are able to distinguish between typical physical violence and daily-life activities and between typical daily-life activities and physical violence. For the remainder of activities, the SVM layer performed a classification. For this DT&ndash;SVM classifier, the accuracy reached 97.6%, and the precision reached 97.2%, thus showing a significant improvement.

VL  - 13

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In this paper, an innovative method for managing a smart-community microgrid (SCM) with a centralized electrical storage system (CESS) is proposed. The method consists of day-ahead optimal power flow (DA&ndash;OPF) for day-ahead SCM managing and its subsequent evaluation, considering forecast uncertainties. The DA&ndash;OPF is based on a data forecast system that uses a deep learning (DL) long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The OPF problem is formulated as a mathematical mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. Following this, the developed DA&ndash;OPF strategy was evaluated under possible operations, using a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The MCS allowed us to obtain potential deviations of forecasted data during possible day-ahead operations and to evaluate the impact of the data forecast errors on the SCM, and that of unit limitation and the emergence of critical situations. Simulation results on a real existing rural conventional community endowed with a centralized community renewable generation (CCRG) and CESS, confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed operation method. The economic analysis showed significant benefits and an electricity price reduction for the considered community if compared to a conventional distribution system, as well as the easy applicability of the proposed method due to the CESS and the developed operating systems.

TI  - Image Representation Method Based on Relative Layer Entropy for Insulator Recognition
T2  - Entropy

PY  - 2020
VL  - 22
IS  - 4
SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with alternating convolutional, pooling and decimation layers are widely used in computer vision, yet current works tend to focus on deeper networks with many layers and neurons, resulting in a high computational complexity. However, the recognition task is still challenging for insufficient and uncomprehensive object appearance and training sample types such as infrared insulators. In view of this, more attention is focused on the application of a pretrained network for image feature representation, but the rules on how to select the feature representation layer are scarce. In this paper, we proposed a new concept, the layer entropy and relative layer entropy, which can be referred to as an image representation method based on relative layer entropy (IRM_RLE). It was designed to excavate the most suitable convolution layer for image recognition. First, the image was fed into an ImageNet pretrained DCNN model, and deep convolutional activations were extracted. Then, the appropriate feature layer was selected by calculating the layer entropy and relative layer entropy of each convolution layer. Finally, the number of the feature map was selected according to the importance degree and the feature maps of the convolution layer, which were vectorized and pooled by VLAD (vector of locally aggregated descriptors) coding and quantifying for final image representation. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs competitively against previous methods across all datasets. Furthermore, for the indoor scenes and actions datasets, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) forms the foundation of next generation infrastructures, enabling development of future cities that are inherently sustainable. Intrusion detection for such paradigms is a non-trivial challenge which has attracted further significance due to extraordinary growth in the volume and variety of security threats for such systems. However, due to unique characteristics of such systems i.e., battery power, bandwidth and processor overheads and network dynamics, intrusion detection for IoT is a challenge, which requires taking into account the trade-off between detection accuracy and performance overheads. In this context, we are focused at highlighting this trade-off and its significance to achieve effective intrusion detection for IoT. Specifically, this paper presents a comprehensive study of existing intrusion detection systems for IoT systems in three aspects: computational overhead, energy consumption and privacy implications. Through extensive study of existing intrusion detection approaches, we have identified open challenges to achieve effective intrusion detection for IoT infrastructures. These include resource constraints, attack complexity, experimentation rigor and unavailability of relevant security data. Further, this paper is envisaged to highlight contributions and limitations of the state-of-the-art within intrusion detection for IoT, and aid the research community to advance it by identifying significant research directions.

AB  - Recognizing human physical activities from streaming smartphone sensor readings is essential for the successful realization of a smart environment. Physical activity recognition is one of the active research topics to provide users the adaptive services using smart devices. Existing physical activity recognition methods lack in providing fast and accurate recognition of activities. This paper proposes an approach to recognize physical activities using only2-axes of the smartphone accelerometer sensor. It also investigates the effectiveness and contribution of each axis of the accelerometer in the recognition of physical activities. To implement our approach, data of daily life activities are collected labeled using the accelerometer from 12 participants. Furthermore, three machine learning classifiers are implemented to train the model on the collected dataset and in predicting the activities. Our proposed approach provides more promising results compared to the existing techniques and presents a strong rationale behind the effectiveness and contribution of each axis of an accelerometer for activity recognition. To ensure the reliability of the model, we evaluate the proposed approach and observations on standard publicly available dataset WISDM also and provide a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art studies. The proposed approach achieved 93% weighted accuracy with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, which is almost 13% higher than the existing methods.

AB  - Leukemia is a fatal disease that threatens the lives of many patients. Early detection can effectively improve its rate of remission. This paper proposes two automated classification models based on blood microscopic images to detect leukemia by employing transfer learning, rather than traditional approaches that have several disadvantages. In the first model, blood microscopic images are pre-processed; then, features are extracted by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network named AlexNet, which makes classifications according to numerous well-known classifiers. In the second model, after pre-processing the images, AlexNet is fine-tuned for both feature extraction and classification. Experiments were conducted on a dataset consisting of 2820 images confirming that the second model performs better than the first because of 100% classification accuracy.

AB  - The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) systems has received much attention from the research community, and it has brought many innovations to smart cities, particularly through the Internet of Moving Things (IoMT). The dynamic geographic distribution of IoMT devices enables the devices to sense themselves and their surroundings on multiple spatio-temporal scales, interact with each other across a vast geographical area, and perform automated analytical tasks everywhere and anytime. Currently, most of the geospatial applications of IoMT systems are developed for abnormal detection and control monitoring. However, it is expected that, in the near future, optimization and prediction tasks will have a larger impact on the way citizens interact with smart cities. This paper examines the state of the art of IoMT systems and discusses their crucial role in supporting anticipatory learning. The maximum potential of IoMT systems in future smart cities can be fully exploited in terms of proactive decision making and decision delivery via an anticipatory action/feedback loop. We also examine the challenges and opportunities of anticipatory learning for IoMT systems in contrast to GIS. The holistic overview provided in this paper highlights the guidelines and directions for future research on this emerging topic.

AB  - Short-term load forecasting ensures the efficient operation of power systems besides affording continuous power supply for energy consumers. Smart meters that are capable of providing detailed information on buildings energy consumption, open several doors of opportunity to short-term load forecasting at the individual building level. In the current paper, four machine learning methods have been employed to forecast the daily peak and hourly energy consumption of domestic buildings. The utilized models depend merely on buildings historical energy consumption and are evaluated on the profiles that were not previously trained on. It is evident that developing data-driven models lacking external information such as weather and building data are of great importance under the situations that the access to such information is limited or the computational procedures are costly. Moreover, the performance evaluation of the models on separated house profiles determines their generalization ability for unseen consumption profiles. The conducted experiments on the smart meter data of several UK houses demonstrated that if the models are fed with sufficient historical data, they can be generalized to a satisfactory level and produce quite accurate results even if they only use past consumption values as the predictor variables. Furthermore, among the four applied models, the ones based on deep learning and ensemble techniques, display better performance in predicting daily peak load consumption than those of others.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 8
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This paper proposes a video-based smoke detection technique for early warning in antifire surveillance systems. The algorithm is developed to detect the smoke behavior in a restricted video surveillance environment, both indoor (e.g., railway carriage, bus wagon, industrial plant, or home/office) or outdoor (e.g., storage area or parking area). The proposed technique exploits a Kalman estimator, color analysis, image segmentation, blob labeling, geometrical features analysis, and M of N decisor, in order to extract an alarm signal within a strict real-time deadline. This new technique requires just a few seconds to detect fire smoke, and it is 15 times faster compared to the requirements of fire-alarm standards for industrial or transport systems, e.g., the EN50155 standard for onboard train fire-alarm systems. Indeed, the EN50155 considers a response time of at least 60 s for onboard systems. The proposed technique has been tested and compared with state-of-art systems using the open access Firesense dataset developed as an output of a European FP7 project, including several fire/smoke indoor and outdoor scenes. There is an improvement of all the detection metrics (recall, accuracy, F1 score, precision, etc.) when comparing Advanced Video SmokE Detection (AdViSED) with other video-based antifire works recently proposed in literature. The proposed technique is flexible in terms of input camera type and frame size and rate and has been implemented on a low-cost embedded platform to develop a distributed antifire system accessible via web browser.

AB  - A groundbreaking design of radio access networks (RANs) is needed to fulfill 5G traffic requirements. To this aim, a cost-effective and flexible strategy consists of complementing terrestrial RANs with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, several problems must be solved in order to effectively deploy such UAV-based RANs (U-RANs). Indeed, due to the high complexity and heterogeneity of these networks, model-based design approaches, often relying on restrictive assumptions and constraints, exhibit severe limitation in real-world scenarios. Moreover, design of a set of appropriate protocols for such U-RANs is a highly sophisticated task. In this context, machine learning (ML) emerges as a useful tool to obtain practical and effective solutions. In this paper, we discuss why, how, and which types of ML methods are useful for designing U-RANs, by focusing in particular on supervised and reinforcement learning strategies.

AB  - This paper introduces a possible architecture and discusses the research directions for the realization of the Cognitive Perceptual Internet (CPI), which is enabled by the convergence of wired and wireless communications, traditional sensor networks, mobile crowd-sensing, and machine learning techniques. The CPI concept stems from the fact that mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming an outstanding mean for zero-effort world-sensing and digitalization thanks to their pervasive diffusion and the increasing number of embedded sensors. Data collected by such devices provide unprecedented insights into the physical world that can be inferred through cognitive processes, thus originating a digital sixth sense. In this paper, we describe how the Internet can behave like a sensing brain, thus evolving into the Internet of Senses, with network-based cognitive perception and action capabilities built upon mobile crowd-sensing mechanisms. The new concept of hyper-map is envisioned as an efficient geo-referenced repository of knowledge about the physical world. Such knowledge is acquired and augmented through heterogeneous sensors, multi-user cooperation and distributed learning mechanisms. Furthermore, we indicate the possibility to accommodate proactive sensors, in addition to common reactive sensors such as cameras, antennas, thermometers and inertial measurement units, by exploiting massive antenna arrays at millimeter-waves to enhance mobile terminals perception capabilities as well as the range of new applications. Finally, we distillate some insights about the challenges arising in the realization of the CPI, corroborated by preliminary results, and we depict a futuristic scenario where the proposed Internet of Senses becomes true.

AB  - Metro systems play a key role in meeting urban transport demands in large cities. The close relationship between historical weather conditions and the corresponding passenger flow has been widely analyzed by researchers. However, few studies have explored the issue of how to use historical weather data to make passenger flow forecasting more accurate. To this end, an hourly metro passenger flow forecasting model using a deep long short-term memory neural network (LSTM_NN) was developed. The optimized traditional input variables, including the different temporal data and historical passenger flow data, were combined with weather variables for data modeling. A comprehensive analysis of the weather impacts on short-term metro passenger flow forecasting is discussed in this paper. The experimental results confirm that weather variables have a significant effect on passenger flow forecasting. It is interesting to find out that the previous variables of one-hour temperature and wind speed are the two most important weather variables to obtain more accurate forecasting results on rainy days at Taipei Main Station, which is a primary interchange station in Taipei. Compared to the four widely used algorithms, the deep LSTM_NN is an extremely powerful method, which has the capability of making more accurate forecasts when suitable weather variables are included.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Lane markings are one of the essential elements of road information, which is useful for a wide range of transportation applications. Several studies have been conducted to extract lane markings through intensity thresholding of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds acquired by mobile mapping systems (MMS). This paper proposes an intensity thresholding strategy using unsupervised intensity normalization and a deep learning strategy using automatically labeled training data for lane marking extraction. For comparative evaluation, original intensity thresholding and deep learning using manually established labels strategies are also implemented. A pavement surface-based assessment of lane marking extraction by the four strategies is conducted in asphalt and concrete pavement areas covered by MMS equipped with multiple LiDAR scanners. Additionally, the extracted lane markings are used for lane width estimation and reporting lane marking gaps along various highways. The normalized intensity thresholding leads to a better lane marking extraction with an F1-score of 78.9% in comparison to the original intensity thresholding with an F1-score of 72.3%. On the other hand, the deep learning model trained with automatically generated labels achieves a higher F1-score of 85.9% than the one trained on manually established labels with an F1-score of 75.1%. In concrete pavement area, the normalized intensity thresholding and both deep learning strategies obtain better lane marking extraction (i.e., lane markings along longer segments of the highway have been extracted) than the original intensity thresholding approach. For the lane width results, more estimates are observed, especially in areas with poor edge lane marking, using the two deep learning models when compared with the intensity thresholding strategies due to the higher recall rates for the former. The outcome of the proposed strategies is used to develop a framework for reporting lane marking gap regions, which can be subsequently visualized in RGB imagery to identify their cause.

AB  - Nowadays, the integration of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IoT) provides a great concern for the research community for enabling advanced services. An IoT network may comprise a large number of heterogeneous smart devices for gathering and forwarding huge data. Such diverse networks raise several research questions, such as processing, storage, and management of massive data. Furthermore, IoT devices have restricted constraints and expose to a variety of malicious network attacks. This paper presents a Secure Sensor Cloud Architecture (SASC) for IoT applications to improve network scalability with efficient data processing and security. The proposed architecture comprises two main phases. Firstly, network nodes are grouped using unsupervised machine learning and exploit weighted-based centroid vectors for the development of intelligent systems. Secondly, the proposed architecture makes the use of sensor-cloud infrastructure for boundless storage and consistent service delivery. Furthermore, the sensor-cloud infrastructure is protected against malicious nodes by using a mathematically unbreakable one-time pad (OTP) encryption scheme to provide data security. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, different simulation experiments are conducted using Network Simulator (NS3). It has been observed through experimental results that the proposed architecture outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of network lifetime, packet drop ratio, energy consumption, and transmission overhead.

AB  - The evolution of the Internet of Things is significantly affected by legal restrictions imposed for personal data handling, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The main purpose of this regulation is to provide people in the digital age greater control over their personal data, with their freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent to collect and process the data concerning them. ADVOCATE is an advanced framework that fully complies with the requirements of GDPR, which, with the extensive use of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies, aims to provide an environment that will support users in maintaining control of their personal data in the IoT ecosystem. This paper proposes and presents the Intelligent Policies Analysis Mechanism (IPAM) of the ADVOCATE framework, which, in an intelligent and fully automated manner, can identify conflicting rules or consents of the user, which may lead to the collection of personal data that can be used for profiling. In order to clearly identify and implement IPAM, the problem of recording user data from smart entertainment devices using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) was simulated. FCMs are an intelligent decision-making system that simulates the processes of a complex system, modeling the correlation base, knowing the behavioral and balance specialists of the system. Respectively, identifying conflicting rules that can lead to a profile, training is done using Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), which are highly efficient neural systems of small and flexible architecture that can work optimally in complex environments.

AB  - This article reviewed the state-of-the-art applications of the Internet of things (IoT) technology applied in homes for making them smart, automated, and digitalized in many respects. The literature presented various applications, systems, or methods and reported the results of using IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and geographic information system (GIS) at homes. Because the technology has been advancing and users are experiencing IoT boom for smart built environment applications, especially smart homes and smart energy systems, it is necessary to identify the gaps, relation between current methods, and provide a coherent instruction of the whole process of designing smart homes. This article reviewed relevant papers within databases, such as Scopus, including journal papers published in between 2010 and 2019. These papers were then analyzed in terms of bibliography and content to identify more related systems, practices, and contributors. A designed systematic review method was used to identify and select the relevant papers, which were then reviewed for their content by means of coding. The presented systematic critical review focuses on systems developed and technologies used for smart homes. The main question is &rdquo;What has been learned from a decade trailing smart system developments in different fields?&rdquo;. We found that there is a considerable gap in the integration of AI and IoT and the use of geospatial data in smart home development. It was also found that there is a large gap in the literature in terms of limited integrated systems for energy efficiency and aged care system development. This article would enable researchers and professionals to fully understand those gaps in IoT-based environments and suggest ways to fill the gaps while designing smart homes where users have a higher level of thermal comfort while saving energy and greenhouse gas emissions. This article also raised new challenging questions on how IoT and existing developed systems could be improved and be further developed to address other issues of energy saving, which can steer the research direction to full smart systems. This would significantly help to design fully automated assistive systems to improve quality of life and decrease energy consumption.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In the intelligent traffic system, real-time and accurate detections of vehicles in images and video data are very important and challenging work. Especially in situations with complex scenes, different models, and high density, it is difficult to accurately locate and classify these vehicles during traffic flows. Therefore, we propose a single-stage deep neural network YOLOv3-DL, which is based on the Tensorflow framework to improve this problem. The network structure is optimized by introducing the idea of spatial pyramid pooling, then the loss function is redefined, and a weight regularization method is introduced, for that, the real-time detections and statistics of traffic flows can be implemented effectively. The optimization algorithm we use is the DL-CAR data set for end-to-end network training and experiments with data sets under different scenarios and weathers. The analyses of experimental data show that the optimized algorithm can improve the vehicles&rsquo; detection accuracy on the test set by 3.86%. Experiments on test sets in different environments have improved the detection accuracy rate by 4.53%, indicating that the algorithm has high robustness. At the same time, the detection accuracy and speed of the investigated algorithm are higher than other algorithms, indicating that the algorithm has higher detection performance.

AB  - Multiple nations have implemented policies for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction since the 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015. In this convention, participants voluntarily agreed to a new climate regime that aimed to decrease GHG emissions. Subsequently, a reduction in GHG emissions with specific reduction technologies (renewable energy) to decrease energy consumption has become a necessity and not a choice. With the launch of the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) in 2015, Korea has certified and financed GHG reduction projects to decrease emissions. To help the user make informed decisions for economic and environmental benefits from the use of renewable energy, an assessment model was developed. This study establishes a simple assessment method (SAM), an assessment database (DB) of 1199 GHG reduction technologies implemented in Korea, and a machine learning-based GHG reduction technology assessment model (GRTM). Additionally, we make suggestions on how to evaluate economic benefits, which can be obtained in conjunction with the environmental benefits of GHG reduction technology. Finally, we validate the applicability of the assessment model on a public building in Korea.

TI  - A Novel Accurate and Fast Converging Deep Learning-Based Model for Electrical Energy Consumption Forecasting in a Smart Grid
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Energy consumption forecasting is of prime importance for the restructured environment of energy management in the electricity market. Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient energy management in the smart grid (SG); however, the energy consumption pattern is non-linear with a high level of uncertainty and volatility. Forecasting such complex patterns requires accurate and fast forecasting models. In this paper, a novel hybrid electrical energy consumption forecasting model is proposed based on a deep learning model known as factored conditional restricted Boltzmann machine (FCRBM). The deep learning-based FCRBM model uses a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and a multivariate autoregressive technique for the network training. The proposed model predicts future electrical energy consumption for efficient energy management in the SG. The proposed model is a novel hybrid model comprising four modules: (i) data processing and features selection module, (ii) deep learning-based FCRBM forecasting module, (iii) genetic wind driven optimization (GWDO) algorithm-based optimization module, and (iv) utilization module. The proposed hybrid model, called FS-FCRBM-GWDO, is tested and evaluated on real power grid data of USA in terms of four performance metrics: mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD), variance, correlation coefficient, and convergence rate. Simulation results validate that the proposed hybrid FS-FCRBM-GWDO model has superior performance than existing models such as accurate fast converging short-term load forecasting (AFC-STLF) model, mutual information-modified enhanced differential evolution algorithm-artificial neural network (MI-mEDE-ANN)-based model, features selection-ANN (FS-ANN)-based model, and Bi-level model, in terms of forecast accuracy and convergence rate.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Over the years, the flourish of crowd computing has enabled enterprises to accomplish computing tasks through crowdsourcing in a large-scale and high-quality manner, and therefore how to efficiently and securely implement crowd computing becomes a hotspot. Some recent work innovatively adopted a P2P (peer-to-peer) network as the communication environment of crowdsourcing. Based on its decentralized control, issues like single-point-of-failure or DDoS attack can be overcome to some extent, but the huge computing capacity and storage costs required by this scheme is always unbearable. Federated learning is a distributed machine learning that supports local storage of data, and clients implement training through interactive gradient values. In our work, we combine blockchain with federated learning and propose a crowdsourcing framework named CrowdSFL, that users can implement crowdsourcing with less overhead and higher security. In addition, to protect the privacy of participants, we design a new re-encryption algorithm based on Elgamal to ensure that interactive values and other information will not be exposed to other participants outside the workflow. Finally, we have proved through experiments that our framework is superior to some similar work in accuracy, efficiency, and overhead.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Nowadays, communication engineering technology is merging with the Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of numerous connected devices (referred to as things) around the world. Many researchers have shown significant growth of sensor deployments for multiple smart engineering technologies, such as smart-healthcare, smart-industries, smart-cities, and smart-transportation, etc. In such intelligent engineering technologies, sensors continuously generate a bunch of messages in the network. To enhance the value of the data in the messages, we must know the actuality of the data embedded inside the messages. For this purpose, the contextual information of the data creates a vital challenge. Recently, context-aware computing has emerged to be fruitful in dealing with sensor information. In the ubiquitous computing domain, location is commonly considered one of the most essential sources of context. However, whenever users or applications are concerned with objects, and their site or spatial relationships, location models or spatial models are necessary to form a model of the environment. This paper investigates the area of context-aware messaging and addressing services in diverse IoT applications. The paper examines the notion of context and the use of context within the data exchanged by the sensors in an IoT application for messaging and addressing purposes. Based on the importance and need for context of the information, we identify three critical categories of new IoT applications for context-aware messaging and addressing services: emergency applications, applications for guiding and reminding, and social networking applications. For this purpose, a representative range of systems is reviewed according to the application type, the technology being used, their architecture, the context information, and the services they provide. This survey assists the work of defining an approach for context-aware messaging services domain by discovering the area of context-aware messaging.

AB  - In healthcare, interoperability is widely adopted in the case of cross-departmental or specialization cases. As the human body demands multiple specialized and cross-disciplined medical experiments, interoperability of business entities like different departments, different specializations, the involvement of legal and government monitoring issues etc. are not sufficient to reduce the active medical cases. A patient-centric system with high capability to collect, retrieve, store or exchange data is the demand for present and future times. Such data-centric health processes would bring automated patient medication, or patient self-driven trusted and high satisfaction capabilities. However, data-centric processes are having a huge set of challenges such as security, technology, governance, adoption, deployment, integration etc. This work has explored the feasibility to integrate resource-constrained devices-based wearable kidney systems in the Industry 4.0 network and facilitates data collection, liquidity, storage, retrieval and exchange systems. Thereafter, a Healthcare 4.0 processes-based wearable kidney system is proposed that is having the blockchain technology advantages. Further, game theory-based consensus algorithms are proposed for resource-constrained devices in the kidney system. The overall system design would bring an example for the transition from the specialization or departmental-centric approach to data and patient-centric approach that would bring more transparency, trust and healthy practices in the healthcare sector. Results show a variation of 0.10 million GH/s to 0.18 million GH/s hash rate for the proposed approach. The chances of a majority attack in the proposed scheme are statistically proved to be minimum. Further Average Packet Delivery Rate (ADPR) lies between 95% to 97%, approximately, without the presence of outliers. In the presence of outliers, network performance decreases below 80% APDR (to a minimum of 41.3%) and this indicates that there are outliers present in the network. Simulation results show that the Average Throughput (AT) value lies between 120 Kbps to 250 Kbps.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - From the last decade, pharmaceutical companies are facing difficulties in tracking their products during the supply chain process, allowing the counterfeiters to add their fake medicines into the market. Counterfeit drugs are analyzed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss of around $200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting problem. The blockchain has the full potential to handle and track the supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented a novel blockchain and machine learning-based drug supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR). Our proposed system consists of two main modules: blockchain-based drug supply chain management and machine learning-based drug recommendation system for consumers. In the first module, the drug supply chain management system is deployed using Hyperledger fabrics which is capable of continuously monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, the N-gram, LightGBM models are used in the machine learning module to recommend the top-rated or best medicines to the customers of the pharmaceutical industry. These models have trained on well known publicly available drug reviews dataset provided by the UCI: an open-source machine learning repository. Moreover, the machine learning module is integrated with this blockchain system with the help of the REST API. Finally, we also perform several tests to check the efficiency and usability of our proposed system.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the analysis of the personal learning environments (PLE) used individually and in groups by fifth grade primary education students. The main objective was to determine if the use of mobile technologies in the students&rsquo; PLEs encouraged their school integration and learning in intercultural communities. For this, a content analysis of the students&rsquo; responses to an ad hoc interview was carried out, with a content validity index of 0.89. The students represented their answers using 41 concept maps in the individual tasks and 5 in the group tasks, which were analyzed with the Nvivo software in its latest version. The results show the categorization of the students&rsquo; responses in three dimensions: read, make/reflection and relationship. Among the main conclusions, it was obtained that, in both types of tasks, the strategies and tools that fostered intercultural relationships, intercultural education and communication between the students, and therefore school integration, are mostly linked to the use of mobile technologies applications, such as Wikipedia, the internet, Word, PowerPoint, social networks and YouTube, although it is essential to develop more studies to have more data to understand the phenomenon in depth.

AB  - Data integrity in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is very important because incorrect or missing values could result in the system making suboptimal or catastrophic decisions. Data imputation allows for a system to counteract the effect of data loss by substituting faulty or missing sensor values with system-defined virtual values. This paper proposes a virtual sensor system that uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to impute sensor values in a WSN. The MLP was trained using a genetic algorithm which efficiently reached an optimal solution for each sensor node. The system was able to successfully identify and replace physical sensor nodes that were disconnected from the network with corresponding virtual sensors. The virtual sensors imputed values with very high accuracies when compared to the physical sensor values.

PY  - 2020

IS  - 6
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of visual impairment and blindness across the world. It is usually found in patients who suffer from diabetes for a long period. The major focus of this work is to derive optimal representation of retinal images that further helps to improve the performance of DR recognition models. To extract optimal representation, features extracted from multiple pre-trained ConvNet models are blended using proposed multi-modal fusion module. These final representations are used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) used for DR identification and severity level prediction. As each ConvNet extracts different features, fusing them using 1D pooling and cross pooling leads to better representation than using features extracted from a single ConvNet. Experimental studies on benchmark Kaggle APTOS 2019 contest dataset reveals that the model trained on proposed blended feature representations is superior to the existing methods. In addition, we notice that cross average pooling based fusion of features from Xception and VGG16 is the most appropriate for DR recognition. With the proposed model, we achieve an accuracy of 97.41%, and a kappa statistic of 94.82 for DR identification and an accuracy of 81.7% and a kappa statistic of 71.1% for severity level prediction. Another interesting observation is that DNN with dropout at input layer converges more quickly when trained using blended features, compared to the same model trained using uni-modal deep features.

SN  - 2624-8921

AB  - With the increase of vehicles in large urban centers, there is also an increase in the number of traffic jams and accidents on public roads. The development of a proper Intelligent Transport System (ITS) could help to alleviate these problems by assisting the drivers on route selections to avoid the most congested road sections. Therefore, to improve on this issue, this work proposes an architecture to aid an ITS to detect, analyze, and classify the traffic flow conditions in real time. This architecture also provides a control room dashboard to visualize the information and notify the users about the live traffic conditions. To this end, the proposed solution takes advantage of computer vision concepts to extract the maximum information about the roads to better assess and keep the drivers posted about the traffic conditions on selected highways. The main contribution of the proposed architecture is to perform the detection and classification of the flow of vehicles regardless of the luminosity conditions. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solution, a testbed was designed. The obtained results show that the accuracy of the traffic classification rate is up to 90% in daylight environments and up to 70% in low light environments when compared with the related literature.

SN  - 2227-7390

AB  - Several epidemiological models are being used around the world to project the number of infected individuals and the mortality rates of the COVID-19 outbreak. Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to the lack of essential data and uncertainty, the epidemiological models have been challenged regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19, and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are proposed to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for 9 days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs. This paper provides an initial benchmarking to demonstrate the potential of machine learning for future research.

TI  - Autonomous Shuttle Bus for Public Transportation: A Review

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 11
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The rapid evolution of autonomous technology in the field of automotive and information technology (IT) has made it possible to implement autonomous vehicles (AVs) for public passenger transport. Although the shuttle bus transport capacities currently in use are low (maximum 15 people), the use of these transport units in large urban agglomerations is beneficial for society. The current paper is written to review the current AV implementation with respect to shuttle buses with its direct implications in their scientific evolution, with direct links to the legal and social aspects of public transportation all over the world. A critical aspect that is presented in the paper is the legal framework of autonomous driving, which is extremely uneven around the globe, with the direct impact of autonomous shuttle bus exploitation. As the legislation on AVs presents some shortcomings in the approval, registration, and public road implementation of these vehicles, many of the world&rsquo;s major cities have found ways to integrate them into testing programs, establishing the basis for future comprehensive legislative measures in this highly dynamic scientific domain. The current technological solutions adopted by several autonomous shuttle bus producers will be presented with an exhaustive overview of each major component. The aspects of the control algorithm, with its complicated layers of security and perturbance factors, will be explained in detail. Thus, in some countries/cities, autonomous shuttle buses have been implemented on less-traveled routes where they can travel at speeds up to 25 km/h without hindering the public&rsquo;s circulation, such as university campuses, industrial areas, airports, and sports bases. Some countries/cities use autonomous shuttle buses for pilot programs related to passenger transport, while others use them in postal transport and others for scientific purposes. In all of these situations, the first step in autonomous driving has been taken. The paper also makes an evaluation of the social factors that are a consequence of the mass introduction of autonomous driving as a means of public transportation. Autonomous shuttle buses are becoming a part of everyday life in big cities. Their acceptance as a strategic means of transport depends on their efficiency in daily services; through its efficiency, this means of transport will become a game-changer once its benefits become not only known but experienced by a large number of users.

AB  - The logistics industry around the world has proliferated over recent years as a large number of business organizations have come to recognize the importance of logistics. Cost control used to be emphasized to remain competitive, but recently green logistics has gained attention with the awareness of the integration of economy and society as a whole. Nowadays, green logistics is a useful concept to improve the sustainability of logistics operations, and its related policies and theoretical research have been investigated and explored. However, the practical applications of green logistics are impeded by real-time data sharing, which is common in the logistics industry.

AB  - There are a number of significant changes taking place in modern city development and most of them are based on the number of recent technological progress. This paper provides a review and analysis of recent approaches of biotechnology that can find a place in today&rsquo;s cities and discusses how those technologies can be integrated into a city&rsquo;s Internet of Things (IoT). Firstly, several biotechnologies that focus on rain gardens, urban vertical farming systems, and city photobioreactors are discussed in the context of their integration in a city&rsquo;s IoT. The next possible application of biofuel cells to the sensor network&rsquo;s energy supply is discussed. It is shown that such devices can influence the low-power sensor network structure as an additional energy source for transmitters. This paper shows the possibility of bioelectrochemical biosensor applications, discusses self-powered biosensors, and shows that such a system can be widely applied to rainwater monitoring in rain gardens and green streets. Significant attention is paid to recent approaches in synthetic biology. Both cell-based biosensors and bioactuators with synthetic genetic circuits are discussed. The development of cell-based biosensors can significantly enhance the sensing possibilities of a city&rsquo;s IoT. We show the possible ways to develop cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with the systems mentioned above. Aspects of data handling for the discussed biotechnologies and the methods of intelligent systems, including those that are machine learning-based, applied to the IoT in a city are presented.

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT), the Internet of vehicles, and blockchain technology have become very popular these days because of their versatility. Road traffic, which is increasing day by day, is causing more and more deaths worldwide. The world needs a product that would reduce the number of road accidents. This paper suggests combining IoT and blockchain technology to mitigate road hazards. The new intelligent transportation system technologies and the subsequent emergence of 5G technologies will be a blessing, delivering the necessary speed to ensure both safety and quality of service (QoS). Hashgraph technology, a distributed ledger technology is used to create communication networks between the different vehicles and other relevant parameters. Scheduling the requests according to the priorities for ensuring better QoS quotient can be effectively done using hashgraph. We demonstrated how the hashgraph outstrips other equivalents platforms. The proposed model was simulated using OMNeT++ with proper design and network description files. A hardware implementation of the proposed model was also done. Messages were transferred between the vehicles and prioritized using a hashgraph. This paper proposes an effective model in reducing the accidents in terms of parameters like speed, security, stability, and fairness.

AB  - The rapid development of urbanization has increased traffic pressure and made the identification of urban functional regions a popular research topic. Some studies have used point of interest (POI) data and smart card data (SCD) to conduct subway station classifications; however, the unity of both the model and the dataset limits the prediction results. This paper not only uses SCD and POI data, but also adds Online to Offline (OTO) e-commerce platform data, an application that provides customers with information about different businesses, like the location, the score, the comments, and so on. In this paper, these data are combined to and used to analyze each subway station, considering the diversity of data, and obtain a passenger flow feature map of different stations, the number of different types of POIs within 800 m, and the situation of surrounding OTO stores. This paper proposes a two-stage framework, to identify the functional region of subway stations. In the passenger flow stage, the SCD feature is extracted and converted to a feature map, and a ResNet model is used to get the output of stage 1. In the built environment stage, the POI and OTO features are extracted, and a deep neural network with stacked autoencoders (SAE&ndash;DNN) model is used to get the output of stage 2. Finally, the outputs of the two stages are connected and a SoftMax function is used to make the final identification of functional region. We performed experimental testing, and our experimental results show that the framework exhibits good performance and has a certain reference value in the planning of subway stations and their surroundings, contributing to the construction of smart cities.

AB  - Early fault detection and diagnosis in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems may reduce the damage of equipment, improving the reliability and safety of smart buildings, generating social and economic benefits. Data models for fault detection and diagnosis are increasingly used for extracting knowledge in the supervisory tasks. This article proposes an autonomic cycle of data analysis tasks (ACODAT) for the supervision of the building&rsquo;s HVAC systems. Data analysis tasks incorporate data mining models for extracting knowledge from the system monitoring, analyzing abnormal situations and automatically identifying and taking corrective actions. This article shows a case study of a real building&rsquo;s HVAC system, for the supervision with our ACODAT, where the HVAC subsystems have been installed over the years, providing a good example of a heterogeneous facility. The proposed supervisory functionality of the HVAC system is capable of detecting deviations, such as faults or gradual increment of energy consumption in similar working conditions. The case study shows this capability of the supervisory autonomic cycle, usually a key objective for smart buildings.

AB  - In a global world, the human population invariably increases while resources gradually decrease as cities and towns constantly consume resources to satisfy their needs and requirements. At this point, it is very necessary to focus on making these urban areas more sustainable and greener. The need for some advanced and automated systems improves the situation, which leads to the innovation of smart cities. Smart city is the concept that helps in developing sustainable cities via optimized resource utilization methods. In smart city development, various sensing technologies can be used that can sense and utilize natural resources in better ways, like storing rainwater to use afterward, intelligent and smart control system, smart infrastructure monitoring system, smart healthcare system, smart transportation system, and smart system for energy consumption and generation by various facilities. To make the city smart and sustainable with efficient energy consumption, we propose renewable solar and wind energy-enabled hybrid heating and cooling HVAC-DHW (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning-Domestic Hot Water) system in which energy consumption is evaluated using optimized NARX-ANN and fuzzy controller based on user needs, dynamic behavior of the atmospheric environment, and spatial distribution of energy supply. To achieve the proposed goal, first, via sensor, heating and cooling effect of environment and building is sensed and these sensed inputs are then fed into deep-learning-based NARX-ANN that forecast internal building temperature. This forecasted temperature is fed into a fuzzy controller for optimizing output based on user demand. This processed information leads to energy distribution based on their requirement using a smart energy sensing system. Based on the experimentation result and performance analysis, it was found that the proposed system is more robust and has a high control response in comparison to the existing systems with minimum energy consumption. The analytical results support the feasibility of the proposed framework architecture to facilitate energy conserving in smart city buildings.

AB  - With the increasing demand for intelligent traffic management and road network intelligent information services, the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) combined with information of air, space and ground have outstanding advantages in coverage, reliable transmission, and resource richness. Due to the characteristics of heterogeneous, numerous nodes, and frequent cross-network flow, the space&ndash;air&ndash;ground integrated network (SAGIN) puts forward higher requirements for security. This paper proposes a cross-regional node identity management architecture based on the hash chain, combined with radio frequency (RF) fingerprint theory, to guarantee node identity security with a non-duplicated physical information identity authentication mechanism. At the same time, the blockchain consensus mechanism is simplified to achieve block recording and verification. OMNet ++, SUMO, and Veins co-simulation platforms are used to generate transactions for cross-regional traffic flow. Based on the Hyperledger&ndash;Fabric architecture, Kafka and PBFT consensus algorithms are simulated. The simulation results show that the average delay of a single transaction generated block is about 0.9 ms, which achieves efficient and low-latency authentication.

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have caught people&rsquo;s attention in recent years, not only from an academic or developmental viewpoint but also because of the wide range of applications that these vehicles may entail, such as intelligent mobility and logistics, as well as for industrial purposes, among others. The open literature contains a variety of works related to the subject. They employ a diversity of techniques ranging from probabilistic to ones based on Artificial Intelligence. The increase in computing capacity, well known to many, has opened plentiful opportunities for the algorithmic processing needed by these applications, making way for the development of autonomous navigation, in many cases with astounding results. The following paper presents a low-cost but high-performance minimal sensor open architecture implemented in a modular vehicle. It was developed in a short period of time, surpassing many of the currently available solutions found in the literature. Diverse experiments were carried out in the controlled and circumscribed environment of an autonomous circuit that demonstrates the efficiency of the applicability of the developed solution.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Studies on room monitoring have only focused on objects in a singular and uniform posture or low-density groups. Considering the wide use of convolutional neural networks for object detection, especially person detection, we use deep learning and perspective correction techniques to propose a room monitoring system that can detect persons with different motion states, high-density groups, and small-sized persons owing to the distance from the camera. This system uses consecutive frames from the monitoring camera as input images. Two approaches are used: perspective correction and person detection. First, perspective correction is used to transform an input image into a 2D top-view image. This allows users to observe the system more easily with different views (2D and 3D views). Second, the proposed person detection scheme combines the Mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) scheme and the tile technique for person detection, especially for detecting small-sized persons. All results are stored in a cloud database. Moreover, new person coordinates in 2D images are generated from the final bounding boxes and heat maps are created according to the 2D images; these enable users to examine the system quickly in different views. Additionally, a system prototype is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system. Experimental results prove that our proposed system outperforms existing schemes in terms of accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

AB  - The growing trend in electrical vehicle (EV) deployment has transformed independent power network and transportation network studies into highly congested interdependent network performance evaluations assessing their impact on power and transportation systems. Electrified transportation is highly capable of intensifying the interdependent correlations across charging service, transportation, and power networks. However, the evaluation of the complex coupled relationship across charging services, transportation, and power networks poses several challenges, including an impact on charging scheduling, traffic congestion, charging loads on the power grid, and high costs. Therefore, this article presents comparative survey analytics of large-scale EV integration&rsquo;s impact on charging service network scheduling, transportation networks, and power networks. Moreover, price mechanism strategies to determine the charging fares, minimize investment profits, diminish traffic congestion, and reduce power distribution constraints under the influence of various factors were carried out. Additionally, the survey analysis stipulates the interdependent network performance index, ascertaining travel distance, route selection, long-term and short-term planning, and different infrastructure strategies. Finally, the limitations of the proposed study, potential research trends, and critical technologies are demonstrated for future inquiries.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - The proper management of a municipal water system is essential to sustain cities and support the water security of societies. Urban water estimating has always been a challenging task for managers of water utilities and policymakers. This paper applies a novel methodology that includes data pre-processing and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) optimized with the Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA-ANN) to estimate monthly water demand in relation to previous water consumption. Historical data of monthly water consumption in the Gauteng Province, South Africa, for the period 2007&ndash;2016, were selected for the creation and evaluation of the methodology. Data pre-processing techniques played a crucial role in the enhancing of the quality of the data before creating the prediction model. The BSA-ANN model yielded the best result with a root mean square error and a coefficient of efficiency of 0.0099 mega liters and 0.979, respectively. Moreover, it proved more efficient and reliable than the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA-ANN), based on the scale of error. Overall, this paper presents a new application for the hybrid model BSA-ANN that can be successfully used to predict water demand with high accuracy, in a city that heavily suffers from the impact of climate change and population growth.

AB  - Air pollution in urban regions remains a crucial subject of study, given its implications on health and environment, where much effort is often put into monitoring pollutants and producing accurate trend estimates over time, employing expensive tools and sensors. In this work, we study the problem of air quality estimation in the urban area of Milan (IT), proposing different machine learning approaches that combine meteorological and transit-related features to produce affordable estimates without introducing sensor measurements into the computation. We investigated different configurations employing machine and deep learning models, namely a linear regressor, an Artificial Neural Network using Bayesian regularization, a Random Forest regressor and a Long Short Term Memory network. Our experiments show that affordable estimation results over the pollutants can be achieved even with simpler linear models, therefore suggesting that reasonably accurate Air Quality Index (AQI) measurements can be obtained without the need for expensive equipment.

AB  - Knowing an accurate passengers attendance estimation on each metro car contributes to the safely coordination and sorting the crowd-passenger in each metro station. In this work we propose a multi-head Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained to infer an estimation of passenger attendance in a metro car. The proposed network architecture consists of two main parts: a convolutional backbone, which extracts features over the whole input image, and a multi-head layers able to estimate a density map, needed to predict the number of people within the crowd image. The network performance is first evaluated on publicly available crowd counting datasets, including the ShanghaiTech part_A, ShanghaiTech part_B and UCF_CC_50, and then trained and tested on our dataset acquired in subway cars in Italy. In both cases a comparison is made against the most relevant and latest state of the art crowd counting architectures, showing that our proposed MH-MetroNet architecture outperforms in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Square Error (MSE) and passenger-crowd people number prediction.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is one of the most important use cases related to smart cities. In addition to assisting traffic management authorities, traffic forecasting can help drivers to choose the best path to their destinations. Accurate traffic forecasting is a basic requirement for traffic management. We propose a traffic forecasting approach that utilizes air pollution and atmospheric parameters. Air pollution levels are often associated with traffic intensity, and much work is already available in which air pollution has been predicted using road traffic. However, to the best of our knowledge, an attempt to improve forecasting road traffic using air pollution and atmospheric parameters is not yet available in the literature. In our preliminary experiments, we found out the relation between traffic intensity, air pollution, and atmospheric parameters. Therefore, we believe that addition of air pollutants and atmospheric parameters can improve the traffic forecasting. Our method uses air pollution gases, including     C O , N O , N  O 2  , N  O x  ,     and     O 3    . We chose these gases because they are associated with road traffic. Some atmospheric parameters, including pressure, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed have also been considered, as these parameters can play an important role in the dispersion of the above-mentioned gases. Data related to traffic flow, air pollution, and the atmosphere were collected from the open data portal of Madrid, Spain. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) was used in this paper to perform traffic forecasting.

AB  - Currently, there is great interest in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels (and other non-renewable energy sources) in order to preserve the environment; smart buildings are commonly proposed for this purpose as they are capable of producing their own energy and using it optimally. However, at times, solar energy is not able to supply the energy demand fully; it is mandatory to know the quantity of energy needed to optimize the system. This research focuses on the prediction of output temperature from a solar thermal collector. The aim is to measure solar thermal energy and optimize the energy system of a house (or building). The dataset used in this research has been taken from a real installation in a bio-climate house located on the Sotavento Experimental Wind Farm, in north-west Spain. A hybrid intelligent model has been developed by combining clustering and regression methods such as neural networks, polynomial regression, and support vector machines. The main findings show that, by dividing the dataset into small clusters on the basis of similarity in behavior, it is possible to create more accurate models. Moreover, combining different regression methods for each cluster provides better results than when a global model of the whole dataset is used. In temperature prediction, mean absolute error was lower than 4      ∘    C.

With rapid resource shrinkage, energy management has recently become an essential concern for all smart environments. Energy management aims to assure ecosystem sustainability, while benefiting both consumers and utility providers. Although energy management emerged as a solution that addresses challenges that arise with increasing energy demand and resource deterioration, further evolution and expansion are hindered due to technological, economical, and social barriers. This review aggregates energy management approaches in smart environments and extensively reviews a variety of recent literature reports on peak load shaving and demand response. Significant benefits and challenges of these energy management strategies were identified through the literature survey. Finally, a critical discussion summarizing trends and opportunities is given as a thread for future research.

As a result, this study aims to design a set of interactive robot-assisted teaching for classroom setting to help students overcoming academic difficulties. Teachers, students, and robots in the classroom can interact with each other through the ARCS motivation model in programming. The proposed method can help students to develop the motivation, relevance, and confidence in learning, thus enhancing their learning effectiveness. The robot, like a teaching assistant, can help students solving problems in the classroom by answering questions and evaluating students&rsquo; answers in natural and responsive interactions. The natural interactive responses of the robot are achieved through the use of a database of emotional big data (Google facial expression comparison dataset). The robot is loaded with an emotion recognition system to assess the moods of the students through their expressions and sounds, and then offer corresponding emotional responses. The robot is able to communicate naturally with the students, thereby attracting their attention, triggering their learning motivation, and improving their learning effectiveness.

AB  - Technological innovations have enabled the realization of a utopian world where all objects of everyday life, as well as humans, are interconnected to form an &ldquo;Internet of Things (IoT).&rdquo; These connected technologies and IoT solutions have led to the emergence of smart cities where all components are converted into a connected smart ecosystem. IoT has envisioned several areas of smart cities including the modern healthcare environment like real-time monitoring, patient information management, ambient-assisted living, ambient-intelligence, anomaly detection, and accelerated sensing. IoT has also brought a breakthrough in the medical domain by integrating stake holders, medical components, and hospitals to bring about holistic healthcare management. The healthcare domain is already witnessing promising IoT-based solutions ranging from embedded mobile applications to wearable devices and implantable gadgets. However, with all these exemplary benefits, there is a need to ensure the safety and privacy of the patient&rsquo;s personal and medical data communicated to and from the connected devices and systems. For a smart city, it is pertinent to have an accessible, effective, and secure healthcare system for its inhabitants. This paper discusses the various elements of technology-enabled healthcare and presents a privacy-preserved and secure &ldquo;Smart Medical System (SMS)&rdquo; framework for the smart city ecosystem. For providing real-time analysis and responses, this paper proposes to use the concept of secured Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) for performing critical time-bound computations on the edge itself. In order to protect the medical and personal data of the patients and to make the data tamper-proof, the concept of blockchain has been used. Finally, this paper highlights the ways to capture and store the medical big data generated from IoT devices and sensors.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular in surveillance, security, and remote monitoring. However, they also pose serious security threats to public privacy. The timely detection of a malicious drone is currently an open research issue for security provisioning companies. Recently, the problem has been addressed by a plethora of schemes. However, each plan has a limitation, such as extreme weather conditions and huge dataset requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework consisting of the hybrid handcrafted and deep feature to detect and localize malicious drones from their sound and image information. The respective datasets include sounds and occluded images of birds, airplanes, and thunderstorms, with variations in resolution and illumination. Various kernels of the support vector machine (SVM) are applied to classify the features. Experimental results validate the improved performance of the proposed scheme compared to other related methods.

AB  - This manuscript identifies and documents unsolved problems and research challenges in the extended reality (XR) domain (i.e., virtual (VR), augmented (AR), and mixed reality (MR)). The manuscript is structured to include technology, design, and human factor perspectives. The text is visualization/display-focused, that is, other modalities such as audio, haptic, smell, and touch, while important for XR, are beyond the scope of this paper. We further narrow our focus to mainly geospatial research, with necessary deviations to other domains where these technologies are widely researched. The main objective of the study is to provide an overview of broader research challenges and directions in XR, especially in spatial sciences. Aside from the research challenges identified based on a comprehensive literature review, we provide case studies with original results from our own studies in each section as examples to demonstrate the relevance of the challenges in the current research. We believe that this paper will be of relevance to anyone who has scientific interest in extended reality, and/or uses these systems in their research.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Non-contact health care monitoring is a unique feature in the emerging 5G networks that is achieved by exploiting artificial intelligence (AI). The ratio of the number of health care problems and patients is increasing exponentially and creating burgeoning data. The integration of AI and Internet of things (IoT) systems enables us to increase the huge volume of data to be generated. The approach by which AI is applied to the IoT systems enhances the intelligence of the health care system. In post-surgery monitoring of the patient, timely consultation is essential before further loss. Unfortunately, even after the advice of the doctor to the patient, he/she may forget to perform the activity in the correct way, which may lead to complications in recovery. In this research, the idea is to design a non-contact sensing testbed using AI for the classification of post-surgery activities. Universal software-defined radio peripheral (USRP) is utilized to collect the data of spinal cord operated patients during weight lifting activity. The wireless channel state information (WCSI) is extracted by using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique. AI applies machine learning to classify the correct and wrong way of weight lifting activity that was considered for experimental analysis. The accuracy achieved by the proposed testbed by using a fine K-nearest neighbor (FKNN) algorithm is 99.6%.

AB  - This paper presents a rapid response system architecture for the distributed management of warehouses in logistics by applying the concept of tiered edge computing. A tiered edge node architecture is proposed for the system to process computing tasks of different complexity, and a corresponding rapid response algorithm is introduced. The paper emphasizes the classification of abstracted outlier sensing data which could better match different sensing types and transplant to various application fields. A software-defined simulation is used to evaluate the system performance on response time and response accuracy, from which it can be concluded that common predefined emergency cases can be detected and responded to, rapidly.

AB  - Over the last years, existing technologies have been applied to agricultural environments, resulting in new precision agriculture systems. Some of the multiple profits of developing new agricultural technologies and applications include the cost reduction around the building and deployment of them, together with more energy-efficient consumption. Therefore, agricultural precision systems focus on developing better, easier, cheaper, and overall more efficient ways of handling agricultural monitoring and actuation. To achieve this vision, we use a set of technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks, Sensors devices, Internet of Things, or data analysis. More specifically, in this study, we proposed a combination of all these technologies to design and develop a prototype of a precision agriculture system for medium and small agriculture plantations that highlights two major advantages: efficient energy management with self-charging capabilities and a low-cost policy. For the development of the project, several prototype nodes were built and deployed within a sensor network connected to the cloud as a self-powered system. The final target of this system is, therefore, to gather environment data, analyze it, and actuate by activating the watering installation. An analysis of the exposed agriculture monitoring system, in addition to results, is exposed in the paper.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - Considering the increasing use of emerging technologies in industrialized construction in recent years, the primary objective of this article is to develop and validate predictive models to predict the emerging technology utilization level of industrialized construction industry practitioners. Our preliminary research results indicate that the company background and personal career profiles can significantly affect practitioners&rsquo; technology utilization level. Thus, our prediction model is based on four variables: company size, company type, working experience, and working position. The United States and China are selected as the case studies to validate the prediction model. First, a well-designed questionnaire survey is distributed to the industrialized construction industry practitioners from the two countries, which leads to 81 and 99 valid responses separately. Then, ordinal logistic regression is used to develop a set of models to predict the practitioners&rsquo; utilization level of the four main technology types. Finally, the external test dataset consisting of 16 cases indicates the prediction models have a high accuracy. The results also reflect some differences of the technology utilization status in the industrialized construction industry between the United States and China. The major contribution of this research is offering an efficient and accurate method to predict practitioners&rsquo; technology utilization level in industrialized construction. Significantly, the models are believed to have a wide application in promoting the emerging technologies in the actual industrialized construction.

AB  - The emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) which was declared a pandemic has spread to 210 countries worldwide. It has had a significant impact on health systems and economic, educational and social facets of contemporary society. As the rate of transmission increases, various collaborative approaches among stakeholders to develop innovative means of screening, detecting and diagnosing COVID-19&rsquo;s cases among human beings at a commensurate rate have evolved. Further, the utility of computing models associated with the fourth industrial revolution technologies in achieving the desired feat has been highlighted. However, there is a gap in terms of the accuracy of detection and prediction of COVID-19 cases and tracing contacts of infected persons. This paper presents a review of computing models that can be adopted to enhance the performance of detecting and predicting the COVID-19 pandemic cases. We focus on big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that can be adopted in the current pandemic. The review suggested that artificial intelligence models have been used for the case detection of COVID-19. Similarly, big data platforms have also been applied for tracing contacts. However, the nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that have demonstrated good performance in feature selection of medical issues are yet to be explored for case detection and tracing of contacts in the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study holds salient implications for practitioners and researchers alike as it elucidates the potentials of NIC in the accurate detection of pandemic cases and optimized contact tracing.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - As a green and sustainable travel mode, the bikeshare plays an important role in solving the &ldquo;last-mile&rdquo; problem. The new dockless bikeshare system (DBS) is widely favored by travelers, and the traditional docked bikeshare system (BS) is affected to a certain extent, but the specific circumstances of this impact are not yet known. To fill the knowledge gap, the objective of this study is to measure the impacts of DBS on London cycle hire, which is a type of BS. In this study, the travel data of 707 docking stations in two periods, i.e., March 2018 and March 2017, are included. A spatial-temporal analysis is first conducted to investigate the mobility pattern changes. A complex network analysis is then developed to explore the impact of DBS on network connectivity. The results suggest a significant decrease of 64% in the average trip amounts, with both origins and destinations in the affected area, and the trips with short and medium duration and short and medium distances are mainly replaced by DBS. DBS also has a considerable impact on the structure and properties of the mobility network. The connectivity and interaction strength between stations decrease after DBS appears. We also concluded that the observed changes are heterogeneously distributed in space, especially on weekends. The applied spatial-temporal analysis and complex network analysis provide a better understanding of the relationships between DBS and BS.

AB  - Sensor networks in real-world environments, such as smart cities or ambient intelligent platforms, provide applications with large and heterogeneous sets of data streams. Outliers—observations that do not conform to an expected behavior—has then turned into a crucial task to establish and maintain secure and reliable databases in this kind of platforms. However, the procedures to obtain accurate models for erratic observations have to operate with low complexity in terms of storage and computational time, in order to attend the limited processing and storage capabilities of the sensor nodes in these environments. In this work, we analyze three binary classifiers based on three statistical prediction models—ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average), GAM (Generalized Additive Model), and LOESS (LOcal RegrESSion)—for outlier detection with low memory consumption and computational time rates. As a result, we provide (1) the best classifier and settings to detect outliers, based on the ARIMA model, and (2) two real-world classified datasets as ground truths for future research.

AB  - Managerial and Business Economics (ME/BE) aims at using quantitative and computational methods to make an efficient (ideally optimal) assignment of the scarce resources owned by firms and organizations. In the current global market, characterized by a fierce competition, an optimal use of the available resources is more important than ever for guaranteeing the economical sustainability of organizations and enterprises of any size. Heuristic optimization algorithms and simulation methods have been successfully employed to analyze and enhance complex systems and processes in a myriad of ME/BE-related fields. This paper reviews recent works on the use of these methodologies in competitive markets, as well as in imperfect markets considering externalities. The paper also discusses open challenges and how state-of-the art methods combining optimization, simulation, and machine learning can contribute to properly address them.

PY  - 2020

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The scope of the present paper is to promote social, cultural and environmental sustainability in cities by establishing a conceptual framework and the relationship amongst safety in urban public space (UPS), lighting and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-based surveillance. This framework uses available technologies and tools, as these can be found in urban equipment such as lighting posts, to enhance security and safety in UPS, ensuring protection against attempted criminal activity. Through detailed literary research, publications on security and safety concerning crime and lighting can be divided into two periods, the first one pre-1994, and the second one from 2004&ndash;2008. Since then, a significant reduction in the number of publications dealing with lighting and crime is observed, while at the same time, the urban nightscape has been reshaped with the immersion of light-emitting diode (LED) technologies. Especially in the last decade, where most municipalities in the EU28 (European Union of all the member states from the accession of Croatia in 2013 to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020) are refurbishing their road lighting with LED technology and the consideration of smart networks and surveillance is under development, the use of lighting to deter possible attempted felonies in UPS is not addressed. To capitalize on the potential of lighting as a deterrent, this paper proposes a framework that uses existing technology, namely, dimmable LED light sources, presence sensors, security cameras, as well as emerging techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled image recognition algorithms and big data analytics and presents a possible system that could be developed as a stand-alone product to alert possible dangerous situations, deter criminal activity and promote the perception of safety thus linking lighting and ICT-based surveillance towards safety and security in UPS.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This paper addresses the voltage control problem in medium-voltage distribution networks. The objective is to cost-efficiently maintain the voltage profile within a safe range, in presence of uncertainties in both the future working conditions, as well as the physical parameters of the system. Indeed, the voltage profile depends not only on the fluctuating renewable-based power generation and load demand, but also on the physical parameters of the system components. In reality, the characteristics of loads, lines and transformers are subject to complex and dynamic dependencies, which are difficult to model. In such a context, the quality of the control strategy depends on the accuracy of the power flow representation, which requires to capture the non-linear behavior of the power network. Relying on the detailed analytical models (which are still subject to uncertainties) introduces a high computational power that does not comply with the real-time constraint of the voltage control task. To address this issue, while avoiding arbitrary modeling approximations, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning model to ensure an autonomous grid operational control. Outcomes show that the proposed model-free approach offers a promising alternative to find a compromise between calculation time, conservativeness and economic performance.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 15
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Increasing waste generation has become a significant issue over the globe due to the rapid increase in urbanization and industrialization. In the literature, many issues that have a direct impact on the increase of waste and the improper disposal of waste have been investigated. Most of the existing work in the literature has focused on providing a cost-efficient solution for the monitoring of garbage collection system using the Internet of Things (IoT). Though an IoT-based solution provides the real-time monitoring of a garbage collection system, it is limited to control the spreading of overspill and bad odor blowout gasses. The poor and inadequate disposal of waste produces toxic gases, and radiation in the environment has adverse effects on human health, the greenhouse system, and global warming. While considering the importance of air pollutants, it is imperative to monitor and forecast the concentration of air pollutants in addition to the management of the waste. In this paper, we present and IoT-based smart bin using a machine and deep learning model to manage the disposal of garbage and to forecast the air pollutant present in the surrounding bin environment. The smart bin is connected to an IoT-based server, the Google Cloud Server (GCP), which performs the computation necessary for predicting the status of the bin and for forecasting air quality based on real-time data. We experimented with a traditional model (k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) and logistic reg) and a non-traditional (long short term memory (LSTM) network-based deep learning) algorithm for the creation of alert messages regarding bin status and forecasting the amount of air pollutant carbon monoxide (CO) present in the air at a specific instance. The recalls of logistic regression and k-NN algorithm is 79% and 83%, respectively, in a real-time testing environment for predicting the status of the bin. The accuracy of modified LSTM and simple LSTM models is 90% and 88%, respectively, to predict the future concentration of gases present in the air. The system resulted in a delay of 4 s in the creation and transmission of the alert message to a sanitary worker. The system provided the real-time monitoring of garbage levels along with notifications from the alert mechanism. The proposed works provide improved accuracy by utilizing machine learning as compared to existing solutions based on simple approaches.

AB  - Smart cities and smart buildings must provide their customers with many services, including those associated with health, productivity, and energy efficiency, among others. Short-range wireless systems can provide all of these services, but the significant growth of wireless networks operating within a smart building (SB) can produce the phenomenon of spectrum shortages. Spectrum shortages could be resolved using Cognitive Radio (CR)-based systems to improve the efficiency of electromagnetic spectrum use by taking advantage of the reusable spectrum available in the building&rsquo;s interior. This study proposes a mechanism using two interference conditions to quickly estimate the minimum amount of effective spectrum availability (ESA) inside an SB. The results show that an SB contains ESA distributed across 36% to 98% of the building&rsquo;s area for reuse, as a function of the height of the building and of the distance from the base station (BS) of the primary system.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Electricity demand is rising due to industrialisation, population growth and economic development. To meet this rising electricity demand, towns are renovated by smart cities, where the internet of things enabled devices, communication technologies, dynamic pricing servers and renewable energy sources are integrated. Internet of things (IoT) refers to scenarios where network connectivity and computing capability is extended to objects, sensors and other items not normally considered computers. IoT allows these devices to generate, exchange and consume data without or with minimum human intervention. This integrated environment of smart cities maintains a balance between demand and supply. In this work, we proposed a closed-loop super twisting sliding mode controller (STSMC) to handle the uncertain and fluctuating load to maintain the balance between demand and supply persistently. Demand-side load management (DSLM) consists of agents-based demand response (DR) programs that are designed to control, change and shift the load usage pattern according to the price of the energy of a smart grid community. In smart grids, evolved DR programs are implemented which facilitate controlling of consumer demand by effective regulation services. The DSLM under price-based DR programs perform load shifting, peak clipping and valley filling to maintain the balance between demand and supply. We demonstrate a theoretical control approach for persistent demand control by dynamic price-based closed-loop STSMC. A renewable energy integrated microgrid scenario is discussed numerically to show that the demand of consumers can be controlled through STSMC, which regulates the electricity price to the DSLM agents of the smart grid community. The overall demand elasticity of the current study is represented by a first-order dynamic price generation model having a piece-wise linear price-based DR program. The simulation environment for this whole scenario is developed in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulations validate that the closed-loop price-based elastic demand control technique can trace down the generation of a renewable energy integrated microgrid.

With this motivation in mind, we propose a strategy, based on neuroevolution, that can be used to this aim. Our proposal uses a genetic algorithm in order to find a sub-optimal set of hyper-parameters for configuring a deep neural network, which can then be used for obtaining the forecasting. Such a strategy is justified by the observation that the performances achieved by deep neural networks are strongly dependent on the right setting of the hyper-parameters, and genetic algorithms have shown excellent search capabilities in huge search spaces. Moreover, we base our proposal on a distributed computing platform, which allows its use on a large time-series. In order to assess the performances of our approach, we have applied it to a large dataset, related to the electric energy consumption registered in Spain over almost 10 years. Experimental results confirm the validity of our proposal since it outperforms all other forecasting techniques to which it has been compared.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) is considered to be one of the main use cases of the fifth-generation cellular system (5G). In addition, it has been categorized as one of the ultra-low latency applications in which VR applications require an end-to-end latency of 5 ms. However, the limited battery capacity and computing resources of mobile devices restrict the execution of VR applications on these devices. As a result, mobile edge-cloud computing is considered as a new paradigm to mitigate resource limitations of these devices through computation offloading process with low latency. To this end, this paper introduces an efficient multi-player with multi-task computation offloading model with guaranteed performance in network latency and energy consumption for VR applications based on mobile edge-cloud computing. In addition, this model has been formulated as an integer optimization problem whose objective is to minimize the sum cost of the entire system in terms of network latency and energy consumption. Afterwards, a low-complexity algorithm has been designed which provides comprehensive processes for deriving the optimal computation offloading decision in an efficient manner. Furthermore, we provide a prototype and real implementation for the proposed system using OpenAirInterface software. Finally, simulations have been conducted to validate our proposed model and prove that the network latency and energy consumption can be reduced by up to 26.2%, 27.2% and 10.9%, 12.2% in comparison with edge and cloud execution, respectively.

AB  - The African continent has a long history of rainfall fluctuations of varying duration and intensities. This has led to varying degrees of drought conditions, triggering research interest across the continent. The research presented here is a bibliometric analysis of scientific articles on drought monitoring and prediction published in Africa. Scientific data analysis was carried out based on bibliometric mapping techniques applied to 332 scientific publications (1980 to 2020) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. In addition, time series of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index for the previous 6 months (SPEI-6) over six regions in the continent was analysed giving the relative comparison of drought occurrences to the annual distribution of the scientific publications. The results revealed that agricultural and hydrological drought studies contributed about 75% of the total publications, while the remaining 25% was shared among socioeconomic and meteorological studies. Countries in the southern, western, and eastern regions of Africa led in terms of scientific publications during the period under review. The results further indicated that the continent experienced drought conditions in the years 1984, 1989, 1992, and 1997, thereby inducing an increase in the number of scientific publications on drought studies. The results show that the tools of analysis have also changed from simple statistics to the use of geospatial tools such as Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) models, and recently Machine Learning (ML). The ML, particularly, contributed about 11% of the total scientific publications, while RS and GIS models, and basic statistical analysis account for about 44%, 20%, and 25% respectively. The integration of spatial technologies and ML are pivotal to the development of robust drought monitoring and drought prediction systems, especially in Africa, which is considered as a drought-prone continent. The research gaps presented in this study can help prospective researchers to respond to the continental and regional drought research needs.

AB  - Phishing is one of the most common threats that users face while browsing the web. In the current threat landscape, a targeted phishing attack (i.e., spear phishing) often constitutes the first action of a threat actor during an intrusion campaign. To tackle this threat, many data-driven approaches have been proposed, which mostly rely on the use of supervised machine learning under a single-layer approach. However, such approaches are resource-demanding and, thus, their deployment in production environments is infeasible. Moreover, most previous works utilise a feature set that can be easily tampered with by adversaries. In this paper, we investigate the use of a multi-layered detection framework in which a potential phishing domain is classified multiple times by models using different feature sets. In our work, an additional classification takes place only when the initial one scores below a predefined confidence level, which is set by the system owner. We demonstrate our approach by implementing a two-layered detection system, which uses supervised machine learning to identify phishing attacks. We evaluate our system with a dataset consisting of active phishing attacks and find that its performance is comparable to the state of the art.

AB  - Several heterogeneous, intelligent, and distributed devices can be connected to interact with one another over the Internet in what is termed internet of things (IoT). Also, the concept of IoT can be exploited in the industrial environment for enhancing the production of goods and services and for mitigating the risk of disaster occurrences. This application of IoT for enhancing industrial production is known as industrial IoT (IIoT). Emergent configuration (EC) is a technology that can be adopted to enhance the operation and collaboration of IoT connected devices in order to improve the efficiency of the connected IoT systems for maximum user satisfaction. To meet user goals, the connected devices are required to cooperate with one another in an adaptive, interoperable, and homogeneous manner. In this paper, a survey of the concept of IoT is presented in addition to a review of IIoT systems. The application of ubiquitous computing-aided software define networking (SDN)-based EC architecture is propounded for enhancing the throughput of oil and gas production in the maritime ecosystems by managing the exploration process especially in emergency situations that involve anthropogenic oil and gas spillages.

AB  - The automated 3D modeling of indoor spaces is a rapidly advancing field, in which recent developments have made the modeling process more accessible to consumers by lowering the cost of instruments and offering a highly automated service for 3D model creation. We compared the performance of three low-cost sensor systems; one RGB-D camera, one low-end terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), and one panoramic camera, using a cloud-based processing service to automatically create mesh models and point clouds, evaluating the accuracy of the results against a reference point cloud from a higher-end TLS. While adequately accurate results could be obtained with all three sensor systems, the TLS performed the best both in terms of reconstructing the overall room geometry and smaller details, with the panoramic camera clearly trailing the other systems and the RGB-D offering a middle ground in terms of both cost and quality. The results demonstrate the attractiveness of fully automatic cloud-based indoor 3D modeling for low-cost sensor systems, with the latter providing better model accuracy and completeness, and with all systems offering a rapid rate of data acquisition through an easy-to-use interface.
