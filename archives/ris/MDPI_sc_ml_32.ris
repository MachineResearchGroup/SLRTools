TI  - Integrating Speculation Detection and Deep Learning to Extract Lung Cancer Diagnosis from Clinical Notes
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Despite efforts to develop models for extracting medical concepts from clinical notes, there are still some challenges in particular to be able to relate concepts to dates. The high number of clinical notes written for each single patient, the use of negation, speculation, and different date formats cause ambiguity that has to be solved to reconstruct the patient&rsquo;s natural history. In this paper, we concentrate on extracting from clinical narratives the cancer diagnosis and relating it to the diagnosis date. To address this challenge, a hybrid approach that combines deep learning-based and rule-based methods is proposed. The approach integrates three steps: (i) lung cancer named entity recognition, (ii) negation and speculation detection, and (iii) relating the cancer diagnosis to a valid date. In particular, we apply the proposed approach to extract the lung cancer diagnosis and its diagnosis date from clinical narratives written in Spanish. Results obtained show an F-score of 90% in the named entity recognition task, and a 89% F-score in the task of relating the cancer diagnosis to the diagnosis date. Our findings suggest that speculation detection is together with negation detection a key component to properly extract cancer diagnosis from clinical notes.

TI  - An IoT-Focused Intrusion Detection System Approach Based on Preprocessing Characterization for Cybersecurity Datasets
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Security in IoT networks is currently mandatory, due to the high amount of data that has to be handled. These systems are vulnerable to several cybersecurity attacks, which are increasing in number and sophistication. Due to this reason, new intrusion detection techniques have to be developed, being as accurate as possible for these scenarios. Intrusion detection systems based on machine learning algorithms have already shown a high performance in terms of accuracy. This research proposes the study and evaluation of several preprocessing techniques based on traffic categorization for a machine learning neural network algorithm. This research uses for its evaluation two benchmark datasets, namely UGR16 and the UNSW-NB15, and one of the most used datasets, KDD99. The preprocessing techniques were evaluated in accordance with scalar and normalization functions. All of these preprocessing models were applied through different sets of characteristics based on a categorization composed by four groups of features: basic connection features, content characteristics, statistical characteristics and finally, a group which is composed by traffic-based features and connection direction-based traffic characteristics. The objective of this research is to evaluate this categorization by using various data preprocessing techniques to obtain the most accurate model. Our proposal shows that, by applying the categorization of network traffic and several preprocessing techniques, the accuracy can be enhanced by up to 45%. The preprocessing of a specific group of characteristics allows for greater accuracy, allowing the machine learning algorithm to correctly classify these parameters related to possible attacks.

TI  - Industry 4.0 towards Forestry 4.0: Fire Detection Use Case
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 3
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Forestry 4.0 is inspired by the Industry 4.0 concept, which plays a vital role in the next industrial generation revolution. It is ushering in a new era for efficient and sustainable forest management. Environmental sustainability and climate change are related challenges to promote sustainable forest management of natural resources. Internet of Forest Things (IoFT) is an emerging technology that helps manage forest sustainability and protect forest from hazards via distributing smart devices for gathering data stream during monitoring and detecting fire. Stream processing is a well-known research area, and recently, it has gained a further significance due to the emergence of IoFT devices. Distributed stream processing platforms have emerged, e.g., Apache Flink, Storm, and Spark, etc. Querying windowing is the heart of any stream-processing platform which splits infinite data stream into chunks of finite data to execute a query. Dynamic query window-based processing can reduce the reporting time in case of missing and delayed events caused by data drift.In this paper, we present a novel dynamic mechanism to recommend the optimal window size and type based on the dynamic context of IoFT application. In particular, we designed a dynamic window selector for stream queries considering input stream data characteristics, application workload and resource constraints to recommend the optimal stream query window configuration. A research gap on the likelihood of adopting smart IoFT devices in environmental sustainability indicates a lack of empirical studies to pursue forest sustainability, i.e., sustainable forestry applications. So, we focus on forest fire management and detection as a use case of Forestry 4.0, one of the dynamic environmental management challenges, i.e., climate change, to deliver sustainable forestry goals. According to the dynamic window selector&rsquo;s experimental results, end-to-end latency time for the reported fire alerts has been reduced by dynamical adaptation of window size with IoFT stream rate changes.

AB  - Wastage of perishable and non-perishable products due to manual monitoring in shopping malls creates huge revenue loss in supermarket industry. Besides, internal and external factors such as calendar events and weather condition contribute to excess wastage of products in different regions of supermarket. It is a challenging job to know about the wastage of the products manually in different supermarkets region-wise. Therefore, the supermarket management needs to take appropriate decision and action to prevent the wastage of products. The fog computing data centers located in each region can collect, process and analyze data for demand prediction and decision making. In this paper, a product-demand prediction model is designed using integrated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means Unsupervised Learning (UL) algorithms and a decision making model is developed using State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. Our proposed method can cluster the products into low, medium, and high-demand product by learning from the designed features. Taking the derived cluster model, decision making for distributing low-demand to high-demand product can be made using SARSA. Experimental results show that our proposed method can cluster the datasets well with a Silhouette score of &ge;60%. Besides, our adopted SARSA-based decision making model outperforms over Q-Learning, Monte-Carlo, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Actor-Critic algorithms in terms of maximum cumulative reward, average cumulative reward and execution time.

PY  - 2021

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Urban functional zones are important space carriers for urban economic and social function. The accurate and rapid identification of urban functional zones is of great significance to urban planning and resource allocation. However, the factors considered in the existing functional zone identification methods are not comprehensive enough, and the recognition of functional zones stops at their categories. This paper proposes a framework that combines multisource heterogeneous data to identify the categories of functional zones and draw the portraits of functional zones. The framework comprehensively describes the features of functional zones from four aspects: building-level metrics, landscape metrics, semantic metrics, and human activity metrics, and uses a combination of ensemble learning and active learning to balance the identification accuracy of functional zones and the labeling cost during large-scale generalization. Furthermore, sentiment analysis, word cloud analysis, and land cover proportion maps are added to the portraits of typical functional zones to make the image of functional zones vivid. The experiment carried out within the Fifth Ring Road, Haidian District, Beijing, shows that the overall accuracy of the method reached 82.37% and the portraits of the four typical functional zones are clear. The method in this paper has good repeatability and generalization, which is helpful to carry out quantitative and objective research on urban functional zones.

AB  - The demand for innovative approaches applied to productive sectors is a reality present in the circular economy and open innovation is a relatively new concept that has revolutionized the literature about innovation management. Since the concept appeared in 2003, many articles have focused on its development and application. Although some studies have connected open innovation with sustainability, the relevance of this current on the global literature about open innovation is still unidentified. In this context, this paper tries to cover this gap with a bibliometric analysis focused on the evolution of the open innovation paradigm and the relevance of sustainability in this field of research. A sample of 3087 papers published between 2003 and 2019 in the Scopus database was obtained. The analysis revealed the main topics and the most prolific journals, authors, institutions, and countries, in terms of productivity, citations, and h-indexes. Besides of these contributions, keywords analysis reveals that, in recent years, sustainability and ecosystems are decisive variables in open innovation research.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The number of global road traffic accidents is rising every year and remains undesirably high. One of the main reasons for this trend is that, in many countries, road users violate road safety regulations and traffic laws. Despite improvements in road safety legislation, enforcement is still a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries. Information technology solutions have emerged for automated traffic enforcement systems in the last decade. They have been tested on a small scale, but until now, the cost of deployment of these systems is generally too high for nation-wide adoption in low- and middle-income countries that need them the most. We present the architectural design of a traffic violation enforcement system that can optimize the cost of deployment and resource utilization. Based on the proposed architecture, we describe the implementation and deployment of the system, and perform a comparison of two different versions of the video-based enforcement system, one using classical computer vision methods and another using deep learning techniques. Finally, we analyze the impact of the system deployed in Phuket, Thailand from 2017 to the present in terms of local road users&rsquo; compliance and the road safety situation. We conclude that the system has had a positive impact on road safety in Phuket at a moderate cost.

AB  - The extensive proliferation of urban transit cards and smartphones has witnessed the feasibility of the collection of citywide travel behaviors and the estimation of traffic status in real-time. In this paper, an urban public traffic dynamic network based on the cyber-physical-social system (CPSS-UPTDN) is proposed as a universal framework for advanced public transportation systems, which can optimize the urban public transportation based on big data and AI methods. Firstly, we introduce three modules and two loops which composes of the novel framework. Then, the key technologies in CPSS-UPTDN are studied, especially collecting and analyzing traffic information by big data and AI methods, and a particular implementation of CPSS-UPTDN is discussed, namely the artificial system, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) method. Finally, a case study is performed. The data sources include both traffic congestion data from physical space and cellular data from social space, which can improve the prediction performance for traffic status. Furthermore, the service quality of urban public transportation can be promoted by optimizing the bus dispatching based on the parallel execution in our framework.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Smart Cities (or Cities 2.0) are an evolution in citizen habitation. In such cities, transport commuting is changing rapidly with the proliferation of contemporary vehicular technology. New models of vehicle ride sharing systems are changing the way citizens commute in their daily movement schedule. The use of a private vehicle per single passenger transportation is no longer viable in sustainable Smart Cities (SC) because of the vehicles&rsquo; resource allocation and urban pollution. The current research on car ride sharing systems is widely expanding in a range of contemporary technologies, however, without covering a multidisciplinary approach. In this paper, the focus is on performing a multidisciplinary research on car riding systems taking into consideration personalized user mobility behavior by providing next destination prediction as well as a recommender system based on riders&rsquo; personalized information. Specifically, it proposes a predictive vehicle ride sharing system for commuting, which has impact on the SC green ecosystem. The adopted system also provides a recommendation to citizens to select the persons they would like to commute with. An Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled weighted pattern matching model is used to assess user movement behavior in SC and provide the best predicted recommendation list of commuting users. Citizens are then able to engage a current trip to next destination with the more suitable user provided by the list. An experimented is conducted with real data from the municipality of New Philadelphia, in SC of Athens, Greece, to implement the proposed system and observe certain user movement behavior. The results are promising for the incorporation of the adopted system to other SCs.

AB  - This paper compares and contrasts three disruptive models of potential and actual new kinds of spatial planning. These include “seasteading”, “smart neighbourhoods” and “renewable spatial systems”. Each is labelled with distinctive discursive titles, respectively: “Attention Capitalism”; “Surveillance Capitalism” and “Sustainable Capitalism” denoting the different lineaments of each, although they all have their origins in the Silicon Valley techno-entrepreneurial milieu. In each case, while the path dependences of trajectories have diverged the progenitors were often erstwhile business partners at the outset. The paper is interested in qualitative methodology and proposes “pattern recognition” as a means to disclose the deep psychological, sociological, political and economic levels that inform the surface appearances and functions of the diverse spatial planning modes and designs that have been advanced or inferred from empirically observable initiator practice. “Dark Triad” analysis is entailed in actualising psychological deep structures. Each of the three models is discussed and the lineaments of their initiators’ ideas are disclosed. Each “school” has a designated mentor(s), respectively: academic B. J. Fogg and venture capitalist Peter Thiel for “Attention Capitalism”, “smart city” planner Dan Doctoroff for “Surveillance Capitalism” and “renewable energineer” and Elon Musk for “Sustainable Capitalism”, the eventual winner of this existential “dark versus light triad” urban planning contest.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Spatiotemporal prediction of crime is crucial for public safety and smart cities operation. As crime incidents are distributed sparsely across space and time, existing deep-learning methods constrained by coarse spatial scale offer only limited values in prediction of crime density. This paper proposes the use of deep inception-residual networks (DIRNet) to conduct fine-grained, theft-related crime prediction based on non-emergency service request data (311 events). Specifically, it outlines the employment of inception units comprising asymmetrical convolution layers to draw low-level spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in crime events and complaint records in the 311 dataset. Afterward, this paper details how residual units can be applied to capture high-level spatiotemporal features from low-level spatiotemporal dependencies for the final prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed DIRNet is evaluated based on theft-related crime data and 311 data in New York City from 2010 to 2015. The results confirm that the DIRNet obtains an average F1 of 71%, which is better than other prediction models.

AB  - With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), many different smart home technologies are commercially available. However, the adoption of such technologies is slow as many of them are not cost-effective and focus on specific functions such as energy efficiency. Recently, IoT devices and sensors have been designed to enhance the quality of personal life by having the capability to generate continuous data streams that can be used to monitor and make inferences by the user. While smart home devices connect to the home Wi-Fi network, there are still compatibility issues between devices from different manufacturers. Smart devices get even smarter when they can communicate with and control each other. The information collected by one device can be shared with others for achieving an enhanced automation of their operations. This paper proposes a non-intrusive approach of integrating and collecting data from open standard IoT devices for personalised smart home automation using big data analytics and machine learning. We demonstrate the implementation of our proposed novel technology instantiation approach for achieving non-intrusive IoT based big data analytics with a use case of a smart home environment. We employ open-source frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache NiFi and FB-Prophet along with popular vendor tech-stacks such as Azure and DataBricks.

AB  - Tree precise classification and identification of forest species is a core issue of forestry resource monitoring and ecological effect assessment. In this paper, an independent tree species classification method based on fractal features of terrestrial laser point cloud is proposed. Firstly, the terrestrial laser point cloud data of an independent tree is preprocessed to obtain terrestrial point clouds of independent tree canopy. Secondly, the multi-scale box-counting dimension calculation algorithm of independent tree canopy dense terrestrial laser point cloud is proposed. Furthermore, a robust box-counting algorithm is proposed to improve the stability and accuracy of fractal dimension expression of independent tree point cloud, which implementing gross error elimination based on Random Sample Consensus. Finally, the fractal dimension of a dense terrestrial laser point cloud of independent trees is used to classify different types of independent tree species. Experiments on nine independent trees of three types show that the fractal dimension can be stabilized under large density variations, proving that the fractal features of terrestrial laser point cloud can stably express tree species characteristics, and can be used for accurate classification and recognition of forest species.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 4

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - The development from traditional low voltage grids to smart systems has become extensive and adopted worldwide. Expanding the demand response program to cover the residential sector raises a wide range of challenges. Short term load forecasting for residential consumers in a neighbourhood could lead to a better understanding of low voltage consumption behaviour. Nevertheless, users with similar characteristics can present diversity in consumption patterns. Consequently, transfer learning methods have become a useful tool to tackle differences among residential time series. This paper proposes a method combining evolutionary algorithms for neural architecture search with transfer learning to perform short term load forecasting in a neighbourhood with multiple household load consumption. The approach centres its efforts on neural architecture search using evolutionary algorithms. The neural architecture evolution process retains the patterns of the centre-most house, and later the architecture weights are adjusted for each house in a multihouse set from a neighbourhood. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure model performance. Experimental results on a large dataset containing hourly load consumption for ten houses in London, Ontario showed that the performance of the proposed approach performs better than the compared techniques. Moreover, the proposed method presents the average accuracy performance of 3.17 points higher than the state-of-the-art LSTM one shot method.

This paper poses a research question and introduces a corresponding systematic literature review, focusing on machine learning techniques’ contributions applied to bike-sharing systems to improve cities’ mobility. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method was adopted to identify specific factors that influence bike-sharing systems, resulting in an analysis of 35 papers published between 2015 and 2019, creating an outline for future research. By means of systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis, machine learning algorithms were identified in two groups: classification and prediction.

AB  - Forecasting energy demand within a distribution network is essential for developing strategies to manage and optimize available energy resources and the associated infrastructure. In this study, we consider remote communities in the Arctic located at the end of the radial distribution network without alternative energy supply. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an accurate forecasting model to manage and optimize the limited energy resources available. We first compare the accuracy of several models that perform short-and medium-term load forecasts in rural areas, where a single industrial customer dominates the electricity consumption. We consider both statistical methods and machine learning models to predict energy demand. Then, we evaluate the transferability of each method to a geographical rural area different from the one considered for training. Our results indicate that statistical models achieve higher accuracy on longer forecast horizons relative to neural networks, while the machine-learning approaches perform better in predicting load at shorter time intervals. The machine learning models also exhibit good transferability, as they manage to predict well the load at new locations that were not accounted for during training. Our work will serve as a guide for selecting the appropriate prediction model and apply it to perform energy load forecasting in rural areas and in locations where historical consumption data may be limited or even not available.

AB  - Worldwide, energy consumption and saving represent the main challenges for all sectors, most importantly in industrial and domestic sectors. The internet of things (IoT) is a new technology that establishes the core of Industry 4.0. The IoT enables the sharing of signals between devices and machines via the internet. Besides, the IoT system enables the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to manage and control the signals between different machines based on intelligence decisions. The paper’s innovation is to introduce a deep learning and IoT based approach to control the operation of air conditioners in order to reduce energy consumption. To achieve such an ambitious target, we have proposed a deep learning-based people detection system utilizing the YOLOv3 algorithm to count the number of persons in a specific area. Accordingly, the operation of the air conditioners could be optimally managed in a smart building. Furthermore, the number of persons and the status of the air conditioners are published via the internet to the dashboard of the IoT platform. The proposed system enhances decision making about energy consumption. To affirm the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed approach, intensive test scenarios are simulated in a specific smart building considering the existence of air conditioners. The simulation results emphasize that the proposed deep learning-based recognition algorithm can accurately detect the number of persons in the specified area, thanks to its ability to model highly non-linear relationships in data. The detection status can also be successfully published on the dashboard of the IoT platform. Another vital application of the proposed promising approach is in the remote management of diverse controllable devices.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Digital twins (DTs) technology has recently gained attention within the research community due to its potential to help build sustainable smart cities. However, there is a gap in the literature: currently no unified model for city services has been proposed that can guarantee interoperability across cities, capture each city’s unique characteristics, and act as a base for modeling digital twins. This research aims to fill that gap. In this work, we propose the DT-DNA model in which we design a city services digital twin, with the goal of reflecting the real state of development of a city’s services towards enhancing its citizens’ quality of life (QoL). As it was designed using ISO 37120, one of the leading international standards for city services, the model guarantees interoperability and allows for easy comparison of services within and across cities. In order to test our model, we built DT-DNA sequences of services in both Quebec City and Boston and then used a DNA alignment tool to determine the matching percentage between them. Results show that the DT-DNA sequences of services in both cities are 46.5% identical. Ground truth comparisons show a similar result, which provides a preliminary proof-of-concept for the applicability of the proposed model and framework. These results also imply that one city performs better than the other. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to compare cities based on the proposed DT-DNA and, using Boston and Quebec City as a case study, demonstrate that Boston has better services towards enhancing QoL for its citizens.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Accurate air quality monitoring requires processing of multi-dimensional, multi-location sensor data, which has previously been considered in centralised machine learning models. These are often unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this article, we address this challenge by: (1) designing a novel hybrid deep learning model for hourly PM2.5 pollutant prediction; (2) optimising the obtained model for edge devices; and (3) examining model performance running on the edge devices in terms of both accuracy and latency. The hybrid deep learning model in this work comprises a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict hourly PM2.5 concentration. The results show that our proposed model outperforms other deep learning models, evaluated by calculating RMSE and MAE errors. The proposed model was optimised for edge devices, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (RPi3B+) and Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (RPi4B). This optimised model reduced file size to a quarter of the original, with further size reduction achieved by implementing different post-training quantisation. In total, 8272 hourly samples were continuously fed to the edge device, with the RPi4B executing the model twice as fast as the RPi3B+ in all quantisation modes. Full-integer quantisation produced the lowest execution time, with latencies of 2.19 s and 4.73 s for RPi4B and RPi3B+, respectively.

AB  - Cloud interoperability provides cloud services such as Software as a Service (SaaS) or customer system to communicate between the cloud providers. However, one of the most important barriers for existing researches was to adopt the application’s or data’s in cloud computing environments so as to obtain efficient cloud interoperability. This paper focuses on reliable cloud interoperability with a heterogeneous cloud computing resource environment with the objective of providing unilateral provision computing capabilities of a cloud server without the help of human interaction and allowing proper utilization of applications and services across various domains by using an effective cloud environment available at runtime. Moreover, the framework uses hybrid squirrel search genetic algorithm (HSSGA) to select the relevant features from a set of extracted features in order to eliminate irrelevant data which provides advantages of low computational time and less memory usage. Thereafter, for a proper selection of cloud server with respect to the selected features, the system has developed the improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (I-ANFIS) which provides accurate server selection and helps against uncertainties caused by servers or applications. Hence, the experimental result of the proposed framework gives an accuracy of 94.24% and remains more efficient compared to existing frameworks.

AB  - IoT plays an important role in daily life; commands and data transfer rapidly between the servers and objects to provide services. However, cyber threats have become a critical factor, especially for IoT servers. There should be a vigorous way to protect the network infrastructures from various attacks. IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is the invisible guardian for IoT servers. Many machine learning methods have been applied in IDS. However, there is a need to improve the IDS system for both accuracy and performance. Deep learning is a promising technique that has been used in many areas, including pattern recognition, natural language processing, etc. The deep learning reveals more potential than traditional machine learning methods. In this paper, sequential model is the key point, and new methods are proposed by the features of the model. The model can collect features from the network layer via tcpdump packets and application layer via system routines. Text-CNN and GRU methods are chosen because the can treat sequential data as a language model. The advantage compared with the traditional methods is that they can extract more features from the data and the experiments show that the deep learning methods have higher F1-score. We conclude that the sequential model-based intrusion detection system using deep learning method can contribute to the security of the IoT servers.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 4
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Visual object tracking is a significant technology for camera-based sensor networks applications. Multilayer convolutional features comprehensively used in correlation filter (CF)-based tracking algorithms have achieved excellent performance. However, there are tracking failures in some challenging situations because ordinary features are not able to well represent the object appearance variations and the correlation filters are updated irrationally. In this paper, we propose a local–global multiple correlation filters (LGCF) tracking algorithm for edge computing systems capturing moving targets, such as vehicles and pedestrians. First, we construct a global correlation filter model with deep convolutional features, and choose horizontal or vertical division according to the aspect ratio to build two local filters with hand-crafted features. Then, we propose a local–global collaborative strategy to exchange information between local and global correlation filters. This strategy can avoid the wrong learning of the object appearance model. Finally, we propose a time-space peak to sidelobe ratio (TSPSR) to evaluate the stability of the current CF. When the estimated results of the current CF are not reliable, the Kalman filter redetection (KFR) model would be enabled to recapture the object. The experimental results show that our presented algorithm achieves better performances on OTB-2013 and OTB-2015 compared with the other latest 12 tracking algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm handles various challenges in object tracking well.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Attack detection problems in industrial control systems (ICSs) are commonly known as a network traffic monitoring scheme for detecting abnormal activities. However, a network-based intrusion detection system can be deceived by attackers that imitate the system’s normal activity. In this work, we proposed a novel solution to this problem based on measurement data in the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The proposed approach is called measurement intrusion detection system (MIDS), which enables the system to detect any abnormal activity in the system even if the attacker tries to conceal it in the system’s control layer. A supervised machine learning model is generated to classify normal and abnormal activities in an ICS to evaluate the MIDS performance. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed is developed to simulate the power generation units and exploit the attack dataset. In the proposed approach, we applied several machine learning models on the dataset, which show remarkable performances in detecting the dataset’s anomalies, especially stealthy attacks. The results show that the random forest is performing better than other classifier algorithms in detecting anomalies based on measured data in the testbed.

AB  - Air pollution is a global problem, especially in urban areas where the population density is very high due to the diverse pollutant sources such as vehicles, industrial plants, buildings, and waste. North Macedonia, as a developing country, has a serious problem with air pollution. The problem is highly present in its capital city, Skopje, where air pollution places it consistently within the top 10 cities in the world during the winter months. In this work, we propose using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models with long short-term memory units to predict the level of PM10 particles at 6, 12, and 24 h in the future. We employ historical air quality measurement data from sensors placed at multiple locations in Skopje and meteorological conditions such as temperature and humidity. We compare different deep learning models’ performance to an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The obtained results show that the proposed models consistently outperform the baseline model and can be successfully employed for air pollution prediction. Ultimately, we demonstrate that these models can help decision-makers and local authorities better manage the air pollution consequences by taking proactive measures.

AB  - An integrated smart home system (ISHS) is an effective way to improve the quality of life of the elderly. The elderly’s willingness is essential to adopt an ISHS; to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the elderly’s perception of ISHS. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the elderly’s perception of the ISHS by comprehensively evaluating its possible benefits and negative responses. A set of sensors required for an ISHS was determined, and interviews were designed based on four factors: perceived comfort, perceived usability, perceived privacy, and perceived benefit. Subsequently, technological trials of the sensor-set followed by two focus group interviews were conducted on nine independently living elderly participants at a senior welfare center in South Korea. Consistent with previous studies, the results of this investigation indicate that elderly participants elicited negative responses regarding usability complexity, and discomfort to daily activities. Despite such negative responses, after acquiring enough awareness about the ISHS’s benefits, the elderly acknowledged its necessity and showed a high level of willingness. Furthermore, these results indicate that for a better adoption of an ISHS, sufficient awareness regarding its benefits and development of elderly-friendly smart home sensors that minimize negative responses are required.

VL  - 9

SN  - 2227-7080

AB  - Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new paradigm that revolutionizes the idea of a software-driven network through the separation of control and data planes. It addresses the problems of traditional network architecture. Nevertheless, this brilliant architecture is exposed to several security threats, e.g., the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which is hard to contain in such software-based networks. The concept of a centralized controller in SDN makes it a single point of attack as well as a single point of failure. In this paper, deep learning-based models, long-short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), are investigated. It illustrates their possibility and efficiency in being used in detecting and mitigating DDoS attack. The paper focuses on TCP, UDP, and ICMP flood attacks that target the controller. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the accuracy, recall, and true negative rate. We compared the performance of the deep learning models with classical machine learning models. We further provide details on the time taken to detect and mitigate the attack. Our results show that RNN LSTM is a viable deep learning algorithm that can be applied in the detection and mitigation of DDoS in the SDN controller. Our proposed model produced an accuracy of 89.63%, which outperformed linear-based models such as SVM (86.85%) and Naive Bayes (82.61%). Although KNN, which is a linear-based model, outperformed our proposed model (achieving an accuracy of 99.4%), our proposed model provides a good trade-off between precision and recall, which makes it suitable for DDoS classification. In addition, it was realized that the split ratio of the training and testing datasets can give different results in the performance of a deep learning algorithm used in a specific work. The model achieved the best performance when a split of 70/30 was used in comparison to 80/20 and 60/40 split ratios.

This paper uses a three-dimensional DenseNet architecture to detect Alzheimer’s disease in magnetic resonance imaging. Our work is restricted to the use of freely available tools. We constructed a deep neural network classifier with metrics of 0.86¯ mean accuracy, 0.86¯ mean sensitivity (micro-average), 0.86¯ mean specificity (micro-average), and 0.91¯ area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (micro-average) for the task of discriminating between five different disease stages or classes. The use of tools available for free ensures the reproducibility of the study and the applicability of the classification system in developing countries.

AB  - Air quality (AQ) in urban areas is deteriorating, thus having negative effects on people’s everyday lives. Official air quality monitoring stations provide the most reliable information, but do not always depict air pollution levels at scales reflecting human activities. They also have a high cost and therefore are limited in number. This issue can be addressed by deploying low cost AQ monitoring devices (LCAQMD), though their measurements are of far lower quality. In this paper we study the correlation of air pollution levels reported by such a device and by a reference station for particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide in Thessaloniki, Greece. On this basis, a corrective factor is modeled via seven machine learning algorithms in order to improve the quality of measurements for the LCAQMD against reference stations, thus leading to its on-field computational improvement. We show that our computational intelligence approach can improve the performance of such a device for PM10 under operational conditions.

AB  - This framework for human behavior monitoring aims to take a holistic approach to study, track, monitor, and analyze human behavior during activities of daily living (ADLs). The framework consists of two novel functionalities. First, it can perform the semantic analysis of user interactions on the diverse contextual parameters during ADLs to identify a list of distinct behavioral patterns associated with different complex activities. Second, it consists of an intelligent decision-making algorithm that can analyze these behavioral patterns and their relationships with the dynamic contextual and spatial features of the environment to detect any anomalies in user behavior that could constitute an emergency. These functionalities of this interdisciplinary framework were developed by integrating the latest advancements and technologies in human–computer interaction, machine learning, Internet of Things, pattern recognition, and ubiquitous computing. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of ADLs, and the performance accuracies of these two functionalities were found to be 76.71% and 83.87%, respectively. The presented and discussed results uphold the relevance and immense potential of this framework to contribute towards improving the quality of life and assisted living of the aging population in the future of Internet of Things (IoT)-based ubiquitous living environments, e.g., smart homes.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Nowcasting is an important technique for weather forecasting because sudden weather changes significantly affect human life. The encoding-forecasting model, which is a state-of-the-art architecture in the field of data-driven radar extrapolation, does not particularly focus on the latest data when forecasting natural phenomena. This paper proposes a weighted broadcasting method that emphasizes the latest data of the time step to improve the nowcasting performance. This weighted broadcasting method allows the most recent rainfall patterns to have a greater impact on the forecasting network by extending the architecture of the existing encoding-forecasting model. Experimental results show that the proposed model is 1.74% and 2.20% better than the existing encoding-forecasting model in terms of mean absolute error and critical success index, respectively. In the case of heavy rainfall with an intensity of 30 mm/h or higher, the proposed model was more than 30% superior to the existing encoding-forecasting model. Therefore, applying the weighted broadcasting method, which explicitly places a high emphasis on the latest information, to the encoding-forecasting model is considered as an improvement that is applicable to the state-of-the-art implementation of data-driven radar-based precipitation nowcasting.

AB  - The utilization of energy is on the rise in current trends due to increasing consumptions by households. Smart buildings, on the other hand, aim to optimize energy, and hence, the aim of the study is to forecast the cost of energy consumption in smart buildings by effectively addressing the minimal energy consumption. However, smart buildings are restricted, with limited power access and capacity associated with Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units. It further suffers from low communication capability due to device limitations. In this paper, a balanced deep learning architecture is used to offer solutions to address these constraints. The deep learning algorithm considers three constraints, such as a multi-objective optimization problem and a fitness function, to resolve the price management problem and high-level energy consumption in HVAC systems. The study analyzes and optimizes the consumption of power in smart buildings by the HVAC systems in terms of power loss, price management and reactive power. Experiments are conducted over various scenarios to check the integrity of the system over various smart buildings and in high-rise buildings. The results are compared in terms of various HVAC devices on various metrics and communication protocols, where the proposed system is considered more effective than other methods. The results of the Li-Fi communication protocols show improved results compared to the other communication protocols.

AB  - Obtaining key and rich visual information under sophisticated road conditions is one of the key requirements for advanced driving assistance. In this paper, a newfangled end-to-end model is proposed for advanced driving assistance based on the fusion of infrared and visible images, termed as FusionADA. In our model, we are committed to extracting and fusing the optimal texture details and salient thermal targets from the source images. To achieve this goal, our model constitutes an adversarial framework between the generator and the discriminator. Specifically, the generator aims to generate a fused image with basic intensity information together with the optimal texture details from source images, while the discriminator aims to force the fused image to restore the salient thermal targets from the source infrared image. In addition, our FusionADA is a fully end-to-end model, solving the issues of manually designing complicated activity level measurements and fusion rules existing in traditional methods. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on publicly available datasets RoadScene and TNO demonstrate the superiority of our FusionADA over the state-of-the-art approaches.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - As one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, it is sensible to analysis historical urban land use characteristics and project the potentials of urban sustainable development for a smart city. The cellular automaton (CA) model is the widely applied in simulating urban growth, but the optimum parameters of variables driving urban growth in the model remains to be continued to improve. We propose a novel model integrating an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) and CA for optimizing parameters of variables in the urban growth model and make a comparison between AFSA-CA and other five models, which is used to study a 40-year urban land growth of Wuhan. We found that the urban growth types from 1995 to 2015 appeared relatively consistent, mainly including infilling, edge-expansion and distant-leap types in Wuhan, which a certain range of urban land growth on the periphery of the central area. Additionally, although the genetic algorithms (GA)-CA model and the AFSA-CA model among the six models due to the distance variables, the parameter value of the GA-CA model is −15.5409 according to the fact that the population (POP) variable should be positively. As a result, the AFSA-CA model regardless of the initial parameter setting is superior to the GA-CA model and the GA-CA model is superior to all the other models. Finally, it is projected that the potentials of urban growth in Wuhan for 2025 and 2035 under three scenarios (natural urban land growth without any restrictions (NULG), sustainable urban land growth with cropland protection and ecological security (SULG), and economic urban land growth with sustainable development and economic development in the core area (EULG)) focus mainly on existing urban land and some new town centers based on AFSA-CA urban growth simulation model. An increasingly precise simulation can determine the potential increase area and quantity of urban land, providing a basis to judge the layout of urban land use for urban planners.

AB  - Recent improvements in the performance of the human face recognition model have led to the development of relevant products and services. However, research in the similar field of animal face identification has remained relatively limited due to the greater diversity and complexity in shape and the lack of relevant data for animal faces such as dogs. In the face identification model using triplet loss, the length of the embedding vector is normalized by adding an L2-normalization (L2-norm) layer for using cosine-similarity-based learning. As a result, object identification depends only on the angle, and the distribution of the embedding vector is limited to the surface of a sphere with a radius of 1. This study proposes training the model from which the L2-norm layer is removed by using the triplet loss to utilize a wide vector space beyond the surface of a sphere with a radius of 1, for which a novel loss function and its two-stage learning method. The proposed method classifies the embedding vector within a space rather than on the surface, and the model’s performance is also increased. The accuracy, one-shot identification performance, and distribution of the embedding vectors are compared between the existing learning method and the proposed learning method for verification. The verification was conducted using an open-set. The resulting accuracy of 97.33% for the proposed learning method is approximately 4% greater than that of the existing learning method.

AB  - The emerging of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0 (I4.0), from the advancement in several technologies is viewed not only to promote economic growth, but also to enable a greener future. The 2030 Agenda of the United Nations for sustainable development sets out clear goals for the industry to foster the economy, while preserving social well-being and ecological validity. However, the influence of I4.0 technologies on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) has not been conclusively or systematically investigated. By understanding the link between the I4.0 technologies and the SDGs, researchers can better support policymakers to consider the technological advancement in updating and harmonizing policies and strategies in different sectors (i.e., education, industry, and governmental) with the SDGs. To address this gap, academic experts in this paper have investigated the influence of I4.0 technologies on the sustainability targets identified by the UN. Key I4.0 element technologies have been classified to enable a quantitative mapping with the 17 SDGs. The results indicate that the majority of the I4.0 technologies can contribute positively to achieving the UN agenda. It was also found that the effects of the technologies on individual goals varies between direct and strong, and indirect and weak influences. The main insights and lessons learned from the mapping are provided to support future policy.

AB  - Air pollution and its consequences are negatively impacting on the world population and the environment, which converts the monitoring and forecasting air quality techniques as essential tools to combat this problem. To predict air quality with maximum accuracy, along with the implemented models and the quantity of the data, it is crucial also to consider the dataset types. This study selected a set of research works in the field of air quality prediction and is concentrated on the exploration of the datasets utilised in them. The most significant findings of this research work are: (1) meteorological datasets were used in 94.6% of the papers leaving behind the rest of the datasets with a big difference, which is complemented with others, such as temporal data, spatial data, and so on; (2) the usage of various datasets combinations has been commenced since 2009; and (3) the utilisation of open data have been started since 2012, 32.3% of the studies used open data, and 63.4% of the studies did not provide the data.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - A reliable prediction of sustainable energy consumption is key for designing environmentally friendly buildings. In this study, three novel hybrid intelligent methods, namely the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), wind-driven optimization (WDO), and biogeography-based optimization (BBO), are employed to optimize the multitarget prediction of heating loads (HLs) and cooling loads (CLs) in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Concerning the optimization of the applied algorithms, a series of swarm-based iterations are performed, and the best structure is proposed for each model. The GOA, WDO, and BBO algorithms are mixed with a class of feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs), which is called a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict the HL and CL. According to the sensitivity analysis, the WDO with swarm size = 500 proposes the most-fitted ANN. The proposed WDO-ANN provided an accurate prediction in terms of heating load (training (R2 correlation = 0.977 and RMSE error = 0.183) and testing (R2 correlation = 0.973 and RMSE error = 0.190)) and yielded the best-fitted prediction in terms of cooling load (training (R2 correlation = 0.99 and RMSE error = 0.147) and testing (R2 correlation = 0.99 and RMSE error = 0.148)).

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - With the limitedness of the sub-6 GHz bandwidth, the world is exploring a thrilling wireless technology known as massive MIMO. This wireless access technology is swiftly becoming key for 5G, B5G, and 6G network deployment. The massive MIMO system brings together antennas at both base stations and the user terminals to provide high spectral service. Despite the fact that massive MIMO offers astronomical benefits such as low latency, high data rate, improved array gain, and far better reliability, it faces several implementation challenges due to the hundreds of antennas at the base station. The signal detection at the base station during the uplink is one of the critical issues in this technology. Detection of user signal becomes computationally complex with a multitude of antennas present in the massive MIMO systems. This paper proposes a novel preconditioned and accelerated Gauss–Siedel algorithm referred to as Symmetric Successive Over-relaxation Preconditioned Gauss-Seidel (SSORGS). The proposed algorithm will address the signal detection challenges associated with massive MIMO technology. Furthermore, we enhance the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm by introducing a novel Symmetric Successive Over-relaxation preconditioner (SSOR) scheme and an initialization scheme based on the instantaneous channel condition between the base station and the user. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm referred to as Symmetric Successive Over-relaxation Preconditioned Gauss-Seidel (SSORGS) provides optimal BER performance. At BER =10−3, over the range of SNR, the SSORGS algorithm performs better than the traditional algorithms. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is computationally more efficient than the traditional algorithms. Furthermore, we designed a comprehensive hardware architecture for the SSORGS algorithm to find the interrelated components necessary to build the actual physical system.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - E-Learning has proven to be the only resort as a replacement of traditional face-to-face learning methods in the current global lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. Academic institutions across the globe have invested heavily into E-Learning and the majority of the courses offered in traditional classroom mode have been converted into E-Learning mode. The success of E-Learning initiatives needs to be ensured to make it a sustainable mode of learning. The objective of the current study is to propose a holistic E-Learning service framework to ensure effective delivery and use of E-Learning Services that contributes to sustainable learning and academic performance. Based on an extensive literature review, a proposed theoretical model has been developed and tested empirically. The model identifies a broad range of success determinants and relates them to different success measures, including learning and academic performance. The proposed model was validated with the response from 397 respondents involved with an E-Learning system in the top five public universities in the southern region of Saudi Arabia through the Partial Least Squares regression technique using SmartPLS software. Five main factors (Learner’s Quality, Instructor’s Quality, Information’s Quality, System’s Quality and Institutional Quality) were identified as a determinant of E-Learning service performance which together explains 48.7% of the variance of perceived usefulness of ELS, 71.2% of the variance of use of the E-Learning system. Perceived usefulness of ELS and use of ELS together explain 70.6% of learning and academic performance of students. Hence the framework will help achieve the sustainable and successful adoption of E-Learning services.

AB  - Rapid developments in urbanization and smart city environments have accelerated the need to deliver safe, sustainable, and effective resource utilization and service provision and have thereby enhanced the need for intelligent, real-time video surveillance. Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have the capability to detect and localize salient objects in surveillance video streams; however, several practical issues remain unaddressed, such as diverse weather conditions, recording conditions, and motion blur. In this context, image de-raining is an important issue that has been investigated extensively in recent years to provide accurate and quality surveillance in the smart city domain. Existing deep convolutional neural networks have obtained great success in image translation and other computer vision tasks; however, image de-raining is ill posed and has not been addressed in real-time, intelligent video surveillance systems. In this work, we propose to utilize the generative capabilities of recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) as an image de-raining approach. We utilize the adversarial loss in GANs that provides an additional component to the loss function, which in turn regulates the final output and helps to yield better results. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that the proposed method outperforms most of the existing state-of-the-art models in terms of quantitative evaluations and visual appearance.

AB  - Pavement markings are used to convey positioning information to both humans and automated driving systems. As automated driving is increasingly being adopted to support safety, it is important to understand how successfully sensor systems can interpret these markings. In this effort, an in-vehicle lane departure warning system was compared to data collected simultaneously from an externally mounted mobile retroreflectometer. The test, performed over 200 km of driving on three different routes in variable lighting conditions and road classes found that, depending on conditions, the retroreflectometer could predict whether the car’s lane departure systems would detect markings in 92% to 98% of cases. The test demonstrated that automated driving systems can be used to monitor the state of pavement markings and can provide input on how to design and maintain road infrastructure to support automated driving features. Since data about the condition of lane marking from multiple lane departure warning systems (crowd-sourced data) can provide input into the pavement marking management systems operated by many road owners, these findings also indicate that these automated driving sensors have an important role in enhancing the maintenance of pavement markings.

AB  - The main aim of this empirical research was to classify the profiles of executives of Spanish companies. We classified the executives’ profiles based on two key factors of innovation: knowledge management and emotional intelligence. The sample comprised study 241 executives of Spanish companies, a principal component analysis, a two-stage cluster analysis, and an ANOVA analysis conducted by taking innovation as a dependent variable. The theory of resources and capacities was the theoretical framework. We conclude that the differentiation of executives’ profiles is essential to avoid the loss of innovative potential and a consequent loss of competitive advantage in the Spanish business sector. This research contributes to identify a taxonomy of executives’ profiles—agile, laggard, soloist and cooperator. These groups present some different levels of knowledge management and emotional intelligence and differences in their ability to innovate.

AB  - This study aims to produce accurate predictions of the NO2 concentrations at a specific station of a monitoring network located in the Bay of Algeciras (Spain). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and sequence-to-sequence long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) were used to create the forecasting models. Additionally, a new prediction method was proposed combining LSTMs using a rolling window scheme with a cross-validation procedure for time series (LSTM-CVT). Two different strategies were followed regarding the input variables: using NO2 from the station or employing NO2 and other pollutants data from any station of the network plus meteorological variables. The ANN and LSTM-CVT exogenous models used lagged datasets of different window sizes. Several feature ranking methods were used to select the top lagged variables and include them in the final exogenous datasets. Prediction horizons of t + 1, t + 4 and t + 8 were employed. The exogenous variables inclusion enhanced the model’s performance, especially for t + 4 (ρ ≈ 0.68 to ρ ≈ 0.74) and t + 8 (ρ ≈ 0.59 to ρ ≈ 0.66). The proposed LSTM-CVT method delivered promising results as the best performing models per prediction horizon employed this new methodology. Additionally, per each parameter combination, it obtained lower error values than ANNs in 85% of the cases.

AB  - The escalated growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has started to reform and reshape our lives. The deployment of a large number of objects adhered to the internet has unlocked the vision of the smart world around us, thereby paving a road towards automation and humongous data generation and collection. This automation and continuous explosion of personal and professional information to the digital world provides a potent ground to the adversaries to perform numerous cyber-attacks, thus making security in IoT a sizeable concern. Hence, timely detection and prevention of such threats are pre-requisites to prevent serious consequences. The survey conducted provides a brief insight into the technology with prime attention towards the various attacks and anomalies and their detection based on the intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS). The comprehensive look-over presented in this paper provides an in-depth analysis and assessment of diverse machine learning and deep learning-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS).

AB  - Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) displays high-quality connectivity underpinned by fifth-generation (5G) networks to cover a wide array of IoT applications. The devices’ development and integration into different smart systems require permanent control, supervision, and the study of power consumption models to determine the performance of the network topology and allow for the measurement of the efficiency of the network topology’s application. This paper reports on an architecture and open-sourced simulation that was developed to study NB-IoT in Device-to-Device (D2D) mode, which includes the Physical (PHY), network, and application layers, as well as a queuing model, the model for uplink and downlink delays, the throughput, the overall NB-IoT D2D network performance, and the energy consumption based on the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol. Our results prove that the suggested framework contributes to a reduction in power consumption, a minimization of queuing delays, a decrease in communication cost, a reduction in inter-cluster collisions, and the prevention of attacks from malicious nodes. Consequently, the framework manages the battery’s State of Charge (SOC), improves the battery’s State of Health (SOH), and maximizes the whole network lifetime. The proposed framework, the code of which has been open-sourced, can be effectively used for scientific research and development purposes to evaluate different parameters and improve the planning of NB-IoT networks.

AB  - The literature discussing the concepts, technologies, and ICT-based urban innovation approaches of smart cities has been growing, along with initiatives from cities all over the world that are competing to improve their services and become smart and sustainable. However, current studies that provide a comprehensive understanding and reveal smart and sustainable city research trends and characteristics are still lacking. Meanwhile, policymakers and practitioners alike need to pursue progressive development. In response to this shortcoming, this research offers content analysis studies based on topic modeling approaches to capture the evolution and characteristics of topics in the scientific literature on smart and sustainable city research. More importantly, a novel topic-detecting algorithm based on the deep learning and clustering techniques, namely deep autoencoders-based fuzzy C-means (DFCM), is introduced for analyzing the research topic trend. The topics generated by this proposed algorithm have relatively higher coherence values than those generated by previously used topic detection methods, namely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and eigenspace-based fuzzy C-means (EFCM). The 30 main topics that appeared in topic modeling with the DFCM algorithm were classified into six groups (technology, energy, environment, transportation, e-governance, and human capital and welfare) that characterize the six dimensions of smart, sustainable city research.

AB  - In today’s Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment, where different systems interact with the physical world, the state proposed by the Industry 4.0 standards can lead to escalating vulnerabilities, especially when these systems receive data streams from multiple intermediaries, requiring multilevel security approaches, in addition to link encryption. At the same time taking into account the heterogeneity of the systems included in the IIoT ecosystem and the non-institutionalized interoperability in terms of hardware and software, serious issues arise as to how to secure these systems. In this framework, given that the protection of industrial equipment is a requirement inextricably linked to technological developments and the use of the IoT, it is important to identify the major vulnerabilities and the associated risks and threats and to suggest the most appropriate countermeasures. In this context, this study provides a description of the attacks against IIoT systems, as well as a thorough analysis of the solutions for these attacks, as they have been proposed in the most recent literature.

AB  - This work makes multiple scientific contributions to the field of Indoor Localization for Ambient Assisted Living in Smart Homes. First, it presents a Big-Data driven methodology that studies the multimodal components of user interactions and analyzes the data from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and BLE scanners to detect a user’s indoor location in a specific ‘activity-based zone’ during Activities of Daily Living. Second, it introduces a context independent approach that can interpret the accelerometer and gyroscope data from diverse behavioral patterns to detect the ‘zone-based’ indoor location of a user in any Internet of Things (IoT)-based environment. These two approaches achieved performance accuracies of 81.36% and 81.13%, respectively, when tested on a dataset. Third, it presents a methodology to detect the spatial coordinates of a user’s indoor position that outperforms all similar works in this field, as per the associated root mean squared error—one of the performance evaluation metrics in ISO/IEC18305:2016—an international standard for testing Localization and Tracking Systems. Finally, it presents a comprehensive comparative study that includes Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, k-NN, Gradient Boosted Trees, Deep Learning, and Linear Regression, to address the challenge of identifying the optimal machine learning approach for Indoor Localization.

AB  - As energy distribution systems evolve from a traditional hierarchical load structure towards distributed smart grids, flexibility is increasingly investigated as both a key measure and core challenge of grid balancing. This paper contributes to the theoretical framework for quantifying network flexibility potential by introducing a machine learning based node characterization. In particular, artificial neural networks are considered for classification of historic demand data from several network substations. Performance of the resulting classifiers is evaluated with respect to clustering analysis and parameter space of the models considered, while the bootstrapping based statistical evaluation is reported in terms of mean confusion matrices. The resulting meta-models of individual nodes can be further utilized on a network level to mitigate the difficulties associated with identifying, implementing and actuating many small sources of energy flexibility, compared to the few large ones traditionally acknowledged.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Diverse computer-aided diagnosis systems based on convolutional neural networks were applied to automate the detection of myocardial infarction (MI) found in electrocardiogram (ECG) for early diagnosis and prevention. However, issues, particularly overfitting and underfitting, were not being taken into account. In other words, it is unclear whether the network structure is too simple or complex. Toward this end, the proposed models were developed by starting with the simplest structure: a multi-lead features-concatenate narrow network (N-Net) in which only two convolutional layers were included in each lead branch. Additionally, multi-scale features-concatenate networks (MSN-Net) were also implemented where larger features were being extracted through pooling the signals. The best structure was obtained via tuning both the number of filters in the convolutional layers and the number of inputting signal scales. As a result, the N-Net reached a 95.76% accuracy in the MI detection task, whereas the MSN-Net reached an accuracy of 61.82% in the MI locating task. Both networks give a higher average accuracy and a significant difference of p &lt; 0.001 evaluated by the U test compared with the state-of-the-art. The models are also smaller in size thus are suitable to fit in wearable devices for offline monitoring. In conclusion, testing throughout the simple and complex network structure is indispensable. However, the way of dealing with the class imbalance problem and the quality of the extracted features are yet to be discussed.

AB  - In this paper, we address the application of the flying Drone Base Stations (DBS) in order to improve the network performance. Given the high degrees of freedom of a DBS, it can change its position and adapt its trajectory according to the users movements and the target environment. A two-hop communication model, between an end-user and a macrocell through a DBS, is studied in this work. We propose Q-learning and Deep Q-learning based solutions to optimize the drone’s trajectory. Simulation results show that, by employing our proposed models, the drone can autonomously fly and adapts its mobility according to the users’ movements. Additionally, the Deep Q-learning model outperforms the Q-learning model and can be applied in more complex environments.

AB  - Cybersecurity in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has become critical as smart cities are becoming increasingly linked to industrial control systems (ICSs) used in critical infrastructure. Consequently, data-driven security systems for analyzing massive amounts of data generated by smart cities have become essential. A representative method for analyzing large-scale data is the game bot detection approach used in massively multiplayer online role-playing games. We reviewed the literature on bot detection methods to extend the anomaly detection approaches used in bot detection schemes to IIoT fields. Finally, we proposed a process wherein the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model was applied to identify features for efficiently detecting anomalous behavior in smart cities. Experimental results using random forest show that our extracted features based on a game bot can achieve an average F1-score of 0.99903 using 10-fold validation. We confirmed the applicability of the analyzed game-industry methodology to other fields and trained a random forest on the high-efficiency features identified by applying a DEA, obtaining an F1-score of 0.997 using the validation set approach. In this study, an anomaly detection method for analyzing massive smart city data based on a game industry methodology was presented and applied to the ICS dataset.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Indoor navigation has attracted commercial developers and researchers in the last few decades. The development of localization tools, methods and frameworks enables current communication services and applications to be optimized by incorporating location data. For clinical applications such as workflow analysis, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons have been employed to map the positions of individuals in indoor environments. To map locations, certain existing methods use the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Devices need to be configured to allow for dynamic interference patterns when using the RSSI sensors to monitor indoor positions. In this paper, our objective is to explore an alternative method for monitoring a moving user’s indoor position using BLE sensors in complex indoor building environments. We developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based positioning model based on the 2D image composed of the received number of signals indicator from both x and y-axes. In this way, like a pixel, we interact with each 10 × 10 matrix holding the spatial information of coordinates and suggest the possible shift of a sensor, adding a sensor and removing a sensor. To develop CNN we adopted a neuro-evolution approach to optimize and create several layers in the network dynamically, through enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). For the optimization of CNN, the global best solution obtained by PSO is directly given to the weights of each layer of CNN. In addition, we employed dynamic inertia weights in the PSO, instead of a constant inertia weight, to maintain the CNN layers’ length corresponding to the RSSI signals from BLE sensors. Experiments were conducted in a building environment where thirteen beacon devices had been installed in different locations to record coordinates. For evaluation comparison, we further adopted machine learning and deep learning algorithms for predicting a user’s location in an indoor environment. The experimental results indicate that the proposed optimized CNN-based method shows high accuracy (97.92% with 2.8% error) for tracking a moving user’s locations in a complex building without complex calibration as compared to other recent methods.

TI  - Cyber-Attack Detection in Water Distribution Systems Based on Blind Sources Separation Technique

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 6
SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Service quality and efficiency of urban systems have been dramatically boosted by various high technologies for real-time monitoring and remote control, and have also gained privileged space in water distribution. Monitored hydraulic and quality parameters are crucial data for developing planning, operation and security analyses in water networks, which makes them increasingly reliable. However, devices for monitoring and remote control also increase the possibilities for failure and cyber-attacks in the systems, which can severely impair the system operation and, in extreme cases, collapse the service. This paper proposes an automatic two-step methodology for cyber-attack detection in water distribution systems. The first step is based on signal-processing theory, and applies a fast Independent Component Analysis (fastICA) algorithm to hydraulic time series (e.g., pressure, flow, and tank level), which separates them into independent components. These components are then processed by a statistical control algorithm for automatic detection of abrupt changes, from which attacks may be disclosed. The methodology is applied to the case study provided by the Battle of Attack Detection Algorithms (BATADAL) and the results are compared with seven other approaches, showing excellent results, which makes this methodology a reliable early-warning cyber-attack detection approach.

AB  - Real-world data streams pose a unique challenge to the implementation of machine learning (ML) models and data analysis. A notable problem that has been introduced by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments across the smart city ecosystem is that the statistical properties of data streams can change over time, resulting in poor prediction performance and ineffective decisions. While concept drift detection methods aim to patch this problem, emerging communication and sensing technologies are generating a massive amount of data, requiring distributed environments to perform computation tasks across smart city administrative domains. In this article, we implement and test a number of state-of-the-art active concept drift detection algorithms for time series analysis within a distributed environment. We use real-world data streams and provide critical analysis of results retrieved. The challenges of implementing concept drift adaptation algorithms, along with their applications in smart cities, are also discussed.

AB  - The integration of multi-source transportation data is complex and insufficient in most of the big cities, which made it difficult for researchers to conduct in-depth data mining to improve the policy or the management. In order to solve this problem, a top-down approach is used to construct a knowledge graph of urban traffic system in this paper. First, the model layer of the knowledge graph was used to realize the reuse and sharing of knowledge. Furthermore, the model layer then was stored in the graph database Neo4j. Second, the representation learning based knowledge reasoning model was adopted to implement knowledge completion and improve the knowledge graph. Finally, the proposed method was validated with an urban traffic data set and the results showed that the model could be used to mine the implicit relationship between traffic entities and discover traffic knowledge effectively.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - With the drastically increasing traffic in the last decades, crucial environmental problems have been caused, such as greenhouse gas emission and traffic noise pollution. These problems have adversely affected our life quality and health conditions. In this paper, modelling of traffic noise employing deep learning is investigated. The goal is to identify the best machine-learning model for predicting traffic noise from real-life traffic data with multivariate traffic features as input. An extensive study on recurrent neural network (RNN) is performed in this work for modelling time series traffic data, which was collected through an experimental campaign at an inner city roundabout, including both video traffic data and audio data. The preprocessing of the data, namely how to generate the appropriate input and output for deep learning model, is detailed in this paper. A selection of different architectures of RNN, such as many-to-one, many-to-many, encoder–decoder architectures, was investigated. Moreover, gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were further discussed. The results revealed that a multivariate bi-directional GRU model with many-to-many architecture achieved the best performance with both high accuracy and computation efficiency. The trained model could be promising for a future smart city concept; with the proposed model, real-time traffic noise predictions can be potentially feasible using only traffic data collected by different sensors in the city, thanks to the generated big data by smart cities. The forecast of excessive noise exposure can help the regulation and policy makers to make early decisions, in order to mitigate the noise level.

AB  - Human activities significantly contribute to worldwide spread of phytopathological adversities. Pathogen-related food losses are today responsible for a reduction in quantity and quality of yield and decrease value and financial returns. As a result, “early detection” in combination with “fast, accurate, and cheap” diagnostics have also become the new mantra in plant pathology, especially for emerging diseases or challenging pathogens that spread thanks to asymptomatic individuals with subtle initial symptoms but are then difficult to face. Furthermore, in a globalized market sensitive to epidemics, innovative tools suitable for field-use represent the new frontier with respect to diagnostic laboratories, ensuring that the instruments and techniques used are suitable for the operational contexts. In this framework, portable systems and interconnection with Internet of Things (IoT) play a pivotal role. Here we review innovative diagnostic methods based on nanotechnologies and new perspectives concerning information and communication technology (ICT) in agriculture, resulting in an improvement in agricultural and rural development and in the ability to revolutionize the concept of “preventive actions”, making the difference in fighting against phytopathogens, all over the world.

AB  - The increasing population across the globe makes it essential to link smart and sustainable city planning with the logistics of transporting people and goods, which will significantly contribute to how societies will face mobility in the coming years. The concept of smart mobility emerged with the popularity of smart cities and is aligned with the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations. A reduction in traffic congestion and new route optimizations with reduced ecological footprint are some of the essential factors of smart mobility; however, other aspects must also be taken into account, such as the promotion of active mobility and inclusive mobility, encouraging the use of other types of environmentally friendly fuels and engagement with citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Big Data technology will serve as the main entry points and fundamental pillars to promote the rise of new innovative solutions that will change the current paradigm for cities and their citizens. Mobility-as-a-service, traffic flow optimization, the optimization of logistics and autonomous vehicles are some of the services and applications that will encompass several changes in the coming years with the transition of existing cities into smart cities. This paper provides an extensive review of the current trends and solutions presented in the scope of smart mobility and enabling technologies that support it. An overview of how smart mobility fits into smart cities is provided by characterizing its main attributes and the key benefits of using smart mobility in a smart city ecosystem. Further, this paper highlights other various opportunities and challenges related to smart mobility. Lastly, the major services and applications that are expected to arise in the coming years within smart mobility are explored with the prospective future trends and scope.

AB  - This paper summarises a literature review on the applications of Internet of Things (IoT) with the aim of enhancing building energy use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). A detailed assessment of contemporary practical reviews and works was conducted to understand how different IoT systems and technologies are being developed to increase energy efficiencies in both residential and commercial buildings. Most of the reviewed works were invariably related to the dilemma of efficient heating systems in buildings. Several features of the central components of IoT, namely, the hardware and software needed for building controls, are analysed. Common design factors across the many IoT systems comprise the selection of sensors and actuators and their powering techniques, control strategies for collecting information and activating appliances, monitoring of actual data to forecast prospect energy consumption and communication methods amongst IoT components. Some building energy applications using IoT are provided. It was found that each application presented has the potential for significant energy reduction and user comfort improvement. This is confirmed in two case studies summarised, which report the energy savings resulting from implementing IoT systems. Results revealed that a few elements are user-specific that need to be considered in the decision processes. Last, based on the studies reviewed, a few aspects of prospective research were recommended.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 6
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are expected to create enormous benefits to society, but there are safety concerns in recognizing faults at the vehicle’s control component. Prior studies proposed various fault detection approaches leveraging heuristics-based rules and supervised learning-based models, but there were several drawbacks. The rule-based approaches required an engineer to update the rules on every type of fault, and the supervised learning-based approaches necessitated the acquisition of a finely-labeled training dataset. Moreover, both prior approaches commonly include a limit that the detection model can identify the trained type of faults only, but fail to recognize the unseen type of faults. In pursuit of resolving the aforementioned drawbacks, we proposed a fault detection model utilizing a stacked autoencoder that lies under unsupervised learning. The autoencoder was trained with data from safe UAV states, and its reconstruction loss was examined to distinguish the safe states and faulty states. The key contributions of our study are, as follows. First, we presented a series of analyses to extract essential features from raw UAV flight logs. Second, we designed a fault detection model consisting of the stacked autoencoder and the classifier. Lastly, we validated our approach’s fault detection performance with two datasets consisting of different types of UAV faults.

AB  - The growing application of smart manufacturing systems and the expansion of the Industry 4.0 model have created a need for new teaching platforms for education, rapid application development, and testing. This research addresses this need with a proposal for a model of working environment monitoring in smart manufacturing, based on emerging wireless sensor technologies and the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. In accordance with the proposed model, a testing platform was developed. The testing platform was built on open-source hardware and software components. The testing platform was used for the validation of the model within the presented experimental environment. The results showed that the proposed model could be developed by mainly using open-source components, which can then be used to simulate different scenarios, applications, and target systems. Furthermore, the presented stable and functional platform proved to be applicable in the process of rapid prototyping, and software development for the targeted systems, as well as for student teaching as part of the engineering education process.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles are increasingly becoming a necessary trend towards building the smart cities of the future. Numerous proposals have been presented in recent years to tackle particular aspects of the working pipeline towards creating a functional end-to-end system, such as object detection, tracking, path planning, sentiment or intent detection, amongst others. Nevertheless, few efforts have been made to systematically compile all of these systems into a single proposal that also considers the real challenges these systems will have on the road, such as real-time computation, hardware capabilities, etc. This paper reviews the latest techniques towards creating our own end-to-end autonomous vehicle system, considering the state-of-the-art methods on object detection, and the possible incorporation of distributed systems and parallelization to deploy these methods. Our findings show that while techniques such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory can effectively handle the initial detection and path planning tasks, more efforts are required to implement cloud computing to reduce the computational time that these methods demand. Additionally, we have mapped different strategies to handle the parallelization task, both within and between the networks.

AB  - Smart Parking is essential for any future smart cities due to the tremendous growth of the car fleet. Such infrastructures require a certain amount of equipment. Indeed, smart parking integrates a lot of actors, to manage the parking its equipment must be managed accordingly. Here, is proposed a distributed architecture to manage them by collecting efficiently their data. Two types of data relating to the parking must be collected: those coming from the deployed equipment in the parking and those coming from the internet due to remote users. Thus, a system of two main servers based on the multi-agent concept is proposed. This system manages the parking platform. The first server is dedicated to the parking equipment data collection (Processing Server–PS). The second server (Processing Web Server–PWS) collects the users’ online data such as reservation, and it is responsible for pricing policies, and receive post-processed data from the Processing Server. The parking equipment integrates a lot of commercial solutions, an intelligent multi-platform application based on this two server philosophy is developed and can be used for parking operation by users and parking managers. The flowcharts of the agents from the two mains servers are presented. These flowcharts are currently used in our demonstrator and still under improvements. Here, we present the architecture (hardware and software) of our smart parking demonstrator developed by our department and suitable for the experimentation of our future work related to this hot topic.

The experimental analysis tests the effectiveness of DNN-IoT-BA in various machine or deep learning algorithms in VANETs. DNN-IoT-BA is validated through various network metrics, like packet delivery ratio, latency and packet error rate. The simulation results show that the proposed method provides lower energy consumption and latency than conventional methods to support real-time traffic conditions.

AB  - Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) provide safer, greener, and more convenient mobility, while reducing the impact on the environment. In recent years, simulation platforms have been employed to study ITS applications, mostly focusing on traffic-related simulations. Despite several research studies on ITS applications and simulation platforms, formal semantic descriptions of intelligent transportation systems have not been addressed yet. In this paper, a semantic model describing intelligent transportation systems for roads is proposed. The semantic model is devised to provide a basis for designing ITS simulation platforms. Building upon the semantic model, an extension to an open building information modeling (BIM) standard, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema, is presented. The IFC schema extension is verified and validated using a BIM-based simulation scenario of ITS for roads. It is shown that the proposed IFC-compliant description of ITS for roads provides a formal basis for generating BIM-based simulations and hence facilitates ITS infrastructure modeling in BIM projects. It is concluded that the present work represents a cornerstone for designing BIM-based ITS simulation platforms. In future endeavors, potential standardization and formalization efforts may be discussed.

AB  - Visible Light Communication (VLC) has been emerging as a promising technology to address the increasingly high data-rate and time-critical demands that the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G paradigms impose on the underlying Wireless Sensor Actuator Networking (WSAN) technologies. In this line, the IEEE 802.15.7 standard proposes several physical layers and Medium Access Control (MAC) sub-layer mechanisms that support a variety of VLC applications. Particularly, at the MAC sub-layer, it can support contention-free communications using Guaranteed Timeslots (GTS), introducing support for time-critical applications. However, to effectively guarantee accurate usage of such functionalities, it is vital to derive the worst-case bounds of the network. In this paper, we use network calculus to carry out the worst-case bounds analysis for GTS utilization of IEEE 802.15.7 and complement our model with an in-depth performance analysis. We also propose the inclusion of an additional mechanism to improve the overall scalability and effective bandwidth utilization of the network.

AB  - COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has a case-fatality rate of 2–3%, with higher rates among elderly patients and patients with comorbidities. Radiologically, COVID-19 is characterised by multifocal ground-glass opacities, even for patients with mild disease. Clinically, patients with COVID-19 present respiratory symptoms, which are very similar to other respiratory virus infections. Our knowledge regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still very limited. These facts make it vitally important to establish mechanisms that allow to model and predict the evolution of the virus and to analyze the spread of cases under different circumstances. The objective of this article is to present a model developed for the evolution of COVID in the city of Manizales, capital of the Department of Caldas, Colombia, focusing on the methodology used to allow its application to other cases, as well as on the monitoring tools developed for this purpose. This methodology is based on a hybrid model which combines the population dynamics of the SIR model of differential equations with extrapolations based on recurrent neural networks. This combination provides self-explanatory results in terms of a coefficient that fluctuates with the restraint measures, which may be further refined by expert rules that capture the expected changes in such measures.

SN  - 2075-4418

AB  - Chronic diseases are becoming more widespread. Treatment and monitoring of these diseases require going to hospitals frequently, which increases the burdens of hospitals and patients. Presently, advancements in wearable sensors and communication protocol contribute to enriching the healthcare system in a way that will reshape healthcare services shortly. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is the foremost of these advancements. RPM systems are based on the collection of patient vital signs extracted using invasive and noninvasive techniques, then sending them in real-time to physicians. These data may help physicians in taking the right decision at the right time. The main objective of this paper is to outline research directions on remote patient monitoring, explain the role of AI in building RPM systems, make an overview of the state of the art of RPM, its advantages, its challenges, and its probable future directions. For studying the literature, five databases have been chosen (i.e., science direct, IEEE-Explore, Springer, PubMed, and science.gov). We followed the (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) PRISMA, which is a standard methodology for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A total of 56 articles are reviewed based on the combination of a set of selected search terms including RPM, data mining, clinical decision support system, electronic health record, cloud computing, internet of things, and wireless body area network. The result of this study approved the effectiveness of RPM in improving healthcare delivery, increase diagnosis speed, and reduce costs. To this end, we also present the chronic disease monitoring system as a case study to provide enhanced solutions for RPMs.

AB  - Movement analytics and mobility insights play a crucial role in urban planning and transportation management. The plethora of mobility data sources, such as GPS trajectories, poses new challenges and opportunities for understanding and predicting movement patterns. In this study, we predict highway speed using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network. Based on statistical models, previous approaches suffer from the inherited features of traffic data, such as nonlinear problems. The proposed method predicts highway speed based on the GRU method after training on digital tachograph data (DTG). The DTG data were recorded in one month, giving approximately 300 million records. These data included the velocity and locations of vehicles on the highway. Experimental results demonstrate that the GRU-based deep learning approach outperformed the state-of-the-art alternatives, the autoregressive integrated moving average model, and the long short-term neural network (LSTM) model, in terms of prediction accuracy. Further, the computational cost of the GRU model was lower than that of the LSTM. The proposed method can be applied to traffic prediction and intelligent transportation systems.

TI  - iResponse: An AI and IoT-Enabled Framework for Autonomous COVID-19 Pandemic Management
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 7
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, a tiny virus, is severely affecting the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of our planet, causing infections and deaths (2,674,151 deaths, as of 17 March 2021), relationship breakdowns, depression, economic downturn, riots, and much more. The lessons that have been learned from good practices by various countries include containing the virus rapidly; enforcing containment measures; growing COVID-19 testing capability; discovering cures; providing stimulus packages to the affected; easing monetary policies; developing new pandemic-related industries; support plans for controlling unemployment; and overcoming inequalities. Coordination and multi-term planning have been found to be the key among the successful national and global endeavors to fight the pandemic. The current research and practice have mainly focused on specific aspects of COVID-19 response. There is a need to automate the learning process such that we can learn from good and bad practices during pandemics and normal times. To this end, this paper proposes a technology-driven framework, iResponse, for coordinated and autonomous pandemic management, allowing pandemic-related monitoring and policy enforcement, resource planning and provisioning, and data-driven planning and decision-making. The framework consists of five modules: Monitoring and Break-the-Chain, Cure Development and Treatment, Resource Planner, Data Analytics and Decision Making, and Data Storage and Management. All modules collaborate dynamically to make coordinated and informed decisions. We provide the technical system architecture of a system based on the proposed iResponse framework along with the design details of each of its five components. The challenges related to the design of the individual modules and the whole system are discussed. We provide six case studies in the paper to elaborate on the different functionalities of the iResponse framework and how the framework can be implemented. These include a sentiment analysis case study, a case study on the recognition of human activities, and four case studies using deep learning and other data-driven methods to show how to develop sustainability-related optimal strategies for pandemic management using seven real-world datasets. A number of important findings are extracted from these case studies.

AB  - Digitisation of the built environment is seen as a significant factor for innovation in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation sector. However, lack of data and information in as-built digital models considerably limits the potential of Building Information Modelling in Facility Management. Therefore, optimisation of data collection and management is needed, all the more so now that Industry 4.0 has widened the use of sensors into buildings and infrastructures. A literature review on the two main pillars of digitalisation in construction, Building Information Modelling and Internet of Things, is presented, along with a bibliographic analysis of two citations and abstracts databases focusing on the operations stage. The bibliographic research has been carried out using Web of Science and Scopus databases. The article is aimed at providing a detailed analysis of BIM–IoT integration for Facility Management (FM) process improvements. Issues, opportunities and areas where further research efforts are required are outlined. Finally, four key areas of further research development in FM management have been proposed, focusing on optimising data collection and management.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - With continuous improvement of earth observation technology, source, and volume of remote sensing data are gradually enriched. It is critical to realize unified organization and to form data sharing service capabilities for massive remote sensing data effectively. We design a hierarchical multi-dimensional hybrid indexing model (HMDH), to address the problems in underlying organization and management, and improve query efficiency. Firstly, we establish remote sensing data grid as the smallest unit carrying and processing spatio-temporal information. We implement the construction of the HMDH in two steps, data classification based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, and classification optimization based on recursive neighborhood search algorithm. Then, we construct a hierarchical “cube” structure, filled with continuous space filling curves, to complete the coding of the HMDH. The HMDH reduces the amount of data to 6–17% and improves the accuracy to more than eight times than traditional grid model. Moreover, it can reduce the query time to 25% in some query scenarios than algorithms selected as the baseline in this paper. The HMDH model proposed can be used to solve the efficiency problems of fast and joint retrieval of remote sensing data. It extends the pattens of data sharing service and has a high application value.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in companies is advancing rapidly. Consequently, multidisciplinary research on AI in business has developed dramatically during the last decade, moving from the focus on technological objectives towards an interest in human users’ perspective. In this article, we investigate the notion of employees’ trust in AI at the workplace (in the company), following a human-centered approach that considers AI integration in business from the employees’ perspective, taking into account the elements that facilitate human trust in AI. While employees’ trust in AI at the workplace seems critical, so far, few studies have systematically investigated its determinants. Therefore, this study is an attempt to fill the existing research gap. The research objective of the article is to examine links between employees’ trust in AI in the company and three other latent variables (general trust in technology, intra-organizational trust, and individual competence trust). A quantitative study conducted on a sample of 428 employees from companies of the energy and chemical industries in Poland allowed the hypotheses to be verified. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate the existence of a positive relationship between general trust in technology and employees’ trust in AI in the company as well as between intra-organizational trust and employees’ trust in AI in the company in the surveyed firms.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Over the past few decades, AI has been widely used in the field of education. However, very little attention has been paid to the use of AI for enhancing the quality of cross-domain learning. College/university students are often interested in different domains of knowledge but may be unaware of how to choose relevant cross-domain courses. Therefore, this paper presents a personality-driven recommender system that suggests cross-domain courses and related jobs by computing personality similarities and probable course grades. In this study, 710 students from 12 departments in a Taiwanese university conducted Holland code assessments. Based on the assessments, a comprehensive empirical study, including objective and subjective evaluations, was performed. The results reveal that (1) the recommender system shows very promising performances in predicting course grades (objective evaluations), (2) most of the student testers had encountered difficulties in selecting cross-domain courses and needed the further support of a recommender system, and (3) most of the student testers positively rated the proposed system (subjective evaluations). In summary, Holland code assessments are useful for connecting personalities, interests and learning styles, and the proposed system provides helpful information that supports good decision-making when choosing cross-domain courses.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 7
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Due to its pervasive nature, the Internet of Things (IoT) is demanding for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) since wirelessly connected devices need battery-efficient and long-range communications. Due to its low-cost and high availability (regional/city level scale), this type of network has been widely used in several IoT applications, such as Smart Metering, Smart Grids, Smart Buildings, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), SCADA Systems. By using LPWAN technologies, the IoT devices are less dependent on common and existing infrastructure, can operate using small, inexpensive, and long-lasting batteries (up to 10 years), and can be easily deployed within wide areas, typically above 2 km in urban zones. The starting point of this work was an overview of the security vulnerabilities that exist in LPWANs, followed by a literature review with the main goal of substantiating an attack vector analysis specifically designed for the IoT ecosystem. This methodological approach resulted in three main contributions: (i) a systematic review regarding cybersecurity in LPWANs with a focus on vulnerabilities, threats, and typical defense strategies; (ii) a state-of-the-art review on the most prominent results that have been found in the systematic review, with focus on the last three years; (iii) a security analysis on the recent attack vectors regarding IoT applications using LPWANs. Results have shown that LPWANs communication technologies contain security vulnerabilities that can lead to irreversible harm in critical and non-critical IoT application domains. Also, the conception and implementation of up-to-date defenses are relevant to protect systems, networks, and data.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 7
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications are becoming popular among many users nowadays, as it makes their life easier. Because of its popularity, attacks that target these devices have increased dramatically, which might cause the entire system to be unavailable. Some of these attacks are denial of service attack, sybil attack, man in the middle attack, and replay attack. Therefore, as the attacks have increased, the detection solutions to detect malware in the IoT have also increased. Most of the current solutions often have very serious limitations, and malware is becoming more apt in taking advantage of them. Therefore, it is important to develop a tool to overcome the existing limitations of current detection systems. This paper presents CoLL-IoT, a CoLLaborative intruder detection system that detects malicious activities in IoT devices. CoLL-IoT consists of the following four main layers: IoT layer, network layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. All of the layers work collaboratively by monitoring and analyzing all of the network traffic generated and received by IoT devices. CoLL-IoT brings the detection system close to the IoT devices by taking the advantage of edge computing and fog computing paradigms. The proposed system was evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset that has more than 175,000 records and achieved an accuracy of up to 98% with low type II error rate of 0.01. The evaluation results showed that CoLL-IoT outperformed the other existing tools, such as Dendron, which was also evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 7
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In unmanned aerial vehicle based urban observation and monitoring, the performance of computer vision algorithms is inevitably limited by the low illumination and light pollution caused degradation, therefore, the application image enhancement is a considerable prerequisite for the performance of subsequent image processing algorithms. Therefore, we proposed a deep learning and generative adversarial network based model for UAV low illumination image enhancement, named LighterGAN. The design of LighterGAN refers to the CycleGAN model with two improvements—attention mechanism and semantic consistency loss—having been proposed to the original structure. Additionally, an unpaired dataset that was captured by urban UAV aerial photography has been used to train this unsupervised learning model. Furthermore, in order to explore the advantages of the improvements, both the performance in the illumination enhancement task and the generalization ability improvement of LighterGAN were proven in the comparative experiments combining subjective and objective evaluations. In the experiments with five cutting edge image enhancement algorithms, in the test set, LighterGAN achieved the best results in both visual perception and PIQE (perception based image quality evaluator, a MATLAB build-in function, the lower the score, the higher the image quality) score of enhanced images, scores were 4.91 and 11.75 respectively, better than EnlightenGAN the state-of-the-art. In the enhancement of low illumination sub-dataset Y (containing 2000 images), LighterGAN also achieved the lowest PIQE score of 12.37, 2.85 points lower than second place. Moreover, compared with the CycleGAN, the improvement of generalization ability was also demonstrated. In the test set generated images, LighterGAN was 6.66 percent higher than CycleGAN in subjective authenticity assessment and 3.84 lower in PIQE score, meanwhile, in the whole dataset generated images, the PIQE score of LighterGAN is 11.67, 4.86 lower than CycleGAN.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Deep learning models have improved cutting-edge technologies in many research areas, but their black-box structure makes it difficult to understand their inner workings and the rationale behind their predictions. This may lead to unintended effects, such as being susceptible to adversarial attacks or the reinforcement of biases. There is still a lack of research in the audio domain, despite the increasing interest in developing deep learning models that provide explanations of their decisions. To reduce this gap, we propose a novel interpretable deep learning model for automatic sound classification, which explains its predictions based on the similarity of the input to a set of learned prototypes in a latent space. We leverage domain knowledge by designing a frequency-dependent similarity measure and by considering different time-frequency resolutions in the feature space. The proposed model achieves results that are comparable to that of the state-of-the-art methods in three different sound classification tasks involving speech, music, and environmental audio. In addition, we present two automatic methods to prune the proposed model that exploit its interpretability. Our system is open source and it is accompanied by a web application for the manual editing of the model, which allows for a human-in-the-loop debugging approach.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - The evolution of low-cost sensors (LCSs) has made the spatio-temporal mapping of indoor air quality (IAQ) possible in real-time but the availability of a diverse set of LCSs make their selection challenging. Converting individual sensors into a sensing network requires the knowledge of diverse research disciplines, which we aim to bring together by making IAQ an advanced feature of smart homes. The aim of this review is to discuss the advanced home automation technologies for the monitoring and control of IAQ through networked air pollution LCSs. The key steps that can allow transforming conventional homes into smart homes are sensor selection, deployment strategies, data processing, and development of predictive models. A detailed synthesis of air pollution LCSs allowed us to summarise their advantages and drawbacks for spatio-temporal mapping of IAQ. We concluded that the performance evaluation of LCSs under controlled laboratory conditions prior to deployment is recommended for quality assurance/control (QA/QC), however, routine calibration or implementing statistical techniques during operational times, especially during long-term monitoring, is required for a network of sensors. The deployment height of sensors could vary purposefully as per location and exposure height of the occupants inside home environments for a spatio-temporal mapping. Appropriate data processing tools are needed to handle a huge amount of multivariate data to automate pre-/post-processing tasks, leading to more scalable, reliable and adaptable solutions. The review also showed the potential of using machine learning technique for predicting spatio-temporal IAQ in LCS networked-systems.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Construction projects and cities account for over 50% of carbon emissions and energy consumption. Industry 4.0 and digital transformation may increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. A digital twin (DT) is a key enabler in implementing Industry 4.0 in the areas of construction and smart cities. It is an emerging technology that connects different objects by utilising the advanced Internet of Things (IoT). As a technology, it is in high demand in various industries, and its literature is growing exponentially. Previous digital modeling practices, the use of data acquisition tools, human–computer–machine interfaces, programmable cities, and infrastructure, as well as Building Information Modeling (BIM), have provided digital data for construction, monitoring, or controlling physical objects. However, a DT is supposed to offer much more than digital representation. Characteristics such as bi-directional data exchange and real-time self-management (e.g., self-awareness or self-optimisation) distinguish a DT from other information modeling systems. The need to develop and implement DT is rising because it could be a core technology in many industrial sectors post-COVID-19. This paper aims to clarify the DT concept and differentiate it from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, digital shadows, and information systems. It also intends to review the state of play in DT development and offer research directions for future investigation. It recommends the development of DT applications that offer rapid and accurate data analysis platforms for real-time decisions, self-operation, and remote supervision requirements post-COVID-19. The discussion in this paper mainly focuses on the Smart City, Engineering and Construction (SCEC) sectors.

SN  - 2075-1702

AB  - The article is devoted to cybersecurity risk assessment of the dynamic device-to-device networks of a smart city. Analysis of the modern security threats at the IoT/IIoT, VANET, and WSN inter-device infrastructures demonstrates that the main concern is a set of network security threats targeted at the functional sustainability of smart urban infrastructure, the most common use case of smart networks. As a result of our study, systematization of the existing cybersecurity risk assessment methods has been provided. Expert-based risk assessment and active human participation cannot be provided for the huge, complex, and permanently changing digital environment of the smart city. The methods of scenario analysis and functional analysis are specific to industrial risk management and are hardly adaptable to solving cybersecurity tasks. The statistical risk evaluation methods force us to collect statistical data for the calculation of the security indicators for the self-organizing networks, and the accuracy of this method depends on the number of calculating iterations. In our work, we have proposed a new approach for cybersecurity risk management based on object typing, data mining, and quantitative risk assessment for the smart city infrastructure. The experimental study has shown us that the artificial neural network allows us to automatically, unambiguously, and reasonably assess the cyber risk for various object types in the dynamic digital infrastructures of the smart city.

TI  - VLSI Implementation of a Cost-Efficient Loeffler DCT Algorithm with Recursive CORDIC for DCT-Based Encoder
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 7
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - This paper presents a low-cost and high-quality, hardware-oriented, two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (2-D DCT) signal analyzer for image and video encoders. In order to reduce memory requirement and improve image quality, a novel Loeffler DCT based on a coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) technique is proposed. In addition, the proposed algorithm is realized by a recursive CORDIC architecture instead of an unfolded CORDIC architecture with approximated scale factors. In the proposed design, a fully pipelined architecture is developed to efficiently increase operating frequency and throughput, and scale factors are implemented by using four hardware-sharing machines for complexity reduction. Thus, the computational complexity can be decreased significantly with only 0.01 dB loss deviated from the optimal image quality of the Loeffler DCT. Experimental results show that the proposed 2-D DCT spectral analyzer not only achieved a superior average peak signal–noise ratio (PSNR) compared to the previous CORDIC-DCT algorithms but also designed cost-efficient architecture for very large scale integration (VLSI) implementation. The proposed design was realized using a UMC 0.18-μm CMOS process with a synthesized gate count of 8.04 k and core area of 75,100 μm2. Its operating frequency was 100 MHz and power consumption was 4.17 mW. Moreover, this work had at least a 64.1% gate count reduction and saved at least 22.5% in power consumption compared to previous designs.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) networks dependent on cloud services usually fail in supporting real-time applications as there is no response time guarantees. The fog computing paradigm has been used to alleviate this problem by executing tasks at the edge of the network, where it is possible to provide time bounds. One of the challenging topics in a fog-assisted architecture is to task placement on edge devices in order to obtain a good performance. The process of task mapping into computational devices is known as Service Placement Problem (SPP). In this paper, we present a heuristic algorithm to solve SPP, dubbed as clustering of fog devices and requirement-sensitive service first (SCATTER). We provide simulations using iFogSim toolkit and experimental evaluations using real hardware to verify the feasibility of the SCATTER algorithm by considering a smart home application. We compared the SCATTER with two existing works: edge-ward and cloud-only approaches, in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. Our experimental results have demonstrated that SCATTER approach has better performance compared with the edge-ward and cloud-only, 42.1% and 60.2% less application response times, 22% and 27.8% less network usage, 45% and 65.7% less average application loop delays, and 2.33% and 3.2% less energy consumption.

AB  - Due to severe climate change impact on electricity consumption, as well as new trends in smart grids (such as the use of renewable resources and the advent of prosumers and energy commons), medium-term and long-term electricity load forecasting has become a crucial need. Such forecasts are necessary to support the plans and decisions related to the capacity evaluation of centralized and decentralized power generation systems, demand response strategies, and controlling the operation. To address this problem, the main objective of this study is to develop and compare precise district level models for predicting the electrical load demand based on machine learning techniques including support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), and deep learning methods such as non-linear auto-regressive exogenous (NARX) neural network and recurrent neural networks (Long Short-Term Memory—LSTM). A dataset including nine years of historical load demand for Bruce County, Ontario, Canada, fused with the climatic information (temperature and wind speed) are used to train the models after completing the preprocessing and cleaning stages. The results show that by employing deep learning, the model could predict the load demand more accurately than SVM and RF, with an R-Squared of about 0.93–0.96 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of about 4–10%. The model can be used not only by the municipalities as well as utility companies and power distributors in the management and expansion of electricity grids; but also by the households to make decisions on the adoption of home- and district-scale renewable energy technologies.

TI  - A Model-Driven-to-Sample-Driven Method for Rural Road Extraction
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 8
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Road extraction in rural areas is one of the most fundamental tasks in the practical application of remote sensing. In recent years, sample-driven methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in road extraction tasks. However, sample-driven methods are prohibitively expensive and laborious, especially when dealing with rural roads with irregular curvature changes, narrow widths, and diverse materials. The template matching method can overcome these difficulties to some extent and achieve impressive road extraction results. This method also has the advantage of the vectorization of road extraction results, but the automation is limited. Straight line sequences can be substituted for curves, and the use of the color space can increase the recognition of roads and nonroads. A model-driven-to-sample-driven road extraction method for rural areas with a much higher degree of automation than existing template matching methods is proposed in this study. Without prior samples, on the basis of the geometric characteristics of narrow and long roads and using the advantages of straight lines instead of curved lines, the road center point extraction model is established through length constraints and gray mean contrast constraints of line sequences, and the extraction of some rural roads is completed through topological connection analysis. In addition, we take the extracted road center point and manual input data as local samples, use the improved line segment histogram to determine the local road direction, and use the panchromatic and hue, saturation, value (HSV) space interactive matching model as the matching measure to complete the road tracking extraction. Experimental results show that, for different types of data and scenarios on the premise, the accuracy and recall rate of the evaluation indicators reach more than 98%, and, compared with other methods, the automation of this algorithm has increased by more than 40%.

TI  - Monitoring Real Time Security Attacks for IoT Systems Using DevSecOps: A Systematic Literature Review

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - In many enterprises and the private sector, the Internet of Things (IoT) has spread globally. The growing number of different devices connected to the IoT and their various protocols have contributed to the increasing number of attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) and remote-to-local (R2L) ones. There are several approaches and techniques that can be used to construct attack detection models, such as machine learning, data mining, and statistical analysis. Nowadays, this technique is commonly used because it can provide precise analysis and results. Therefore, we decided to study the previous literature on the detection of IoT attacks and machine learning in order to understand the process of creating detection models. We also evaluated various datasets used for the models, IoT attack types, independent variables used for the models, evaluation metrics for assessment of models, and monitoring infrastructure using DevSecOps pipelines. We found 49 primary studies, and the detection models were developed using seven different types of machine learning techniques. Most primary studies used IoT device testbed datasets, and others used public datasets such as NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. When it comes to measuring the efficiency of models, both numerical and graphical measures are commonly used. Most IoT attacks occur at the network layer according to the literature. If the detection models applied DevSecOps pipelines in development processes for IoT devices, they were more secure. From the results of this paper, we found that machine learning techniques can detect IoT attacks, but there are a few issues in the design of detection models. We also recommend the continued use of hybrid frameworks for the improved detection of IoT attacks, advanced monitoring infrastructure configurations using methods based on software pipelines, and the use of machine learning techniques for advanced supervision and monitoring.

AB  - In recent years, rapid development has been made to the Internet of Things communication technologies, infrastructure, and physical resources management. These developments and research trends address challenges such as heterogeneous communication, quality of service requirements, unpredictable network conditions, and a massive influx of data. One major contribution to the research world is in the form of software-defined networking applications, which aim to deploy rule-based management to control and add intelligence to the network using high-level policies to have integral control of the network without knowing issues related to low-level configurations. Machine learning techniques coupled with software-defined networking can make the networking decision more intelligent and robust. The Internet of Things application has recently adopted virtualization of resources and network control with software-defined networking policies to make the traffic more controlled and maintainable. However, the requirements of software-defined networking and the Internet of Things must be aligned to make the adaptations possible. This paper aims to discuss the possible ways to make software-defined networking enabled Internet of Things application and discusses the challenges solved using the Internet of Things leveraging the software-defined network. We provide a topical survey of the application and impact of software-defined networking on the Internet of things networks. We also study the impact of machine learning techniques applied to software-defined networking and its application perspective. The study is carried out from the different perspectives of software-based Internet of Things networks, including wide-area networks, edge networks, and access networks. Machine learning techniques are presented from the perspective of network resources management, security, classification of traffic, quality of experience, and quality of service prediction. Finally, we discuss challenges and issues in adopting machine learning and software-defined networking for the Internet of Things applications.

AB  - The accelerated urban development over the last decades has made it necessary to update spatial information rapidly and constantly. Therefore, cities’ three-dimensional models have been widely used as a study base for various urban problems. However, although many efforts have been made to develop new building extraction methods, reliable and automatic extraction is still a major challenge for the remote sensing and computer vision communities, mainly due to the complexity and variability of urban scenes. This paper presents a method to extract building roof boundaries in the object space by integrating a high-resolution aerial images stereo pair, three-dimensional roof models reconstructed from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and contextual information of the scenes involved. The proposed method focuses on overcoming three types of common problems that can disturb the automatic roof extraction in the urban environment: perspective occlusions caused by high buildings, occlusions caused by vegetation covering the roof, and shadows that are adjacent to the roofs, which can be misinterpreted as roof edges. For this, an improved Snake-based mathematical model is developed considering the radiometric and geometric properties of roofs to represent the roof boundary in the image space. A new approach for calculating the corner response and a shadow compensation factor was added to the model. The created model is then adapted to represent the boundaries in the object space considering a stereo pair of aerial images. Finally, the optimal polyline, representing a selected roof boundary, is obtained by optimizing the proposed Snake-based model using a dynamic programming (DP) approach considering the contextual information of the scene. The results showed that the proposed method works properly in boundary extraction of roofs with occlusion and shadows areas, presenting completeness and correctness average values above 90%, RMSE average values below 0.5 m for E and N components, and below 1 m for H component.

AB  - Modern vehicles are no longer simply mechanical devices. Connectivity between the vehicular network and the outside world has widened the security holes that hackers can use to exploit a vehicular network. Controller Area Network (CAN), FlexRay, and automotive Ethernet are popular protocols for in-vehicle networks (IVNs) and will stay in the industry for many more years. However, these protocols were not designed with security in mind. They have several vulnerabilities, such as lack of message authentication, lack of message encryption, and an ID-based arbitration mechanism for contention resolution. Adversaries can use these vulnerabilities to launch sophisticated attacks that may lead to loss of life and damage to property. Thus, the security of the vehicles should be handled carefully. In this paper, we investigate the security vulnerabilities with in-vehicle network protocols such as CAN, automotive Ethernet, and FlexRay. A comprehensive survey on security attacks launched against in-vehicle networks is presented along with countermeasures adopted by various researchers. Various algorithms have been proposed in the past for intrusion detection in IVNs. However, those approaches have several limitations that need special attention from the research community. Blockchain is a good approach to solving the existing security issues in IVNs, and we suggest a way to improve IVN security based on a hybrid blockchain.

AB  - The development of start-ups is a driving force of the local and regional economy. Therefore, it should be in the interest of municipal authorities to take actions for their organizational and resource support. In the conditions of limited public resources, however, it is a difficult and multifaceted task. Therefore, in this article, the authors attempt to determine the influence of local conditions on the establishment of start-ups. As a natural environment for the development of this type of entrepreneurship, cities were considered in which accessibility to infrastructure and human resources is high, and thus, by definition, conducive to creativity and innovation. Such a formulations of the objective and scope of the research allowed the existing theoretical and research gaps to be filled, relating to the identification and establishment of a hierarchy of local determinants of creating start-ups in the urban environment. The research in question was carried out on a representative sample of 287 Polish cities using questionnaire techniques and structural modelling. The results confirm the dominant influence of human and financial capital on the establishment of start-ups. The research also shows a slightly less significant influence of business incubators and technology parks on the creation of start-ups, which implies the need to improve the performance of these entities. The results also point to the positive role of direct city involvement in the development of this form of entrepreneurship.

T2  - Energies

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The proliferation of distributed renewable energy resources (RESs) poses major challenges to the operation of microgrids due to uncertainty. Traditional online scheduling approaches relying on accurate forecasts become difficult to implement due to the increase of uncertain RESs. Although several data-driven methods have been proposed recently to overcome the challenge, they generally suffer from a scalability issue due to the limited ability to optimize high-dimensional continuous control variables. To address these issues, we propose a data-driven online scheduling method for microgrid energy optimization based on continuous-control deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We formulate the online scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). The objective is to minimize the operating cost of the microgrid considering the uncertainty of RESs generation, load demand, and electricity prices. To learn the optimal scheduling strategy, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based network is designed to extract temporal features of uncertainty and generate the optimal scheduling decisions in an end-to-end manner. To optimize the policy with high-dimensional and continuous actions, proximal policy optimization (PPO) is employed to train the neural network-based policy in a data-driven fashion. The proposed method does not require any forecasting information on the uncertainty or a prior knowledge of the physical model of the microgrid. Simulation results using realistic power system data of California Independent System Operator (CAISO) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Worldwide increasing awareness of energy sustainability issues has been the main driver in developing the concepts of (Nearly) Zero Energy Buildings, where the reduced energy consumptions are (nearly) fully covered by power locally generated by renewable sources. At the same time, recent advances in Internet of Things technologies are among the main enablers of Smart Homes and Buildings. The transition of conventional buildings into active environments that process, elaborate and react to online measured environmental quantities is being accelerated by the aspects related to COVID-19, most notably in terms of air exchange and the monitoring of the density of occupants. In this paper, we address the problem of maximizing the energy efficiency and comfort perceived by occupants, defined in terms of thermal comfort, visual comfort and air quality. The case study of the University of Pisa is considered as a practical example to show preliminary results of the aggregation of environmental data.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Artificial intelligence methods can remarkably reduce costs for water supply and sanitation systems and help ensure compliance with the quality of drinking and wastewater treatment. Therefore, modelling and predicting water quality to control water pollution has been widely researched. The novelty of the proposed system is presented to develop an efficient operation of monitoring drinking water to ensure a sustainable and friendly green environment. In this work, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm was developed to predict the water quality index (WQI). Feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and K-nearest neighbors were applied to classify water quality. The dataset has eight significant parameters, but seven parameters were considered to show significant values. The proposed methodology was developed based on these statistical parameters. Prediction results demonstrated that the ANFIS model was superior for the prediction of WQI values. Nevertheless, the FFNN algorithm achieved the highest accuracy (100%) for water quality classification (WQC). Furthermore, the ANFIS model accurately predicted WQI, and the FFNN model showed superior robustness in classifying the WQC. In addition, the ANFIS model showed accuracy during the testing phase, with a regression coefficient of 96.17% for predicting WQI, and the FFNN model achieved the highest accuracy (100%) for WQC. This proposed method, using advanced artificial intelligence, can aid in water treatment and management.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has proven to be a billion-dollar industry. Despite offering numerous benefits, the prevalent nature of IoT makes it vulnerable and a possible target for the development of cyber-attacks. The diversity of the IoT, on the one hand, leads to the benefits of the integration of devices into a smart ecosystem, but the heterogeneous nature of the IoT makes it difficult to come up with a single security solution. However, the centralized intelligence and programmability of software-defined networks (SDNs) have made it possible to compose a single and effective security solution to cope with cyber threats and attacks. We present an SDN-enabled architecture leveraging hybrid deep learning detection algorithms for the efficient detection of cyber threats and attacks while considering the resource-constrained IoT devices so that no burden is placed on them. We use a state-of-the-art dataset, CICDDoS 2019, to train our algorithm. The results evaluated by this algorithm achieve high accuracy with a minimal false positive rate (FPR) and testing time. We also perform 10-fold cross-validation, proving our results to be unbiased, and compare our results with current benchmark algorithms.

AB  - The agro-industrial sector consumes a significant amount of natural resources for farming and meat production. By 2050, population growth is expected, generating more demand and, consequently, more consumption of scarce resources. This challenging scenario is a concern of the European Commission, revealed in the Green Deal commitment and by the United Nations’ 12th goal of sustainable development. Thus, organizations must increase productivity and be more sustainable as soon as possible. Internet of Things (IoT) is introduced as a solution to facilitate agro-food companies to be more eco-efficient, mainly facing difficulties on farms, such as food loss and waste, best efficiency in management of resources, and production. The deployment of this technology depends on the stage of maturity and potential of implementation. To assess and characterize companies, with respect of IoT implementation, a survey was applied in 21 micro, small and medium agro-food companies, belonging to milk, honey, olive oil, jams, fruticulture, bakery and pastry, meat, coffee, and wine sectors, in the central region of Portugal. As results, this paper reveals the stage of maturity, level of sophistication, potential, opportunities, solutions, and barriers for implementation of IoT. Additionally, suggestions and recommendations to improve practices are discussed.

AB  - In the light of climate change and burgeoning urbanization, heat loads in urban areas have emerged as serious issues, affecting the well-being of the population and the environment. In response to a pressing need for more standardised and communicable research into urban climate, the concept of local climate zones (LCZs) has been created. This concept aims to define the morphological types of (urban) surface with respect to the formation of local climatic conditions, largely thermal. This systematic review paper analyses studies that have applied the concept of LCZs to European urban areas. The methodology utilized pre-determined keywords and five steps of literature selection. A total of 91 studies were found eligible for analysis. The results show that the concept of LCZs has been increasingly employed and become well established in European urban climate research. Dozens of measurements, satellite observations, and modelling outcomes have demonstrated the characteristic thermal responses of LCZs in European cities. However, a substantial number of the studies have concentrated on the methodological development of the classification process, generating a degree of inconsistency in the delineation of LCZs. Recent trends indicate an increasing prevalence of the accessible remote-sensing based approach over accurate GIS-based methods in the delineation of LCZs. In this context, applications of the concept in fine-scale modelling appear limited. Nevertheless, the concept of the LCZ has proven appropriate and valuable to the provision of metadata for urban stations, (surface) urban heat island analysis, and the assessment of outdoor thermal comfort and heat risk. Any further development of LCZ mapping appears to require a standardised objective approach that may be globally applicable.

AB  - Currently, private universities, as a result of the pandemic that the world is facing, are going through very delicate moments in several areas, both academic and financial. Academically, there are learning problems and these are directly related to the dropout rate, which brings financial problems. Added to this are the economic problems caused by the pandemic, where the rates of students who want to access a private education have dropped considerably. For this reason, it is necessary for all private universities to have support to improve their student income and avoid cuts in budgets and resources. However, the academic part represents a great effort to fulfill their academic activities, which are the priority, with attention on those interested in pursuing a training programs. To solve these problems, it is important to integrate technologies such as Chatbots, which use artificial intelligence in such a way that tasks such as providing information on an academic courses are addressed by them, reducing the administrative burden and improving the user experience. At the same time, this encourages people to be a part of the college.

In this paper, different optical camera communications (OCC) equipment are experimentally studied in the laboratory and the field, and a sub-pixel architecture is raised as a potential solution for outdoor wireless sensor networks (WSN) applications, considering its achievable data throughput, the spatial division of sources, and the ability of cameras to overcome the attenuation caused by different atmospheric conditions such as rain, turbulence and the presence of aerosols. Sub-pixel OCC shows particularly adequate capabilities for some of the WSN applications presented, also in terms of cost-effectiveness and scalability. The novel topology of sub-pixel projection of multiple transmitters over the receiver using small optical devices is presented as a solution using OCC that re-uses camera equipment for communication purposes on top of video-monitoring.

AB  - As the current standardization for the 5G networks nears completion, work towards understanding the potential technologies for the 6G wireless networks is already underway. One of these potential technologies for the 6G networks is reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. They offer unprecedented degrees of freedom towards engineering the wireless channel, i.e., the ability to modify the characteristics of the channel whenever and however required. Nevertheless, such properties demand that the response of the associated metasurface is well understood under all possible operational conditions. While an understanding of the radiation pattern characteristics can be obtained through either analytical models or full-wave simulations, they suffer from inaccuracy and extremely high computational complexity, respectively. Hence, in this paper, we propose a neural network-based approach that enables a fast and accurate characterization of the metasurface response. We analyze multiple scenarios and demonstrate the capabilities and utility of the proposed methodology. Concretely, we show that this method can learn and predict the parameters governing the reflected wave radiation pattern with an accuracy of a full-wave simulation (98.8–99.8%) and the time and computational complexity of an analytical model. The aforementioned result and methodology will be of specific importance for the design, fault tolerance, and maintenance of the thousands of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces that will be deployed in the 6G network environment.

AB  - Infrastructure is a fundamental sector for sustainable development and Earth observation has great potentials for sustainable infrastructure development (SID). However, implementations of the timely, large–scale and multi–source Earth observation are still limited in satisfying the huge global requirements of SID. This study presents a systematical literature review to identify trends of Earth observation for sustainable infrastructure (EOSI), investigate the relationship between EOSI and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and explore challenges and future directions of EOSI. Results reveal the close associations of infrastructure, urban development, ecosystems, climate, Earth observation and GIS in EOSI, and indicate their relationships. In addition, from the perspective of EOSI–SDGs relationship, the huge potentials of EOSI are demonstrated from the 70% of the infrastructure influenced targets that can be directly or indirectly derived from Earth observation data, but have not been included in current SDG indicators. Finally, typical EOSI cases are presented to indicate challenges and future research directions. This review emphasizes the contributions and potentials of Earth observation to SID and EOSI is a powerful pathway to deliver on SDGs.

VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Video anomaly recognition in smart cities is an important computer vision task that plays a vital role in smart surveillance and public safety but is challenging due to its diverse, complex, and infrequent occurrence in real-time surveillance environments. Various deep learning models use significant amounts of training data without generalization abilities and with huge time complexity. To overcome these problems, in the current work, we present an efficient light-weight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based anomaly recognition framework that is functional in a surveillance environment with reduced time complexity. We extract spatial CNN features from a series of video frames and feed them to the proposed residual attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which can precisely recognize anomalous activity in surveillance videos. The representative CNN features with the residual blocks concept in LSTM for sequence learning prove to be effective for anomaly detection and recognition, validating our model’s effective usage in smart cities video surveillance. Extensive experiments on the real-world benchmark UCF-Crime dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model within complex surveillance environments and demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models with a 1.77%, 0.76%, and 8.62% increase in accuracy on the UCF-Crime, UMN and Avenue datasets, respectively.

AB  - Employment of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the healthcare field can contribute to recruiting heterogeneous medical devices and creating smart cooperation between them. This cooperation leads to an increase in the efficiency of the entire medical system, thus accelerating the diagnosis and curing of patients, in general, and rescuing critical cases in particular. In this paper, a large-scale IoT-enabled healthcare architecture is proposed. To achieve a wide range of communication between healthcare devices, not only are Internet coverage tools utilized but also satellites and high-altitude platforms (HAPs). In addition, the clustering idea is applied in the proposed architecture to facilitate its management. Moreover, healthcare data are prioritized into several levels of importance. Finally, NS3 is used to measure the performance of the proposed IoT-enabled healthcare architecture. The performance metrics are delay, energy consumption, packet loss, coverage tool usage, throughput, percentage of served users, and percentage of each exchanged data type. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IoT-enabled healthcare architecture outperforms the traditional healthcare architecture.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), a UAV is employed as a mobile sink to gather data from sensor nodes. Incorporating UAV helps prolong the network lifetime and avoid the energy-hole problem faced by sensor networks. In emergency applications, timely data collection from sensor nodes and transferal of the data to the base station (BS) is a prime requisite. The timely and safe path of UAV is one of the fundamental premises for effective UWSN operations. It is essential and challenging to identify a suitable path in an environment comprising various obstacles and to ensure that the path can efficiently reach the target point. This paper proposes a hybrid path planning (HPP) algorithm for efficient data collection by assuring the shortest collision-free path for UAV in emergency environments. In the proposed HPP scheme, the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm is used to design the shortest trajectory map and the optimized artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to improve different path constraints in a three-dimensional environment. Our simulation results show that the proposed HPP outperforms the PRM and conventional ABC schemes significantly in terms of flight time, energy consumption, convergence time, and flight path.

AB  - Smart farming has the potential to overcome the challenge of 2050 to feed 10 billion people. Both artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT) have become critical prerequisites to smart farming due to their high interoperability, sensors, and cutting-edge technologies. Extending the role of responsible leadership, this paper proposes an AI and IoT based smart farming system in Bangladesh. With a comprehensive literature review, this paper counsels the need to go beyond the simple application of traditional farming and irrigation practices and recommends implementing smart farming enabling responsible leadership to uphold sustainable agriculture. It contributes to the current literature of smart farming in several ways. First, this paper helps to understand the prospect and challenges of both AI and IoT and the requirement of smart farming in a nonwestern context. Second, it clarifies the interventions of responsible leadership into Bangladesh’s agriculture sector and justifies the demand for sustainable smart farming. Third, this paper is a step forward to explore future empirical studies for the effective and efficient use of AI and IoT to adopt smart farming. Finally, this paper will help policymakers to take responsible initiatives to plan and apply smart farming in a developing economy like Bangladesh.

TI  - Decision-Level and Feature-Level Integration of Remote Sensing and Geospatial Big Data for Urban Land Use Mapping
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Information about urban land use is important for urban planning and sustainable development. The emergence of geospatial big data (GBD), increased the availability of remotely sensed (RS) data and the development of new methods for data integration to provide new opportunities for mapping types of urban land use. However, the modes of RS and GBD integration are diverse due to the differences in data, study areas, classifiers, etc. In this context, this study aims to summarize the main methods of data integration and evaluate them via a case study of urban land use mapping in Hangzhou, China. We first categorized the RS and GBD integration methods into decision-level integration (DI) and feature-level integration (FI) and analyzed their main differences by reviewing the existing literature. The two methods were then applied for mapping urban land use types in Hangzhou city, based on urban parcels derived from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network, 10 m Sentinel-2A images, and points of interest (POI). The corresponding classification results were validated quantitatively and qualitatively using the same testing dataset. Finally, we illustrated the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches via bibliographic evidence and quantitative analysis. The results showed that: (1) The visual comparison indicates a generally better performance of DI-based classification than FI-based classification; (2) DI-based urban land use mapping is easy to implement, while FI-based land use mapping enables the mixture of features; (3) DI-based and FI-based methods can be used together to improve urban land use mapping, as they have different performances when classifying different types of land use. This study provides an improved understanding of urban land use mapping in terms of the RS and GBD integration strategy.

AB  - Nowadays, there is an increasing need to understand the behavior of COVID-19. After the Directorate-General of Health of Portugal made available the infected patient’s data, it became possible to analyze it and gather some conclusions, obtaining a better understanding of the matter. In this context, the project developed—ioCOVID19—Intelligent Decision Support Platform aims to identify patterns and develop intelligent models to predict and support clinical decisions. This article explores which typologies are associated with different outcomes to help clinicians fight the virus with a decision support system. So, to achieve this purpose, classification algorithms were used, and one target was studied—Patients outcome, that is, to predict if the patient will die or recover. Regarding the obtained results, the model that stood out is composed of scenario s4 (composed of all comorbidities, symptoms, and age), the decision tree algorithm, and the oversampling sampling method. The obtained results by the studied metrics were (in order of importance): Sensitivity of 95.20%, Accuracy of 90.67%, and Specificity of 86.08%. The models were deployed as a service, and they are part of a clinical decision support system that is available for authorized users anywhere and anytime.

SN  - 2076-0825

AB  - In today’s world, smart buildings are considered an overarching system that automates a building’s complex operations and increases security while reducing environmental impact. One of the primary goals of building management systems is to promote sustainable and efficient use of energy, requiring coherent task management and execution of control commands for actuators. This paper proposes a predictive-learning framework based on contextual feature selection and optimal actuator control mechanism for minimizing energy consumption in smart buildings. We aim to assess multiple parameters and select the most relevant contextual features that would optimize energy consumption. We have implemented an artificial neural network-based particle swarm optimization (ANN-PSO) algorithm for predictive learning to train the framework on feature importance. Based on the relevance of attributes, our model was also capable of re-adding features. The extracted features are then applied as input parameters for the training of long short-term memory (LSTM) and optimal control module. We have proposed an objective function using a velocity boost-particle swarm optimization (VB-PSO) algorithm that reduces energy cost for optimal control. We then generated and defined the control tasks based on the fuzzy rule set and optimal values obtained from VB-PSO. We compared our model’s performance with and without feature selection using the root mean square error (RMSE) metric in the evaluation section. This paper also presents how optimal control can reduce energy cost and improve performance resulting from lesser learning cycles and decreased error rates.

AB  - Mobile agents have the potential to offer benefits, as they are able to either independently or cooperatively move throughout networks and collect/aggregate sensory data samples. They are programmed to autonomously move and visit sensory data stations through optimal paths, which are established according to the application requirements. However, mobile agent routing protocols still suffer heavy computation/communication overheads, lack of route planning accuracy and long-delay mobile agent migrations. For this, mobile agent route planning protocols aim to find the best-fitted paths for completing missions (e.g., data collection) with minimised delay, maximised performance and minimised transmitted traffic. This article proposes a mobile agent route planning protocol for sensory data collection called MINDS. The key goal of this MINDS is to reduce network traffic, maximise data robustness and minimise delay at the same time. This protocol utilises the Hamming distance technique to partition a sensor network into a number of data-centric clusters. In turn, a named data networking approach is used to form the cluster-heads as a data-centric, tree-based communication infrastructure. The mobile agents utilise a modified version of the Depth-First Search algorithm to move through the tree infrastructure according to a hop-count-aware fashion. As the simulation results show, MINDS reduces path length, reduces network traffic and increases data robustness as compared with two conventional benchmarks (ZMA and TBID) in dense and large wireless sensor networks.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - Nowadays, networks use many different paths to exchange data. However, our research will construct a reliable path in the networks among a huge number of nodes for use in tele-surgery using medical applications such as healthcare tracking applications, including tele-surgery which lead to optimizing medical quality of service (m-QoS) during the COVID-19 situation. Many people could not travel due to the current issues, for fear of spreading the covid-19 virus. Therefore, our paper will provide a very trusted and reliable method of communication between a doctor and his patient so that the latter can do his operation even from a far distance. The communication between the doctor and his/her patient will be monitored by our proposed algorithm to make sure that the data will be received without delay. We test how we can invest buffer space that can be used efficiently to reduce delays between source and destination, avoiding loss of high-priority data packets. The results are presented in three stages. First, we show how to obtain the greatest possible reduction in rate variability when the surgeon begins an operation using live streaming. Second, the proposed algorithm reduces congestion on the determined path used for the online surgery. Third, we have evaluated the affection of optimal smoothing algorithm on the network parameters such as peak-to-mean ratio and delay to optimize m-QoS. We propose a new Smart-Rout Control algorithm (s-RCA) for creating a virtual smart path between source and destination to transfer the required data traffic between them, considering the number of hops and link delay. This provides a reliable connection that can be used in healthcare surgery to guarantee that all instructions are received without any delay, to be executed instantly. This idea can improve m-QoS in distance surgery, with trusted paths. The new s-RCA can be adapted with an existing routing protocol to track the primary path and monitor emergency packets received in node buffers, for direct forwarding via the demand path, with extended features.

AB  - The smart grid is enabling the collection of massive amounts of high-dimensional and multi-type data about the electric power grid operations, by integrating advanced metering infrastructure, control technologies, and communication technologies. However, the traditional modeling, optimization, and control technologies have many limitations in processing the data; thus, the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the smart grid are becoming more apparent. This survey presents a structured review of the existing research into some common AI techniques applied to load forecasting, power grid stability assessment, faults detection, and security problems in the smart grid and power systems. It also provides further research challenges for applying AI technologies to realize truly smart grid systems. Finally, this survey presents opportunities of applying AI to smart grid problems. The paper concludes that the applications of AI techniques can enhance and improve the reliability and resilience of smart grid systems.

AB  - This paper reviews non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) approaches that employ deep neural networks to disaggregate appliances from low frequency data, i.e., data with sampling rates lower than the AC base frequency. The overall purpose of this review is, firstly, to gain an overview on the state of the research up to November 2020, and secondly, to identify worthwhile open research topics. Accordingly, we first review the many degrees of freedom of these approaches, what has already been done in the literature, and compile the main characteristics of the reviewed publications in an extensive overview table. The second part of the paper discusses selected aspects of the literature and corresponding research gaps. In particular, we do a performance comparison with respect to reported mean absolute error (MAE) and F1-scores and observe different recurring elements in the best performing approaches, namely data sampling intervals below 10 s, a large field of view, the usage of generative adversarial network (GAN) losses, multi-task learning, and post-processing. Subsequently, multiple input features, multi-task learning, and related research gaps are discussed, the need for comparative studies is highlighted, and finally, missing elements for a successful deployment of NILM approaches based on deep neural networks are pointed out. We conclude the review with an outlook on possible future scenarios.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have huge potential to efficiently manage the automated operation of the internet of things (IoT) nodes deployed in smart cities. In smart cities, the major IoT applications are smart traffic monitoring, smart waste management, smart buildings and patient healthcare monitoring. The small size IoT nodes based on low power Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) standard and wireless sensor networks (WSN) (IEEE 802.15.4) standard are generally used for transmission of data to a remote location using gateways. The WSN based IoT (WSN-IoT) design problems include network coverage and connectivity issues, energy consumption, bandwidth requirement, network lifetime maximization, communication protocols and state of the art infrastructure. In this paper, the authors propose machine learning methods as an optimization tool for regular WSN-IoT nodes deployed in smart city applications. As per the author’s knowledge, this is the first in-depth literature survey of all ML techniques in the field of low power consumption WSN-IoT for smart cities. The results of this unique survey article show that the supervised learning algorithms have been most widely used (61%) as compared to reinforcement learning (27%) and unsupervised learning (12%) for smart city applications.

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a topic of intense interest among the research and industrial community as it has had a revolutionary impact on human life. The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart devices, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart city, smart grid, among others. IoT devices’ security has become a serious concern nowadays, especially for the healthcare domain, where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security solutions are well established. However, due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the context-aware IoT security solutions, especially for a sensitive use case like IoT healthcare environment.

AB  - The agricultural industry is getting more data-centric and requires precise, more advanced data and technologies than before, despite being familiar with agricultural processes. The agriculture industry is being advanced by various information and advanced communication technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The rapid emergence of these advanced technologies has restructured almost all other industries, as well as advanced agriculture, which has shifted the industry from a statistical approach to a quantitative one. This radical change has shaken existing farming techniques and produced the latest prospects in a series of challenges. This comprehensive review article enlightens the potential of the IoT in the advancement of agriculture and the challenges faced when combining these advanced technologies with conventional agricultural systems. A brief analysis of these advanced technologies with sensors is presented in advanced agricultural applications. Numerous sensors that can be implemented for specific agricultural practices require best management practices (e.g., land preparation, irrigation systems, insect, and disease management). This review includes the integration of all suitable techniques, from sowing to harvesting, packaging, transportation, and advanced technologies available for farmers throughout the cropping system. Besides, this review article highlights the utilization of other tools such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for crop monitoring and other beneficiary measures, such as optimizing crop yields. In addition, advanced programs based on the IoT are also discussed. Finally, based on our comprehensive review, we identified advanced prospects regarding the IoT, which are essential tools for sustainable agriculture.

PY  - 2021

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UAVs) are dramatically evolving and promoting several civil applications. However, they are still prone to many security issues that threaten public safety. Security becomes even more challenging when they are connected to the Internet as their data stream is exposed to attacks. Unmanned traffic management (UTM) represents one of the most important topics for small unmanned aerial systems for beyond-line-of-sight operations in controlled low-altitude airspace. However, without securing the flight path exchanges between drones and ground stations or control centers, serious security threats may lead to disastrous situations. For example, a predefined flight path could be easily altered to make the drone perform illegal operations. Motivated by these facts, this paper discusses the security issues for UTM’s components and addresses the security requirements for such systems. Moreover, we propose UTM-Chain, a lightweight blockchain-based security solution using hyperledger fabric for UTM of low-altitude UAVs which fits the computational and storage resources limitations of UAVs. Moreover, UTM-Chain provides secure and unalterable traffic data between the UAVs and their ground control stations. The performance of the proposed system related to transaction latency and resource utilization is analyzed by using cAdvisor. Finally, the analysis of security aspects demonstrates that the proposed UTM-Chain scheme is feasible and extensible for the secure sharing of UAV data.

AB  - Information fusion in networked systems poses challenges with respect to both theory and implementation. Limited available bandwidth can become a bottleneck when high-dimensional estimates and associated error covariance matrices need to be transmitted. Compression of estimates and covariance matrices can endanger desirable properties like unbiasedness and may lead to unreliable fusion results. In this work, quantization methods for estimates and covariance matrices are presented and their usage with the optimal fusion formulas and covariance intersection is demonstrated. The proposed quantization methods significantly reduce the bandwidth required for data transmission while retaining unbiasedness and conservativeness of the considered fusion methods. Their performance is evaluated using simulations, showing their effectiveness even in the case of substantial data reduction.

AB  - As COVID-19 solidifies its presence in everyday life, the interest in mental health is growing, resulting in the necessity of sentiment analysis. A smart mirror is suitable for encouraging mental comfort due to its approachability and scalability as an in-home AI device. From the aspect of natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis for Korean lacks an emotion dataset regarding everyday conversation. Its significant differences from English in terms of language structure make implementation challenging. The proposed smart mirror LUX provides Korean text sentiment analysis with the deep learning model, which examines GRU, LSTM, CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Bi-GRU networks. There are four emotional labels: anger, sadness, neutral, and happiness. For each emotion, there are three possible interactive responses: reciting wise sayings, playing music, and sympathizing. The implemented smart mirror also includes more-typical functions, such as a wake-up prompt, a weather reporting function, a calendar, a news reporting function, and a clock.

AB  - Tour traffic prediction is very important in determining the capacity of public transportation and planning new transportation devices, allowing them to be built in accordance with people’s basic needs. From a review of a limited number of studies, the common methods for forecasting tour traffic demand appear to be regression analysis, econometric modeling, time-series modeling, artificial neural networks, and gray theory. In this study, a two-step procedure is used to build a predictive model for public transport. In the first step of this study, regression analysis is used to find the correlations between two or more variables and their associated directions and strength, and the regression function is used to predict future changes. In the second step, the regression analysis and artificial neural network methods are assessed and the results are compared. The artificial neural network is more accurate in prediction than regression analysis. The study results can provide useful references for transportation organizations in the development of business operation strategies for managing sustainable smart cities.

AB  - Sharing data and services in the Internet of Things (IoT) can give rise to significant security concerns with information being sensitive and vulnerable to attacks. In such an environment, objects can be either public resources or owned by humans. For this reason, the need of monitoring the reliability of all involved actors, both persons and smart objects, assuring that they really are who they claim to be, is becoming an essential property of the IoT, with the increase in the pervasive adoption of such a paradigm. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a new framework, called H2O (Human to Object). Our solution is able to continuously authenticate an entity in the network, providing a reliability assessment mechanism based on behavioral fingerprinting. A detailed security analysis evaluates the robustness of the proposed protocol; furthermore, a performance analysis shows the feasibility of our approach.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Many algorithms use clustering to improve vehicular ad hoc network performance. The expected points of many of these approaches support multiple rounds of data to the roadside unit and constantly include clustering in every round of single-hop data transmission towards the road side unit; however, the clustering in every round maximizes the number of control messages and there could be the possibility of collision and decreases in network energy. Multi-hop transmission prolongs the cluster head node’s lifetime and boosts the network’s efficiency. Accordingly, this article proposes a new fuzzy-clustering-based routing algorithm to benefit from multi-hop transmission clustering simultaneously. This research has analyzed the limitation of clustering in each round, different algorithms were used to perform the clustering, and multi-hop routing was used to transfer the data of every cluster to the road side unit. The fuzzy logic was used to choose the head node of each cluster. Three parameters, (1) distance of each node, (2) remaining energy, and (3) number of neighbors of every node, were considered as fuzzy criteria. The results of this research were compared to various other algorithms in relation to parameters like dead node in every round, first node expire, half node expire, last node expire, and the network lifetime. The simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other methods. On the other hand, the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) environment is vulnerable at the time of data transmission. The NS-2 software tool was used to simulate and evaluate the proposed fuzzy logic opportunistic routing’s performance results concerning end-to-end delay, packet delivery, and network throughput. We compare to the existing protocols, such as fuzzy Internet of Things (IoT), two fuzzy, and Fuzzy-Based Driver Monitoring System (FDMS). The performance comparison also emphasizes an effective utilization of the resources. Simulations on the highway environment show that the suggested protocol has an improved Quality of Service (QoS) efficiency compared to the above published methods in the literature.

AB  - As the development of technology accelerates, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which combines various technologies and provides them as one service, has been in the spotlight, and services using big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming more intelligent and helpful to users. As these services are used in various fields, attacks by attackers also occur in various areas and ways. However, cyberattacks by attackers may vary depending on the attacking pattern of the attacker, and the same vulnerability can be attacked from different perspectives. Therefore, in this study, by constructing a cyberattack framework based on preemptive prediction, we can collect vulnerability information based on big data existing on the network and increase the accuracy by applying machine learning to the mapping of keywords frequently mentioned in attack strategies. We propose an attack strategy prediction framework.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Deterioration of bridge infrastructure is a serious concern to transport and government agencies as it declines serviceability and reliability of bridges and jeopardizes public safety. Maintenance and rehabilitation needs of bridge infrastructure are periodically monitored and assessed, typically every two years. Existing inspection techniques, such as visual inspection, are time-consuming, subjective, and often incomplete. Non-destructive testing (NDT) using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been gaining momentum for bridge monitoring in the recent years, particularly due to enhanced accessibility and cost efficiency, deterrence of traffic closure, and improved safety during inspection. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive review of the application of UAVs in bridge condition monitoring, used in conjunction with remote sensing technologies. Remote sensing technologies such as visual imagery, infrared thermography, LiDAR, and other sensors, integrated with UAVs for data acquisition are analyzed in depth. This study compiled sixty-five journal and conference papers published in the last two decades scrutinizing NDT-based UAV systems. In addition to comparison of stand-alone and integrated NDT-UAV methods, the facilitation of bridge inspection using UAVs is thoroughly discussed in the present article in terms of ease of use, accuracy, cost-efficiency, employed data collection tools, and simulation platforms. Additionally, challenges and future perspectives of the reviewed UAV-NDT technologies are highlighted.

TI  - Motion Estimation Using Region-Level Segmentation and Extended Kalman Filter for Autonomous Driving

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 9
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Motion estimation is crucial to predict where other traffic participants will be at a certain period of time, and accordingly plan the route of the ego-vehicle. This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the motion state by using region-level instance segmentation and extended Kalman filter (EKF). Motion estimation involves three stages of object detection, tracking and parameter estimate. We first use a region-level segmentation to accurately locate the object region for the latter two stages. The region-level segmentation combines color, temporal (optical flow), and spatial (depth) information as the basis for segmentation by using super-pixels and Conditional Random Field. The optical flow is then employed to track the feature points within the object area. In the stage of parameter estimate, we develop a relative motion model of the ego-vehicle and the object, and accordingly establish an EKF model for point tracking and parameter estimate. The EKF model integrates the ego-motion, optical flow, and disparity to generate optimized motion parameters. During tracking and parameter estimate, we apply edge point constraint and consistency constraint to eliminate outliers of tracking points so that the feature points used for tracking are ensured within the object body and the parameter estimates are refined by inner points. Experiments have been conducted on the KITTI dataset, and the results demonstrate that our method presents excellent performance and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods either in object segmentation and parameter estimate.

AB  - Within the objectives of the H2020 DIAMOND project, the paper investigates women’s needs and expectations as users of the bike-sharing service managed by Syndicat Mixte Autolib et Velib Métropole in the territory of Paris Region-Petite Couronne (France). The paper presents a thematic literature review focused on gender inclusion in bike-sharing schemes. The proposed methodological approach is based on (i) Geographic Information Systems for the analysis of geolocated open datasets related to land, sociodemographic and mobility characteristics of the areas surrounding each docking stations. This was aimed at identifying a short list of suitable bike-sharing docking stations, which were further characterized through: (ii) structured proprietary data focused on travel demand; (iii) onsite observations focused on universal design indicators; (iv) survey questionnaires focused on women’s concerns, needs and expectations; and (v) social media data from Twitter focused on the opinion of the end-users. Results showed that women use the VELIB’s bike-sharing service much less than men (about 30% of the total number of users), since they are more concerned about the following issues: accessibility (e.g., availability of bikes at the docking stations, distance to the nearest station, type and quality of the cycle paths); safety and security (e.g., perception of danger and insecurity while cycling and using the current bicycle infrastructures); social constraints (e.g., perceptions and cultural stigmatization associated with cycling and bike-sharing); weather and topography (e.g., impact of weather and the urban terrain on cycling and bike-sharing). The final aim of the H2020 DIAMOND project is to support the definition of guidelines and policies for the inclusion of women’s needs in the design of future bike-sharing services.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Cyber attackers exploit a network of compromised computing devices, known as a botnet, to attack Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. Recent research works have recommended the use of Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) for botnet attack detection in IoT networks. However, for high feature dimensionality in the training data, high network bandwidth and a large memory space will be needed to transmit and store the data, respectively in IoT back-end server or cloud platform for Deep Learning (DL). Furthermore, given highly imbalanced network traffic data, the DRNN model produces low classification performance in minority classes. In this paper, we exploit the joint advantages of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder (LAE), Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and DRNN to develop a memory-efficient DL method, named LS-DRNN. The effectiveness of this method is evaluated with the Bot-IoT dataset. Results show that the LAE method reduced the dimensionality of network traffic features in the training set from 37 to 10, and this consequently reduced the memory space required for data storage by 86.49%. SMOTE method helped the LS-DRNN model to achieve high classification performance in minority classes, and the overall detection rate increased by 10.94%. Furthermore, the LS-DRNN model outperformed state-of-the-art models.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Data aggregation may be considered as the technique through which streams of data gathered from Smart Meters (SMs) can be processed and transmitted to a Utility Control Center (UCC) in a reliable and cost-efficient manner without compromising the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In a typical Smart Grid (SG) paradigm, the UCC is usually located far away from the consumers (SMs), which has led to a degradation in network performance. Although the data aggregation technique has been recognized as a favorable solution to optimize the network performance of the SG, the underlying issue to date is to determine the optimal locations for the Data Aggregation Points (DAPs), where network coverage and full connectivity for all SMs deployed within the network are achieved. In addition, the main concern of the aggregation technique is to minimize transmission and computational costs. In this sense, the number of DAPs deployed should be as minimal as possible while satisfying the QoS requirements of the SG. This paper presents a Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) placement scheme based on the unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm with silhouette index method to determine the efficient number of DAPs required under different SM densities and find the best locations for the deployment of DAPs. Poisson Point Process (PPP) has been deployed to model the locations of the SMs. The simulation results presented in this paper indicate that the NAN placement scheme based on the ageless unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm not only improves the accuracy in determining the number of DAPs required and their locations but may also improve the network performance significantly in terms of network coverage and full connectivity.

AB  - Studies on human mobility have a long history with increasingly strong interdisciplinary connections across social science, environmental science, information and technology, computer science, engineering, and health science. However, what is lacking in the current research is a synthesis of the studies to identify the evolutional pathways and future research directions. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic review of human mobility-related studies published from 1990 to 2020. Drawing on the selected publications retrieved from the Web of Science, we provide a bibliometric analysis and network visualisation using CiteSpace and VOSviewer on the number of publications and year published, authors and their countries and afflictions, citations, topics, abstracts, keywords, and journals. Our findings show that human mobility-related studies have become increasingly interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional, which have been strengthened by the use of the so-called ‘big data’ from multiple sources, the development of computer technologies, the innovation of modelling approaches, and the novel applications in various areas. Based on our synthesis of the work by top cited authors we identify four directions for future research relating to data sources, modelling methods, applications, and technologies. We advocate for more in-depth research on human mobility using multi-source big data, improving modelling methods and integrating advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, and machine and deep learning to address real-world problems and contribute to social good.

AB  - The development of a smart city and digital twin requires the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), where BIM models are to be integrated into GIS for visualization and/or analysis. However, the intrinsic differences between BIM and GIS have led to enormous problems in BIM-to-GIS data conversion, and the use of City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) has further escalated this issue. This study aims to facilitate the use of BIM models in GIS by proposing using the shapefile format, and a creative approach for converting Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to shapefile was developed by integrating a computer graphics technique. Thirteen building models were used to validate the proposed method. The result shows that: (1) the IFC-to-shapefile conversion is easier and more flexible to realize than the IFC-to-CityGML conversion, and (2) the computer graphics technique can improve the efficiency and reliability of BIM-to-GIS data conversion. This study can facilitate the use of BIM information in GIS and benefit studies working on digital twins and smart cities where building models are to be processed and integrated in GIS, or any other studies that need to manipulate IFC geometry in depth.

AB  - Wearable technologies are becoming a profitable means of monitoring a person’s health state, such as heart rate and physical activity. The use of the smartwatch is becoming consolidated, not only as a novelty but also as a very useful tool for daily use. In addition, other devices, such as helmets or belts, are beneficial for monitoring workers and the early detection of any anomaly. They can provide valuable information, especially in work environments, where they help reduce the rate of accidents and occupational diseases, which makes them powerful Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The constant monitoring of the worker’s health can be done in real-time, through temperature, falls, noise, impacts, or heart rate meters, activating an audible and vibrating alarm when an anomaly is detected. The gathered information is transmitted to a server in charge of collecting and processing it. In the first place, this paper provides an exhaustive review of the state of the art on works related to electronics for human activity behavior. After that, a smart multisensory bracelet, combined with other devices, developed a control platform that can improve operators’ security in the working environment. Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things (AIoT) bring together the information to improve safety on construction sites, power stations, power lines, etc. Real-time and historic data is used to monitor operators’ health and a hybrid system between Gaussian Mixture Model and Human Activity Classification. That is, our contribution is also founded on the use of two machine learning models, one based on unsupervised learning and the other one supervised. Where the GMM gave us a performance of 80%, 85%, 70%, and 80% for the 4 classes classified in real time, the LSTM obtained a result under the confusion matrix of 0.769, 0.892, and 0.921 for the carrying-displacing, falls, and walking-standing activities, respectively. This information was sent in real time through the platform that has been used to analyze and process the data in an alarm system.

AB  - The paper concerns multicast packet traffic throughput maximization in multi-hop wireless sensor networks with time division multiple access to radio channel. We assume that the modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) that are used by the (broadcasting) nodes as well as the transmission power of the nodes are adjustable. This leads to the main research question studied in this paper: to what extent traffic throughput can be increased by proper MCSs assignment and transmission power control (TPC) at the nodes? To answer this question, we introduce mixed-integer programming formulations for joint MCSs assignment and TPC optimization, together with a solution algorithm. Finally, we present a numerical study illustrating the considerations of the paper. The numerical results show a significant gain being achieved by proper MCSs assignment, which is further increased by applying TPC.

AB  - The emerging paradigm of the cognitive city, which augments smart cities with learning and behavioral change capabilities, is gaining increasing attention as a promising solution to the challenges of future mega-cities. Cognitive cities are built upon artificial learning and behavioral analysis techniques founded on the exploitation of human-machine collective intelligence. Hence, cognitive cities rely on the sharing of citizens’ daily-life data, which might be considered sensitive personal data. In this context, privacy and security of the shared information become critical issues that have to be addressed to guarantee the proper deployment of cognitive cities and the fundamental rights of people. This article provides a thorough literature review using the recommendations for systematic reviews proposed by Vom Brocke et al. and the PRISMA statement. We analyze peer-reviewed publications indexed in ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science until July 2020. We identify the main challenges on privacy and information security within cognitive cities, and the proposals described in the literature to address them. We conclude that many challenges remain open and we suggest several research lines that will require further examination in the years to come.

AB  - With growing evidence of the operational performance of cyber-physical manufacturing systems, there is a pivotal need for comprehending sustainable, smart, and sensing technologies underpinning data-driven decision-making processes. In this research, previous findings were cumulated showing that cyber-physical production networks operate automatically and smoothly with artificial intelligence-based decision-making algorithms in a sustainable manner and contribute to the literature by indicating that sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing systems function in an automated, robust, and flexible manner. Throughout October 2020 and April 2021, a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases was performed, with search terms including “Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics”, “sustainable smart manufacturing”, “cyber-physical production system”, “industrial big data”, “sustainable organizational performance”, “cyber-physical smart manufacturing system”, and “sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing system”. As research published between 2018 and 2021 was inspected, and only 426 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. By taking out controversial or ambiguous findings (insufficient/irrelevant data), outcomes unsubstantiated by replication, too general material, or studies with nearly identical titles, we selected 174 mainly empirical sources. Further developments should entail how cyber-physical production networks and Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics, by use of cognitive decision-making algorithms, enable the advancement of data-driven sustainable smart manufacturing.

AB  - Since architect Nicholas Negroponte first proposed a vision of responsive architecture smart environments have been widely investigated, especially in the fields of computer science and engineering. Despite growing interest in the topic, a comprehensive review of research about smart environments from the architectural perspective is largely missing. In order to provide a formal understanding of smart environments in architecture, this paper conducts a systematic literature review of scholarly sources over the last decade, focusing on four related subjects: (1) responsive architecture, (2) kinetic architecture, (3) adaptive architecture and (4) intelligent buildings. Through this review, the paper identifies and examines interactive and collective behaviors in smart environments, thereby contributing to defining the properties of creative, smart spaces in the contemporary digital ecosystem. In addition, this research offers a means of systematically characterizing and constructing smart environments as interactive and collective platforms, enabling occupants to sense, experience and understand smart spaces.

PY  - 2021

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Vehicle technology development drives economic development but also causes severe mobile pollution sources. Eco-driving is an effective driving strategy for solving air pollution and achieving driving safety. The on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II) module is a common monitoring tool used to acquire sensing data from in-vehicle electronic control units. However, different vehicle models use different controller area network (CAN) standards, resulting in communication difficulties; however, relevant literature has not discussed compatibility problems. The present study researched and developed the universal OBD-II module, adopted deep learning methods to evaluate fuel consumption, and proposed an intuitive driving graphic user interface design. In addition to using the universal module to obtain data on different CAN standards, this study used deep learning methods to analyze the fuel consumption of three vehicles of different brands on various road conditions. The accuracy was over 96%, thus validating the practicability of the developed system. This system will greatly benefit future applications that employ OBD-II to collect various types of driving data from different car models. For example, it can be implemented for achieving eco-driving in bus driver training. The developed system outperforms those proposed by previous research regarding its completeness and universality.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Maintaining a pleasant indoor environment with low energy consumption is important for healthy and comfortable living in buildings. In previous studies, we proposed the integrated comfort control (ICC) algorithm, which integrates several indoor environmental control devices, including an air conditioner, a ventilation system, and a humidifier. The ICC algorithm is operated by simple on/off control to maintain indoor temperature and relative humidity within a defined comfort range. This simple control method can cause inefficient building operation because it does not reflect the changes in indoor–outdoor environmental conditions and the status of the control devices. To overcome this limitation, we suggest the artificial intelligence integrated comfort control (AI2CC) algorithm using a double deep Q-network(DDQN), which uses a data-driven approach to find the optimal control of several environmental control devices to maintain thermal comfort with low energy consumption. The suggested AI2CC showed a good ability to learn how to operate devices optimally to improve indoor thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption. Compared to the previous approach (ICC), the AI2CC reduced energy consumption by 14.8%, increased the comfort ratio by 6.4%, and decreased the time to reach the comfort zone by 54.1 min.

AB  - The increasing interconnections of city services, the explosion of available urban data, and the need for multidisciplinary analysis and decision making for city sustainability require new technological solutions to cope with such complexity. Ontologies have become viable and effective tools to practitioners for developing applications requiring data and process interoperability, big data management, and automated reasoning on knowledge. We investigate how and to what extent ontologies have been used to support smart city services and we provide a comprehensive reference on what problems have been addressed and what has been achieved so far with ontology-based applications. To this purpose, we conducted a systematic literature review finalized to presenting the ontologies, and the methods and technological systems where ontologies play a relevant role in shaping current smart cities. Based on the result of the review process, we also propose a classification of the sub-domains of the city addressed by the ontologies we found, and the research issues that have been considered so far by the scientific community. We highlight those for which semantic technologies have been mostly demonstrated to be effective to enhance the smart city concept and, finally, discuss in more details about some open problems.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used extensively for search and rescue operations, surveillance, disaster monitoring, attacking terrorists, etc. due to their growing advantages of low-cost, high maneuverability, and easy deployability. This study proposes a mixed-integer programming model under a multi-objective optimization framework to design trajectories that enable a set of UAVs to execute surveillance tasks. The first objective maximizes the cumulative probability of target detection to aim for mission planning success. The second objective ensures minimization of cumulative path length to provide a higher resource utilization goal. A two-step variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is offered, which addresses the combinatorial optimization issue for determining the near-optimal sequence for cell visiting to reach the target. Numerical experiments and simulation results are evaluated in numerous benchmark instances. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach can favorably support practical deployability purposes.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 10
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The use of a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) in an urban traffic network allows for controlling the infrastructure of a traffic network and errors in its operations. In this research, a novel, stable predictive controller for urban traffic is proposed and state-space dynamics are used to estimate the number of vehicles at an isolated intersection and the length of its queue. This is a novel control strategy based on the type of traffic light and on the duration of the green-light phase and aims to achieve an optimal balance at intersections. This balance should be adaptable to the unchanging behavior of time and to the randomness of traffic situations. The proposed method reduces traffic volumes and the number of crashes involving cars by controlling traffic on an urban road using model predictive control. A single intersection in Tehran, the capital city of Iran, was considered in our study to control traffic signal timing, and model predictive control was used to reduce traffic. A model of traffic systems was extracted at the intersection, and the state-space parameters of the intersection were designed using the model predictive controller to control traffic signals based on the length of the vehicle queue and on the number of inbound and outbound vehicles, which were used as inputs. This process demonstrates that this method is able to reduce traffic volumes at each leg of an intersection and to optimize flow in a road network compared to the fixed-time method.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 5
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - In a post-earthquake scenario, the semantic enrichment of 3D building models with seismic damage is crucial from the perspective of disaster management. This paper aims to present the methodology and the results for the Level of Detail 3 (LOD3) building modelling (after an earthquake) with the enrichment of the semantics of the seismic damage based on the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98). The study area is the Vrisa traditional settlement on the island of Lesvos, Greece, which was affected by a devastating earthquake of Mw = 6.3 on 12 June 2017. The applied methodology consists of the following steps: (a) unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) nadir and oblique images are acquired and photogrammetrically processed for 3D point cloud generation, (b) 3D building models are created based on 3D point clouds and (c) 3D building models are transformed into a LOD3 City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) standard with enriched semantics of the related seismic damage of every part of the building (walls, roof, etc.). The results show that in following this methodology, CityGML LOD3 models can be generated and enriched with buildings’ seismic damage. These models can assist in the decision-making process during the recovery phase of a settlement as well as be the basis for its monitoring over time. Finally, these models can contribute to the estimation of the reconstruction cost of the buildings.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Smart cities and communities (SCC) constitute a new paradigm in urban development. SCC ideate a data-centered society aimed at improving efficiency by automating and optimizing activities and utilities. Information and communication technology along with Internet of Things enables data collection and with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) situation awareness can be obtained to feed the SCC actors with enriched knowledge. This paper describes AI perspectives in SCC and gives an overview of AI-based technologies used in traffic to enable road vehicle automation and smart traffic control. Perception, smart traffic control and driver modeling are described along with open research challenges and standardization to help introduce advanced driver assistance systems and automated vehicle functionality in traffic. To fully realize the potential of SCC, to create a holistic view on a city level, availability of data from different stakeholders is necessary. Further, though AI technologies provide accurate predictions and classifications, there is an ambiguity regarding the correctness of their outputs. This can make it difficult for the human operator to trust the system. Today there are no methods that can be used to match function requirements with the level of detail in data annotation in order to train an accurate model. Another challenge related to trust is explainability: models can have difficulty explaining how they came to certain conclusions, so it is difficult for humans to trust them.

T2  - Energies

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Demand Response (DR) programs represent an effective way to optimally manage building energy demand while increasing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) integration and grid reliability, helping the decarbonization of the electricity sector. To fully exploit such opportunities, buildings are required to become sources of energy flexibility, adapting their energy demand to meet specific grid requirements. However, in most cases, the energy flexibility of a single building is typically too small to be exploited in the flexibility market, highlighting the necessity to perform analysis at a multiple-building scale. This study explores the economic benefits associated with the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control strategy for the participation in an incentive-based demand response program of a cluster of commercial buildings. To this purpose, optimized Rule-Based Control (RBC) strategies are compared with a RL controller. Moreover, a hybrid control strategy exploiting both RBC and RL is proposed. Results show that the RL algorithm outperforms the RBC in reducing the total energy cost, but it is less effective in fulfilling DR requirements. The hybrid controller achieves a reduction in energy consumption and energy costs by respectively 7% and 4% compared to a manually optimized RBC, while fulfilling DR constraints during incentive-based events.

AB  - The smart city concept, in which data from different systems are available, contains a multitude of critical infrastructures. This data availability opens new research opportunities in the study of the interdependency between those critical infrastructures and cascading effects solutions and focuses on the smart city as a network of critical infrastructures. This paper proposes an integrated resilience system linking interconnected critical infrastructures in a smart city to improve disaster resilience. A data-driven approach is considered, using artificial intelligence and methods to minimize cascading effects and the destruction of failing critical infrastructures and their components (at a city level). The proposed approach allows rapid recovery of infrastructures’ service performance levels after disasters while keeping the coverage of the assessment of risks, prevention, detection, response, and mitigation of consequences. The proposed approach has the originality and the practical implication of providing a decision support system that handles the infrastructures that will support the city disaster management system—make the city prepare, adapt, absorb, respond, and recover from disasters by taking advantage of the interconnections between its various critical infrastructures to increase the overall resilience capacity. The city of Lisbon (Portugal) is used as a case to show the practical application of the approach.

AB  - Vehicular networks are the combination of transport systems and the internet systems formed with the main motive to increase the safety of passengers, although non-safety applications are also provided by vehicular networks. Internet of Things (IoT) has a subsection called Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET)m which in turn has a subsection called Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). Internet of Energy (IoE) is a new domain that is formed using electric vehicles connected with VANETs. As a large number of transport systems are coming into operation and various pervasive applications are designed to handle such networks, the increasing number of attacks in this domain is also creating threats. As IoE is connected to VANETs extension with electric cars, the future of VANETs can be a question if security measures are not significant. The present survey is an attempt to cover various attack types on vehicular networks with existing security solutions available to handle these attacks. This study will help researchers in getting in-depth information about the taxonomy of vehicular network security issues which can be explored further to design innovative solutions. This knowledge will also be helpful for new research directions, which in turn will help in the formulation of new strategies to handle attacks in a much better way.

VL  - 14

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Demand response has been widely developed during recent years to increase efficiency and decrease the cost in the electric power sector by shifting energy use, smoothening the load curve, and thus ensuring benefits for all participating parties. This paper introduces a Demand Response Alert Service (DRAS) that can optimize the interaction between the energy industry parties and end users by sending the minimum number of relatable alerts to satisfy the transformation of the load curve. The service creates appliance models for certain deferrable appliances based on past-usage measurements and prioritizes households according to the probability of the use of their appliances. Several variations of the appliance model are examined with respect to the probabilistic association of appliance usage on different days. The service is evaluated for a peak-shaving scenario when either one or more appliances per household are involved. The results demonstrate a significant improvement compared to a random selection of end users, thus promising increased participation and engagement. Indicatively, in terms of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) index, the proposed method achieves, in all the studied scenarios, an improvement ranging between 41.33% and 64.64% compared to the baseline scenario. In terms of the F1 score index, the respective improvement reaches up to 221.05%.

AB  - Smart buildings use Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for monitoring indoor environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, luminosity, and air quality. Due to the huge amount of data generated by these sensors, data analytics and machine learning techniques are needed to extract useful and interesting insights, which provide the input for the building optimization in terms of energy-saving, occupants’ health and comfort. In this paper, we propose an IoT-based smart building (SB) solution for indoor environment management, which aims to provide the following main functionalities: monitoring of the room environmental parameters; detection of the number of occupants in the room; a cloud platform where virtual entities collect the data acquired by the sensors and virtual super entities perform data analysis tasks using machine learning algorithms; a control dashboard for the management and control of the building. With our prototype, we collected data for 10 days, and we built two prediction models: a classification model that predicts the number of occupants based on the monitored environmental parameters (average accuracy of 99.5%), and a regression model that predicts the total volatile organic compound (TVOC) values based on the environmental parameters and the number of occupants (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.939).

AB  - Skin cancer is one of the most dangerous forms of cancer. Skin cancer is caused by un-repaired deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in skin cells, which generate genetic defects or mutations on the skin. Skin cancer tends to gradually spread over other body parts, so it is more curable in initial stages, which is why it is best detected at early stages. The increasing rate of skin cancer cases, high mortality rate, and expensive medical treatment require that its symptoms be diagnosed early. Considering the seriousness of these issues, researchers have developed various early detection techniques for skin cancer. Lesion parameters such as symmetry, color, size, shape, etc. are used to detect skin cancer and to distinguish benign skin cancer from melanoma. This paper presents a detailed systematic review of deep learning techniques for the early detection of skin cancer. Research papers published in well-reputed journals, relevant to the topic of skin cancer diagnosis, were analyzed. Research findings are presented in tools, graphs, tables, techniques, and frameworks for better understanding.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Data centers are widely recognized for demanding many energy resources. The greater the computational demand, the greater the use of resources operating together. Consequently, the greater the heat, the greater the need for cooling power, and the greater the energy consumption. In this context, this article aims to report an industrial experience of achieving energy efficiency in a data center through a new layout proposal, reuse of previously existing resources, and air conditioning. We used the primary resource to adopt a cold corridor confinement, the increase of the raised floor’s height, and a better direction of the cold airflow for the aspiration at the servers’ entrance. We reused the three legacy refrigeration machines from the old data center, and no new ones were purchased. In addition to 346 existing devices, 80 new pieces of equipment were added (between servers and network assets) as a load to be cooled. Even with the increase in the amount of equipment, the implementations contributed to energy efficiency compared to the old data center, still reducing approximately 41% of the temperature and, consequently, energy-saving.

TI  - An Approach for Realizing Hybrid Digital Twins Using Asset Administration Shells and Apache StreamPipes
T2  - Information

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - Digital twins (DTs) are digital representations of assets, capturing their attributes and behavior. They are one of the cornerstones of Industry 4.0. Current DT standards are still under development, and so far, they typically allow for representing DTs only by attributes. Yet, knowledge about the behavior of assets is essential to properly control and interact with them, especially in the context of industrial production. This behavior is typically represented by multiple different models, making integration and orchestration within a DT difficult to manage. In this paper, we propose a new approach for hybrid DTs by intertwining different DT models. We also show how to realize this approach by combining the Fraunhofer Asset Administration Shell (AAS) Tools for Digital Twins (FAST) to create Industry 4.0-compliant DTs with Apache StreamPipes to implement and manage multiple DT models. Our prototype implementation is limited to a subset of the AAS metamodel and pull-based communication between FAST and an external Apache StreamPipes instance. Future work should provide full support for the AAS metamodel, publish/subscribe-based communication, and other execution environments as well as deployment strategies. We also present how this approach has been applied to a real-world use case in the steel production industry.

AB  - Artificial intelligence in the fourth industrial revolution is beginning to live up to its promises of delivering real value necessitated by the availability of relevant data, computational ability, and algorithms. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the influence of artificial intelligence on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals with a direct focus on poverty reduction, goal one, industry, innovation, and infrastructure development goal 9, in emerging economies. Using content analysis, the result pointed to the fact that artificial intelligence has a strong influence on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals particularly on poverty reduction, improvement of the certainty and reliability of infrastructure like transport making economic growth and development possible in emerging economies. The results revealed that Artificial intelligence is making poverty reduction possible through improving the collection of poverty-related data through poverty maps, revolutionizing agriculture education and the finance sector through financial inclusion. The study also discovered that AI is also assisting a lot in education, and the financial sector allowing the previously excluded individuals to be able to participate in the mainstream economy. Therefore, it is important that governments in emerging economies need to invest more in the use of AI and increase the research related to it so that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to innovation, infrastructure development, poverty reduction are attained.

TI  - Graph-Based Modeling in Shop Scheduling Problems: Review and Extensions
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Graphs are powerful tools to model manufacturing systems and scheduling problems. The complexity of these systems and their scheduling problems has been substantially increased by the ongoing technological development. Thus, it is essential to generate sustainable graph-based modeling approaches to deal with these excessive complexities. Graphs employ nodes and edges to represent the relationships between jobs, machines, operations, etc. Despite the significant volume of publications applying graphs to shop scheduling problems, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey study. We proposed the first comprehensive review paper which (1) systematically studies the overview and the perspective of this field, (2) highlights the gaps and potential hotspots of the literature, and (3) suggests future research directions towards sustainable graphs modeling the new intelligent/complex systems. We carefully examined 143 peer-reviewed journal papers published from 2015 to 2020. About 70% of our dataset were published in top-ranked journals which confirms the validity of our data and can imply the importance of this field. After discussing our generic data collection methodology, we proposed categorizations over the properties of the scheduling problems and their solutions. Then, we discussed our novel categorization over the variety of graphs modeling scheduling problems. Finally, as the most important contribution, we generated a creative graph-based model from scratch to represent the gaps and hotspots of the literature accompanied with statistical analysis on our dataset. Our analysis showed a significant attention towards job shop systems (56%) and Un/Directed Graphs (52%) where edges can be either directed, or undirected, or both, Whereas 14% of our dataset applied only Undirected Graphs and 11% targeted hybrid systems, e.g., mixed shop, flexible, and cellular manufacturing systems, which shows potential future research directions.

SN  - 2077-0472

AB  - With the implementation of the Internet of Things, the agricultural domain has become data-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm management while remaining environmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain is the need of the hour for developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends on the farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure for precision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with a methodological paradigm which can accommodate a complete model to connect ground sensors to the compute nodes in a cost-effective way by keeping the data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In this regard, this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed in precision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with respect to heavy metal in agricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly, this manuscript illustrates the processing of data generated from the sensors. In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from cloud computing has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efficient offloading of data with smooth workflow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims to open a new corridor for the farming sector in developing nations by tackling challenges and providing substantial consideration.

VL  - 4

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Global warming contributes to the worldwide goal of a sustainable carbon-neutral society. Currently, hydroelectric, wind and solar power plants are the most competitive renewable technologies. They are limited to the primary resource availability, but while hydroelectric power plants (HPPs) can have storage capacity but have several geographical limitations, wind and solar power plants have variable renewable energy (VRE) with stochastic profiles, requiring a substantially higher investment when equipped with battery energy storage systems. One of the most affordable solutions to compensate the stochastic behaviour of VRE is the active participation of consumers with demand response capability. Therefore, the role of citizen energy communities (CECs) can be important towards a carbon-neutral society. This work presents the economic and environmental advantages of CECs, by aggregating consumers, prosumers and VRE at the distribution level, considering microgrid trades, but also establishing bilateral agreements with large-scale VRE and HPPs, and participating in electricity markets. Results from the case-study prove the advantages of CECs and self-consumption. Currently, CECs have potential to be carbon-neutral in relation to electricity consumption and reduce consumers’ costs with its variable term until 77%. In the future, electrification may allow CECs to be fully carbon-neutral, if they increase their flexibility portfolio.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 11
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The aim of the article is to present and analyze the implementation of intelligent lighting within the concept of smart energies and smart cities. Motivation and research hypothesis: Electricity consumption in the world is based largely on non-renewable energy. Until these full changes, it is necessary to look for opportunities to save and use it efficiently. Today’s cities are increasingly implementing the smart concept, of which smart energy is one area. One of the smart city elements implemented by cities is smart energy. Within this framework, a supported concept is the replacement of traditional lighting with LEDs (Light-Emitting Diodes), which contributes to energy and cost savings and reduces the pollution of the sky with artificial light, while increasing the efficiency of urban lighting. Positive effects of modern solutions include reduced lighting expenses and increased safety of residents. Methods and results of the research: The authors chose the case study method for their research. The authors present forecasts for the development, not only from the point of view of the number of lamps but also the cost efficiency pointing out the importance of this element in the context of building smart cities. These are specific benchmarks for cities that have not yet implemented this concept. Conclusions and interdisciplinary implications: solutions are desirable directions for the development of the smart city concept, bringing benefits and reducing external costs. Considerations show a quantitative development forecast and an indication of the possibility of achieving trade-offs and cost reductions. It translates into meeting the requirements of sustainable development providing tangible benefits. The analysis of the case studies is intended to show the effects that can be achieved and the wide range of applications (indicating that modern lamps are not just lighting, but a platform for urban services). The analyses presented are intended to serve as benchmarks showing the possibilities of reducing costs and increasing the quality of life of residents in modern cities. The indicated examples and analyses are of economic importance, they show managers, but also inhabitants, in which direction they should lead the smart city concept, which will allow saving costs, but also to increase the quality of life of inhabitants.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The advancement in recent IoT devices has led to catastrophic attacks on the devices resulting in breaches in user privacy and exhausting resources of various organizations, so that users and organizations expend increased time and money. One such harmful malware is Mirai, which has created worldwide recognition by impacting the digital world. There are several ways to detect Mirai, but the Machine Learning approach has proved to be accurate and reliable in detecting malware. In this research, a novel-based approach of detecting Mirai using Machine Learning Algorithm is proposed and implemented in Matlab and Python. To evaluate the proposed approaches, Mirai and Benign datasets are considered and training is performed on the dataset comprised of a Training set, Cross-Validation set and Test set using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) consisting of neurons in the hidden layer, which provides consistent accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 score. In this research, an accurate number of hidden layers and neurons are chosen to avoid the problem of Overfitting. This research provides a comparative analysis between ANN and Random Forest models of the dataset formed by merging Mirai and benign datasets of the Mirai malware detection pertaining to seven IoT devices. The dataset used in this research is “N-BaIoT” dataset, which represents data in the features infected by Mirai Malware. The results are found to be accurate and reliable as the best performance was achieved with an accuracy of 92.8% and False Negative rate of 0.3% and F-1 score of 0.99. The expected outcomes of this project, include major findings towards cost-effective Learning solutions in detecting Mirai Malware strains.

AB  - Weeds are one of the most important factors affecting agricultural production. The waste and pollution of farmland ecological environment caused by full-coverage chemical herbicide spraying are becoming increasingly evident. With the continuous improvement in the agricultural production level, accurately distinguishing crops from weeds and achieving precise spraying only for weeds are important. However, precise spraying depends on accurately identifying and locating weeds and crops. In recent years, some scholars have used various computer vision methods to achieve this purpose. This review elaborates the two aspects of using traditional image-processing methods and deep learning-based methods to solve weed detection problems. It provides an overview of various methods for weed detection in recent years, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods, and introduces several related plant leaves, weed datasets, and weeding machinery. Lastly, the problems and difficulties of the existing weed detection methods are analyzed, and the development trend of future research is prospected.

T2  - Data

PY  - 2021
VL  - 6

SN  - 2306-5729

AB  - To predict the future behavior of a system, we can exploit the information collected in the past, trying to identify recurring structures in what happened to predict what could happen, if the same structures repeat themselves in the future as well. A time series represents a time sequence of numerical values observed in the past at a measurable variable. The values are sampled at equidistant time intervals, according to an appropriate granular frequency, such as the day, week, or month, and measured according to physical units of measurement. In machine learning-based algorithms, the information underlying the knowledge is extracted from the data themselves, which are explored and analyzed in search of recurring patterns or to discover hidden causal associations or relationships. The prediction model extracts knowledge through an inductive process: the input is the data and, possibly, a first example of the expected output, the machine will then learn the algorithm to follow to obtain the same result. This paper reviews the most recent work that has used machine learning-based techniques to extract knowledge from time series data.

AB  - Smart Agriculture or Agricultural Internet of things, consists of integrating advanced technologies (e.g., NFV, SDN, 5G/6G, Blockchain, IoT, Fog, Edge, and AI) into existing farm operations to improve the quality and productivity of agricultural products. The convergence of Industry 4.0 and Intelligent Agriculture provides new opportunities for migration from factory agriculture to the future generation, known as Agriculture 4.0. However, since the deployment of thousands of IoT based devices is in an open field, there are many new threats in Agriculture 4.0. Security researchers are involved in this topic to ensure the safety of the system since an adversary can initiate many cyber attacks, such as DDoS attacks to making a service unavailable and then injecting false data to tell us that the agricultural equipment is safe but in reality, it has been theft. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based intrusion detection system for DDoS attacks based on three models, namely, convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Each model’s performance is studied within two classification types (binary and multiclass) using two new real traffic datasets, namely, CIC-DDoS2019 dataset and TON_IoT dataset, which contain different types of DDoS attacks.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The share of renewable and distributed energy resources (DERs), like wind turbines, solar photovoltaics and grid-connected batteries, interconnected to the electric grid is rapidly increasing due to reduced costs, rising efficiency, and regulatory requirements aimed at incentivizing a lower-carbon electricity system. These distributed energy resources differ from traditional generation in many ways including the use of many smaller devices connected primarily (but not exclusively) to the distribution network, rather than few larger devices connected to the transmission network. DERs being installed today often include modern communication hardware like cellular modems and WiFi connectivity and, in addition, the inverters used to connect these resources to the grid are gaining increasingly complex capabilities, like providing voltage and frequency support or supporting microgrids. To perform these new functions safely, communications to the device and more complex controls are required. The distributed nature of DER devices combined with their network connectivity and complex controls interfaces present a larger potential attack surface for adversaries looking to create instability in power systems. To address this area of concern, the steps of a cyberattack on DERs have been studied, including the security of industrial protocols, the misuse of the DER interface, and the physical impacts. These different steps have not previously been tied together in practice and not specifically studied for grid-connected storage devices. In this work, we focus on grid-connected batteries. We explore the potential impacts of a cyberattack on a battery to power system stability, to the battery hardware, and on economics for various stakeholders. We then use real hardware to demonstrate end-to-end attack paths exist when security features are disabled or misconfigured. Our experimental focus is on control interface security and protocol security, with the initial assumption that an adversary has gained access to the network to which the device is connected. We provide real examples of the effectiveness of certain defenses. This work can be used to help utilities and other grid-connected battery owners and operators evaluate the severity of different threats and the effectiveness of defense strategies so they can effectively deploy and protect grid-connected storage devices.

AB  - Computer Vision is a cross-research field with the main purpose of understanding the surrounding environment as closely as possible to human perception. The image processing systems is continuously growing and expanding into more complex systems, usually tailored to the certain needs or applications it may serve. To better serve this purpose, research on the architecture and design of such systems is also important. We present the End-to-End Computer Vision Framework, an open-source solution that aims to support researchers and teachers within the image processing vast field. The framework has incorporated Computer Vision features and Machine Learning models that researchers can use. In the continuous need to add new Computer Vision algorithms for a day-to-day research activity, our proposed framework has an advantage given by the configurable and scalar architecture. Even if the main focus of the framework is on the Computer Vision processing pipeline, the framework offers solutions to incorporate even more complex activities, such as training Machine Learning models. EECVF aims to become a useful tool for learning activities in the Computer Vision field, as it allows the learner and the teacher to handle only the topics at hand, and not the interconnection necessary for visual processing flow.

AB  - With the majority of research, in relation to 3D object reconstruction, focusing on single static synthetic object reconstruction, there is a need for a method capable of reconstructing morphing objects in dynamic scenes without external influence. However, such research requires a time-consuming creation of real world object ground truths. To solve this, we propose a novel three-staged deep adversarial neural network architecture capable of denoising and refining real-world depth sensor input for full human body posture reconstruction. The proposed network has achieved Earth Mover and Chamfer distances of 0.059 and 0.079 on synthetic datasets, respectively, which indicates on-par experimental results with other approaches, in addition to the ability of reconstructing from maskless real world depth frames. Additional visual inspection to the reconstructed pointclouds has shown that the suggested approach manages to deal with the majority of the real world depth sensor noise, with the exception of large deformities to the depth field.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - This paper reviews the different remote sensing techniques found in the literature to monitor plant water status, allowing farmers to control the irrigation management and to avoid unnecessary periods of water shortage and a needless waste of valuable water. The scope of this paper covers a broad range of 77 references published between the years 1981 and 2021 and collected from different search web sites, especially Scopus. Among them, 74 references are research papers and the remaining three are review papers. The different collected approaches have been categorized according to the part of the plant subjected to measurement, that is, soil (12.2%), canopy (33.8%), leaves (35.1%) or trunk (18.9%). In addition to a brief summary of each study, the main monitoring technologies have been analyzed in this review. Concerning the presentation of the data, different results have been obtained. According to the year of publication, the number of published papers has increased exponentially over time, mainly due to the technological development over the last decades. The most common sensor is the radiometer, which is employed in 15 papers (20.3%), followed by continuous-wave (CW) spectroscopy (12.2%), camera (10.8%) and THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) (10.8%). Excluding two studies, the minimum coefficient of determination (R2) obtained in the references of this review is 0.64. This indicates the high degree of correlation between the estimated and measured data for the different technologies and monitoring methods. The five most frequent water indicators of this study are: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (12.2%), backscattering coefficients (10.8%), spectral reflectance (8.1%), reflection coefficient (8.1%) and dielectric constant (8.1%).

PY  - 2021

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Facial emotion recognition (FER) is the procedure of identifying human emotions from facial expressions. It is often difficult to identify the stress and anxiety levels of an individual through the visuals captured from computer vision. However, the technology enhancements on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have yielded impressive results from gathering various forms of emotional and physical health-related data. The novel deep learning (DL) algorithms are allowing to perform application in a resource-constrained edge environment, encouraging data from IoMT devices to be processed locally at the edge. This article presents an IoMT based facial emotion detection and recognition system that has been implemented in real-time by utilizing a small, powerful, and resource-constrained device known as Raspberry-Pi with the assistance of deep convolution neural networks. For this purpose, we have conducted one empirical study on the facial emotions of human beings along with the emotional state of human beings using physiological sensors. It then proposes a model for the detection of emotions in real-time on a resource-constrained device, i.e., Raspberry-Pi, along with a co-processor, i.e., Intel Movidius NCS2. The facial emotion detection test accuracy ranged from 56% to 73% using various models, and the accuracy has become 73% performed very well with the FER 2013 dataset in comparison to the state of art results mentioned as 64% maximum. A t-test is performed for extracting the significant difference in systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and the heart rate of an individual watching three different subjects (angry, happy, and neutral).

AB  - Energy demand and generation are common variables that need to be forecast in recent years, due to the necessity for energy self-consumption via storage and Demand Side Management. This work studies multi-step time series forecasting models for energy with confidence intervals for each time point, accompanied by a demand optimization algorithm, for energy management in partly or completely isolated islands. Particularly, the forecasting is performed via numerous traditional and contemporary machine learning regression models, which receive as input past energy data and weather forecasts. During pre-processing, the historical data are grouped into sets of months and days of week based on clustering models, and a separate regression model is automatically selected for each of them, as well as for each forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the multi-criteria optimization algorithm is implemented for demand scheduling with load shifting, assuming that, at each time point, demand is within its confidence interval resulting from the forecasting algorithm. Both clustering and multiple model training proved to be beneficial to forecasting compared to traditional training. The Normalized Root Mean Square Error of the forecasting models ranged approximately from 0.17 to 0.71, depending on the forecasting difficulty. It also appeared that the optimization algorithm can simultaneously increase renewable penetration and achieve load peak shaving, while also saving consumption cost in one of the tested islands. The global improvement estimation of the optimization algorithm ranged approximately from 5% to 38%, depending on the flexibility of the demand patterns.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel congested crowd counting network for crowd density estimation, i.e., the Adaptive Multi-scale Context Aggregation Network (MSCANet). MSCANet efficiently leverages the spatial context information to accomplish crowd density estimation in a complicated crowd scene. To achieve this, a multi-scale context learning block, called the Multi-scale Context Aggregation module (MSCA), is proposed to first extract different scale information and then adaptively aggregate it to capture the full scale of the crowd. Employing multiple MSCAs in a cascaded manner, the MSCANet can deeply utilize the spatial context information and modulate preliminary features into more distinguishing and scale-sensitive features, which are finally applied to a 1 × 1 convolution operation to obtain the crowd density results. Extensive experiments on three challenging crowd counting benchmarks showed that our model yielded compelling performance against the other state-of-the-art methods. To thoroughly prove the generality of MSCANet, we extend our method to two relevant tasks: crowd localization and remote sensing object counting. The extension experiment results also confirmed the effectiveness of MSCANet.

AB  - Information technology and the popularity of mobile devices allow for various types of customer data, such as purchase history and behavior patterns, to be collected. As customer data accumulate, the demand for recommender systems that provide customized services to customers is growing. Global e-commerce companies offer recommender systems to gain a sustainable competitive advantage. Research on recommender systems has consistently suggested that customer satisfaction will be highest when the recommendation algorithm is accurate and recommends a diversity of items. However, few studies have investigated the impact of accuracy and diversity on customer satisfaction. In this research, we seek to identify the factors determining customer satisfaction when using the recommender system. To this end, we develop several recommender systems and measure their ability to deliver accurate and diverse recommendations and their ability to generate customer satisfaction with diverse data sets. The results show that accuracy and diversity positively affect customer satisfaction when applying a deep learning-based recommender system. By contrast, only accuracy positively affects customer satisfaction when applying traditional recommender systems. These results imply that developers or managers of recommender systems need to identify factors that further improve customer satisfaction with the recommender system and promote the sustainable development of e-commerce.

With the advancement in technology, product designers and manufacturers can use new approaches to obtain information about their products and transform it into knowledge that they can use to improve the product. We developed the Poket Framework platform to facilitate the generation of product knowledge. In order to increase the reliability and safety in operation of electrical equipment, an evaluation is proposed, through tests and studies, using the original Poket Framework platform. Thus, several tests and studies were performed, which included testing and analyzing the correct integration in several use cases and remote data acquisition, and testing and analysis of the Poket Framework using literature established data sets of household appliances and electrical systems. Possible evolutions and Poket platform extensions are also considered.

AB  - Load forecasting (LF) has become the main concern in decentralized power generation systems with the smart grid revolution in the 21st century. As an intriguing research topic, it facilitates generation systems by providing essential information for load scheduling, demand-side integration, and energy market pricing and reducing cost. An intelligent LF model of residential loads using a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach, achieved by assembling an integration strategy model in a smart grid context, is proposed. The proposed model improves the LF by optimizing the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The time-series-based autoregression schemes were carried out to collect historical data and set the objective functions of the proposed model. An algorithm consisting of seven different autoregression models was also developed and validated through a feedforward adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model, based on the ML approach. Moreover, a binary genetic algorithm (BGA) was deployed for the best feature selection, and the best fitness score of the features was obtained with principal component analysis (PCA). A unique decision integration strategy is presented that led to a remarkably improved transformation in reducing MAPE. The model was tested using a one-year Pakistan Residential Electricity Consumption (PRECON) dataset, and the attained results verify that the proposed model obtained the best feature selection and achieved very promising values of MAPE of 1.70%, 1.77%, 1.80%, and 1.67% for summer, fall, winter, and spring seasons, respectively. The overall improvement percentage is 17%, which represents a substantial increase for small-scale decentralized generation units.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Last-mile operations in forward and reverse logistics are responsible for a large part of the costs, emissions, and times in supply chains. These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data- and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage.

AB  - Social media has become an essential facet of modern society, wherein people share their opinions on a wide variety of topics. Social media is quickly becoming indispensable for a majority of people, and many cases of social media addiction have been documented. Social media platforms such as Twitter have demonstrated over the years the value they provide, such as connecting people from all over the world with different backgrounds. However, they have also shown harmful side effects that can have serious consequences. One such harmful side effect of social media is the immense toxicity that can be found in various discussions. The word toxic has become synonymous with online hate speech, internet trolling, and sometimes outrage culture. In this study, we build an efficient model to detect and classify toxicity in social media from user-generated content using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The BERT pre-trained model and three of its variants has been fine-tuned on a well-known labeled toxic comment dataset, Kaggle public dataset (Toxic Comment Classification Challenge). Moreover, we test the proposed models with two datasets collected from Twitter from two different periods to detect toxicity in user-generated content (tweets) using hashtages belonging to the UK Brexit. The results showed that the proposed model can efficiently classify and analyze toxic tweets.

AB  - An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an active research topic and is regarded as one of the important applications of machine learning. An IDS is a classifier that predicts the class of input records associated with certain types of attacks. In this article, we present a review of IDSs from the perspective of machine learning. We present the three main challenges of an IDS, in general, and of an IDS for the Internet of Things (IoT), in particular, namely concept drift, high dimensionality, and computational complexity. Studies on solving each challenge and the direction of ongoing research are addressed. In addition, in this paper, we dedicate a separate section for presenting datasets of an IDS. In particular, three main datasets, namely KDD99, NSL, and Kyoto, are presented. This article concludes that three elements of concept drift, high-dimensional awareness, and computational awareness that are symmetric in their effect and need to be addressed in the neural network (NN)-based model for an IDS in the IoT.

AB  - The aim of this study was to fill the gap in the literature on e-learning acceptance and its role in the sustainability of learning and the role of task-technology fit (TTF), which influences student satisfaction and academic performance. While researchers have examined e-learning acceptance in a variety of contexts, the role of TTF as a mediating variable in measuring education sustainability has not been explored using the technology acceptance model (TAM). As a result, the goal of this study was to develop a new paradigm by combining two theories: TFF and the TAM. In total, 432 students and researchers from public universities participated in this study. We surveyed students using the structural equation modelling (SEM) approach to learn about their expectations with regard to e-learning adoption. According to the findings, perceived ease of use has a positive impact on perceived enjoyment and usefulness, which in turn has a positive impact on task–technology fit and e-learning use in higher education, resulting in a positive impact on student satisfaction and academic performance as well as sustainability. Finally, the role of task-technology fit and e-learning usage in education sustainability had a positive effect on student satisfaction and learning performance. As a result, the use of e-learning in learning processes should be encouraged as a long-term strategy in higher education institutions.

AB  - Over the decades, robotics technology has acquired sufficient advancement through the progression of 5G Internet, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, and Edge Computing. Though nowadays, Cobot and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) supported robots with edge computing paradigms have achieved remarkable performances in diverse applications, the existing SOA robotics technology fails to develop a multi-domain expert with high performing robots and demands improvement to Service-Oriented Brain, SOB (including AI model, driving service application and metadata) enabling robot for deploying brain and a new computing model with more scalability and flexibility. In this paper, instead of focusing on SOA and Robot as a Service (RaaS) model, we propose a novel computing architecture, addressed as Brainware Computing, for driving multiple domain-specific brains one-at-a-time in a single hardware robot according to the service, addressed as Brain as a Service (BaaS). In Brainware Computing, each robot can install and remove the virtual machine, which contains SOB and operating applications from the nearest edge cloud. Secondly, we provide an extensive explanation of the scope and possibilities of Brainware Computing. Finally, we demonstrate several challenges and opportunities and then concluded with future research directions in the field of Brainware Computing.

AB  - Anomaly detection has gained considerable attention in the past couple of years. Emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), are known to be among the most critical sources of data streams that produce massive amounts of data continuously from numerous applications. Examining these collected data to detect suspicious events can reduce functional threats and avoid unseen issues that cause downtime in the applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the data stream characteristics, many unresolved problems persist. In the existing literature, methods have been designed and developed to evaluate certain anomalous behaviors in IoT data stream sources. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that discuss all the aspects of IoT data processing. Thus, this paper attempts to fill this gap by providing a complete image of various state-of-the-art techniques on the major problems and core challenges in IoT data. The nature of data, anomaly types, learning mode, window model, datasets, and evaluation criteria are also presented. Research challenges related to data evolving, feature-evolving, windowing, ensemble approaches, nature of input data, data complexity and noise, parameters selection, data visualizations, heterogeneity of data, accuracy, and large-scale and high-dimensional data are investigated. Finally, the challenges that require substantial research efforts and future directions are summarized.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 12
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper deals with the synchronization of Mobile Smart Objects (MSOs). Today, this scenario is becoming typical in Industrial IoT applications due to the plethora of MSOs available as robots, drones and wearables, equipped by sensors making them measurement instruments cooperating in distributed measurement systems. In this context, the synchronization accuracy is directly tied with the accuracy of the performed measurements. In hierarchical synchronization approaches, the presence of an MSO makes the network topology time varying, and this could prevent the synchronization of the whole network. Peer to peer approaches do not need node hierarchy to synchronize but could not converge to a common sense of time. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a consensus-based approach for which the convergence to a common sense of time is here demonstrated. The proposal deploys the MSO to bring the common sense of time from an SO to another, establishing new paths among SOs. The new paths are temporary and depend on the MSO’s route. In the paper, the influence of the MSO’s route on the synchronization accuracy σ and the time interval to synchronize all the SOs ∆TIS is investigated, also. The mathematical proof, the simulations and the experimental tests confirm that the MSO can reduce both the values of σ and ∆TIS, because the new connections introduced by the MSO can boost the exchange of information among SOs. Consequently, the criteria to a priori select the route ameliorating σ and ∆TIS values are proposed.

AB  - The evolution of Mobile Networks and Internet of Things (IoT) architectures allows one to rethink the way smart cities infrastructures are designed and managed, and solve a number of problems in terms of human mobility. The territories that adopt the sensoring era can take advantage of this disruptive technology to improve the quality of mobility of their citizens and the rationalization of their resources. However, with this rapid development of smart terminals and infrastructures, as well as the proliferation of diversified applications, even current networks may not be able to completely meet quickly rising human mobility demands. Thus, they are facing many challenges and to cope with these challenges, different standards and projects have been proposed so far. Accordingly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been utilized as a new paradigm for the design and optimization of mobile networks with a high level of intelligence. The objective of this work is to identify and discuss the challenges of mobile networks, alongside IoT and AI, to characterize smart human mobility and to discuss some workable solutions to these challenges. Finally, based on this discussion, we propose paths for future smart human mobility researches.

AB  - Forecasting future driving conditions such as acceleration, velocity, and driver behaviors can greatly contribute to safety, mobility, and sustainability issues in the development of new energy vehicles (NEVs). In this brief, a review of existing velocity prediction techniques is studied from the perspective of traffic flow and vehicle lateral dynamics for the first time. A classification framework for velocity prediction in NEVs is presented where various state-of-the-art approaches are put forward. Firstly, we investigate road traffic flow models, under which a driving-scenario-based assessment is introduced. Secondly, vehicle speed prediction methods for NEVs are given where an extensive discussion on traffic flow model classification based on traffic big data and artificial intelligence is carried out. Thirdly, the influence of vehicle lateral dynamics and correlation control methods for vehicle speed prediction are reviewed. Suitable applications of each approach are presented according to their characteristics. Future trends and questions in the development of NEVs from different angles are discussed. Finally, different from existing review papers, we introduce application examples, demonstrating the potential applications of the highlighted concepts in next-generation intelligent transportation systems. To sum up, this review not only gives the first comprehensive analysis and review of road traffic network, vehicle handling stability, and velocity prediction strategies, but also indicates possible applications of each method to prospective designers, where researchers and scholars can better choose the right method on velocity prediction in the development of NEVs.

AB  - Nowadays, the growth in the consumption of energy and the need to face pollution resulting from its generation are causing concern for consumers and providers. Energy consumption in residential buildings and houses is about 22% of total energy production. Cutting-edge energy managers aim to optimize electrical devices in homes, taking into account users’ patterns, goals, and needs, by creating energy consumption awareness and helping current change habits. In this way, energy manager systems (EMSs) monitor and manage electrical appliances, automate and schedule actions, and make suggestions regarding electrical consumption. Furthermore, gamification strategies may change energy consumption patterns through energy managers, which are seen as an option to save energy and money. Therefore, this paper proposes a personalized gamification strategy for an EMS through an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) decision-making engine to classify the level of electrical consumption and persuade the end-user to reduce and modify consumption patterns, saving energy and money with gamified motivations. These strategies have proven to be effective in changing consumer behavior with intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. The interfaces consider three cases for summer and winter periods to calculate the saving-energy potentials: (1) for a type of user that is interested in home-improvement efforts while helping to save energy; (2) for a type of user that is advocating to save energy; (3) for a type of user that is not interested in saving energy. Hence, each interface considers the end-user’s current consumption and the possibility to modify their consumption habits using their current electrical devices. Finally, an interface displaying the electrical consumption for each case exemplifies its linkage with EMSs.

AB  - The global economy is now under threat due to the ongoing domestic and international lockdown for COVID-19. Many have already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the Corona era. Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and agriculture, there are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The roles of modern technology, the Internet of things, and artificial intelligence are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic prosperity in the post-COVID-19 economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by 2050 to meet global food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving food production and distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and addressing the double burden of malnutrition. As the world’s population is growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods, technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced. The urban smart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production, which can be introduced at any adaptive reuse, retrofit, or new buildings in vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity as well as its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and benefits. This review has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations in the development of the system, vertical farming management, and modern technologies approach.

AB  - Machine vision has been thoroughly studied in the past, but research thus far has lacked an engineering perspective on human vision. This paper addresses the observed and hypothetical neural behavior of the brain in relation to the visual system. In a human vision system, visual data are collected by photoreceptors in the eye, and these data are then transmitted to the rear of the brain for processing. There are millions of retinal photoreceptors of various types, and their signals must be unscrambled by the brain after they are carried through the optic nerves. This work is a forward step toward explaining how the photoreceptor locations and proximities are resolved by the brain. It is illustrated here that unlike in digital image sensors, there is no one-to-one sensor-to-processor identifier in the human vision system. Instead, the brain must go through an iterative learning process to identify the spatial locations of the photosensors in the retina. This involves a process called synaptic pruning, which can be simulated by a memristor-like component in a learning circuit model. The simulations and proposed mathematical models in this study provide a technique that can be extrapolated to create spatial distributions of networked sensors without a central observer or location knowledge base. Through the mapping technique, the retinal space with known configuration generates signals as scrambled data-feed to the logical space in the brain. This scrambled response is then reverse-engineered to map the logical space’s connectivity with the retinal space locations.

AB  - With the rapid rise of private vehicles around the world, License Plate Recognition (LPR) plays a vital role in supporting the government to manage vehicles effectively. However, an introduction of new types of license plate (LP) or slight changes in the LP format can break previous LPR systems, as they fail to recognize the LP. Moreover, the LPR system is extremely sensitive to the conditions of the surrounding environment. Thus, this paper introduces a novel deep learning-based Korean LPR system that can effectively deal with existing challenges. The main contributions of this study include (1) a robust LPR system with the integration of three pre-processing techniques (defogging, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution) that can effectively recognize the LP under various conditions, (2) the establishment of two original Korean LPR approaches for different scenarios, including whole license plate recognition (W-LPR) and single-character license plate recognition (SC-LPR), and (3) the introduction of two Korean LPR datasets (synthetic data and real data) involving a new type of LP introduced by the Korean government. Through several experiments, the proposed LPR framework achieved the highest recognition accuracy of 98.94%.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative condition that affects a patient’s everyday life. Authors have proposed that a machine learning and sensor-based approach that continuously monitors patients in naturalistic settings can provide constant evaluation of PD and objectively analyse its progression. In this paper, we make progress toward such PD evaluation by presenting a multimodal deep learning approach for discriminating between people with PD and without PD. Specifically, our proposed architecture, named MCPD-Net, uses two data modalities, acquired from vision and accelerometer sensors in a home environment to train variational autoencoder (VAE) models. These are modality-specific VAEs that predict effective representations of human movements to be fused and given to a classification module. During our end-to-end training, we minimise the difference between the latent spaces corresponding to the two data modalities. This makes our method capable of dealing with missing modalities during inference. We show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal and other multimodal approaches by an average increase in F1-score of 0.25 and 0.09, respectively, on a data set with real patients. We also show that our method still outperforms other approaches by an average increase in F1-score of 0.17 when a modality is missing during inference, demonstrating the benefit of training on multiple modalities.

TI  - Pixel-Level Fatigue Crack Segmentation in Large-Scale Images of Steel Structures Using an Encoder–Decoder Network

AB  - Fatigue cracks are critical types of damage in steel structures due to repeated loads and distortion effects. Fatigue crack growth may lead to further structural failure and even induce collapse. Efficient and timely fatigue crack detection and segmentation can support condition assessment, asset maintenance, and management of existing structures and prevent the early permit post and improve life cycles. In current research and engineering practices, visual inspection is the most widely implemented approach for fatigue crack inspection. However, the inspection accuracy of this method highly relies on the subjective judgment of the inspectors. Furthermore, it needs large amounts of cost, time, and labor force. Non-destructive testing methods can provide accurate detection results, but the cost is very high. To overcome the limitations of current fatigue crack detection methods, this study presents a pixel-level fatigue crack segmentation framework for large-scale images with complicated backgrounds taken from steel structures by using an encoder-decoder network, which is modified from the U-net structure. To effectively train and test the images with large resolutions such as 4928 × 3264 pixels or larger, the large images were cropped into small images for training and testing. The final segmentation results of the original images are obtained by assembling the segment results in the small images. Additionally, image post-processing including opening and closing operations were implemented to reduce the noises in the segmentation maps. The proposed method achieved an acceptable accuracy of automatic fatigue crack segmentation in terms of average intersection over union (mIOU). A comparative study with an FCN model that implements ResNet34 as backbone indicates that the proposed method using U-net could give better fatigue crack segmentation performance with fewer training epochs and simpler model structure. Furthermore, this study also provides helpful considerations and recommendations for researchers and practitioners in civil infrastructure engineering to apply image-based fatigue crack detection.

TI  - An Evolving TinyML Compression Algorithm for IoT Environments Based on Data Eccentricity

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Currently, the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) generate a large amount of sensor data at a very high pace, making it a challenge to collect and store the data. This scenario brings about the need for effective data compression algorithms to make the data manageable among tiny and battery-powered devices and, more importantly, shareable across the network. Additionally, considering that, very often, wireless communications (e.g., low-power wide-area networks) are adopted to connect field devices, user payload compression can also provide benefits derived from better spectrum usage, which in turn can result in advantages for high-density application scenarios. As a result of this increase in the number of connected devices, a new concept has emerged, called TinyML. It enables the use of machine learning on tiny, computationally restrained devices. This allows intelligent devices to analyze and interpret data locally and in real time. Therefore, this work presents a new data compression solution (algorithm) for the IoT that leverages the TinyML perspective. The new approach is called the Tiny Anomaly Compressor (TAC) and is based on data eccentricity. TAC does not require previously established mathematical models or any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed solution and validate it, a comparative analysis was performed on two real-world datasets with two other algorithms from the literature (namely Swing Door Trending (SDT) and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)). It was found that the TAC algorithm showed promising results, achieving a maximum compression rate of 98.33%. Additionally, it also surpassed the two other models regarding the compression error and peak signal-to-noise ratio in all cases.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Wastewater networks are mandatory for urbanisation. Their management, including the prediction and planning of repairs and expansion operations, requires precise information on their underground components (manhole covers, equipment, nodes, and pipes). However, due to their years of service and to the increasing number of maintenance operations they may have undergone over time, the attributes and characteristics associated with the various objects constituting a network are not all available at a given time. This is partly because (i) the multiple actors that carry out repairs and extensions are not necessarily the operators who ensure the continuous functioning of the network, and (ii) the undertaken changes are not properly tracked and reported. Therefore, databases related to wastewater networks may suffer from missing data. To overcome this problem, we aim to exploit the structure of wastewater networks in the learning process of machine learning approaches, using topology and the relationship between components, to complete the missing values of pipes. Our results show that Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models yield better results than classical methods and represent a useful tool for missing data completion.

AB  - The race for the 6th generation of wireless networks (6G) has begun. Researchers around the world have started to explore the best solutions for the challenges that the previous generations have experienced. To provide the readers with a clear map of the current developments, several review papers shared their vision and critically evaluated the state of the art. However, most of the work is based on general observations and the big picture vision, and lack the practical implementation challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. This paper takes a novel approach in the review, as we present a sample of IoT use cases that are representative of a wide variety of its implementations. The chosen use cases are from the most research-active sectors that can benefit from 6G and its enabling technologies. These sectors are healthcare, smart grid, transport, and Industry 4.0. Additionally, we identified some of the practical challenges and the lessons learned in the implementation of these use cases. The review highlights the cases’ main requirements and how they overlap with the key drivers for the future generation of wireless networks.
