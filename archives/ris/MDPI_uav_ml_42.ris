AB  - Water Resource Sustainability Management plays a vitally important role in ensuring sustainable development, especially in water-stressed arid regions throughout the world. In order to achieve sustainable development, it is necessary to study and monitor the water quality in the arid region of Central Asia, an area that is increasingly affected by climate change. In recent decades, the rapid deterioration of water quality in the Ebinur Lake basin in Xinjiang (China) has severely threatened sustainable economic development. This study selected the Ebinur Lake basin as the study target, with the purpose of revealing the response between the water quality index and water body reflectivity, and to describe the relationship between the water quality index and water reflectivity. The methodology employed remote sensing techniques that establish a water quality index monitoring model to monitor water quality. The results of our study include: (1) the Water Quality Index (WQI) that was used to evaluate the water environment in Ebinur Lake indicates a lower water quality of Ebinur Lake, with a WQI value as high as 4000; (2) an introduction of the spectral derivative method that realizes the extraction of spectral information from a water body to better mine the information of spectral data through remote sensing, and the results also prove that the spectral derivative method can improve the relationship between the water body spectral and WQI, whereby R2 is 0.6 at the most sensitive wavelengths; (3) the correlation between the spectral sensitivity index and WQI was greater than 0.6 at the significance level of 0.01 when multi-source spectral data were integrated with the spectral index (DI, RI and NDI) and fluorescence baseline; and (4) the distribution map of WQI in Ebinur Lake was obtained by the optimal model, which was constructed based on the third derivative data of Sentinel 2 data. We concluded that the water quality in the northwest of Ebinur Lake was the lowest in the region. In conclusion, we found that remote sensing techniques were highly effective and laid a foundation for water quality detection in arid areas.

AB  - This paper considers the self-localization of a tethered drone without using a cable-tension force sensor in GPS-denied environments. The original problem is converted to a state-estimation problem, where the cable-tension force and the three-dimensional position of the drone with respect to a ground platform are estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed approach uses the data reported by the onboard electric motors (i.e., the pulse width modulation (PWM) signals), accelerometers, gyroscopes, and altimeter, embedded in the commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) inertial measurement units (IMU). A system-identification experiment was conducted to determine the model that computes the drone thrust force using the PWM signals. The proposed approach was compared with an existing work that assumes known cable-tension force. Simulation results show that the proposed approach produces estimates with less than 0.3-m errors when the actual cable-tension force is greater than 1 N.

AB  - As nuclear technology evolves, and continues to be used in various fields since its discovery less than a century ago, radiation safety has become a major concern to humans and the environment. Radiation monitoring plays a significant role in preventive radiological nuclear detection in nuclear facilities, hospitals, or in any activities associated with radioactive materials by acting as a tool to measure the risk of being exposed to radiation while reaping its benefit. Apart from in occupational settings, radiation monitoring is required in emergency responses to radiation incidents as well as outdoor radiation zones. Several radiation sensors have been developed, ranging from as simple as a Geiger-Muller counter to bulkier radiation systems such as the High Purity Germanium detector, with different functionality for use in different settings, but the inability to provide real-time data makes radiation monitoring activities less effective. The deployment of manned vehicles equipped with these radiation sensors reduces the scope of radiation monitoring operations significantly, but the safety of radiation monitoring operators is still compromised. Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been introduced to the world and offered solutions to these limitations. This review elucidates a systematic understanding of the fundamental usage of the Internet of Drones for radiation monitoring purposes. The extension of essential functional blocks in IoT can be expanded across radiation monitoring industries, presenting several emerging research opportunities and challenges. This article offers a comprehensive review of the evolutionary application of IoT technology in nuclear and radiation monitoring. Finally, the security of the nuclear industry is discussed.

AB  - Mining enterprises are widely introducing digital technologies and automation is one of such tools. Granularity monitoring, namely, the size determination of rock mass pieces is a common operational component of the processes that extract minerals by open-pit mining. The article proposes an approach that, in addition to the lump size distribution, makes it possible to estimate the lump form distribution as well. To investigate the effectiveness of monitoring the form of blasted rock mass lumps, the authors conducted experiments in four stages related to the rock condition. They include geological occurrence, explosive crushing, trommelling, and mill crushing. The relationship between these stages is presented and the change in the lumps fragment form is traced. The present article proposes an informational and analytical model of the processes at mining enterprises, extracting minerals by open-pit mining, as well as an algorithm for determining the lumps form and obtaining their distribution in the rock mass.

AB  - Traffic density around the globe is increasing on a day-to-day basis, resulting in more accidents, congestion, and pollution. The dynamic vehicular environment induces challenges in designing an efficient and reliable protocol for communication. Timely delivery of safety and non-safety messages is necessary for traffic congestion control and for avoiding road mishaps. For efficient resource sharing and optimized channel utilization, the media access control (MAC) protocol plays a vital role. An efficient MAC protocol design can provide fair channel access and can delay constraint safety message dissemination, improving road safety. This paper reviews the applications, characteristics, and challenges faced in the design of MAC protocols. A classification of the MAC protocol is presented based on contention mechanisms and channel access. The classification based on contention is oriented as contention-based, contention-free, and hybrid, whereas the classification based on channel access is categorized as distributed, centralized, cluster-based, cooperative, token-based, and random access. These are further sub-classified as single-channel and multi-channel, based on the type of channel resources they utilize. This paper gives an analysis of the objectives, mechanisms, advantages/disadvantages, and simulators used in specified protocols. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on the future scope and open challenges for improving the MAC protocol design.

TI  - Predicting Days to Maturity, Plant Height, and Grain Yield in Soybean: A Machine and Deep Learning Approach Using Multispectral Data
T2  - Remote Sensing

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In soybean, there is a lack of research aiming to compare the performance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to predict more than one agronomic variable, such as days to maturity (DM), plant height (PH), and grain yield (GY). As these variables are important to developing an overall precision farming model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict DM, PH, and GY for soybean cultivars based on multispectral bands. The field experiment considered 524 genotypes of soybeans in the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 growing seasons and a multitemporal–multispectral dataset collected by embedded sensor in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We proposed a multilayer deep learning regression network, trained during 2000 epochs using an adaptive subgradient method, a random Gaussian initialization, and a 50% dropout in the first hidden layer for regularization. Three different scenarios, including only spectral bands, only vegetation indices, and spectral bands plus vegetation indices, were adopted to infer each variable (PH, DM, and GY). The DL model performance was compared against shallow learning methods such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and linear regression (LR). The results indicate that our approach has the potential to predict soybean-related variables using multispectral bands only. Both DL and RF models presented a strong (r surpassing 0.77) prediction capacity for the PH variable, regardless of the adopted input variables group. Our results demonstrated that the DL model (r = 0.66) was superior to predict DM when the input variable was the spectral bands. For GY, all machine learning models evaluated presented similar performance (r ranging from 0.42 to 0.44) for each tested scenario. In conclusion, this study demonstrated an efficient approach to a computational solution capable of predicting multiple important soybean crop variables based on remote sensing data. Future research could benefit from the information presented here and be implemented in subsequent processes related to soybean cultivars or other types of agronomic crops.

T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 22
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Controlling and managing surface source pollution depends on the rapid monitoring of total nitrogen in water. However, the complex factors affecting water quality (plant shading and suspended matter in water) make direct estimation extremely challenging. Considering the spectral response mechanisms of emergent plants, we coupled discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and fractional order discretization (FOD) techniques with three machine learning models (random forest (RF), bagging algorithm (bagging), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) to mine this potential spectral information. A total of 567 models were developed, and airborne hyperspectral data processed with various DWT scales and FOD techniques were compared. The effective information in the hyperspectral reflectance data were better emphasized after DWT processing. After DWT processing the original spectrum (OR), its sensitivity to TN in water was maximally improved by 0.22, and the correlation between FOD and TN in water was optimally increased by 0.57. The transformed spectral information enhanced the TN model accuracy, especially for FOD after DWT. For RF, 82% of the model R2 values improved by 0.02~0.72 compared to the model using FOD spectra; 78.8% of the bagging values improved by 0.01~0.53 and 65.0% of the XGBoost values improved by 0.01~0.64. The XGBoost model with DWT coupled with grey relation analysis (GRA) yielded the best estimation accuracy, with the highest precision of R2 = 0.91 for L6. In conclusion, appropriately scaled DWT analysis can substantially improve the accuracy of extracting TN from UAV hyperspectral images. These outcomes may facilitate the further development of accurate water quality monitoring in sophisticated global waters from drone or satellite hyperspectral data.

SN  - 2571-5577

AB  - Recently, the lack of expansion joint gaps on highway bridges in Korea has been increasing. In particular, with the increase in the number of days during the summer heatwave, the narrowing of the expansion joint gap causes symptoms such as expansion joint damage and pavement blow-up, which threaten traffic safety and structural safety. Therefore, in this study, we developed a machine vision (M/V)-technique-based inspection system that can monitor the expansion joint gap through image analysis while driving at high speed (100 km/h), replacing the current manual method that uses an inspector to inspect the expansion joint gap. To fix the error factors of image analysis that happened during the trial application, a machine learning method was used to improve the accuracy of measuring the gap between the expansion joint device. As a result, the expansion gap identification accuracy was improved by 27.5%, from 67.5% to 95.0%, and the use of the system reduces the survey time by more than 95%, from an average of approximately 1 h/bridge (existing manual inspection method) to approximately 3 min/bridge. We assume, in the future, maintenance practitioners can contribute to preventive maintenance that prepares countermeasures before problems occur.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - For monitoring protected forest landscapes over time it is essential to follow changes in tree species composition and forest dynamics. Data driven remote sensing methods provide valuable options if terrestrial approaches for forest inventories and monitoring activities cannot be applied efficiently due to restrictions or the size of the study area. We demonstrate how species can be detected at a single tree level utilizing a Random Forest (RF) model using the Black Forest National Park as an example of a Central European forest landscape with complex relief. The classes were European silver fir (Abies alba, AA), Norway spruce (Picea abies, PA), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris, PS), European larch (Larix decidua including Larix kampferii, LD), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii, PM), deciduous broadleaved species (DB) and standing dead trees (snags, WD). Based on a multi-temporal (leaf-on and leaf-off phenophase) and multi-spectral mosaic (R-G-B-NIR) with 10 cm spatial resolution, digital elevation models (DTM, DSM, CHM) with 40 cm spatial resolution and a LiDAR dataset with 25 pulses per m2, 126 variables were derived and used to train the RF algorithm with 1130 individual trees. The main objective was to determine a subset of meaningful variables for the RF model classification on four heterogeneous test sites. Using feature selection techniques, mainly passive optical variables from the leaf-off phenophase were considered due to their ability to differentiate between conifers and the two broader classes. An examination of the two phenological phases (using the difference of the respective NDVIs) is important to clearly distinguish deciduous trees from other classes including snags (WD). We also found that the variables of the first derivation of NIR and the tree metrics play a crucial role in discriminating PA und PS. With this unique set of variables some classes can be differentiated more reliably, especially LD and DB but also AA, PA and WD, whereas difficulties exist in identifying PM and PS. Overall, the non-parametric object-based approach has proved to be highly suitable for accurately detecting (OA: 89.5%) of the analyzed classes. Finally, the successful classification of complex 265 km2 study area substantiates our findings.

TI  - An Object- and Topology-Based Analysis (OTBA) Method for Mapping Rice-Crayfish Fields in South China
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 22
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The rice-crayfish field (i.e., RCF), a newly emerging rice cultivation pattern, has greatly expanded in China in the last decade due to its significant ecological and economic benefits. The spatial distribution of RCFs is an important dataset for crop planting pattern adjustment, water resource management and yield estimation. Here, an object- and topology-based analysis (OTBA) method, which considers spectral-spatial features and the topological relationship between paddy fields and their enclosed ditches, was proposed to identify RCFs. First, we employed an object-based method to extract crayfish breeding ditches using very high-resolution images. Subsequently, the paddy fields that provide fodder for crayfish were identified according to the topological relationship between the paddy field and circumjacent crayfish ditch. The extracted ditch objects together with those paddy fields were merged to derive the final RCFs. The performance of the OTBA method was carefully evaluated using the RCF and non-RCF samples. Moreover, the effects of different spatial resolutions, spectral bands and temporal information on RCF identification were comprehensively investigated. Our results suggest the OTBA method performed well in extracting RCFs, with an overall accuracy of 91.77%. Although the mapping accuracies decreased as the image spatial resolution decreased, satisfactory RCF mapping results (&gt;80%) can be achieved at spatial resolutions greater than 2 m. Additionally, we demonstrated that the mapping accuracy can be improved by more than 10% when near-infrared (NIR) band information was involved, indicating the necessity of the NIR band when selecting images to derive reliable RCF maps. Furthermore, the images acquired in the rice growth phase are recommended to maximize the differences of spectral characteristics between paddy fields and ditches. These promising findings suggest that the OTBA approach performs well for mapping RCFs in areas with fragmented agricultural landscapes, which provides fundamental information for further agricultural land use and water resources management.

T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 22
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Chlorophyll is an essential vegetation pigment influencing plant photosynthesis rate and growth conditions. Remote sensing images have been widely used for mapping vegetation chlorophyll content in different ecosystems (e.g., farmlands, forests, grasslands, and wetlands) for evaluating vegetation growth status and productivity of these ecosystems. Compared to farmlands and forests that are more homogeneous in terms of species composition, grasslands and wetlands are more heterogeneous with highly mixed species (e.g., various grass, forb, and shrub species). Different species contribute differently to the ecosystem services, thus, monitoring species-specific chlorophyll content is critical for better understanding their growth status, evaluating ecosystem functions, and supporting ecosystem management (e.g., control invasive species). However, previous studies in mapping chlorophyll content in heterogeneous ecosystems have rarely estimated species-specific chlorophyll content, which was partially due to the limited spatial resolution of remote sensing images commonly used in the past few decades for recognizing different species. In addition, many previous studies have used one universal model built with data of all species for mapping chlorophyll of the entire study area, which did not fully consider the impacts of species composition on the accuracy of chlorophyll estimation (i.e., establishing species-specific chlorophyll estimation models may generate higher accuracy). In this study, helicopter-acquired high-spatial resolution hyperspectral images were acquired for species classification and species-specific chlorophyll content estimation. Four estimation models, including a universal linear regression (LR) model (i.e., built with data of all species), species-specific LR models (i.e., built with data of each species, respectively), a universal random forest regression (RFR) model, and species-specific RFR models, were compared to determine their performance in mapping chlorophyll and to evaluate the impacts of species composition. The results show that species-specific models performed better than the universal models, especially for species with fewer samples in the dataset. The best performed species-specific models were then used to generate species-specific chlorophyll content maps using the species classification results. Impacts of species composition on the retrieval of chlorophyll content were further assessed to support future chlorophyll mapping in heterogeneous ecosystems and ecosystem management.

AB  - Soil changes, including landslides and erosion, are some of the most prominent post-fire effects in Mediterranean ecosystems. Landslide detection and monitoring play an essential role in mitigation measures. We tested two different methodologies in five burned sites with different characteristics in Central Greece. We compared Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-derived high-resolution Digital Surface Models and point clouds with terrestrial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived point clouds to reveal new cracks and monitor scarps of pre-existing landslides. New cracks and scarps were revealed at two sites after the wildfire, measuring up to 27 m in length and up to 25 &plusmn; 5 cm in depth. Pre-existing scarps in both Kechries sites appeared to be active, with additional vertical displacements ranging from 5&ndash;15 &plusmn; 5 cm. In addition, the pre-existing landslide in Magoula expanded by 8%. Due to vegetation regrowth, no changes could be detected in the Agios Stefanos pre-existing landslide. This high-spatial-resolution mapping of slope deformations can be used as landslide precursor, assisting prevention measures. Considering the lack of vegetation after wildfires, UAV photogrammetry has great potential for tracing such early landslide indicators and is more efficient for accurately recording soil changes.

AB  - Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing can be used to estimate soil properties; however, little is known regarding the effects of UAV and satellite remote sensing data integration on the estimation of soil comprehensive attributes, or how to estimate quickly and robustly. In this study, we tackled those gaps by employing UAV multispectral and Sentinel-2B data to estimate soil salinity and chemical properties over a large agricultural farm (400 ha) covered by different crops and harvest areas at the coastal saline-alkali land of the Yellow River Delta of China in 2019. Spatial information of soil salinity, organic matter, available/total nitrogen content, and pH at 0&ndash;10 cm and 10&ndash;20 cm layers were obtained via ground sampling (n = 195) and two-dimensional spatial interpolation, aiming to overlap the soil information with remote sensing information. The exploratory factor analysis was conducted to generate latent variables, which represented the salinity and chemical characteristics of the soil. A machine learning algorithm (random forest) was applied to estimate soil attributes. Our results indicated that the integration of UAV texture and Sentinel-2B spectral data as random forest model inputs improved the accuracy of latent soil variable estimation. The remote sensing-based information from cropland (crop-based) had a higher accuracy compared to estimations performed on bare soil (soil-based). Therefore, the crop-based approach, along with the integration of UAV texture and Sentinel-2B data, is recommended for the quick assessment of soil comprehensive attributes.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Synthetic-aperture radar&rsquo;s (SAR&rsquo;s) capacity to resolve the cloud cover concerns encountered while gathering optical data has tremendous potential for soil moisture data retrieval using SAR data. It is possible to use SAR data to recover soil moisture because the backscatter coefficient is sensitive to both soil and vegetation by penetrating through the vegetation layer. This study investigated the feasibility of employing a SAR-derived radar vegetation index (RVI), the ratios of the backscatter coefficients using polarizations of HH/HV (RHH/HV) and HV/HH (RHH/HV) to an oil palm crops as vegetation indicators in the water cloud model (WCM) using phased-array L-band SAR-2 (PALSAR-2). These data were compared to the manual leaf area index (LAI) and a physical soil sampling method for computing soil moisture. The field data included the LAI input parameters and, more importantly, physical soil samples from which to calculate the soil moisture. The fieldwork was carried out in Chuping District, Perlis State, Malaysia. Corresponding PALSAR-2 data were collected on three observation dates in 2019: 17 January, 16 April, and 9 July. The results showed that the WCM modeled using the LAI under HV polarization demonstrated promising accuracy, with the root mean square error recorded as 0.033 m3/m3. This was comparable to the RVI and RHH/HV under HV polarization, which had accuracies of 0.031 and 0.049 m3/m3, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that SAR-based indicators, RHH/HV and RVI using PALSAR-2, can be used to reduce field-related input in the retrieval of soil moisture data using the WCM for oil palm crop.

AB  - Earthquakes are one of the most catastrophic natural phenomena. After an earthquake, earthquake reconnaissance enables effective recovery by collecting data on building damage and other impacts. This paper aims to identify state-of-the-art data sources for building damage assessment and provide guidance for more efficient data collection. We have reviewed 39 articles that indicate the sources used by different authors to collect data related to damage and post-disaster recovery progress after earthquakes between 2014 and 2021. The current data collection methods have been grouped into seven categories: fieldwork or ground surveys, omnidirectional imagery (OD), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), remote sensing (RS), crowdsourcing platforms, social media (SM) and closed-circuit television videos (CCTV). The selection of a particular data source or collection technique for earthquake reconnaissance includes different criteria depending on what questions are to be answered by these data. We conclude that modern reconnaissance missions cannot rely on a single data source. Different data sources should complement each other, validate collected data or systematically quantify the damage. The recent increase in the number of crowdsourcing and SM platforms used to source earthquake reconnaissance data demonstrates that this is likely to become an increasingly important data source.

AB  - Detecting newly established invasive plants is key to prevent further spread. Traditional field surveys are challenging and often insufficient to identify the presence and extent of invasions. This is particularly true for wetland ecosystems because of difficult access, and because floating and submergent plants may go undetected in the understory of emergent plants. Unpiloted aerial systems (UAS) have the potential to revolutionize how we monitor invasive vegetation in wetlands, but key components of the data collection and analysis workflow have not been defined. In this study, we conducted a rigorous comparison of different methodologies for mapping invasive Emergent (Typha &times; glauca (cattail)), Floating (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae (European frogbit)), and Submergent species (Chara spp. and Elodea canadensis) using the machine learning classifier, random forest, in a Great Lakes wetland. We compared accuracies using (a) different spatial resolutions (11 cm pixels vs. 3 cm pixels), (b) two classification approaches (pixel- vs. object-based), and (c) including structural measurements (e.g., surface/canopy height models and rugosity as textural metrics). Surprisingly, the coarser resolution (11 cm) data yielded the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 81.4%, 2.5% higher than the best performing model of the finer (3 cm) resolution data. Similarly, the Mean Area Under the Receiving Operations Characteristics Curve (AUROC) and F1 Score from the 11 cm data yielded 15.2%, and 6.5% higher scores, respectively, than those in the 3 cm data. At each spatial resolution, the top performing models were from pixel-based approaches and included surface model data over those with canopy height or multispectral data alone. Overall, high-resolution maps generated from UAS classifications will enable early detection and control of invasive plants. Our workflow is likely applicable to other wetland ecosystems threatened by invasive plants throughout the globe.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The potential of hyperspectral measurements for early disease detection has been investigated by many experts over the last 5 years. One of the difficulties is obtaining enough data for training and building a hyperspectral training library. When the goal is to detect disease at a previsible stage, before the pathogen has manifested either its first symptoms or in the area surrounding the existing symptoms, it is impossible to objectively delineate the regions of interest containing the previsible pathogen growth from the areas without the pathogen growth. To overcome this, we propose an image labelling and segmentation algorithm that is able to (a) more objectively label the visible symptoms for the construction of a training library and (b) extend this labelling to the pre-visible symptoms. This algorithm is used to create hyperspectral training libraries for late blight disease (Phytophthora infestans) in potatoes and two types of leaf rust (Puccinia triticina and Puccinia striiformis) in wheat. The model training accuracies were compared between the automatic labelling algorithm and the classic visual delineation of regions of interest using a logistic regression machine learning approach. The modelling accuracies of the automatically labelled datasets were higher than those of the manually labelled ones for both potatoes and wheat, at 98.80% for P. infestans in potato, 97.69% for P. striiformis in soft wheat, and 96.66% for P. triticina in durum wheat.

SN  - 2073-4395

AB  - Basal stem rot (BSR) disease occurs due to the most aggressive and threatening fungal attack of the oil palm plant known as Ganoderma boninense (G. boninense). BSR is a disease that has a significant impact on oil palm crops in Malaysia and Indonesia. Currently, the only sustainable strategy available is to extend the life of oil palm trees, as there is no effective treatment for BSR disease. This study used thermal imagery to identify the thermal features to classify non-infected and BSR-infected trees. The aims of this study were to (1) identify the potential temperature features and (2) examine the performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers (na&iuml;ve Bayes (NB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF) to classify oil palm trees that are non-infected and BSR-infected. The sample size consisted of 55 uninfected trees and 37 infected trees. We used the imbalance data approaches such as random undersampling (RUS), random oversampling (ROS) and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) in these classifications due to the different sample sizes. The study found that the Tmax feature is the most beneficial temperature characteristic for classifying non-infected or infected BSR trees. Meanwhile, the ROS approach improves the curve region (AUC) and PRC results compared to a single approach. The result showed that the temperature feature Tmax and combination feature TmaxTmin had a higher correct classification for the G. boninense non-infected and infected oil palm trees for the ROS-RF and had a robust success rate, classifying correctly 87.10% for non-infected and 100% for infected by G. boninense. In terms of model performance using the most significant variables, Tmax, the ROS-RF model had an excellent receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve region (AUC) of 0.921, and the precision&ndash;recall curve (PRC) region gave a value of 0.902. Therefore, it can be concluded that the ROS-RF, using the Tmax, can be used to predict BSR disease with relatively high accuracy.

AB  - The study area is located near Toot village in the Yazd province of Iran, which is considered in terms of its iron mineralization potential. In this area, due to radioactivity, radiometric surveys were performed in a part of the area where magnetometric studies have also been performed. According to geological studies, the presence of magnetic anomalies can have a complex relationship with the intensity of radioactivity of radioactive elements. Using the K-means clustering method, the centers of the clusters were calculated with and without considering the coordinates of radiometric points. Finally, the behavior of the two variables of magnetic field strength and radioactivity of radioactive elements relative to each other was studied, and a mathematical relationship was presented to analyze the behavior of these two variables relative to each other. On the other hand, the increasing and then decreasing behavior of the intensity of the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field relative to the intensity of radioactivity of radioactive elements shows that it is possible to generalize the results of magnetometric surveys to radiometry without radiometric re-sampling in this region and neighboring areas. For this purpose, using the general regression neural network and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) methods, radiometric data were estimated with very good accuracy. The general regression neural network (GRNN) method, with more precision in estimation, was used as a model for estimating the radiation intensity of radioactive elements in other neighboring areas.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 23
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - We propose the Point Cloud Tree Species Classification Network (PCTSCN) to overcome challenges in classifying tree species from laser data with deep learning methods. The network is mainly composed of two parts: a sampling component in the early stage and a feature extraction component in the later stage. We used geometric sampling to extract regions with local features from the tree contours since these tend to be species-specific. Then we used an improved Farthest Point Sampling method to extract the features from a global perspective. We input the intensity of the tree point cloud as a dimensional feature and spatial information into the neural network and mapped it to higher dimensions for feature extraction. We used the data obtained by Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Laser Scanning (UAVLS) to conduct tree species classification experiments of white birch and larch. The experimental results showed that in both the TLS and UAVLS datasets, the input tree point cloud density and the highest feature dimensionality of the mapping had an impact on the classification accuracy of the tree species. When the single tree sample obtained by TLS consisted of 1024 points and the highest dimension of the network mapping was 512, the classification accuracy of the trained model reached 96%. For the individual tree samples obtained by UAVLS, which consisted of 2048 points and had the highest dimension of the network mapping of 1024, the classification accuracy of the trained model reached 92%. TLS data tree species classification accuracy of PCTSCN was improved by 2&ndash;9% compared with other models using the same point density, amount of data and highest feature dimension. The classification accuracy of tree species obtained by UAVLS was up to 8% higher. We propose PCTSCN to provide a new strategy for the intelligent classification of forest tree species.

AB  - Anthropogenic marine debris (AMD) represent a global threat for aquatic environments. It is important to locate and monitor the distribution and presence of macroplastics along beaches to prevent degradation into microplastics (MP), which are potentially more harmful and more difficult to remove. UAV imaging represents a quick method for acquiring pictures with a ground spatial resolution of a few centimeters. In this work, we investigate strategies for AMD mapping on beaches with different ground resolutions and with elevation and multispectral data in support of RGB orthomosaics. Operators with varying levels of expertise and knowledge of the coastal environment map the AMD on four to five transects manually, using a range of photogrammetric tools. The initial survey was repeated after one year; in both surveys, beach litter was collected and further analyzed in the laboratory. Operators assign three levels of confidence when recognizing and describing AMD. Preliminary validation of results shows that items identified with high confidence were almost always classified properly. Approaching the detected items in terms of surface instead of a simple count increased the percentage of mapped litter significantly when compared to those collected. Multispectral data in near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths and digital surface models (DSMs) did not significantly improve the efficiency of manual mapping, even if vegetation features were removed using NDVI maps. In conclusion, this research shows that a good solution for performing beach AMD mapping can be represented by using RGB imagery with a spatial resolution of about 200 pix/m for detecting macroplastics and, in particular, focusing on the largest items. From the point of view of assessing and monitoring potential sources of MP, this approach is not only feasible but also quick, practical, and sustainable.

TI  - A YOLO-Based Target Detection Model for Offshore Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Data
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 23
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Target detection in offshore unmanned aerial vehicle data is still a challenge due to the complex characteristics of targets, such as multi-sizes, alterable orientation, and complex backgrounds. Herein, a YOLO-based detection model (YOLO-D) was proposed for target detection in offshore unmanned aerial vehicle data. Based on the YOLOv3 network, the residual module was improved by establishing dense connections and adding a dual-attention mechanism (CBAM) to enhance the use of features and global information. Then, the loss function of the YOLO-D model was added to the weight coefficients to increase detection accuracy for small-size targets. Finally, the feature pyramid network (FPN) was replaced by the secondary recursive feature pyramid network to reduce the impacts of a complicated environment. Taking the car, boat, and deposit near the coastline as the targets, the proposed YOLO-D model was compared against other models, including the faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and YOLOv5, to evaluate its detection performance. The results showed that the evaluation metrics of the YOLO-D model, including precision (Pr), recall (Re), average precision (AP), and the mean of average precision (mAP), had the highest values. The mAP of the YOLO-D model increased by 37.95%, 39.44%, 28.46%, and 5.08% compared to the faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and YOLOv5, respectively. The AP of the car, boat, and deposit reached 96.24%, 93.70%, and 96.79% respectively. Moreover, the YOLO-D model had a higher detection accuracy than other models, especially in the detection of small-size targets. Collectively, the proposed YOLO-D model is a suitable model for target detection in offshore unmanned aerial vehicle data.

AB  - mmWave radars play a vital role in autonomous systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), ground station control and monitoring systems. The challenging task when using mmWave radars is to estimate the accurate angle of arrival (AoA) of the targets, due to the limited number of receivers. In this paper, we present a novel AoA estimation technique, using mmWave FMCW radars operating in the frequency range 77&ndash;81 GHz by utilizing the mechanical rotation. Rotating the radar also increases the field of view in both azimuth and elevation. The proposed method estimates the AoA of the targets, using only a single transmitter and receiver. The measurements are carried out in a variety of practical scenarios including pedestrians, a car, and an UAV, also known as a drone. With measured data, range-angle maps are created, and morphological operators are used to estimate the AoA of the targets. We also process radar range-angle images for improved visual representation. The proposed method will be extremely beneficial for practical ground stations, traffic control and monitoring frameworks for both on-ground and airborne vehicles.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In general, the quality of imagery from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is evaluated after the flight, and then a decision is made on the further value and use of the acquired data. In this paper, an a priori (preflight) image quality prediction methodology is proposed to estimate the preflight image quality and to avoid unfavourable flights, which is extremely important from a time and cost management point of view. The XBoost Regressor model and cross-validation were used for machine learning of the model and image quality prediction. The model was learned on a rich database of real-world images acquired from UAVs under conditions varying in both sensor type, UAV type, exposure parameters, weather, topography, and land cover. Radiometric quality indices (SNR, Entropy, PIQE, NIQE, BRISQUE, and NRPBM) were calculated for each image to train and test the model and to assess the accuracy of image quality prediction. Different variants of preflight parameter knowledge were considered in the study. The proposed methodology offers the possibility of predicting image quality with high accuracy. The correlation coefficient between the actual and predicted image quality, depending on the number of parameters known a priori, ranged from 0.90 to 0.96. The methodology was designed for data acquired from a UAV. Similar prediction accuracy is expected for other low-altitude or close-range photogrammetric data.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can play a key role in meeting certain demands of cellular networks. UAVs can be used not only as user equipment (UE) in cellular networks but also as mobile base stations (BSs) wherein they can either augment conventional BSs by adapting their position to serve the changing traffic and connectivity demands or temporarily replace BSs that are damaged due to natural disasters. The flexibility of UAVs allows them to provide coverage to UEs in hot-spots, at cell-edges, in coverage holes, or regions with scarce cellular infrastructure. In this work, we study how UAV locations and other cellular parameters may be optimized in such scenarios to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) of the network. We compare the performance of machine learning (ML) techniques with conventional optimization approaches. We found that, on an average, a double deep Q learning approach can achieve 93.46% of the optimal median SE and 95.83% of the optimal mean SE. A simple greedy approach, which tunes the parameters of each BS and UAV independently, performed very well in all the cases that we tested. These computationally efficient approaches can be utilized to enhance the network performance in existing cellular networks.

AB  - Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have gained widespread interest in civilian and military applications, which has led to the development of novel UAVs that can perform various operations. UAVs are aircraft that can fly without the need of a human pilot onboard, meaning they can fly either autonomously or be remotely piloted. They can be equipped with multiple sensors, including cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), LiDAR, and GPS, to collect and transmit data in real time. Due to the demand for UAVs in various applications such as precision agriculture, search and rescue, wireless communications, and surveillance, several types of UAVs have been invented with different specifications for their size, weight, range and endurance, engine type, and configuration. Because of this variety, the design process and analysis are based on the type of UAV, with the availability of several control techniques that could be used to improve the flight of the UAV in order to avoid obstacles and potential collisions, as well as find the shortest path to save the battery life with the support of optimization techniques. However, UAVs face several challenges in order to fly smoothly, including collision avoidance, battery life, and intruders. This review paper presents UAVs&rsquo; classification, control applications, and future directions in industry and research interest. For the design process, fabrication, and analysis, various control approaches are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the challenges for UAVs, including battery charging, collision avoidance, and security, are also presented and discussed.

AB  - Nowadays, pavement management systems (PMS) are mainly based on monitoring processes that have been established for a long time, and strongly depend on acquired experience. However, with the emergence of smart technologies, such as internet of things and artificial intelligence, PMS could be improved by applying these new smart technologies to their decision support systems, not just by updating their data collection methodologies, but also their data analysis tools. The application of these smart technologies to the field of pavement monitoring and condition evaluation will undoubtedly contribute to more efficient, less costly, safer, and environmentally friendly methodologies. Thus, the main drive of the present work is to provide insight for the development of future decision support systems for smart pavement management by conducting a systematic literature review of the developed works that apply smart technologies to this field. The conclusions drawn from the analysis allowed for the identification of a series of future direction recommendations for researchers. In fact, future PMS should tend to be capable of collecting and analyzing data at different levels, both externally at the surface or inside the pavement, as well as to detect and predict all types of functional and structural flaws and defects.

AB  - The integration of geospatial data in hydrography, performed using different measurement systems, involves combining several study results to provide a comprehensive analysis. Each of the hydroacoustic and optoelectronic systems is characterised by a different spatial reference system and the method for technical implementation of the measurement. Therefore, the integration of hydrographic data requires that problems in selected fields of electronics, geodesy and physics (acoustics and optics) be solved. The aim of this review is to present selected fusion methods applying the data derived from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Real Time Kinematic (RTK) measurements, hydrographic surveys, a photogrammetric pass using unmanned vehicles and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and compare their accuracy. An additional goal is the evalution of data integration methods according to the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) S-44 standard. The publication is supplemented by implementation examples of the integration of geospatial data in the Geographic Information System (GIS). The methods described indicate the lack of a uniform methodology for data fusion due to differences in both the spatial reference systems and the techniques used. However, the integration of hydroacoustic and optoelectronic data allows for high accuracy geospatial data to be obtained. This is confirmed by the methods cited, in which the accuracy of integrated geospatial data was in the order of several centimetres.

AB  - The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autopilot flight to survey urban rooftop solar panels needs a certain flight altitude at a level that can avoid obstacles such as high-rise buildings, street trees, telegraph poles, etc. For this reason, the autopilot-based thermal imaging has severe data redundancy&mdash;namely, that non-solar panel area occupies more than 99% of ground target, causing a serious lack of the thermal markers on solar panels. This study aims to explore the correlations between the thermal signatures of urban rooftop solar panels obtained from a UAV video stream and autopilot-based photomosaic. The thermal signatures of video imaging are strongly correlated (0.89&ndash;0.99) to those of autopilot-based photomosaics. Furthermore, the differences in the thermal signatures of solar panels between the video and photomosaic are aligned in the range of noise equivalent differential temperature with a 95% confidence level. The results of this study could serve as a valuable reference for employing video stream-based thermal imaging to urban rooftop solar panels.

AB  - In this paper, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided multi-antenna configured downlink mmWave cooperative generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) system is proposed. To provide physical layer security (PLS), a 3D controlled Lorenz mapping system is introduced. Furthermore, the combination of T-transformation spreading codes, walsh Hadamard transform, and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) techniques are integrated with a novel linear multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) gyre precoding (GP) for multi-user interference reduction. Furthermore, concatenated channel-coding with multi-user beamforming weighting-aided maximum-likelihood and zero forcing (ZF) signal detection schemes for an improved bit error rate (BER) are also used. The system is then simulated with a single base station (BS), eight massive machine-type communications (mMTC) users, and two UAV relay stations (RSs). Numerical results reveal the robustness of the proposed system in terms of PLS and an achievable ergodic rate with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) under the implementation of T-transformation scheme. By incorporating the 3D mobility model, brownian perturbations of the UAVs are also analyzed. An out-of-band (OOB) reduction of 320 dB with an improved BER of 1&times;10&minus;4 in 16-QAM for a signal-to-noise ratio, Eb/N0, of 20 dB is achieved.

AB  - Several cities have recently moved towards becoming smart cities for better services and quality of life for residents and visitors, with: optimized resource utilization; increased environmental protection; enhanced infrastructure operations and maintenance; and strong safety and security measures. Smart cities depend on deploying current and new technologies and different optimization methods to enhance services and performance in their different sectors. Some of the technologies assisting smart city applications are the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing, and cloud computing. Integrating these three to serve one system (we will refer to it as integrated IoT-fog-cloud system (iIFC)) creates an advanced platform to develop and operate various types of smart city applications. This platform will allow applications to use the best features from the IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud services to deliver best capabilities and performance. Utilizing this powerful platform will provide many opportunities for enhancing and optimizing applications in energy, transportation, healthcare, and other areas. In this paper we survey various applications of iIFCs for smart cities. We identify different common issues associated with utilizing iIFCs for smart city applications. These issues arise due to the characteristics of iIFCs on the one side and the requirements of different smart city applications on the other. In addition, we outline the main requirements to effectively utilize iIFCs for smart city applications. These requirements are related to optimization, networking, and security.

AB  - Cloud robotics and advanced communications can foster a step-change in cooperative robots and hybrid wireless sensor networks (H-WSN) for demanding environments (e.g., disaster response, mining, demolition, and nuclear sites) by enabling the timely sharing of data and computational resources between robot and human teams. However, the operational complexity of such multi-agent systems requires defining effective architectures, coping with implementation details, and testing in realistic deployments. This article proposes X-IoCA, an Internet of robotic things (IoRT) and communication architecture consisting of a hybrid and heterogeneous network of wireless transceivers (H2WTN), based on LoRa and BLE technologies, and a robot operating system (ROS) network. The IoRT is connected to a feedback information system (FIS) distributed among multi-access edge computing (MEC) centers. Furthermore, we present SAR-IoCA, an implementation of the architecture for search and rescue (SAR) integrated into a 5G network. The FIS for this application consists of an SAR-FIS (including a path planner for UGVs considering risks detected by a LoRa H-WSN) and an ROS-FIS (for real-time monitoring and processing of information published throughout the ROS network). Moreover, we discuss lessons learned from using SAR-IoCA in a realistic exercise where three UGVs, a UAV, and responders collaborated to rescue victims from a tunnel accessible through rough terrain.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, aka drones) are being used for mapping macro-litter in the environment. As drone images require a manual processing task for detecting marine litter, it is of interest to evaluate the accuracy of non-expert citizen science operators (CSO) in performing this task. Students from Italian secondary schools (in this work, the CSO) were invited to identify, mark, and classify stranded litter items on a UAV orthophoto collected on an Italian beach. A specific training program and working tools were developed for the aim. The comparison with the standard in situ visual census survey returned a general underestimation (50%) of items. However, marine litter bulk categorisation was fairly in agreement with the in situ survey, especially for sources classification. The concordance level among CSO ranged between 60% and 91%, depending on the item properties considered (type, material, and colour). As the assessment accuracy was in line with previous works developed by experts, remote detection of marine litter on UAV images can be improved through citizen science programs, upon an appropriate training plan and provision of specific tools.

AB  - Vehicular visible light communication is known as a promising way of inter-vehicle communication. Vehicular VLC can ensure the significant advancement of safety and efficiency in traffic. It has disadvantages, such as unexpected glare on drivers in moving conditions, i.e., non-line-of-sight link at night. While designing a receiver, the most important factor is to ensure the optimal quality of the received signal. Within this context, to achieve an optimal communication quality, it is necessary to find the optimal maximum signal strength. Hereafter, a new receiver design is focused on in this paper at the circuit level, and a novel micro genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize the signal strength. The receiver can calculate the SNR, and it is possible to modify its structural design. The micro GA determines the alignment of the maximum signal strength at the receiver point rather than monitoring the signal strength for each angle. The results showed that the proposed scheme accurately estimates the alignment of the receiver, which gives the optimum signal strength. In comparison with the conventional GA, the micro GA results showed that the maximum received signal strength was improved by &minus;1.7 dBm, &minus;2.6 dBm for user Location 1 and user Location 2, respectively, which proves that the micro GA is more efficient. The execution time of the conventional GA was 7.1 s, while the micro GA showed 0.7 s. Furthermore, at a low SNR, the receiver showed robust communication for automotive applications.

AB  - Hyper-DRELIO (Hyperspectral DRone for Environmental and LIttoral Observations) is a custom, mini-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) platform (&lt;20 kg), equipped with a light push broom hyperspectral sensor combined with a navigation module measuring position and orientation. Because of the particularities of UAV surveys (low flight altitude, small spatial scale, and high resolution), dedicated pre-processing methods have to be developed when reconstructing hyperspectral imagery. This article presents light, easy-implementation, in situ methods, using only two Spectralon&reg; and a field spectrometer, allowing performance of an initial calibration of the sensor in order to correct &ldquo;vignetting effects&rdquo; and a field standardization to convert digital numbers (DN) collected by the hyperspectral camera to reflectance, taking into account the time-varying illumination conditions. Radiometric corrections are applied to a subset of a dataset collected above mudflats colonized by pioneer mangroves in French Guiana. The efficiency of the radiometric corrections is assessed by comparing spectra from Hyper-DRELIO imagery to in situ spectrometer measurements above the intertidal benthic biofilm and mangroves. The shapes of the spectra were consistent, and the spectral angle mapper (SAM) distance was 0.039 above the benthic biofilm and 0.159 above the mangroves. These preliminary results provide new perspectives for quantifying and mapping the benthic biofilm and mangroves at the scale of the Guianese intertidal mudbanks system, given their importance in the coastal food webs, biogeochemical cycles, and the sediment stabilization.

AB  - The detection of buildings in the city is essential in several geospatial domains and for decision-making regarding intelligence for city planning, tax collection, project management, revenue generation, and smart cities, among other areas. In the past, the classical approach used for building detection was by using the imagery and it entailed human&ndash;computer interaction, which was a daunting proposition. To tackle this task, a novel network based on an end-to-end deep learning framework is proposed to detect and classify buildings features. The proposed CNN has three parallel stream channels: the first is the high-resolution aerial imagery, while the second stream is the digital surface model (DSM). The third was fixed on extracting deep features using the fusion of channel one and channel two, respectively. Furthermore, the channel has eight group convolution blocks of 2D convolution with three max-pooling layers. The proposed model&rsquo;s efficiency and dependability were tested on three different categories of complex urban building structures in the study area. Then, morphological operations were applied to the extracted building footprints to increase the uniformity of the building boundaries and produce improved building perimeters. Thus, our approach bridges a significant gap in detecting building objects in diverse environments; the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of the proposed method are greater than 80% and 0.605, respectively. The findings support the proposed framework and methodologies&rsquo; efficacy and effectiveness at extracting buildings from complex environments.

AB  - Recently, technology utilizing ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors for robot localization in an indoor environment where the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) cannot be used has begun to be actively studied. UWB-based positioning has the advantage of being able to work even in an environment lacking feature points, which is a limitation of positioning using existing vision- or LiDAR-based sensing. However, UWB-based positioning requires the pre-installation of UWB anchors and the precise location of coordinates. In addition, when using a sensor that measures only the one-dimensional distance between the UWB anchor and the tag, there is a limitation whereby the position of the robot is solved but the orientation cannot be acquired. To overcome this, a framework based on an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter that tightly integrates an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor and a UWB sensor is proposed in this paper. However, UWB-based distance measurement introduces large errors in multipath environments with obstacles or walls between the anchor and the tag, which degrades positioning performance. Therefore, we propose a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) robust UWB ranging model to improve the pose estimation performance. Finally, the localization performance of the proposed framework is verified through experiments in real indoor environments.

Its processes have been changing to enable technology adoption to increase productivity, quality, and sustainable development. In this research, we present a scientific mapping of the adoption of precision techniques and breakthrough technologies in agriculture, so-called Digital Agriculture. To do this, we used 4694 documents from the Web of Science database to perform a Bibliometric Performance and Network Analysis of the literature using SciMAT software with the support of the PICOC protocol. Our findings presented 22 strategic themes related to Digital Agriculture, such as Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Climate-smart Agriculture (CSA), among others. The thematic network structure of the nine most important clusters (motor themes) was presented and an in-depth discussion was performed. The thematic evolution map provides a broad perspective of how the field has evolved over time from 1994 to 2020. In addition, our results discuss the main challenges and opportunities for research and practice in the field of study. Our findings provide a comprehensive overview of the main themes related to Digital Agriculture.

AB  - The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as base station (BS) is gaining popularity. In this paper, we consider maximization of the overall data rate by intelligent deployment of UAV BS in the downlink of a cellular system. We investigate a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided approach to optimize the position of flying BSs mounted on board UAVs to support a macro BS (MBS). We propose an algorithm to avoid collision between multiple UAVs undergoing exploratory movements and to restrict UAV BSs movement within a predefined area. Q-learning technique is used to optimize UAV BS position, where the reward is equal to sum of user equipment (UE) data rates. We consider a framework where the UAV BSs carry out exploratory movements in the beginning and exploitary movements in later stages to maximize the overall data rate. Our results show that a cellular system with three UAV BSs and one MBS serving 72 UE reaches 69.2% of the best possible data rate, which is identified by brute force search. Finally, the RL algorithm is compared with a K-means algorithm to study the need of accurate UE locations. Our results show that the RL algorithm outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm when the measure of imperfection is higher. The proposed algorithm can be made use of by a practical MBS&ndash;UAV BSs&ndash;UEs system to provide protection to UAV BSs while maximizing data rate.

AB  - Stem biomass is a fundamental component of the global carbon cycle that is essential for forest productivity estimation. Over the last few decades, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has proven to be a useful tool for accurate carbon stock and biomass estimation in various biomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of multispectral LiDAR data for the reliable estimation of single-tree total and barkless stem biomass (TSB and BSB) in an uneven-aged structured forest with complex topography. Destructive and non-destructive field measurements were collected for a total of 67 dominant and co-dominant Abies borisii-regis trees located in a mountainous area in Greece. Subsequently, two allometric equations were constructed to enrich the reference data with non-destructively sampled trees. Five different regression algorithms were tested for single-tree BSB and TSB estimation using height (height percentiles and bicentiles, max and average height) and intensity (skewness, standard deviation and average intensity) LiDAR-derived metrics: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Gaussian Process (GP), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results showcased that the RF algorithm provided the best overall predictive performance in both BSB (i.e., RMSE = 175.76 kg and R2 = 0.78) and TSB (i.e., RMSE = 211.16 kg and R2 = 0.65) cases. Our work demonstrates that BSB can be estimated with moderate to high accuracy using all the tested algorithms, contrary to the TSB, where only three algorithms (RF, SVR and GP) can adequately provide accurate TSB predictions due to bark irregularities along the stems. Overall, the multispectral LiDAR data provide accurate stem biomass estimates, the general applicability of which should be further tested in different biomes and ecosystems.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The vision-based robot pose estimation and mapping system has the disadvantage of low pose estimation accuracy and poor local detail mapping effects, while the modeling environment has poor features, high dynamics, weak light, and multiple shadows, among others. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive pose fusion (APF) method to fuse the robot&rsquo;s pose and use the optimized pose to construct an indoor map. Firstly, the proposed method calculates the robot&rsquo;s pose by the camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU), respectively. Then, the pose fusion method is adaptively selected according to the motion state of the robot. When the robot is in a static state, the proposed method directly uses the extended Kalman filter (EKF) method to fuse camera and IMU data. When the robot is in a motive state, the weighted coefficient is determined according to the matching success rate of the feature points, and the weighted pose fusion (WPF) method is used to fuse camera and IMU data. According to the different states, a series of new poses of the robot are obtained. Secondly, the fusion optimized pose is used to correct the distance and azimuth angle of the laser points obtained by LiDAR, and a Gauss&ndash;Newton iterative matching process is used to match the corresponding laser points to construct an indoor map. Finally, a pose fusion experiment is designed, and the EuRoc data and the measured data are used to verify the effectiveness of this method. The experimental results confirm that this method provides higher pose estimation accuracy compared with the robust visual inertial odometry (ROVIO) and visual-inertial ORB-SLAM (VI ORB-SLAM) algorithms. Compared with the Cartographer algorithm, this method provides higher two-dimensional map modeling accuracy and modeling performance.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Large sheets of high-density polyethene geomembrane are used as floating covers on some of the wastewater treatment lagoons at the Melbourne Water Corporation&rsquo;s Western Treatment Plant. These covers provide an airtight seal for the anaerobic digestion of sewage and allow for harvesting the methane-rich biogas, which is then used to generate electricity. There is a potential for scum to develop under the covers during the anaerobic digestion of the raw sewage by microorganisms. Due to the nature of the operating environment of the lagoons and the vast size (450 m &times; 170 m) of these covers, a safe non-contact method to monitor the development and movement of the scum is preferred. This paper explores the potential of using a new thermographic approach to identify and monitor the scum under the covers. The approach exploits naturally occurring variations in solar intensity as a trigger for generating a transient thermal response that is then fitted to an exponential decay law to determine a cooling constant. This approach is investigated experimentally using a laboratory-scale test rig. A finite element (FE) model is constructed and shown to reliably predict the experimentally observed thermal transients and cooling constants. This FE model is then set up to simulate progressive scum accumulation with time, using a specified scumberg geometry and a stepwise change in thermal properties. The results indicate a detectable change in the cooling constant at different locations on the cover, thereby providing a quantitative basis for characterising the scum accumulation beneath the cover. The practical application and limitations of these results are briefly discussed.

TI  - OBIA-Based Extraction of Artificial Terrace Damages in the Loess Plateau of China from UAV Photogrammetry

AB  - Terraces, which are typical artificial landforms found around world, are of great importance for agricultural production and soil and water conservation. However, due to the lack of maintenance, terrace damages often occur and affect the local flow process, which will influence soil erosion. Automatic high-accuracy mapping of terrace damages is the basis of monitoring and related studies. Researchers have achieved artificial terrace damage mapping mainly via manual field investigation, but an automatic method is still lacking. In this study, given the success of high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry and object-based image analysis (OBIA) for image processing tasks, an integrated framework based on OBIA and UAV photogrammetry is proposed for terrace damage mapping. The Pujiawa terrace in the Loess Plateau of China was selected as the study area. Firstly, the segmentation process was optimised by considering the spectral features and the terrains and corresponding textures obtained from high-resolution images and digital surface models. The feature selection was implemented via correlation analysis, and the optimised segmentation parameter was achieved using the estimation of scale parameter algorithm. Then, a supervised k-nearest neighbourhood classifier was used to identify the terrace damages in the segmented objects, and additional geometric features at the object level were considered for classification. The comparison with the ground truth, as delineated by the image and field survey, showed that proposed classification can be adequately performed. The F-measures of extraction on three terrace damages were 92.07% (terrace sinkhole), 81.95% (ridge sinkhole), and 85.17% (collapse), and the Kappa coefficient was 85.34%. Finally, the potential application and spatial distribution of the terrace damages in this study were determined. We believe that this work can provide a credible framework for mapping terrace damages in the Loess Plateau of China.

AB  - Forest disturbances&mdash;driven by pests, pathogens, and discrete events&mdash;have led to billions of dollars in lost ecosystem services and management costs. To understand the patterns and severity of these stressors across complex landscapes, there must be an increase in reliable data at scales compatible with management actions. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS or UAV) offer a capable platform for collecting local scale (e.g., individual tree) forestry data. In this study, we evaluate the capability of UAS multispectral imagery and freely available National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery for differentiating coniferous healthy, coniferous stressed, deciduous healthy, deciduous stressed, and degraded individual trees throughout a complex, mixed-species forests. These methods are first compared to assessments of crown vigor in the field, to evaluate the potential in supplementing this resource intensive practice. This investigation uses the random forest and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithms to classify the imagery into the five forest health classes. Using the random forest classifier, the UAS imagery correctly classified five forest Health classes with an overall accuracy of 65.43%. Using similar methods, the high-resolution airborne NAIP imagery achieved an overall accuracy of 50.50% for the five health classes, a reduction of 14.93%. When these classes were generalized to healthy, stressed, and degraded trees, the accuracy improved to 71.19%, using UAS imagery, and 70.62%, using airborne imagery. Further analysis into the precise calibration of UAS multispectral imagery, a refinement of image segmentation methods, and the fusion of these data with more widely distributed remotely sensed imagery would further enhance the potential of these methods to more effectively and efficiently collect forest health information from the UAS instead of using field methods.

AB  - This study tested whether machine learning (ML) methods can effectively separate individual plants from complex 3D canopy laser scans as a prerequisite to analyzing particular plant features. For this, we scanned mung bean and chickpea crops with PlantEye (R) laser scanners. Firstly, we segmented the crop canopies from the background in 3D space using the Region Growing Segmentation algorithm. Then, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based ML algorithms were fine-tuned for plant counting. Application of the CNN-based (Convolutional Neural Network) processing architecture was possible only after we reduced the dimensionality of the data to 2D. This allowed for the identification of individual plants and their counting with an accuracy of 93.18% and 92.87% for mung bean and chickpea plants, respectively. These steps were connected to the phenotyping pipeline, which can now replace manual counting operations that are inefficient, costly, and error-prone. The use of CNN in this study was innovatively solved with dimensionality reduction, addition of height information as color, and consequent application of a 2D CNN-based approach. We found there to be a wide gap in the use of ML on 3D information. This gap will have to be addressed, especially for more complex plant feature extractions, which we intend to implement through further research.

AB  - Construction sites are increasingly complex, and their layout have an impact on productivity, safety, and efficiency of construction operations. Dynamic site layout planning (DSLP) considers the adjustment of construction facilities on-site, on an evolving basis, allowing the relocation of temporary facilities according to the stages of the project. The main objective of this study is to develop a framework for integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their capacity for effective photogrammetry with site layout planning optimisation and Building Information Modelling (BIM) for automating site layout planning in large construction projects. The mathematical model proposed is based on a mixed integer programming (MIP) model, which was employed to validate the framework on a realistic case study provided by an industry partner. Allocation constraints were formulated to ensure the placement of the facilities in feasible regions. Using information from the UAV, several parameters could be considered, including proximity to access ways, distances between the facilities, and suitability of locations. Based on the proposed framework, a layout was developed for each stage of the project, adapting the location of temporary facilities according to current progress on-site. As a result, the use of space was optimised, and internal transport costs were progressively reduced.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Seagrass meadows are one of the blue carbon ecosystems that continue to decline worldwide. Frequent mapping is essential to monitor seagrass meadows for understanding change processes including seasonal variations and influences of meteorological and oceanic events such as typhoons and cyclones. Such mapping approaches may also enhance seagrass blue carbon strategy and management practices. Although unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial photography has been widely conducted for this purpose, there have been challenges in mapping accuracy, efficiency, and applicability to subtidal water meadows. In this study, a novel method was developed for mapping subtidal and intertidal seagrass meadows to overcome such challenges. Ground truth seagrass orthophotos in four seasons were created from the Futtsu tidal flat of Tokyo Bay, Japan, using vertical and oblique UAV photography. The feature pyramid network (FPN) was first applied for automated seagrass classification by adjusting the spatial resolution and normalization parameters and by considering the combinations of seasonal input data sets. The FPN classification results ensured high performance with the validation metrics of 0.957 overall accuracy (OA), 0.895 precision, 0.942 recall, 0.918 F1-score, and 0.848 IoU, which outperformed the conventional U-Net results. The FPN classification results highlighted seasonal variations in seagrass meadows, exhibiting an extension from winter to summer and demonstrating a decline from summer to autumn. Recovery of the meadows was also detected after the occurrence of Typhoon No. 19 in October 2019, a phenomenon which mainly happened before summer 2020.

AB  - The wide use of cooperative missions using multiple unmanned platforms has made relative distance information an essential factor for cooperative positioning and formation control. Reducing the range error effectively in real time has become the main technical challenge. We present a new method to deal with ranging errors based on the distance increment (DI). The DI calculated by dead reckoning is used to smooth the DI obtained by the cooperative positioning, and the smoothed DI is then used to detect and estimate the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) error as well as to smooth the observed values containing random noise in the filtering process. Simulation and experimental results show that the relative accuracy of NLOS estimation is 8.17%, with the maximum random error reduced by 40.27%. The algorithm weakens the influence of NLOS and random errors on the measurement distance, thus improving the relative distance precision and enhancing the stability and reliability of cooperative positioning.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Developing efficient communication between vehicles and everything (V2X) is a challenging task, mainly due to the characteristics of vehicular networks, which include rapid topology changes, large-scale sizes, and frequent link disconnections. This article proposes a deep learning model to enhance V2X communication. Various channel conditions such as interference, channel noise, and path loss affect the communication between a vehicle (V) and everything (X). Thus, the proposed model aims to determine the required optimum interference power to enhance connectivity, comply with the quality of service (QoS) constraints, and improve the communication link reliability. The proposed model fulfills the best QoS in terms of four metrics, namely, achievable data rate (Rb), packet delivery ratio (PDR), packet loss rate (PLR), and average end-to-end delay (E2E). The factors to be considered are the distribution and density of vehicles, average length, and minimum safety distance between vehicles. A mathematical formulation of the optimum required interference power is presented to achieve the given objectives as a constrained optimization problem, and accordingly, the proposed deep learning model is trained. The obtained results show the ability of the proposed model to enhance the connectivity between V2X for improving road traffic information efficiency and increasing road traffic safety.

AB  - Access to broadband communications in different parts of the world has become a priority for some governments and regulatory authorities around the world in recent years. Building new digital roads and pursuing a connected society includes looking for easier access to the internet. In general, not all areas where people congregate are fully covered, especially in rural zones, thus restricting access to data communications and inducing inequality. In the present review article, we have comprehensively surveyed the use of three platforms to deliver broadband services to such remote and low-income areas, and they are proposed as follows: unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), altitude platforms (AP), and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. These novel strategies support the connected and accessible world hypothesis. Hence, UAVs are considered a noteworthy solution since their efficient maneuverability can solve rural coverage issues or not-spots.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - The amount of arable land is limited, yet the demand for agricultural food products is increasing. This issue has led to the notion of precision farming, where smart city-based technologies (e.g., Internet of Things, digital twins, artificial intelligence) are employed in combination to cater for increased production with fewer resources. Widely used in manufacturing, augmented reality has demonstrated impactful solutions for information communication, remote monitoring and increased interaction. Yet, the technology has only recently begun to find a footing alongside precision farming solutions, despite the many benefits possible to farmers through augmenting the physical world with digital objects. Therefore, this article reflects on literature discussing current applied solutions within agriculture, where augmented realty has demonstrated a significant impact for monitoring and production. The findings discuss that augmented reality must be coupled with other technologies (e.g., simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms, global positioning systems, and sensors), specifically 9 are identified across 2 application domains (livestock and crop farming) to be beneficial. Attention is also provided on how augmented reality should be employed within agriculture, where related-work examples are drawn from in order to discuss suitable hardware approaches and constraints (e.g., mobility).

TI  - Remotely Sensed Tree Characterization in Urban Areas: A Review
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 23
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services (ES), including temperature regulation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. Interest in ES has increased amongst policymakers, scientists, and citizens given the extent and growth of urbanized areas globally. However, the methods and techniques used to properly assess biodiversity and ES provided by vegetation in urban environments, at large scales, are insufficient. Individual tree identification and characterization are some of the most critical issues used to evaluate urban biodiversity and ES, given the complex spatial distribution of vegetation in urban areas and the scarcity or complete lack of systematized urban tree inventories at large scales, e.g., at the regional or national levels. This often limits our knowledge on their contributions toward shaping biodiversity and ES in urban areas worldwide. This paper provides an analysis of the state-of-the-art studies and was carried out based on a systematic review of 48 scientific papers published during the last five years (2016&ndash;2020), related to urban tree and greenery characterization, remote sensing techniques for tree identification, processing methods, and data analysis to classify and segment trees. In particular, we focused on urban tree and forest characterization using remotely sensed data and identified frontiers in scientific knowledge that may be expanded with new developments in the near future. We found advantages and limitations associated with both data sources and processing methods, from which we drew recommendations for further development of tree inventory and characterization in urban forestry science. Finally, a critical discussion on the current state of the methods, as well as on the challenges and directions for future research, is presented.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - As the number of civil aerial vehicles increase explosively, spectrum scarcity and security become an increasingly challenge in both the airspace and terrestrial space. To address this difficulty, this paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted (UAV-assisted) spectrum mapping system and a spectrum data reconstruction algorithm driven by spectrum data and channel model are proposed. The reconstruction algorithm, which includes a model-driven spectrum data inference method and a spectrum data completion method with uniformity decision mechanism, can reconstruct limited and incomplete spectrum data to a three-dimensional (3D) spectrum map. As a result, spectrum scarcity and security can be achieved. Spectrum mapping is a symmetry-based digital twin technology. By employing an uniformity decision mechanism, the proposed completion method can effectively interpolate spatial data even when the collected data are unevenly distributed. The effectiveness of the proposed mapping scheme is evaluated by comparing its results with the ray-tracing simulated data of the campus scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed reconstruction algorithm outperforms the classical inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method and the tensor completion method by about 12.5% and 92.3%, respectively, in terms of reconstruction accuracy when the collected spectrum data are regularly missing, unevenly distributed and limited.

AB  - The brain&ndash;computer interface (BCI) is a mechanism for extracting information from the brain, with this information used for various applications. This study proposes a method to control an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying through a BCI system using the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) approach. The UAV&rsquo;s screen emits three frequencies for visual stimulation: 15, 23, and 31 Hz for the UAV&rsquo;s left-turn, forward-flight, and right-turn functions. Due to the requirement of immediate response to the UAV flight, this paper proposes a method to improve the accuracy rate and reduce the time required to correct instruction errors in the resolution of brainwave signals received by UAVs. This study tested ten subjects and verified that the proposed method has a 10% improvement inaccuracy. While the traditional method can take 8 s to correct an error, the proposed method requires only 1 s, making it more suitable for practical applications in UAVs. Furthermore, such a BCI application for UAV systems can achieve the same experience of using the remote control for physically challenged patients.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Hyperspectral Images (HSIs) have been utilized in many fields which contain spatial and spectral features of objects simultaneously. Hyperspectral image matching is a fundamental and critical problem in a wide range of HSI applications. Feature descriptors for grayscale image matching are well studied, but few descriptors are elaborately designed for HSI matching. HSI descriptors, which should have made good use of the spectral feature, are essential in HSI matching tasks. Therefore, this paper presents a descriptor for HSI matching, called HOSG-SIFT, which ensembles spectral features with spatial features of objects. First, we obtain the grayscale image by dimensional reduction from HSI and apply it to extract keypoints and descriptors of spatial features. Second, the descriptors of spectral features are designed based on the histogram of the spectral gradient (HOSG), which effectively preserves the physical significance of the spectral profile. Third, we concatenate the spatial descriptors and spectral descriptors with the same weights into a new descriptor and apply it for HSI matching. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HOSG-SIFT performs superior against traditional feature descriptors.

AB  - Due to the complexity and danger of Mars&rsquo;s environment, traditional Mars unmanned ground vehicles cannot efficiently perform Mars exploration missions. To solve this problem, the DeepLabV3+/Efficientnet hybrid network is proposed and applied to the scene area judgment for the Mars unmanned vehicle system. Firstly, DeepLabV3+ is used to extract the feature information of the Mars image due to its high accuracy. Then, the feature information is used as the input for Efficientnet, and the categories of scene areas are obtained, including safe area, report area, and dangerous area. Finally, according to three categories, the Mars unmanned vehicle system performs three operations: pass, report, and send. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the DeepLabV3+/Efficientnet hybrid network in the scene area judgment. Compared with the Efficientnet network, the accuracy of the DeepLabV3+/Efficientnet hybrid network is improved by approximately 18% and reaches 99.84%, which ensures the safety of the exploration mission for the Mars unmanned vehicle system.

VL  - 14

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Conformance control is an effective method to enhance heavy oil recovery for cyclic-steam-stimulated horizontal wells. The numerical simulation technique is frequently used prior to field applications to evaluate the incremental oil production with conformance control in order to ensure cost-efficiency. However, conventional numerical simulations require the use of specific thermal numerical simulators that are usually expensive and computationally inefficient. This paper proposed the use of the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) trees to estimate the incremental oil production of conformance control with N2-foam and gel for cyclic-steam-stimulated horizontal wells. A database consisting of 1000 data points was constructed using numerical simulations based on the geological and fluid properties of the heavy oil reservoir in the Chunfeng Oilfield, which was then used for training and validating the XGBoost model. Results show that the XGBoost model is capable of estimating the incremental oil production with relatively high accuracy. The mean absolute errors (MAEs), mean relative errors (MRE) and correlation coefficients are 12.37/80.89 t, 0.09%/0.059% and 0.99/0.98 for the training/validation sets, respectively. The validity of the prediction model was further confirmed by comparison with numerical simulations for six real production wells in the Chunfeng Oilfield. The permutation indices (PI) based on the XGBoost model indicate that net to gross ratio (NTG) and the cumulative injection of the plugging agent exerts the most significant effects on the enhanced oil production. The proposed method can be easily transferred to other heavy oil reservoirs, provided efficient training data are available.

AB  - Communities in urban space are the most basic living units. Community visual features directly reflect the local living quality and influence the perception of residents and visitors. The evaluation of the community visual features is of great significance to the space design under the guidance of urban landscape recognition and urban space perception. Based on the street view image data, this paper analyzes the composition of visual features in the community space scale by using the geographically weighted principal components analysis. GWPCA can not only reflect the global characteristics, but also analyze the local components, thus describing the visual features of the community in a comprehensive manner. The results show that: (1) community visual features have significant spatial heterogeneity at different statistical scales, and the spatial heterogeneity of community visual features can provide a basis for urban landscape planning and design; (2) the combination mode of dominant visual elements can reflect different community landscapes. The analysis of this paper further illustrates the effectiveness and application prospect of street view images in identifying the landscape composition mode of urban space from the medium-micro perspective. This conclusion is helpful for planners to learn the dominant visual features of the community through street view images, and, further, use the classification of elements of street view images to guide the planning and design of cityscape.

AB  - In recent years, jellyfish outbreaks have frequently occurred in offshore areas worldwide, posing a significant threat to the marine fishery, tourism, coastal industry, and personal safety. Effective monitoring of jellyfish is a vital method to solve the above problems. However, the optical detection method for jellyfish is still in the primary stage. Therefore, this paper studies a jellyfish detection method based on convolution neural network theory and digital image processing technology. This paper studies the underwater image preprocessing algorithm because the quality of underwater images directly affects the detection results. The results show that the image quality is better after applying the three algorithms namely prior defogging, adaptive histogram equalization, and multi-scale retinal enhancement, which is more conducive to detection. We establish a data set containing seven species of jellyfishes and fish. A total of 2141 images are included in the data set. The YOLOv3 algorithm is used to detect jellyfish, and its feature extraction network Darknet53 is optimized to ensure it is conducted in real-time. In addition, we introduce label smoothing and cosine annealing learning rate methods during the training process. The experimental results show that the improved algorithms improve the detection accuracy of jellyfish on the premise of ensuring the detection speed. This paper lays a foundation for the construction of an underwater jellyfish optical imaging real-time monitoring system.

AB  - Detection accuracy of current machine-learning approaches to intrusion detection depends heavily on feature engineering and dimensionality-reduction techniques (e.g., variational autoencoder) applied to large datasets. For many use cases, a tradeoff between detection performance and resource requirements must be considered. In this paper, we propose Loci-Constellation-based Intrusion Detection System (LC-IDS), a general framework for network intrusion detection (detection of already known and previously unknown routing attacks) for reconfigurable wireless networks (e.g., vehicular ad hoc networks, unmanned aerial vehicle networks). We introduce the concept of &lsquo;attack-constellation&rsquo;, which allows us to represent all the relevant information for intrusion detection (misuse detection and anomaly detection) on a latent 2-dimensional space that arises naturally by considering the temporal structure of the input data. The attack/anomaly-detection performance of LC-IDS is analyzed through simulations in a wide range of network conditions. We show that for all the analyzed network scenarios, we can detect known attacks, with a good detection accuracy, and anomalies with low false positive rates. We show the flexibility and scalability of LC-IDS that allow us to consider a dynamic number of neighboring nodes and routing attacks in the &lsquo;attack-constellation&rsquo; in a distributed fashion and with low computational requirements.

How to efficiently and accurately identify crops in a timely manner by remote sensing in order to determine the crop planting area and its temporal&ndash;spatial dynamic change information is a core issue of monitoring crop growth and estimating regional crop yields. Based on hundreds of relevant documents from the past 25 years, in this paper, we summarize research progress in relation to farmland vegetation identification and classification by remote sensing. The classification and identification of farmland vegetation includes classification based on vegetation index, spectral bands, multi-source data fusion, artificial intelligence learning, and drone remote sensing. Representative studies of remote sensing methods are collated, the main content of each technology is summarized, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are analyzed. Current problems related to crop remote sensing identification are then identified and future development directions are proposed.

AB  - Crop monitoring is crucial to understand crop production changes, agronomic practice decision-support, pests/diseases mitigation, and developing climate change adaptation strategies. Banana, an important staple food and cash crop in East Africa, is threatened by Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW) disease. Yet, there is no up-to-date information about the spatial distribution and extent of banana lands, especially in Rwanda, where banana plays a key role in food security and livelihood. Therefore, delineation of banana-cultivated lands is important to prioritize resource allocation for optimal productivity. We mapped the spatial extent of smallholder banana farmlands by acquiring and processing high-resolution (25 cm/px) multispectral unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) imageries, across four villages in Rwanda. Georeferenced ground-truth data on different land cover classes were combined with reflectance data and vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, and EVI2) and compared using pixel-based supervised multi-classifiers (support vector models-SVM, classification and regression trees-CART, and random forest&ndash;RF), based on varying ground-truth data richness. Results show that RF consistently outperformed other classifiers regardless of data richness, with overall accuracy above 95%, producer&rsquo;s/user&rsquo;s accuracies above 92%, and kappa coefficient above 0.94. Estimated banana farmland areal coverage provides concrete baseline for extension-delivery efforts in terms of targeting banana farmers relative to their scale of production, and highlights opportunity to combine UAV-derived data with machine-learning methods for rapid landcover classification.

TI  - Classifying Individual Shrub Species in UAV Images&mdash;A Case Study of the Gobi Region of Northwest China
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 24
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Shrublands are the main vegetation component in the Gobi region and contribute considerably to its ecosystem. Accurately classifying individual shrub vegetation species to understand their spatial distributions and to effectively monitor species diversity in the Gobi ecosystem is essential. High-resolution remote sensing data create vegetation type inventories over large areas. However, high spectral similarity between shrublands and surrounding areas remains a challenge. In this study, we provide a case study that integrates object-based image analysis (OBIA) and the random forest (RF) model to classify shrubland species automatically. The Gobi region on the southern slope of the Tian Shan Mountains in Northwest China was analyzed using readily available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB imagery (1.5 cm spatial resolution). Different spectral and texture index images were derived from UAV RGB images as variables for species classification. Principal component analysis (PCA) extracted features from different types of variable sets (original bands, original bands + spectral indices, and original bands + spectral indices + texture indices). We tested the ability of several non-parametric decision tree models and different types of variable sets to classify shrub species. Moreover, we analyzed three main shrubland areas comprising different shrub species and compared the prediction accuracies of the optimal model in combination with different types of variable sets. We found that the RF model could generate higher accuracy compared with the other two models. The best results were obtained using a combination of the optimal variable set and the RF model with an 88.63% overall accuracy and 0.82 kappa coefficient. Integrating OBIA and RF in the species classification process provides a promising method for automatic mapping of individual shrub species in the Gobi region and can reduce the workload of individual shrub species classification.

TI  - Tracking Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on the Kalman Filter Considering Uncertainty and Error Aware
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 24
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have made significant impacts on our daily lives with the advancement of technologies and their applications. Tracking UAVs have become more important because they not only provide location-based services, but are also faced with serious security threats and vulnerabilities. UAVs are smaller in nature, move with high speed, and operate in a low-altitude environment, which makes it conceivable to track UAVs using fixed or mobile radars. Kalman Filter (KF)-based methodologies are widely used for extracting valuable trajectory information from samples composed of noisy information. As UAVs&rsquo; trajectories resemble uncertain behavior, the traditional KF-based methodologies have poor tracking accuracy. Recently, the Diffusion-Map-based KF (DMK) was introduced for modeling uncertainties in the environment without prior knowledge. However, the model has poor accuracy when operating in environments with higher noise. In order to achieve better tracking performance, this paper presents the Uncertainty and Error-Aware KF (UEAKF) for tracking UAVs. The UEAKF-based tracking method provides a good tradeoff among preceding estimate confidence and forthcoming measurement under dynamic environments; the resulting filter is robust and nonlinear in nature. The experimental results showed that the UEAKF-based UAV tracking model achieves much better Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance compared to the existing particle filter-based and DMK-based UAV tracking models.

AB  - In a changing climate where future food security is a growing concern, researchers are exploring new methods and technologies in the effort to meet ambitious crop yield targets. The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) including Machine Learning (ML) methods in this area has been proposed as a potential mechanism to support this. This review explores current research in the area to convey the state-of-the-art as to how AI/ML have been used to advance research, gain insights, and generally enable progress in this area. We address the question&mdash;Can AI improve crops and plant health? We further discriminate the bluster from the lustre by identifying the key challenges that AI has been shown to address, balanced with the potential issues with its usage, and the key requisites for its success. Overall, we hope to raise awareness and, as a result, promote usage, of AI related approaches where they can have appropriate impact to improve practices in agricultural and plant sciences.

TI  - Tree Species Classification Based on Sentinel-2 Imagery and Random Forest Classifier in the Eastern Regions of the Qilian Mountains
T2  - Forests

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12
IS  - 12
SN  - 1999-4907

AB  - Obtaining accurate forest coverage of tree species is an important basis for the rational use and protection of existing forest resources. However, most current studies have mainly focused on broad tree classification, such as coniferous vs. broadleaf tree species, and a refined tree classification with tree species information is urgently needed. Although airborne LiDAR data or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images can be used to acquire tree information even at the single tree level, this method will encounter great difficulties when applied to a large area. Therefore, this study takes the eastern regions of the Qilian Mountains as an example to explore the possibility of tree species classification with satellite-derived images. We used Sentinel-2 images to classify the study area&rsquo;s major vegetation types, particularly four tree species, i.e., Sabina przewalskii (S.P.), Picea crassifolia (P.C.), Betula spp. (Betula), and Populus spp. (Populus). In addition to the spectral features, we also considered terrain and texture features in this classification. The results show that adding texture features can significantly increase the separation between tree species. The final classification result of all categories achieved an accuracy of 86.49% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.83. For trees, the classification accuracy was 90.31%, and their producer&rsquo;s accuracy (PA) and user&rsquo;s (UA) were all higher than 84.97%. We found that altitude, slope, and aspect all affected the spatial distribution of these four tree species in our study area. This study confirms the potential of Sentinel-2 images for the fine classification of tree species. Moreover, this can help monitor ecosystem biological diversity and provide references for inventory estimation.

VL  - 4

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Modern cities require a tighter integration with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for bringing new services to the citizens. The Smart City is the revolutionary paradigm aiming at integrating the ICT with the citizen life; among several urban services, transports are one of the most important in modern cities, introducing several challenges to the Smart City paradigm. In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of new vehicular applications and services, Edge Computing (EC) is one of the most promising technologies when integrated into the Vehicular Networks (VNs). EC-enabled VNs can facilitate new latency-critical and data-intensive applications and services. However, ground-based EC platforms (i.e., Road Side Units&mdash;RSUs, 5G Base Stations&mdash;5G BS) can only serve a reduced number of Vehicular Users (VUs), due to short coverage ranges and resource shortage. In the recent past, several new aerial platforms with integrated EC facilities have been deployed for achieving global connectivity. Such air-based EC platforms can complement the ground-based EC facilities for creating a futuristic VN able to deploy several new applications and services. The goal of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a novel joint air-ground EC platform within a VN architecture for helping VUs with new intelligent applications and services. By exploiting most modern technologies, with particular attention towards network softwarization, vehicular edge computing, and machine learning, we propose here three possible layered air-ground EC-enabled VN scenarios. For each of the discussed scenarios, a list of the possible challenges is considered, as well possible solutions allowing to overcome all or some of the considered challenges. A proper comparison is also done, through the use of tables, where all the proposed scenarios, and the proposed solutions, are discussed.

AB  - Mapping surface ceramics through systematic pedestrian archaeological survey is considered a consistent method to recover the cultural biography of sites within a micro-region. Archaeologists nowadays conduct surface survey equipped with navigation devices counting, documenting, and collecting surface archaeological potsherds within a set of plotted grids. Recent advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and image processing analysis can be utilised to support such surface archaeological investigations. In this study, we have implemented two different artificial intelligence image processing methods over two areas of interest near the present-day village of Kophinou in Cyprus, in the Xeros River valley. We have applied a random forest classifier through the Google Earth Engine big data cloud platform and a Single Shot Detector neural network in the ArcGIS Pro environment. For the first case study, the detection was based on red&ndash;green&ndash;blue (RGB) high-resolution orthophotos. In contrast, a multispectral camera covering both the visible and the near-infrared parts of the spectrum was used in the second area of investigation. The overall results indicate that such an approach can be used in the future as part of ongoing archaeological pedestrian surveys to detect scattered potsherds in areas of archaeological interest, even if pottery shares a very high spectral similarity with the surface.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The spatial information about crop grain protein concentration (GPC) can be an important layer (i.e., a map that can be utilized in a geographic information system) with uses from nutrient management to grain marketing. Recently, on- and off-combine harvester sensors have been developed for creating spatial GPC layers. The quality of these GPC layers, as measured by the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the relationship between measured and predicted GPC, is affected by different sensing characteristics. The objectives of this synthesis analysis were to (i) contrast GPC prediction R2 and RMSE for different sensor types (on-combine, off-combine proximal and remote); (ii) contrast and discuss the best spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions and features, and the best statistical approach for off-combine sensors; and (iii) review current technology limitations and provide future directions for spatial GPC research and application. On-combine sensors were more accurate than remote sensors in predicting GPC, yet with similar precision. The most optimal conditions for creating reliable GPC predictions from off-combine sensors were sensing near anthesis using multiple spectral features that include the blue and green bands, and that are analyzed by complex statistical approaches. We discussed sensor choice in regard to previously identified uses of a GPC layer, and further proposed new uses with remote sensors including same season fertilizer management for increased GPC, and in advance segregated harvest planning related to field prioritization and farm infrastructure. Limitations of the GPC literature were identified and future directions for GPC research were proposed as (i) performing GPC predictive studies on a larger variety of crops and water regimes; (ii) reporting proper GPC ground-truth calibrations; (iii) conducting proper model training, validation, and testing; (iv) reporting model fit metrics that express greater concordance with the ideal predictive model; and (v) implementing and benchmarking one or more uses for a GPC layer.

AB  - The preservation and analysis of tangible cultural heritage sites have attracted enormous interest worldwide. Recently, establishing three-dimensional (3D) digital archives has emerged as a critical strategy for the permanent preservation and digital analysis of cultural sites. For extant parts of cultural sites, 3D scanning is widely used for efficient and accurate digitization. However, in many historical sites, many parts that have been damaged or lost by natural or artificial disasters are unavailable for 3D scanning. The remaining available data sources for these destroyed parts are photos, computer-aided design (CAD) drawings, written descriptions, etc. In this paper, we achieve an integrated digital archive of a UNESCO World Heritage site, namely, the Borobudur temple, in which buried reliefs and internal foundations are not available for 3D scanning. We introduce a digitizing framework to integrate three different kinds of data sources and to create a unified point-cloud-type digital archive. This point-based integration enables us to digitally record the entire 3D structure of the target cultural heritage site. Then, the whole site is visualized by stochastic point-based rendering (SPBR) precisely and comprehensibly. The proposed framework is widely applicable to other large-scale cultural sites.

T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 24
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Advanced remote sensing techniques for estimating crop nitrogen (N) are crucial for optimizing N fertilizer management. Hyperspectral LiDAR (HSL) data, with both spectral and spatial information of the targets, can extract more plant properties than traditional LiDAR and hyperspectral imaging systems. In this study, we tested the ability of HSL in terms of estimating maize N concentration at the leaf-level by using spectral indices and partial least squares regression (PLSR) methods. Subsequently, the N estimation was scaled up to the plant-level based on HSL point clouds. Biomass, extracted with structural proxies, was utilized to exhibit its supplemental effect on N concentration. The results show that HSL has the ability to extract N concentrations at both the leaf-level and the canopy-level, and PLSR showed better performance (R2 &gt; 0.6) than the single spectral index (R2 &gt; 0.4). In comparison to the stem height and maximum canopy width, the plant height had the strongest ability (R2 = 0.88) to estimate biomass. Future research should utilize larger datasets to test the viability of using HSL to monitor the N concentration of crops, which is beneficial for precision agriculture.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12

SN  - 1999-4907

AB  - Rapid and accurate plant growth and biomass estimation is essential for formulating and implementing targeted forest cultivation measures. In this study, RGB-D imaging technology was used to obtain the RGB and depth imaging data for a Toona sinensis seedling canopy to estimate plant growth and aboveground biomass (AGB). Three hundred T. sinensis seedlings from 20 varieties were planted under five different drought stress treatments. The U-Net model was applied first to achieve highly accurate segmentation of plants from complex backgrounds. Simple linear regression (SLR) was used for plant height prediction, and the other three models, including multivariate linear (ML), random forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regression, were applied to predict the AGB and compared for optimal model selection. The results showed that the SLR model yields promising and reliable results for the prediction of plant height, with R2 and RMSE values of 0.72 and 1.89 cm, respectively. All three regression methods perform well in the prediction of AGB estimation. MLP yields the highest accuracy in predicting dry and fresh aboveground biomass compared to the other two regression models, with R2 values of 0.77 and 0.83, respectively. The combination of Gray, Green minus red (GMR) and Excess green index (ExG) was identified as the key predictor by RReliefF for predicting dry AGB. GMR was the most important in predicting fresh AGB. This study demonstrated that the merits of RGB-D and machine learning models are effective phenotyping techniques for plant height and AGB prediction, and can be used to assist dynamic responses to drought stress for breeding selection.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide an intermediate scale of spatial and spectral data collection that yields increased accuracy and consistency in data collection for morphological and physiological traits than satellites and expanded flexibility and high-throughput compared to ground-based data collection. In this study, we used UAV-based remote sensing for automated phenotyping of field-grown switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a leading bioenergy feedstock. Using vegetation indices calculated from a UAV-based multispectral camera, statistical models were developed for rust disease caused by Puccinia novopanici, leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen, and lignin contents. For the first time, UAV remote sensing technology was used to explore the potentials for multiple traits associated with sustainable production of switchgrass, and one statistical model was developed for each individual trait based on the statistical correlation between vegetation indices and the corresponding trait. Also, for the first time, lignin content was estimated in switchgrass shoots via UAV-based multispectral image analysis and statistical analysis. The UAV-based models were verified by ground-truthing via correlation analysis between the traits measured manually on the ground-based with UAV-based data. The normalized difference red edge (NDRE) vegetation index outperformed the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for rust disease and nitrogen content, while NDVI performed better than NDRE for chlorophyll and lignin content. Overall, linear models were sufficient for rust disease and chlorophyll analysis, but for nitrogen and lignin contents, nonlinear models achieved better results. As the first comprehensive study to model switchgrass sustainability traits from UAV-based remote sensing, these results suggest that this methodology can be utilized for switchgrass high-throughput phenotyping in the field.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming integrated into a wide range of modern IoT applications. The growing number of networked IoT devices generates a large amount of data. However, processing and memorizing this massive volume of data at local nodes have been deemed critical challenges, especially when using artificial intelligence (AI) systems to extract and exploit valuable information. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a way to bring cloud computing (CC) processes within reach of users, to address computation-intensive offloading and latency issues. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the most relevant research works related to UAV technology applications in terms of enabled or assisted MEC architectures. It details the utility of UAV-enabled MEC architecture regarding emerging IoT applications and the role of both deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in meeting various limitations related to latency, task offloading, energy demand, and security. Furthermore, throughout this article, the reader gains an insight into the future of UAV-enabled MEC, the advantages and the critical challenges to be tackled when using AI.

AB  - A vision-based approach has been employed in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of bridge infrastructure. The approach has many advantages: non-contact, non-destructive, long-distance, high precision, immunity from electromagnetic interference, and multiple-target monitoring. This review aims to summarise the vision- and Digital Image Correlation (DIC)-based SHM methods for bridge infrastructure because of their strategic significance and security concerns. Four different bridge types were studied: concrete, suspension, masonry, and steel bridge. DIC applications in SHM have recently garnered attention in aiding to assess the bridges&rsquo; structural response mechanisms under loading. Different non-destructive diagnostics methods for SHM in civil infrastructure have been used; however, vision-based techniques like DIC were only developed over the last two decades, intending to facilitate damage detection in bridge systems with prompt and accurate data for efficient and sustainable operation of the bridge structure throughout its service life. Research works reviewed in this article demonstrated the DIC capability to detect damage such as cracks, spalling, and structural parameters such as deformation, strains, vibration, deflection, and rotation. In addition, the reviewed works indicated that the DIC as an efficient and reliable technique could provide sustainable monitoring solutions for different bridge infrastructures.

For the purpose of assessing long-term gully growth rates, the influencing factors and potential of gully growth, KH-4B satellite images, Quickbird-2 images, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images were used to assess gully erosion from 1969 to 2019. The effects of runoff, topography and human activities were analyzed with information derived from historical and present images. Ninety-five investigated gullies were classified into four types: 45 growing, 25 stable, 21 infilled and four excavated gullies. The rates (RA) of 45 growing gullies ranged from 0.50 to 20.94 m2&middot;yr&minus;1, with an average of 5.66 m2&middot;yr&minus;1 from 1969 to 2010. The present drainage area, local slope, average drainage slope, annual runoff, and ratio of the terraced area were all significantly different between the stable and growing gullies. The long-term gully growth rate could be estimated using a nonlinear regression model with annual runoff (Qa) and the slope of the drainage area (Sd) as predictors (RA = 0.301Qa0.562Sd, R2 = 0.530). Based on the Sg-A and Sg-Qa relationship that was used to reveal the threshold conditions for gully growth, all growing gullies still have the potential to keep growing, but soil and water conservation measures, including terraces, could change the threshold condition by reducing the effective drainage area. The results of this study could be helpful for preventing further gully erosion by dealing with gullies far above the threshold line.

AB  - Hyperspectral imaging offers enormous potential for measuring grape composition with a high degree of representativity, allowing all exposed grapes from the cluster to be examined non-destructively. On-the-go hyperspectral images were acquired using a push broom hyperspectral camera (400&ndash;100 nm) that was mounted in the front part of a motorized platform moving at 5 km/h in a commercial Tempranillo vineyard in La Rioja, Spain. Measurements were collected on three dates during grape ripening in 2018 on the east side of the canopy, which was defoliated in the basal fruiting zone. A total of 144 grape clusters were measured for Total soluble solids (TSS), Titratable acidity (TA), pH, Tartaric and Malic acid, Anthocyanins and Total polyphenols, using standard wet chemistry reference methods, throughout the entire experiment. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was used to build calibration, cross validation and prediction models for the grape composition parameters. The best performances returned determination coefficients values of external validation (R2p) of 0.82 for TSS, 0.81 for Titratable acidity, 0.61 for pH, 0.62 for Tartaric acid, 0.84 for Malic acid, 0.88 for Anthocyanins and 0.55 for Total polyphenols. The promising results exposed in this work disclosed a notable methodology on-the-go for the non-destructive, in-field assessment of grape quality composition parameters along the ripening period.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) clusters usually face problems such as complex environments, heterogeneous combat subjects, and realistic interference factors in the course of mission assignment. In order to reduce resource consumption and improve the task execution rate, it is very important to develop a reasonable allocation plan for the tasks. Therefore, this paper constructs a heterogeneous UAV multitask assignment model based on several realistic constraints and proposes an improved half-random Q-learning (HR Q-learning) algorithm. The algorithm is based on the Q-learning algorithm under reinforcement learning, and by changing the way the Q-learning algorithm selects the next action in the process of random exploration, the probability of obtaining an invalid action in the random case is reduced, and the exploration efficiency is improved, thus increasing the possibility of obtaining a better assignment scheme, this also ensures symmetry and synergy in the distribution process of the drones. Simulation experiments show that compared with Q-learning algorithm and other heuristic algorithms, HR Q-learning algorithm can improve the performance of task execution, including the ability to improve the rationality of task assignment, increasing the value of gains by 12.12%, this is equivalent to an average of one drone per mission saved, and higher success rate of task execution. This improvement provides a meaningful attempt for UAV task assignment.

SN  - 1999-4907

AB  - In remote sensing, red edge bands are important indicators for monitoring vegetation growth. To examine the application potential of red edge bands in forest canopy closure estimation, three types of commonly used models&mdash;empirical statistical models (multiple stepwise regression (MSR)), machine learning models (back propagation neural network (BPNN)) and physical models (Li&ndash;Strahler geometric-optical (Li&ndash;Strahler GO) models)&mdash;were constructed and verified based on Sentinel-2 data, DEM data and measured data. In addition, we set up a comparative experiment without red edge bands. The relative error (ER) values of the BPNN model, MSR model, and Li&ndash;Strahler GO model with red edge bands were 16.97%, 20.76% and 24.83%, respectively. The validation accuracy measures of these models were higher than those of comparison models. For comparative experiments, the ER values of the MSR, Li&ndash;Strahler GO and BPNN models were increased by 13.07%, 4% and 1.22%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that red edge bands can effectively improve the accuracy of forest canopy closure estimation models to varying degrees. These findings provide a reference for modeling and estimating forest canopy closure using red edge bands based on Sentinel-2 images.

AB  - By effectively observing the land surface and obtaining farmland conditions, satellite remote sensing has played an essential role in agricultural drought monitoring over past decades. Among all remote sensing techniques, optical and thermal remote sensing have the most extended history of being utilized in drought monitoring. The primary goal of this paper is to illustrate how optical and thermal remote sensing have been and will be applied in the monitoring, assessment, and prediction of agricultural drought. We group the methods into four categories: optical, thermal, optical and thermal, and multi-source. For each category, a concise explanation is given to show the inherent mechanisms. We pay special attention to solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, which has great potential in early drought detection. Finally, we look at the future directions of agricultural drought monitoring, including (1) early detection; (2) spatio-temporal resolution; (3) organic combination of multi-source data; and (4) smart prediction and assessment based on deep learning and cloud computing.

AB  - It is an objective demand for sustainable agricultural development to realize fast and accurate cultivated land quality assessment. In this paper, Tengzhou city (county-scale hilly area: scale A), Shanghe county (county-scale plain area: scale B), and Huang-Huai-Hai region (including large-scale hilly and plain area: scale C and D) were taken as research areas. Through the conversion of evaluation systems, the inversion models at the county-scale were constructed. Then, the image scale conversion was carried out based on the numerical regression method, and the upscaling inversion was realized. The results showed that: (1) the conversion models of evaluation systems (CMES) are Y = 1.021x &minus; 4.989 (CMESA&minus;B), Y = 0.801x + 16.925 (CMESA&minus;C), and Y = 0.959x + 3.458 (CMESC&minus;D); (2) the booting stage is the best inversion phase; (3) the back propagation neural network model based on the combination index group (CI-BPNN) is the best inversion model, with the R2 are 0.723 (modeling set) and 0.722 (verification set). CI-BPNN and CI-BPNN-CMESA&minus;B models are suitable for the hilly and plain areas at the county-scale, and the level area ratio difference is less than 4.87%. Furthermore, (4) the reflectance conversion model of short-wave infrared 2 is cubic, and the rest are quadratic. CI-BPNN-CMESA&minus;C and CI-BPNN-CMESA&minus;C-CMESC&minus;D models realized upscaling inversion in the hilly and plain areas, with the maximum level area ratio difference being 1.60%. Additionally, (5) the wheat field quality has improved steadily since 2001 in the Huang-Huai-Hai region. This study proposes an upscaling inversion method of wheat field quality, which provides a scientific basis for cultivated land management and agricultural production in large areas.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The effectiveness of the Wolf Pack Algorithm (WPA) in high-dimensional discrete optimization problems has been verified in previous studies; however, it usually takes too long to obtain the best solution. This paper proposes the Multi-Population Parallel Wolf Pack Algorithm (MPPWPA), in which the size of the wolf population is reduced by dividing the population into multiple sub-populations that optimize independently at the same time. Using the approximate average division method, the population is divided into multiple equal mass sub-populations whose better individuals constitute an elite sub-population. Through the elite-mass population distribution, those better individuals are optimized twice by the elite sub-population and mass sub-populations, which can accelerate the convergence. In order to maintain the population diversity, population pretreatment is proposed. The sub-populations migrate according to a constant migration probability and the migration of sub-populations are equivalent to the re-division of the confluent population. Finally, the proposed algorithm is carried out in a synchronous parallel system. Through the simulation experiments on the task assignment of the UAV swarm in three scenarios whose dimensions of solution space are 8, 30 and 150, the MPPWPA is verified as being effective in improving the optimization performance.

SN  - 2075-1702

AB  - This paper introduces a new intelligent fault diagnosis method based on stack pruning sparse denoising autoencoder and convolutional neural network (sPSDAE-CNN). This method processes the original input data by using a stack denoising autoencoder. Different from the traditional autoencoder, stack pruning sparse denoising autoencoder includes a fully connected autoencoding network, the features extracted from the front layer of the network are used for the operation of the subsequent layer, which means that some new connections will appear between the front and rear layers of the network, reduce the loss of information, and obtain more effective features. Firstly, a one-dimensional sliding window is introduced for data enhancement. In addition, transforming one-dimensional time-domain data into the two-dimensional gray image can further improve the deep learning (DL) ability of models. At the same time, pruning operation is introduced to improve the training efficiency and accuracy of the network. The convolutional neural network model with sPSDAE has a faster training speed, strong adaptability to noise interference signals, and can also suppress the over-fitting problem of the convolutional neural network to a certain extent. Actual experiments show that for the fault of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) blade damage, the sPSDAE-CNN model we use has better stability and reliable prediction accuracy than traditional convolutional neural networks. At the same time, For noise signals, better results can be obtained. The experimental results show that the sPSDAE-CNN model still has a good diagnostic accuracy rate in a high-noise environment. In the case of a signal-to-noise ratio of &minus;4, it still has an accuracy rate of 90%.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) support humans in performing an increasingly varied number of tasks. UAVs need to be remotely operated by a human pilot in many cases. Therefore, pilots require repetitive training to master the UAV movements. Nevertheless, training with an actual UAV involves high costs and risks. Fortunately, simulators are alternatives to face these difficulties. However, existing simulators lack realism, do not present flight information intuitively, and sometimes do not allow natural interaction with the human operator. This work addresses these issues through a framework for building realistic virtual simulators for the human operation of UAVs. First, the UAV is modeled in detail to perform a dynamic simulation in this framework. Then, the information of the above simulation is utilized to manipulate the elements in a virtual 3D operation environment developed in Unity 3D. Therefore, the interaction with the human operator is introduced with a proposed teleoperation algorithm and an input device. Finally, a meta-heuristic optimization procedure provides realism to the simulation. In this procedure, the flight information obtained from an actual UAV is used to optimize the parameters of the teleoperation algorithm. The quadrotor is adopted as the study case to show the proposal&rsquo;s effectiveness.

AB  - The use of high-throughput phenotyping with imaging and machine learning to monitor seedling growth is a tough yet intriguing subject in plant research. This has been recently addressed with low-cost RGB imaging sensors and deep learning during day time. RGB-Depth imaging devices are also accessible at low-cost and this opens opportunities to extend the monitoring of seedling during days and nights. In this article, we investigate the added value to fuse RGB imaging with depth imaging for this task of seedling growth stage monitoring. We propose a deep learning architecture along with RGB-Depth fusion to categorize the three first stages of seedling growth. Results show an average performance improvement of 5% correct recognition rate by comparison with the sole use of RGB images during the day. The best performances are obtained with the early fusion of RGB and Depth. Also, Depth is shown to enable the detection of growth stage in the absence of the light.

AB  - Oxytropis ochrocephala Bunge is an herbaceous perennial poisonous weed. It severely affects the production of local animal husbandry and ecosystem stability in the source region of Yellow River (SRYR), China. To date, however, the spatiotemporal distribution of O. ochrocephala is still unclear, mainly due to lack of high-precision observation data and effective methods at a regional scale. In this study, an efficient sampling method, based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), was proposed to supply basic sampling data for species distribution models (SDMs, BIOMOD in this study). A total of 3232 aerial photographs were obtained, from 2018 to 2020, in SRYR, and the potential and future distribution of O. ochrocephala were predicted by an ensemble model, consisting of six basic models of BIOMOD. The results showed that: (1) O. ochrocephala mainly distributed in the southwest, middle, and northeast of the SRYR, and the high suitable habitat of O. ochrocephala accounted for 3.19%; (2) annual precipitation and annual mean temperature were the two most important factors that affect the distribution of O. ochrocephala, with a cumulative importance of 60.45%; and (3) the distribution probability of O. ochrocephala tends to increase from now to the 2070s, while spatial distribution ranges will remain in the southwest, middle, and northeast of the SRYR. This study shows that UAVs can potentially be used to obtain the basic data for species distribution modeling; the results are both beneficial to establishing reasonable management practices and animal husbandry in alpine grassland systems.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Accurate assessment of crop nitrogen (N) status and understanding the N demand are considered essential in precision N management. Chlorophyll fluorescence is unsusceptible to confounding signals from underlying bare soil and is closely related to plant photosynthetic activity. Therefore, fluorescence sensing is considered a promising technology for monitoring crop N status, even at an early growth stage. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential of using Multiplex&reg; 3, a proximal canopy fluorescence sensor, to detect N status variability and to quantitatively estimate N status indicators at four key growth stages of maize. The sensor measurements were performed at different growth stages, and three different regression methods were compared to estimate plant N concentration (PNC), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI). The results indicated that the induced differences in maize plant N status were detectable as early as the V6 growth stage. The first method based on simple regression (SR) and the Multiplex sensor indices normalized by growing degree days (GDD) or N sufficiency index (NSI) achieved acceptable estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.73&ndash;0.87), showing a good potential of canopy fluorescence sensing for N status estimation. The second method using multiple linear regression (MLR), fluorescence indices and GDDs had the lowest modeling accuracy (R2 = 0.46&ndash;0.79). The third tested method used a non-linear regression approach in the form of random forest regression (RFR) based on multiple sensor indices and GDDs. This approach achieved the best estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.84&ndash;0.93) and the most accurate diagnostic result.

AB  - Solar energy is one of the most strategic energy sources for the world&rsquo;s economic development. This has caused the number of solar photovoltaic plants to increase around the world; consequently, they are installed in places where their access and manual inspection are arduous and risky tasks. Recently, the inspection of photovoltaic plants has been conducted with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Although the inspection with UAVs can be completed with a drone operator, where the UAV flight path is purely manual or utilizes a previously generated flight path through a ground control station (GCS). However, the path generated in the GCS has many restrictions that the operator must supply. Due to these restrictions, we present a novel way to develop a flight path automatically with coverage path planning (CPP) methods. Using a DL server to segment the region of interest (RoI) within each of the predefined PV plant images, three CPP methods were also considered and their performances were assessed with metrics. The UAV energy consumption performance in each of the CPP methods was assessed using two different UAVs and standard metrics. Six experiments were performed by varying the CPP width, and the consumption metrics were recorded in each experiment. According to the results, the most effective and efficient methods are the exact cellular decomposition boustrophedon and grid-based wavefront coverage, depending on the CPP width and the area of the PV plant. Finally, a relationship was established between the size of the photovoltaic plant area and the best UAV to perform the inspection with the appropriate CPP width. This could be an important result for low-cost inspection with UAVs, without high-resolution cameras on the UAV board, and in small plants.

IS  - 24
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Connected vehicles (CVs) have the potential to collect and share information that, if appropriately processed, can be employed for advanced traffic control strategies, rendering infrastructure-based sensing obsolete. However, before we reach a fully connected environment, where all vehicles are CVs, we have to deal with the challenge of incomplete data. In this paper, we develop data-driven methods for the estimation of vehicles approaching a signalised intersection, based on the availability of partial information stemming from an unknown penetration rate of CVs. In particular, we build machine learning models with the aim of capturing the nonlinear relations between the inputs (CV data) and the output (number of non-connected vehicles), which are characterised by highly complex interactions and may be affected by a large number of factors. We show that, in order to train these models, we may use data that can be easily collected with modern technologies. Moreover, we demonstrate that, if the available real data is not deemed sufficient, training can be performed using synthetic data, produced via microscopic simulations calibrated with real data, without a significant loss of performance. Numerical experiments, where the estimation methods are tested using real vehicle data simulating the presence of various penetration rates of CVs, show very good performance of the estimators, making them promising candidates for applications in the near future.

AB  - This paper presents the first complete approach to achieving environmental intelligence support in the management of vegetation within electrical power transmission corridors. Contrary to the related studies that focused on the mapping of power lines, together with encroaching vegetation risk assessment, we realised predictive analytics with vegetation growth simulation. This was achieved by following the JDL/DFIG data fusion model for complementary feature extraction from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived data products and auxiliary thematic maps that feed an ensemble regression model. The results indicate that improved vegetation growth prediction accuracy is obtained by segmenting training samples according to their contextual similarities that relate to their ecological niches. Furthermore, efficient situation assessment was then performed using a rasterised parametrically defined funnel-shaped volumetric filter. In this way, RMSE&asymp;1 m was measured when considering tree growth simulation, while a 0.37 m error was estimated in encroaching vegetation detection, demonstrating significant improvements over the field observations.

AB  - For many applications deployed in manufacturing networks, communication latency has been a significant barrier. Despite the constant development of improved communication protocols and standards during Industry 4.0, the latency problem persists, lowering quality of services (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). Tactile internet (TI), with its high availability, security, and ultra-low latency, will add a new dimension to human-machine interaction (HMI) by enabling haptic and tactile sensations. The tactile internet (TI) is a cutting-edge technology that uses 5G and beyond (B5G) communications to enable real-time interaction of haptic data over the internet between tactile ends. This emerging TI technology is regarded as the next evolutionary step for the Internet of Things (IoT) and is expected to bring about massive changes towards Society 5.0 and to address complex issues in current society. To that end, the 5G mobile communication systems will support the TI at the wireless edge. As a result, TI can be used as a backbone for delay mitigation in conjunction with 5G networks, allowing for ultra-reliable low latency applications like Smart Manufacturing, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to present the current state of 5G and TI, as well as the challenges and future trends for 5G networks beyond 2021, as well as a conceptual framework for integrating 5G and TI into existing industrial case studies, with a focus on the design aspects and layers of TI, such as the master, network, and slave layers. Finally, the key publications focused on the key enabling technologies of TI are summarized and the beyond 5G era towards Society 5.0 based on cyber-physical systems is discussed.

AB  - In recent years, the delay in sowing has become a major obstacle to high wheat yield in Jiangsu Province, one of the major wheat producing areas in China; hence, it is necessary to screen wheat varieties are resilient for late sowing. This study aimed to provide an effective, fast, and non-destructive monitoring method of soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, which can represent leaf chlorophyll contents, for late-sown winter wheat variety screening. This study acquired multispectral images using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at the overwintering stage of winter wheat growth, and further processed these images to extract reflectance of five single spectral bands and calculated 26 spectral vegetation indices. Based on these 31 variables, this study combined three variable selection methods (i.e., recursive feature elimination (RFE), random forest (RF), and Pearson correlation coefficient (r)) with four machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest regression (RFR), linear kernel-based support vector regression (SVR), radial basis function (RBF) kernel-based SVR, and sigmoid kernel-based SVR), resulted in seven SVR models (i.e., RFE-SVR_linear, RF-SVR_linear, RF-SVR_RBF, RF-SVR_sigmoid, r-SVR_linear, r-SVR_RBF, and r-SVR_sigmoid) and three RFR models (i.e., RFE-RFR, RF-RFR, and r-RFR). The performances of the 10 machine learning models were evaluated and compared with each other according to the achieved coefficient of determination (R2), residual prediction deviation (RPD), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (RRMSE) in SPAD estimation. Of the 10 models, the best one was the RF-SVR_sigmoid model, which was the combination of the RF variable selection method and the sigmoid kernel-based SVR algorithm. It achieved high accuracy in estimating SPAD values of the wheat canopy (R2 = 0.754, RPD = 2.017, RMSE = 1.716 and RRMSE = 4.504%). The newly developed UAV- and machine learning-based model provided a promising and real time method to monitor chlorophyll contents at the overwintering stage, which can benefit late-sown winter wheat variety screening.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - High throughput phenotyping (HTP) for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) stay green (SG) is expected in field breeding as SG is a beneficial phenotype for wheat high yield and environment adaptability. The RGB and multispectral imaging based on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are widely popular multi-purpose HTP platforms for crops in the field. The purpose of this study was to compare the potential of UAV RGB and multispectral images (MSI) in SG phenotyping of diversified wheat germplasm. The multi-temporal images of 450 samples (406 wheat genotypes) were obtained and the color indices (CIs) from RGB and MSI and spectral indices (SIs) from MSI were extracted, respectively. The four indices (CIs in RGB, CIs in MSI, SIs in MSI, and CIs + SIs in MSI) were used to detect four SG stages, respectively, by machine learning classifiers. Then, all indices&rsquo; dynamics were analyzed and the indices that varied monotonously and significantly were chosen to calculate wheat temporal stay green rates (SGR) to quantify the SG in diverse genotypes. The correlations between indices&rsquo; SGR and wheat yield were assessed and the dynamics of some indices&rsquo; SGR with different yield correlations were tracked in three visual observed SG grades samples. In SG stage detection, classifiers best average accuracy reached 93.20&ndash;98.60% and 93.80&ndash;98.80% in train and test set, respectively, and the SIs containing red edge or near-infrared band were more effective than the CIs calculated only by visible bands. Indices&rsquo; temporal SGR could quantify SG changes on a population level, but showed some differences in the correlation with yield and in tracking visual SG grades samples. In SIs, the SGR of Normalized Difference Red-edge Index (NDRE), Red-edge Chlorophyll Index (CIRE), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in MSI showed high correlations with yield and could track visual SG grades at an earlier stage of grain filling. In CIs, the SGR of Normalized Green Red Difference Index (NGRDI), the Green Leaf Index (GLI) in RGB and MSI showed low correlations with yield and could only track visual SG grades at late grain filling stage and that of Norm Red (NormR) in RGB images failed to track visual SG grades. This study preliminarily confirms the MSI is more available and reliable than RGB in phenotyping for wheat SG. The index-based SGR in this study could act as HTP reference solutions for SG in diversified wheat genotypes.

AB  - Current methods of broadcast herbicide application cause a negative environmental and economic impact. Computer vision methods, specifically those related to object detection, have been reported to aid in site-specific weed management procedures for targeted herbicide application within a field. However, a major challenge to developing a weed detection system is the requirement for a properly annotated database to differentiate between weeds and crops under field conditions. This research involved creating an annotated database of 374 red, green, and blue (RGB) color images organized into monocot and dicot weed classes. The images were acquired from corn and soybean research plots located in north-central Indiana using an unmanned aerial system (UAS) flown at 30 and 10 m heights above ground level (AGL). A total of 25,560 individual weed instances were manually annotated. The annotated database consisted of four different subsets (Training Image Sets 1&ndash;4) to train the You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3) deep learning model for five separate experiments. The best results were observed with Training Image Set 4, consisting of images acquired at 10 m AGL. For monocot and dicot weeds, respectively, an average precision (AP) score of 91.48 % and 86.13% was observed at a 25% IoU threshold (AP @ T = 0.25), as well as 63.37% and 45.13% at a 50% IoU threshold (AP @ T = 0.5). This research has demonstrated a need to develop large, annotated weed databases to evaluate deep learning models for weed identification under field conditions. It also affirms the findings of other limited research studies utilizing object detection for weed identification under field conditions.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Crop growth and development is a dynamic and complex process, and the essence of yield formation is the continuous accumulation of photosynthetic products from multiple fertility stages. In this study, a new stacking method for integrating multiple growth stages information was proposed to improve the performance of the winter wheat grain yield (GY) prediction model. For this purpose, crop canopy hyperspectral reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) data were obtained at the jointing, flagging, anthesis and grain filling stages. In this case, 15 vegetation indices and LAI were used as input features of the elastic network to construct GY prediction models for single growth stage. Based on Stacking technique, the GY prediction results of four single growth stages were integrated to construct the ensemble learning framework. The results showed that vegetation indices coupled LAI could effectively overcome the spectral saturation phenomenon, the validated R2 of each growth stage was improved by 10%, 22.5%, 3.6% and 10%, respectively. The stacking method provided more stable information with higher prediction accuracy than the individual fertility results (R2 = 0.74), and the R2 of the model validation phase improved by 236%, 51%, 27.6%, and 12.1%, respectively. The study can provide a reference for GY prediction of other crops.

AB  - This study presents a methodology to estimate the seven indicators of the Setting and Infrastructure criterion of the UI GreenMetric World University Ranking based on three-dimensional data from a point cloud taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This study also estimated the potential aerial biomass, C and CO2, stored in the green spaces of a university campus using photogrammetric data analyzed in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The method was based on isolating classified point clouds using digital surface models (DSMs) and ground control points (GCPs) considering the canopy height model (CHM), the allometric equation (DBH, p, h), the biomass conversion factor, and carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e). The results confirmed that the national models for estimating the potential C reserves in natural forests are very close to reality and that the open space and green areas available to people on campus are adequate. The use of photogrammetric data facilitated the estimation of UI GreenMetric indicators from a highly detailed, low-cost three-dimensional model. The results of a case study revealed that the campus assimilates the CO2 emissions it produces and generates a surplus.

TI  - Reconfigurable Computing for Reactive Robotics Using Open-Source FPGAs
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2022
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Reconfigurable computing provides a paradigm to create intelligent systems different from the classic software computing approach. Instead of using a processor with an instruction set, a full stack of middleware, and an application program running on top, the field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) integrate a cell set that can be configured in different ways. A few vendors have dominated this market with their proprietary tools, hardware devices, and boards, resulting in fragmented ecosystems with few standards and little interoperation. However, a new and complete toolchain for FPGAs with its associated open tools has recently emerged from the open-source community. Robotics is an expanding application field that may definitely benefit from this revolution, as fast speed and low power consumption are usual requirements. This paper hypothesizes that basic reactive robot behaviors may be easily designed following the reconfigurable computing approach and the state-of-the-art open FPGA toolchain. They provide new abstractions such as circuit blocks and wires for building intelligent robots. Visual programming and block libraries make such development painless and reliable. As experimental validation, two reactive behaviors have been created in a real robot involving common sensors, actuators, and in-between logic. They have been also implemented using classic software programming for comparison purposes. Results are discussed and show that the development of reactive robot behaviors using reconfigurable computing and open tools is feasible, also achieving a high degree of simplicity and reusability, and benefiting from FPGAs&rsquo; low power consumption and time-critical responsiveness.

TI  - Low-Altitude Aerial Video Surveillance via One-Class SVM Anomaly Detection from Textural Features in UAV Images
T2  - Information

PY  - 2022
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - In recent years, small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been used in many video surveillance applications, such as vehicle tracking, border control, dangerous object detection, and many others. Anomaly detection can represent a prerequisite of many of these applications thanks to its ability to identify areas and/or objects of interest without knowing them a priori. In this paper, a One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) anomaly detector based on customized Haralick textural features for aerial video surveillance at low-altitude is presented. The use of a One-Class SVM, which is notoriously a lightweight and fast classifier, enables the implementation of real-time systems even when these are embedded in low-computational small-scale UAVs. At the same time, the use of textural features allows a vision-based system to detect micro and macro structures of an analyzed surface, thus allowing the identification of small and large anomalies, respectively. The latter aspect plays a key role in aerial video surveillance at low-altitude, i.e., 6 to 15 m, where the detection of common items, e.g., cars, is as important as the detection of little and undefined objects, e.g., Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Experiments obtained on the UAV Mosaicking and Change Detection (UMCD) dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, where the model achieves a 100% precision, i.e., never misses an anomaly, but at the expense of a reasonable trade-off in its recall, which still manages to reach up to a 71.23% score. Moreover, when compared to classical Haralick textural features, the model obtains significantly higher performances, i.e., &asymp;20% on all metrics, further demonstrating the approach effectiveness.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has changed the worldwide network of people, smart devices, intelligent things, data, and information as an emergent technology. IoT development is still in its early stages, and numerous interrelated challenges must be addressed. IoT is the unifying idea of embedding everything. The Internet of Things offers a huge opportunity to improve the world&rsquo;s accessibility, integrity, availability, scalability, confidentiality, and interoperability. However, securing the Internet of Things is a difficult issue. The IoT aims to connect almost everything within the framework of a common infrastructure. This helps in controlling devices and, will allow device status to be updated everywhere and at any time. To develop technology via IoT, several critical scientific studies and inquiries have been carried out. However, many obstacles and problems remain to be tackled in order to reach IoT&rsquo;s maximum potential. These problems and concerns must be taken into consideration in different areas of the IoT, such as implementation in remote areas, threats to the system, development support, social and environmental impacts, etc. This paper reviews the current state of the art in different IoT architectures, with a focus on current technologies, applications, challenges, IoT protocols, and opportunities. As a result, a detailed taxonomy of IoT is presented here which includes interoperability, scalability, security and energy efficiency, among other things. Moreover, the significance of blockchains and big data as well as their analysis in relation to IoT, is discussed. This article aims to help readers and researchers understand the IoT and its applicability to the real world.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Powdery mildew severely affects wheat growth and yield; therefore, its effective monitoring is essential for the prevention and control of the disease and global food security. In the present study, a spectroradiometer and thermal infrared cameras were used to obtain hyperspectral signature and thermal infrared images data, and thermal infrared temperature parameters (TP) and texture features (TF) were extracted from the thermal infrared images and RGB images of wheat with powdery mildew, during the wheat flowering and filling periods. Based on the ten vegetation indices from the hyperspectral data (VI), TF and TP were integrated, and partial least square regression, random forest regression (RFR), and support vector machine regression (SVR) algorithms were used to construct a prediction model for a wheat powdery mildew disease index. According to the results, the prediction accuracy of RFR was higher than in other models, under both single data source modeling and multi-source data modeling; among the three data sources, VI was the most suitable for powdery mildew monitoring, followed by TP, and finally TF. The RFR model had stable performance in multi-source data fusion modeling (VI&amp;TP&amp;TF), and had the optimal estimation performance with 0.872 and 0.862 of R2 for calibration and validation, respectively. The application of multi-source data collaborative modeling could improve the accuracy of remote sensing monitoring of wheat powdery mildew, and facilitate the achievement of high-precision remote sensing monitoring of crop disease status.

AB  - Citrus fruit detection can provide technical support for fine management and yield determination of citrus orchards. Accurate detection of citrus fruits in mountain orchards is challenging because of leaf occlusion and citrus fruit mutual occlusion of different fruits. This paper presents a citrus detection task that combines UAV data collection, AI embedded device, and target detection algorithm. The system used a small unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a camera to take full-scale pictures of citrus trees; at the same time, we extended the state-of-the-art model target detection algorithm, added the attention mechanism and adaptive fusion feature method, improved the model&rsquo;s performance; to facilitate the deployment of the model, we used the pruning method to reduce the amount of model calculation and parameters. The improved target detection algorithm is ported to the edge computing end to detect the data collected by the unmanned aerial vehicle. The experiment was performed on the self-made citrus dataset, the detection accuracy was 93.32%, and the processing speed at the edge computing device was 180 ms/frame. This method is suitable for citrus detection tasks in the mountainous orchard environment, and it can help fruit growers to estimate their yield.

AB  - Areca yellow leaf disease is a major attacker of the planting and production of arecanut. The continuous expansion of arecanut (Areca catechu L.) planting areas in Hainan has placed a great need to strengthen the monitoring of this disease. At present, there is little research on the monitoring of areca yellow leaf disease. PlanetScope imagery can achieve daily global coverage at a high spatial resolution (3 m) and is thus suitable for the high-precision monitoring of plant pest and disease. In this paper, PlanetScope images were employed to extract spectral features commonly used in disease, pest and vegetation growth monitoring for primary models. In this paper, 13 spectral features commonly used in vegetation growth and pest monitoring were selected to form the initial feature space, followed by the implementation of the Correlation Analysis (CA) and independent t-testing to optimize the feature space. Then, the Random Forest (RF), Backward Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and AdaBoost algorithms based on feature space optimization to construct double-classification (healthy, diseased) monitoring models for the areca yellow leaf disease. The results indicated that the green, blue and red bands, and plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) exhibited highly significant differences and strong correlations with healthy and diseased samples. The RF model exhibits the highest overall recognition accuracy for areca yellow leaf disease (88.24%), 2.95% and 20.59% higher than the BPNN and AdaBoost models, respectively. The commission and omission errors were lowest with the RF model for both healthy and diseased samples. This model also exhibited the highest Kappa coefficient at 0.765. Our results exhibit the feasible application of PlanetScope imagery for the regional large-scale monitoring of areca yellow leaf disease, with the RF method identified as the most suitable for this task. Our study provides a reference for the monitoring, a rapid assessment of the area affected and the management planning of the disease in the agricultural and forestry industries.

AB  - To improve productivity, reduce production costs, and minimize the environmental impacts of agriculture, the advancement of nitrogen (N) fertilizer management methods is needed. The objective of this study is to compare the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery and PlanetScope satellite imagery, together with plant height, leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture, and field topographic metrics to predict the canopy nitrogen weight (g/m2) of wheat fields in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Random Forests (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) models, applied to either UAV imagery or satellite imagery, were evaluated for canopy nitrogen weight prediction. The top-performing UAV imagery-based validation model used SVR with seven selected variables (plant height, LAI, four VIs, and the NIR band) with an R2 of 0.80 and an RMSE of 2.62 g/m2. The best satellite imagery-based validation model was RF, which used 17 variables including plant height, LAI, the four PlanetScope bands, and 11 VIs, resulting in an R2 of 0.92 and an RMSE of 1.75 g/m2. The model information can be used to improve field nitrogen predictions for the effective management of N fertilizer.

AB  - In this paper, UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle, DJI Phantom4RTK) and YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once) target detection deep neural network methods were employed to collected mature rice images and detect rice ears to produce a rice density prescription map. The YOLOv4 model was used for rice ear quick detection of rice images captured by a UAV. The Kriging interpolation algorithm was used in ArcGIS to make rice density prescription maps. Mature rice images collected by a UAV were marked manually and used to build the training and testing datasets. The resolution of the images was 300 &times; 300 pixels. The batch size was 2, and the initial learning rate was 0.01, and the mean average precision (mAP) of the best trained model was 98.84%. Exceptionally, the network ability to detect rice in different health states was also studied with a mAP of 95.42% in the no infection rice images set, 98.84% in the mild infection rice images set, 94.35% in the moderate infection rice images set, and 93.36% in the severe infection rice images set. According to the severity of rice sheath blight, which can cause rice leaves to wither and turn yellow, the blighted grain percentage increased and the thousand-grain weight decreased, the rice images were divided into these four infection levels. The ability of the network model (R2 = 0.844) was compared with traditional image processing segmentation methods (R2 = 0.396) based on color and morphology features and machine learning image segmentation method (Support Vector Machine, SVM R2 = 0.0817, and K-means R2 = 0.1949) for rice ear counting. The results highlight that the CNN has excellent robustness, and can generate a wide range of rice density prescription maps.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Most 3D CityGML building models in street-view maps (e.g., Google, Baidu) lack texture information, which is generally used to reconstruct real-scene 3D models by photogrammetric techniques, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mapping. However, due to its simplified building model and inaccurate location information, the commonly used photogrammetric method using a single data source cannot satisfy the requirement of texture mapping for the CityGML building model. Furthermore, a single data source usually suffers from several problems, such as object occlusion. We proposed a novel approach to achieve CityGML building model texture mapping by multiview coplanar extraction from UAV remotely sensed or terrestrial images to alleviate these problems. We utilized a deep convolutional neural network to filter out object occlusion (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles, and trees) and obtain building-texture distribution. Point-line-based features are extracted to characterize multiview coplanar textures in 2D space under the constraint of a homography matrix, and geometric topology is subsequently conducted to optimize the boundary of textures by using a strategy combining Hough-transform and iterative least-squares methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach enables texture mapping for building fa&ccedil;ades to use 2D terrestrial images without the requirement of exterior orientation information; that is, different from the photogrammetric method, a collinear equation is not an essential part to capture texture information. In addition, the proposed approach can significantly eliminate blurred and distorted textures of building models, so it is suitable for automatic and rapid texture updates.

AB  - In the 21st century, remote sensing (RS) has become increasingly employed in many environmental studies. This paper constitutes an overview of works utilising RS methods in studies on peatlands and investigates publications from the period 2010&ndash;2021. Based on fifty-nine case studies from different climatic zones (from subarctic to subtropical), we can indicate an increase in the use of RS methods in peatland research during the last decade, which is likely a result of the greater availability of new remote sensing data sets (Sentinel 1 and 2; Landsat 8; SPOT 6 and 7) paired with the rapid development of open-source software (ESA SNAP; QGIS and SAGA GIS). In the studied works, satellite data analyses typically encompassed the following elements: land classification/identification of peatlands, changes in water conditions in peatlands, monitoring of peatland state, peatland vegetation mapping, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), and the estimation of carbon resources in peatlands. The most frequently employed research methods, on the other hand, included: vegetation indices, soil moisture indices, water indices, supervised classification and machine learning. Remote sensing data combined with field research is deemed helpful for peatland monitoring and multi-proxy studies, and they may offer new perspectives on research at a regional level.

AB  - This paper provides a novel methodology for designing implanted multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) antennas in the automatic fashion. The proposed optimization consists of two sequential phases for firstly configuring the geometry of an implanted MIMO antenna and then sizing the design parameters through the hierarchy top-down optimization (TDO) and regression deep neural network (DNN), respectively. It tackles the difficulty in constructing the structure of antennas and also provides optimal values for the determined variables, sufficiently. This methodology results in valid electromagnetic (EM)-verified post-layout generation that is ready-to-fabricate. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization-oriented method is verified by designing and optimizing the implanted MIMO antenna in the frequency band of 4.34&ndash;4.61 GHz and 5.86&ndash;6.64 GHz suitable for medical applications at the emerging wireless band. For our design, we employ the actual biological tissues as bone, liquid (%1 sodium chloride, %40 sugar in distilled water), and plexiglass surroundings with a bio-compatible substrate, as aluminium oxide on a large ground plane, that is suitable to be used in a particular biomedical applications involving smart implants.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid PSO Enhanced ANFIS Model in Prediction of Traffic Flow of Vehicles on Freeways: Traffic Data Evidence from South Africa
T2  - Infrastructures

PY  - 2022
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
SN  - 2412-3811

AB  - In the last few years, there has been a significant rise in the number of private vehicles ownership, migration of people from rural areas to urban cities, and the rise in the number of under-maintained freeways; all these have added to the perennial problem of traffic congestion. Traffic flow prediction has been recognized as the solution in alleviating and reducing the problem of traffic congestion. In this research, we developed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system trained by particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO) by performing an evaluative performance of the model through traffic flow modelling of vehicles on five freeways (N1,N3,N12,N14&nbsp;and&nbsp;N17) using South Africa Transportation System as a case study. Six hundred and fifty (650) traffic data were collected using inductive loop detectors and video cameras from the five freeways. The traffic data used for developing these models comprises traffic volume, traffic density, speed of vehicles, time, and different types of vehicles. The traffic data were divided into 70% and 30% for the training and validation of the model. The model results show a positively correlated optimal performance between the inputs and the output with a regression value R2&nbsp; of 0.9978 and 0.9860 for the training and testing. The result of this research shows that the soft computing model ANFIS-PSO used in this research can model vehicular traffic flow on freeways. Furthermore, the evidence from this research suggests that the on-peak and off-peak hours are significant determinants of vehicular traffic flow on freeways. The modelling approach developed in this research will assist urban planners in developing practical ways to tackle traffic congestion and assist motorists and pedestrians in travel behaviour decision-making. Finally, the approach used in this study will assist transportation engineers in making constructive and safety dependent guidelines for drivers and pedestrians on freeways.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Optimised farm crop productivity requires careful management in response to the spatial and temporal variability of yield. Accordingly, combination of crop simulation models and remote sensing data provides a pathway for providing the spatially variable information needed on current crop status and the expected yield. An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation framework was developed to assimilate plant and soil observations into a prediction model to improve crop development and yield forecasting. Specifically, this study explored the performance of assimilating state observations into the APSIM-Wheat model using a dataset collected during the 2018/19 wheat season at a farm near Cora Lynn in Victoria, Australia. The assimilated state variables include (1) ground-based measurements of Leaf Area Index (LAI), soil moisture throughout the profile, biomass, and soil nitrate-nitrogen; and (2) remotely sensed observations of LAI and surface soil moisture. In a baseline scenario, an unconstrained (open-loop) simulation greatly underestimated the wheat grain with a relative difference (RD) of &minus;38.3%, while the assimilation constrained simulations using ground-based LAI, ground-based biomass, and remotely sensed LAI were all found to improve the RD, reducing it to &minus;32.7%, &minus;9.4%, and &minus;7.6%, respectively. Further improvements in yield estimation were found when: (1) wheat states were assimilated in phenological stages 4 and 5 (end of juvenile to flowering), (2) plot-specific remotely sensed LAI was used instead of the field average, and (3) wheat phenology was constrained by ground observations. Even when using parameters that were not accurately calibrated or measured, the assimilation of LAI and biomass still provided improved yield estimation over that from an open-loop simulation.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Identification and mapping of various habitats with sufficient spatial details are essential to support environmental planning and management. Considering the complexity of diverse habitat types in a heterogeneous landscape, a context-dependent mapping framework is expected to be superior to traditional classification techniques. With the aim to produce a territory-wide habitat map in Hong Kong, a three-stage mapping procedure was developed to identify 21 habitats by combining very-high-resolution satellite images, geographic information system (GIS) layers and knowledge-based modification rules. In stage 1, several classification methods were tested to produce initial results with 11 classes from a WorldView-2/3 image mosaic using a combination of spectral, textural, topographic and geometric variables. In stage 2, modification rules were applied to refine the classification results based on contextual properties and ancillary data layers. Evaluation of the classified maps showed that the highest overall accuracy was obtained from pixel-based random forest classification (84.0%) and the implementation of modification rules led to an average 8.8% increase in the accuracy. In stage 3, the classification scheme was expanded to all 21 habitats through the adoption of additional rules. The resulting habitat map achieved &gt;80% accuracy for most of the evaluated classes and &gt;70% accuracy for the mixed habitats when validated using field-collected points. The proposed mapping framework was able to utilize different information sources in a systematic and controllable workflow. While transitional mixed habitats were mapped using class membership probabilities and a soft classification method, the identification of other habitats benefited from the hybrid use of remote-sensing classification and ancillary data. Adaptive implementation of classification procedures, development of appropriate rules and combination with spatial data are recommended when producing an integrated and accurate map.

AB  - The increasing number of severe storm events is threatening European forests. Besides the primary damages directly caused by storms, there are secondary damages such as bark beetle outbreaks and tertiary damages due to negative effects on the market. These subsequent damages can be minimized if a detailed overview of the affected area and the amount of damaged wood can be obtained quickly and included in the planning of clearance measures. The present work utilizes UAV-orthophotos and an adaptation of the U-Net architecture for the semantic segmentation and localization of windthrown stems. The network was pre-trained with generic datasets, randomly combining stems and background samples in a copy&ndash;paste augmentation, and afterwards trained with a specific dataset of a particular windthrow. The models pre-trained with generic datasets containing 10, 50 and 100 augmentations per annotated windthrown stems achieved F1-scores of 73.9% (S1Mod10), 74.3% (S1Mod50) and 75.6% (S1Mod100), outperforming the baseline model (F1-score 72.6%), which was not pre-trained. These results emphasize the applicability of the method to correctly identify windthrown trees and suggest the collection of training samples from other tree species and windthrow areas to improve the ability to generalize. Further enhancements of the network architecture are considered to improve the classification performance and to minimize the calculative costs.

TI  - Red Tide Detection Method for HY&minus;1D Coastal Zone Imager Based on U&minus;Net Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Existing red tide detection methods have mainly been developed for ocean color satellite data with low spatial resolution and high spectral resolution. Higher spatial resolution satellite images are required for red tides with fine scale and scattered distribution. However, red tide detection methods for ocean color satellite data cannot be directly applied to medium&ndash;high spatial resolution satellite data owing to the shortage of red tide responsive bands. Therefore, a new red tide detection method for medium&ndash;high spatial resolution satellite data is required. This study proposes the red tide detection U&minus;Net (RDU&minus;Net) model by considering the HY&minus;1D Coastal Zone Imager (HY&minus;1D CZI) as an example. RDU&minus;Net employs the channel attention model to derive the inter&minus;channel relationship of red tide information in order to reduce the influence of the marine environment on red tide detection. Moreover, the boundary and binary cross entropy (BBCE) loss function, which incorporates the boundary loss, is used to obtain clear and accurate red tide boundaries. In addition, a multi&minus;feature dataset including the HY&minus;1D CZI radiance and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is employed to enhance the spectral difference between red tides and seawater and thus improve the accuracy of red tide detection. Experimental results show that RDU&minus;Net can detect red tides accurately without a precedent threshold. Precision and Recall of 87.47% and 86.62%, respectively, are achieved, while the F1&minus;score and Kappa are 0.87. Compared with the existing method, the F1&minus;score is improved by 0.07&ndash;0.21. Furthermore, the proposed method can detect red tides accurately even under interference from clouds and fog, and it shows good performance in the case of red tide edges and scattered distribution areas. Moreover, it shows good applicability and can be successfully applied to other satellite data with high spatial resolution and large bandwidth, such as GF&minus;1 Wide Field of View 2 (WFV2) images.

TI  - A Methodology for the Automated Delineation of Crop Tree Crowns from UAV-Based Aerial Imagery by Means of Morphological Image Analysis

SN  - 2073-4395

AB  - The popularisation of aerial remote sensing using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), has boosted the capacities of agronomists and researchers to offer farmers valuable data regarding the status of their crops. This paper describes a methodology for the automated detection and individual delineation of tree crowns in aerial representations of crop fields by means of image processing and analysis techniques, providing accurate information about plant population and canopy coverage in intensive-farming orchards with a row-based plant arrangement. To that end, after pre-processing initial aerial captures by means of photogrammetry and morphological image analysis, a resulting binary representation of the land plot surveyed is treated at connected component-level in order to separate overlapping tree crown projections. Then, those components are morphologically transformed into a set of seeds with which tree crowns are finally delineated, establishing the boundaries between them when they appear overlapped. This solution was tested on images from three different orchards, achieving semantic segmentations in which more than 94% of tree canopy-belonging pixels were correctly classified, and more than 98% of trees were successfully detected when assessing the methodology capacities for estimating the overall plant population. According to these results, the methodology represents a promising tool for automating the inventorying of plants and estimating individual tree-canopy coverage in intensive tree-based orchards.

TI  - Using UAV and Multispectral Images to Estimate Peanut Maturity Variability on Irrigated and Rainfed Fields Applying Linear Models and Artificial Neural Networks

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Using UAV and multispectral images has contributed to identifying field variability and improving crop management through different data modeling methods. However, knowledge on application of these tools to manage peanut maturity variability is still lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare and validate linear and multiple linear regression with models using artificial neural networks (ANN) for estimating peanut maturity under irrigated and rainfed conditions. The models were trained (80% dataset) and tested (20% dataset) using results from the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons from irrigated and rainfed fields. In each field, plant reflectance was collected weekly from 90 days after planting using a UAV-mounted multispectral camera. Images were used to develop vegetation indices (VIs). Peanut pods were collected on the same dates as the UAV flights for maturity assessment using the peanut maturity index (PMI). The precision and accuracy of the linear models to estimate PMI using VIs were, in general, greater in irrigated fields with R2 &gt; 0.40 than in rainfed areas, which had a maximum R2 value of 0.21. Multiple linear regressions combining adjusted growing degree days (aGDD) and VIs resulted in decreased RMSE for both irrigated and rainfed conditions and increased R2 in irrigated areas. However, these models did not perform successfully in the test process. On the other hand, ANN models that included VIs and aGDD showed accuracy of R2 = 0.91 in irrigated areas, regardless of using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP; RMSE = 0.062) or Radial Basis Function (RBF; RMSE = 0.065), as well as low tendency (1:1 line). These results indicated that, regardless of the ANN architecture used to predict complex and non-linear variables, peanut maturity can be estimated accurately through models with multiple inputs using VIs and aGDD. Although the accuracy of the MLP or RBF models for irrigated and rainfed areas separately was high, the overall ANN models using both irrigated and rainfed areas can be used to predict peanut maturity with the same precision.

TI  - Attentively Learning Edge Distributions for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Semantic segmentation has been a fundamental task in interpreting remote sensing imagery (RSI) for various downstream applications. Due to the high intra-class variants and inter-class similarities, inflexibly transferring natural image-specific networks to RSI is inadvisable. To enhance the distinguishability of learnt representations, attention modules were developed and applied to RSI, resulting in satisfactory improvements. However, these designs capture contextual information by equally handling all the pixels regardless of whether they around edges. Therefore, blurry boundaries are generated, rising high uncertainties in classifying vast adjacent pixels. Hereby, we propose an edge distribution attention module (EDA) to highlight the edge distributions of leant feature maps in a self-attentive fashion. In this module, we first formulate and model column-wise and row-wise edge attention maps based on covariance matrix analysis. Furthermore, a hybrid attention module (HAM) that emphasizes the edge distributions and position-wise dependencies is devised combing with non-local block. Consequently, a conceptually end-to-end neural network, termed as EDENet, is proposed to integrate HAM hierarchically for the detailed strengthening of multi-level representations. EDENet implicitly learns representative and discriminative features, providing available and reasonable cues for dense prediction. The experimental results evaluated on ISPRS Vaihingen, Potsdam and DeepGlobe datasets show the efficacy and superiority to the state-of-the-art methods on overall accuracy (OA) and mean intersection over union (mIoU). In addition, the ablation study further validates the effects of EDA.

Increasingly, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being used in search and rescue operations. This study proposes a method to generate a search path that covers all generated nodes in the shortest amount of time with multiple heterogeneous UAVs. The proposed model, which is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model based on a hexagonal grid-based decomposition method, was verified through a simulation analysis based on the performance of an actual UAV. This study presents both the optimization technique&rsquo;s calculation time as a function of the search area size and the various UAV routes derived as the search area grows. The results of this study can have wide-ranging applications for emergency search and rescue operations.

AB  - Noncollaborative surveillance of airborne UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) is a key enabler to the safe integration of UAS within a UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) ecosystem. Thus, a wide variety of new sensors (known as Counter-UAS sensors) are being developed to provide real-time UAS tracking, ranging from radar, RF analysis and image-based detection to even sound-based sensors. This paper aims to discuss the current state-of-the art technology in this wide variety of sensors (both academically and commercially) and to propose a set of simulation models for them. Thus, the review is focused on identifying the key parameters and processes that allow modeling their performance and operation, which reflect the variety of measurement processes. The resulting simulation models are designed to help evaluate how sensors&rsquo; performances affect UTM systems, and specifically the implications in their tracking and tactical services (i.e., tactical conflicts with uncontrolled drones). The simulation models cover probabilistic detection (i.e., false alarms and probability of detection) and measurement errors, considering equipment installation (i.e., monostatic vs. multistatic configurations, passive sensing, etc.). The models were integrated in a UTM simulation platform and simulation results are included in the paper for active radars, passive radars, and acoustic sensors.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks have largely improved the performance of building segmentation from remote sensing images. However, the images for building segmentation are often in the form of traditional orthophotos, where the relief displacement would cause non-negligible misalignment between the roof outline and the footprint of a building; such misalignment poses considerable challenges for extracting accurate building footprints, especially for high-rise buildings. Aiming at alleviating this problem, a new workflow is proposed for generating rectified building footprints from traditional orthophotos. We first use the facade labels, which are prepared efficiently at low cost, along with the roof labels to train a semantic segmentation network. Then, the well-trained network, which employs the state-of-the-art version of EfficientNet as backbone, extracts the roof segments and the facade segments of buildings from the input image. Finally, after clustering the classified pixels into instance-level building objects and tracing out the roof outlines, an energy function is proposed to drive the roof outline to maximally align with the building footprint; thus, the rectified footprints can be generated. The experiments on the aerial orthophotos covering a high-density residential area in Shanghai demonstrate that the proposed workflow can generate obviously more accurate building footprints than the baseline methods, especially for high-rise buildings.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - A meticulous image processing workflow is oftentimes required to derive quality image data from high-resolution, unmanned aerial systems. There are many subjective decisions to be made during image processing, but the effects of those decisions on prediction model accuracy have never been reported. This study introduced a framework for quantifying the effects of image processing methods on model accuracy. A demonstration of this framework was performed using high-resolution hyperspectral imagery (&lt;10 cm pixel size) for predicting maize nitrogen uptake in the early to mid-vegetative developmental stages (V6&ndash;V14). Two supervised regression learning estimators (Lasso and partial least squares) were trained to make predictions from hyperspectral imagery. Data for this use case were collected from three experiments over two years (2018&ndash;2019) in southern Minnesota, USA (four site-years). The image processing steps that were evaluated include (i) reflectance conversion, (ii) cropping, (iii) spectral clipping, (iv) spectral smoothing, (v) binning, and (vi) segmentation. In total, 648 image processing workflow scenarios were evaluated, and results were analyzed to understand the influence of each image processing step on the cross-validated root mean squared error (RMSE) of the estimators. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the segmentation step was the most influential image processing step on the final estimator error. Across all workflow scenarios, the RMSE of predicted nitrogen uptake ranged from 14.3 to 19.8 kg ha&minus;1 (relative RMSE ranged from 26.5% to 36.5%), a 38.5% increase in error from the lowest to the highest error workflow scenario. The framework introduced demonstrates the sensitivity and extent to which image processing affects prediction accuracy. It allows remote sensing analysts to improve model performance while providing data-driven justification to improve the reproducibility and objectivity of their work, similar to the benefits of hyperparameter tuning in machine learning applications.

AB  - Wheat and rice are two main staple food crops that may suffer from yield losses due to drought episodes that are increasingly impacted by climate change, in addition to new epidemic outbreaks. Sustainable intensification of production will rely on several strategies, such as efficient use of water and variety improvement. This review updates the latest findings regarding complementary approaches in agronomy, genetics, and phenomics to cope with climate change challenges. The agronomic approach focuses on a case study examining alternative rice water management practices, with their impact on greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity for ecosystem services. The genetic approach reviews in depth the latest technologies to achieve fungal disease resistance, as well as the use of landraces to increase the genetic diversity of new varieties. The phenomics approach explores recent advances in high-throughput remote sensing technologies useful in detecting both biotic and abiotic stress effects on breeding programs. The complementary nature of all these technologies indicates that only interdisciplinary work will ensure significant steps towards a more sustainable agriculture under future climate change scenarios.

AB  - Agriculture is the primary source of income in developing countries like India. Agriculture accounts for 17 percent of India&rsquo;s total GDP, with almost 60 percent of the people directly or indirectly employed. While researchers and planters focus on a variety of elements to boost productivity, crop loss due to disease is one of the most serious issues they confront. Crop growth monitoring and early detection of pest infestations are still a problem. With the expansion of cultivation to wider fields, manual intervention to monitor and diagnose insect and pest infestations is becoming increasingly difficult. Failure to apply on time fertilizers and pesticides results in more crop loss and so lower output. Farmers are putting in greater effort to conserve crops, but they are failing most of the time because they are unable to adequately monitor the crops when they are infected by pests and insects. Pest infestation is also difficult to predict because it is not evenly distributed. In the recent past, modern equipment, tools, and approaches have been used to replace manual involvement. Unmanned aerial vehicles serve a critical role in crop disease surveillance and early detection in this setting. This research attempts to give a review of the most successful techniques to have precision-based crop monitoring and pest management in agriculture fields utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft. The researchers&rsquo; reports on the various types of UAVs and their applications to early detection of agricultural diseases are rigorously assessed and compared. This paper also discusses the deployment of aerial, satellite, and other remote sensing technologies for disease detection, as well as their Quality of Service (QoS).

AB  - Here, we developed a method for detecting cyber security attacks aimed at spoofing the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Most methods for detecting UAV anomalies indicative of an attack use machine learning or other such methods that compare normal behavior with abnormal behavior. Such approaches require large amounts of data and significant &ldquo;training&rdquo; time to prepare and implement the system. Instead, we consider a new approach based on other mathematical methods for detecting UAV anomalies without the need to first collect a large amount of data and describe normal behavior patterns. Doing so can simplify the process of creating an anomaly detection system, which can further facilitate easier implementation of intrusion detection systems in UAVs. This article presents issues related to ensuring the information security of UAVs. Development of the GPS spoofing detection method for UAVs is then described, based on a preliminary study that made it possible to form a mathematical apparatus for solving the problem. We then explain the necessary analysis of parameters and methods of data normalization, and the analysis of the Kullback&mdash;Leibler divergence measure needed to detect anomalies in UAV systems.

AB  - Geospatial technologies are presented as an alternative for the monitoring and control of crops, as demonstrated through the analysis of spectral responses (SR) of each species. In this study, it was intended to determine the effects of the application of nanonutrients (Zn and Mn) in cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitate L.) by analyzing the relationship between the vegetation indices (VI) NDVI, GNDVI, NGRDI, RVI, GVI, CCI RARSa and the content of chlorophyll (CC), from two trials established in the field and in the greenhouse, together with the calculation of dry biomass production in the field through the use of digital models and its further validation. The results indicated that for greenhouse experiments no significant differences were found between the VIs in the implemented treatments, rather for their phenological states. Whereas in the field assays it was evidenced that there were significant differences between the VIs for the treatments, as well as for the phenological states. The SR issued in the field allowed the evaluation of the behavior of the crop due to the application of nanonutrients, which did not occur in the greenhouse, in the same way. The SR also enabled the spectral characterization of the crop in its phenological states in the two trials. All this information was stored in a digital format, which allowed the creation of a spectral library which was published on a web server. The validation of the dry biomass allowed, by statistical analysis, the efficiency of the method used for its estimation to be confirmed.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - In geospatial applications such as urban planning and land use management, automatic detection and classification of earth objects are essential and primary subjects. When the significant semantic segmentation algorithms are considered, DeepLabV3+ stands out as a state-of-the-art CNN. Although the DeepLabV3+ model is capable of extracting multi-scale contextual information, there is still a need for multi-stream architectural approaches and different training approaches of the model that can leverage multi-modal geographic datasets. In this study, a new end-to-end dual-stream architecture that considers geospatial imagery was developed based on the DeepLabV3+ architecture. As a result, the spectral datasets other than RGB provided increments in semantic segmentation accuracies when they were used as additional channels to height information. Furthermore, both the given data augmentation and Tversky loss function which is sensitive to imbalanced data accomplished better overall accuracies. Also, it has been shown that the new dual-stream architecture using Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets produced 88.87% and 87.39% overall semantic segmentation accuracies, respectively. Eventually, it was seen that enhancement of the traditional significant semantic segmentation networks has a great potential to provide higher model performances, whereas the contribution of geospatial data as the second stream to RGB to segmentation was explicitly shown.

AB  - Rockslides along a stepped failure surface have characteristics of stepped deformation characteristic and it is difficult to predict the failure time. In this study, the deformation characteristics and disaster prediction model of the Fengning granite rockslide were analyzed based on field surveys and monitoring data. To evaluate the stability, the shear strength parameters of the sliding surface were determined based on the back-propagation neural network and three-dimensional discrete element numerical method. Through the correlation analysis of deformation monitoring results with rainfall and blasting, it is shown that the landslide was triggered by excavation, rainfall, and blasting vibrations. The landslide displacement prediction model was established by using long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) based on the monitoring data, and the prediction results are compared with those using the BP model, SVM model and ARMA model. Results show that the LSTM model has strong advantages and good reliability for the stepped landslide deformation with short-term influence, and the predicted LSTM values were very consistent with the measured values, with a correlation coefficient of 0.977. Combined with the distribution characteristics of joints, the damage influence scope of the landslide was simulated by three-dimensional discrete element, which provides decision-making basis for disaster warning after slope instability. The method proposed in this paper can provide references for early warning and treatment of geological disasters.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Forests are an enduring component of the natural world and perform a vital role in protecting the environment. Forests are valuable resources to control global warming and provide oxygen for the survival of human life, including wood for households. Forest fires have recently emerged as a major threat to biological processes and the ecosystem. Unfortunately, almost every year, fire damages millions of hectares of forest land due to late and inefficient detection of fire. However, it is important to identify the forest fire at the initial level before it spreads to vast areas and destroys natural resources. In this paper, a formal model of the Internet of Things (IoT) and drone-based forest fire detection and counteraction system is presented. The proposed system comprises network maintenance. Sensor deployment is on trees, the ground, and animals in the form of subnets to transmit sensed data to the control room. All subnets are connected to the control room through gateway nodes. Alarms are being used to alert human beings and animals to save their lives, which will help to initially protect them from fire. The embedded sensors collect the information and transfer it to the gateways. Drones are being used for real-time visualization of fire-affected areas and to perform actions to control fires because they play a vital role in disasters. Graph theory is used to construct an efficient model and to show the connectivity of the network. To identify failures and develop recovery procedures, the algorithm is designed through the graph-based model. The model is developed by the Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL), and the correctness of the model is ensured using various VDM-SL toolbox facilities.

AB  - Electric companies face flow control and inventory obstacles such as reliability, outlays, and time-consuming tasks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) combined with computational vision approaches can process image classification in warehouse management applications to tackle this problem. This study uses synthetic and real images applied to CNNs to deal with classification of inventory items. The results are compared to seek the neural networks that better suit this application. The methodology consists of fine-tuning several CNNs on Red&ndash;Green&ndash;Blue (RBG) and Red&ndash;Green&ndash;Blue-Depth (RGB-D) synthetic and real datasets, using the best architecture of each domain in a blended ensemble approach. The proposed blended ensemble approach was not yet explored in such an application, using RGB and RGB-D data, from synthetic and real domains. The use of a synthetic dataset improved accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score in comparison with models trained only on the real domain. Moreover, the use of a blend of DenseNet and Resnet pipelines for colored and depth images proved to outperform accuracy, precision and f1-score performance indicators over single CNNs, achieving an accuracy measurement of 95.23%. The classification task is a real logistics engineering problem handled by computer vision and artificial intelligence, making full use of RGB and RGB-D images of synthetic and real domains, applied in an approach of blended CNN pipelines.

AB  - Video object and human action detection are applied in many fields, such as video surveillance, face recognition, etc. Video object detection includes object classification and object location within the frame. Human action recognition is the detection of human actions. Usually, video detection is more challenging than image detection, since video frames are often more blurry than images. Moreover, video detection often has other difficulties, such as video defocus, motion blur, part occlusion, etc. Nowadays, the video detection technology is able to implement real-time detection, or high-accurate detection of blurry video frames. In this paper, various video object and human action detection approaches are reviewed and discussed, many of them have performed state-of-the-art results. We mainly review and discuss the classic video detection methods with supervised learning. In addition, the frequently-used video object detection and human action recognition datasets are reviewed. Finally, a summarization of the video detection is represented, e.g., the video object and human action detection methods could be classified into frame-by-frame (frame-based) detection, extracting-key-frame detection and using-temporal-information detection; the methods of utilizing temporal information of adjacent video frames are mainly the optical flow method, Long Short-Term Memory and convolution among adjacent frames.

AB  - Modelling fire behaviour in forest fires is based on meteorological, topographical, and vegetation data, including species&rsquo; type. To accurately parameterise these models, an inventory of the area of analysis with the maximum spatial and temporal resolution is required. This study investigated the use of UAV-based digital aerial photogrammetry (UAV-DAP) point clouds to classify tree and shrub species in Mediterranean forests, and this information is key for the correct generation of wildfire models. In July 2020, two test sites located in the Natural Park of Sierra Calderona (eastern Spain) were analysed, registering 1036 vegetation individuals as reference data, corresponding to 11 shrub and one tree species. Meanwhile, photogrammetric flights were carried out over the test sites, using a UAV DJI Inspire 2 equipped with a Micasense RedEdge multispectral camera. Geometrical, spectral, and neighbour-based features were obtained from the resulting point cloud generated. Using these features, points belonging to tree and shrub species were classified using several machine learning methods, i.e., Decision Trees, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and MultiLayer Perceptron. The best results were obtained using Gradient Boosting, with a mean cross-validation accuracy of 81.7% and 91.5% for test sites 1 and 2, respectively. Once the best classifier was selected, classified points were clustered based on their geometry and tested with evaluation data, and overall accuracies of 81.9% and 96.4% were obtained for test sites 1 and 2, respectively. Results showed that the use of UAV-DAP allows the classification of Mediterranean tree and shrub species. This technique opens a wide range of possibilities, including the identification of species as a first step for further extraction of structure and fuel variables as input for wildfire behaviour models.

TI  - Transfer Learning for Improving Seismic Building Damage Assessment

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The rapid assessment of building damage in earthquake-stricken areas is of paramount importance for emergency response. The development of remote sensing technology has aided in deriving reliable and precise building damage assessments of extensive areas following disasters. It is well documented that convolutional neural network methods have superior performance in earthquake building damage assessment compared with traditional machine learning methods. However, deep learning models require a large number of samples, and sufficient numbers of samples are usually not available in the newly earthquake-stricken areas rapidly enough. At the same time, the historical samples inevitably differ from the new earthquake-affected areas due to the discrepancy of regional building characteristics. For this purpose, this study proposes a data transfer algorithm for evaluating the impact of a single historical training sample on the model performance. Then, beneficial samples are selected to transfer knowledge from the historical data for facilitating the calibration of the new model. Four models are designed with two earthquake damage building datasets and the performance of the models is compared and evaluated. The results show that the data transfer algorithm proposed in this work improves the reliability of the building damage assessment model significantly by filtering samples from the historical data that are suitable for the new task. The performance of the model built based on the data transfer method on the test set of new earthquakes task is approximately 8% higher in overall accuracy compared with the model trained directly with the new earthquake samples when the training data for the new task is only 10% of the historical data and is operating under the objective of four classes of building damage. The proposed data transfer algorithm has effectively enhanced the precision of the seismic building damage assessment in a data-limited context. Thus, it could be applicable to the building damage assessment of new disasters.

SN  - 1999-4907

AB  - Selective logging can cause significant impacts on the residual stands, affecting biodiversity and leading to environmental changes. Proper monitoring and mapping of the impacts from logging activities, such as the stumps, felled logs, roads, skid trails, and forest canopy gaps, are crucial for sustainable forest management operations. The purpose of this study is to assess the indicators of selective logging impacts by detecting the individual stumps as the main indicators, evaluating the performance of classification methods to assess the impacts and identifying forest gaps from selective logging activities. The combination of forest inventory field plots and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB and overlapped imaged were used in this study to assess these impacts. The study area is located in Ulu Jelai Forest Reserve in the central part of Peninsular Malaysia, covering an experimental study area of 48 ha. The study involved the integration of template matching (TM), object-based image analysis (OBIA), and machine learning classification&mdash;support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). Forest features and tree stumps were classified, and the canopy height model was used for detecting forest canopy gaps in the post selective logging region. Stump detection using the integration of TM and OBIA produced an accuracy of 75.8% when compared with the ground data. Forest classification using SVM and ANN methods were adopted to extract other impacts from logging activities such as skid trails, felled logs, roads and forest canopy gaps. These methods provided an overall accuracy of 85% and kappa coefficient value of 0.74 when compared with conventional classifier. The logging operation also caused an 18.6% loss of canopy cover. The result derived from this study highlights the potential use of UAVs for efficient post logging impact analysis and can be used to complement conventional forest inventory practices.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Computer vision-based automation has become popular in detecting and monitoring plants&rsquo; nutrient deficiencies in recent times. The predictive model developed by various researchers were so designed that it can be used in an embedded system, keeping in mind the availability of computational resources. Nevertheless, the enormous popularity of smart phone technology has opened the door of opportunity to common farmers to have access to high computing resources. To facilitate smart phone users, this study proposes a framework of hosting high end systems in the cloud where processing can be done, and farmers can interact with the cloud-based system. With the availability of high computational power, many studies have been focused on applying convolutional Neural Networks-based Deep Learning (CNN-based DL) architectures, including Transfer learning (TL) models on agricultural research. Ensembling of various TL architectures has the potential to improve the performance of predictive models by a great extent. In this work, six TL architectures viz. InceptionV3, ResNet152V2, Xception, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, and VGG19 are considered, and their various ensemble models are used to carry out the task of deficiency diagnosis in rice plants. Two publicly available datasets from Mendeley and Kaggle are used in this study. The ensemble-based architecture enhanced the highest classification accuracy to 100% from 99.17% in the Mendeley dataset, while for the Kaggle dataset; it was enhanced to 92% from 90%.

AB  - Although hyperspectral remote sensing techniques have increasingly been used in the nutritional quantification of plants, it is important to understand whether the method shows a satisfactory response during the various phenological stages of the crop. The aim of this study was to quantify the levels of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and zinc (Zn) in the leaves of Vigna Unguiculata (L.) Walp using spectral data obtained by a spectroradiometer. A randomised block design was used, with three treatments and twenty-five replications. The crop was evaluated at three growth stages: V4, R6 and R9. Single-band models were fitted using simple correlations. For the band ratio models, the wavelengths were selected by 2D correlation. For the models using partial least squares regression (PLSR), the stepwise method was used. The model showing the best fit was used to estimate the phosphorus content in the single-band (R&sup2; = 0.62; RMSE = 0.54 and RPD = 1.61), band ratio (R&sup2; = 0.66; RMSE = 0.65 and RPD = 1.52) and PLSR models, using data from each of the phenological stages (R&sup2; = 0.80; RMSE = 0.47 and RPD = 1.66). Accuracy in modelling leaf nutrients depends on the phenological stage, as well as the amount of data used, and is more accurate with a larger number of samples.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remotely sensed images is an urgent issue in satellite image processing. Solving this problem can help overcome various obstacles in urban planning, land cover classification, and environmental protection, paving the way for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. Encoder-decoder structures based on attention mechanisms have been frequently used for fine-resolution image segmentation. In this paper, we incorporate a coordinate attention (CA) mechanism, adopt an asymmetric convolution block (ACB), and design a refinement fusion block (RFB), forming a network named the fusion coordinate and asymmetry-based U-Net (FCAU-Net). Furthermore, we propose novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to fully capture long-term dependencies and fine-grained details in fine-resolution remotely sensed imagery. This approach has the following advantages: (1) the CA mechanism embeds position information into a channel attention mechanism to enhance the feature representations produced by the network while effectively capturing position information and channel relationships; (2) the ACB enhances the feature representation ability of the standard convolution layer and captures and refines the feature information in each layer of the encoder; and (3) the RFB effectively integrates low-level spatial information and high-level abstract features to eliminate background noise when extracting feature information, reduces the fitting residuals of the fused features, and improves the ability of the network to capture information flows. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets (ZY-3 and DeepGlobe) demonstrate the effectiveness of the FCAU-Net. The proposed FCAU-Net transcends U-Net, Attention U-Net, the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet), DeepLab v3+, the multistage attention residual U-Net (MAResU-Net), MACU-Net, and the Transformer U-Net (TransUNet). Specifically, the FCAU-Net achieves a 97.97% (95.05%) pixel accuracy (PA), a 98.53% (91.27%) mean PA (mPA), a 95.17% (85.54%) mean intersection over union (mIoU), and a 96.07% (90.74%) frequency-weighted IoU (FWIoU) on the ZY-3 (DeepGlobe) dataset.

AB  - To ensure the hybrid oilseed rape (OSR, Brassica napus) seed production, two important things are necessary, the stamen sterility on the female OSR plants and the effective pollen spread onto the pistil from the OSR male plants to the OSR female plants. The unmanned agricultural aerial system (UAAS) has developed rapidly in China. It has been used on supplementary pollination and aerial spraying during the hybrid OSR seed production. This study developed a new method to rapidly recognize the male OSR plants and extract the row center line for supporting the UAAS navigation. A male OSR plant recognition model was constructed based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). The sequence images of male OSR plants were extracted, the feature regions and points were obtained from the images through morphological and boundary process methods and horizontal segmentation, respectively. The male OSR plant image recognition accuracies of different CNN structures and segmentation sizes were discussed. The male OSR plant row center lines were fitted using the least-squares method (LSM) and Hough transform. The results showed that the segmentation algorithm could segment the male OSR plants from the complex background. The highest average recognition accuracy was 93.54%, and the minimum loss function value was 0.2059 with three convolutional layers, one fully connected layer, and a segmentation size of 40 pix &times; 40 pix. The LSM is better for center line fitting. The average recognition model accuracies of original input images were 98% and 94%, and the average root mean square errors (RMSE) of angle were 3.22&deg; and 1.36&deg; under cloudy day and sunny day lighting conditions, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of using digital imaging technology to recognize the male OSR plant row for UAAS visual navigation on the applications of hybrid OSR supplementary pollination and aerial spraying, which would be a meaningful supplement in precision agriculture.

AB  - With the rise of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of agricultural and farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT, in particular, can improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes by eliminating human intervention through automation. The fast rise of Internet of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life sectors, including business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various obstacles. IoT aids in collecting data that is useful in the farming sector, such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility, amount of water required for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively use technology to monitor their forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors, including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor networks), are utilized for agricultural inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact output and utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from afar. The goal of this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates IoT applications, benefits, current obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart agricultural system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield and save time, such as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer management.

TI  - A Multiview Semantic Vegetation Index for Robust Estimation of Urban Vegetation Cover

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Urban vegetation growth is vital for developing sustainable and liveable cities in the contemporary era since it directly helps people&rsquo;s health and well-being. Estimating vegetation cover and biomass is commonly done by calculating various vegetation indices for automated urban vegetation management and monitoring. However, most of these indices fail to capture robust estimation of vegetation cover due to their inherent focus on colour attributes with limited viewpoint and ignore seasonal changes. To solve this limitation, this article proposed a novel vegetation index called the Multiview Semantic Vegetation Index (MSVI), which is robust to color, viewpoint, and seasonal variations. Moreover, it can be applied directly to RGB images. This Multiview Semantic Vegetation Index (MSVI) is based on deep semantic segmentation and multiview field coverage and can be integrated into any vegetation management platform. This index has been tested on Google Street View (GSV) imagery of Wyndham City Council, Melbourne, Australia. The experiments and training achieved an overall pixel accuracy of 89.4% and 92.4% for FCN and U-Net, respectively. Thus, the MSVI can be a helpful instrument for analysing urban forestry and vegetation biomass since it provides an accurate and reliable objective method for assessing the plant cover at street level.

AB  - Low-cost sensors (LCS) are becoming popular for air quality monitoring (AQM). They promise high spatial and temporal resolutions at low-cost. In addition, citizen science applications such as personal exposure monitoring can be implemented effortlessly. However, the reliability of the data is questionable due to various error sources involved in the LCS measurement. Furthermore, sensor performance drift over time is another issue. Hence, the adoption of LCS by regulatory agencies is still evolving. Several studies have been conducted to improve the performance of low-cost sensors. This article summarizes the existing studies on the state-of-the-art of LCS for AQM. We conceptualize a step by step procedure to establish a sustainable AQM setup with LCS that can produce reliable data. The selection of sensors, calibration and evaluation, hardware setup, evaluation metrics and inferences, and end user-specific applications are various stages in the LCS-based AQM setup we propose. We present a critical analysis at every step of the AQM setup to obtain reliable data from the low-cost measurement. Finally, we conclude this study with future scope to improve the availability of air quality data.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - The water components affecting turbidity are complex and changeable, and the spectral response mechanism of each water quality parameter is different. Therefore, this study mainly aimed at the turbidity monitoring by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral technology, and establishes a set of turbidity retrieval models through the artificial control experiment, and verifies the model&rsquo;s accuracy through UAV flight and water sample data in the same period. The results of this experiment can also be extended to different inland waters for turbidity retrieval. Retrieval of turbidity values of small inland water bodies can provide support for the study of the degree of water pollution. We collected the images and data of aquaculture ponds and irrigation ditches in Dawa District, Panjin City, Liaoning Province. Twenty-nine standard turbidity solutions with different concentration gradients (concentration from 0 to 360 NTU&mdash;the abbreviation of Nephelometric Turbidity Unit, which stands for scattered turbidity.) were established through manual control and we simultaneously collected hyperspectral data from the spectral values of standard solutions. The sensitive band to turbidity was obtained after analyzing the spectral information. We established four kinds of retrieval, including the single band, band ratio, normalized ratio, and the partial least squares (PLS) models. We selected the two models with the highest R2 for accuracy verification. The band ratio model and PLS model had the highest accuracy, and R2 was, respectively, 0.65 and 0.72. The hyperspectral image data obtained by UAV were combined with the PLS model, which had the highest R2 to estimate the spatial distribution of water turbidity. The turbidity of the water areas in the study area was 5&ndash;300 NTU, and most of which are 5&ndash;80 NTU. It shows that the PLS models can retrieve the turbidity with high accuracy of aquaculture ponds, irrigation canals, and reservoirs in Dawa District of Panjin City, Liaoning Province. The experimental results are consistent with the conclusions of the field investigation.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Accurately identifying the phenology of summer maize is crucial for both cultivar breeding and fertilizer controlling in precision agriculture. In this study, daily RGB images covering the entire growth of summer maize were collected using phenocams at sites in Shangqiu (2018, 2019 and 2020) and Nanpi (2020) in China. Four phenological dates, including six leaves, booting, heading and maturity of summer maize, were pre-defined and extracted from the phenocam-based images. The spectral indices, textural indices and integrated spectral and textural indices were calculated using the improved adaptive feature-weighting method. The double logistic function, harmonic analysis of time series, Savitzky&ndash;Golay and spline interpolation were applied to filter these indices and pre-defined phenology was identified and compared with the ground observations. The results show that the DLF achieved the highest accuracy, with the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) being 0.86 and 9.32 days, respectively. The new index performed better than the single usage of spectral and textural indices, of which the R2 and RMSE were 0.92 and 9.38 days, respectively. The phenological extraction using the new index and double logistic function based on the PhenoCam data was effective and convenient, obtaining high accuracy. Therefore, it is recommended the adoption of the new index by integrating the spectral and textural indices for extracting maize phenology using PhenoCam data.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The degrading of input images due to the engineering environment decreases the performance of helmet detection models so as to prevent their application in practice. To overcome this problem, we propose an end-to-end helmet monitoring system, which implements a super-resolution (SR) reconstruction driven helmet detection workflow to detect helmets for monitoring tasks. The monitoring system consists of two modules, the super-resolution reconstruction module and the detection module. The former implements the SR algorithm to produce high-resolution images, the latter performs the helmet detection. Validations are performed on both a public dataset as well as the realistic dataset obtained from a practical construction site. The results show that the proposed system achieves a promising performance and surpasses the competing methods. It will be a promising tool for construction monitoring and is easy to be extended to corresponding tasks.

VL  - 14

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In low-resolution wide-area aerial imagery, object detection algorithms are categorized as feature extraction and machine learning approaches, where the former often requires a post-processing scheme to reduce false detections and the latter demands multi-stage learning followed by post-processing. In this paper, we present an approach on how to select post-processing schemes for aerial object detection. We evaluated combinations of each of ten vehicle detection algorithms with any of seven post-processing schemes, where the best three schemes for each algorithm were determined using average F-score metric. The performance improvement is quantified using basic information retrieval metrics as well as the classification of events, activities and relationships (CLEAR) metrics. We also implemented a two-stage learning algorithm using a hundred-layer densely connected convolutional neural network for small object detection and evaluated its degree of improvement when combined with the various post-processing schemes. The highest average F-scores after post-processing are 0.902, 0.704 and 0.891 for the Tucson, Phoenix and online VEDAI datasets, respectively. The combined results prove that our enhanced three-stage post-processing scheme achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 63.9% for feature extraction methods and 82.8% for the machine learning approach.

AB  - This paper puts forward a new method of landscape recognition and evaluation by using aerial video and EEG technology. In this study, seven typical landscape types (forest, wetland, grassland, desert, water, farmland, and city) were selected. Different electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were generated through different inner experiences and feelings felt by people watching video stimuli of the different landscape types. The electroencephalogram (EEG) features were extracted to obtain the mean amplitude spectrum (MAS), power spectrum density (PSD), differential entropy (DE), differential asymmetry (DASM), rational asymmetry (RASM), and differential caudality (DCAU) in the five frequency bands of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. According to electroencephalogram (EEG) features, four classifiers including the back propagation (BP) neural network, k-nearest neighbor classification (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to classify the landscape types. The results showed that the support vector machine (SVM) classifier and the random forest (RF) classifier had the highest accuracy of landscape recognition, which reached 98.24% and 96.72%, respectively. Among the six classification features selected, the classification accuracy of MAS, PSD, and DE with frequency domain features were higher than those of the spatial domain features of DASM, RASM and DCAU. In different wave bands, the average classification accuracy of all subjects was 98.24% in the gamma band, 94.62% in the beta band, and 97.29% in the total band. This study identifies and classifies landscape perception based on multi-channel EEG signals, which provides a new idea and method for the quantification of human perception.

AB  - Soil erosion is serious in China&mdash;the soil in plateau and mountain areas contain a large of rock fragments, and their content and distribution have an important influence on soil erosion. However, there are still no complete results for calculating soil erodibility factor (K) that have corrected rock fragments in China. In this paper, the data available on rock fragments in the soil profile (RFP); rock fragments on the surface of the soil (RFS); and environmental factors such as elevation, terrain relief, slope, vegetation coverage (characterised by normalised difference vegetation index, NDVI), land use, precipitation, temperature, and soil type were used to explore the effects of content of soil rock fragments on calculating of K in China. The correlation analysis, typical sampling area analysis, and redundancy analysis were applied to analyse the effects of content of soil rock fragments on calculating of K and its relationship with environment factors. The results showed that (1) The rock fragments in the soil profile (RFP) increased K. The rock fragments on the surface (RFS) of the soil reduced K. The effect of both RFP and RFS reduced K. (2) The effect of rock fragments on K was most affected by elevation, followed by terrain relief, NDVI, slope, soil type, temperature, and precipitation, but had little correlation with land use. (3) The result of redundancy analysis showed elevation to be the main predominant factor of the effect of rock fragments on K. This study fully considered the effect of rock fragments on calculating of K and carried out a quantitative analysis of the factors affecting the effect of rock fragments on K, so as to provide necessary scientific basis for estimating K and evaluating soil erosion status in China more accurately.

Necessary measures to effectively capture latent defects at the early stage of delamination before crack formation were investigated.

T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Accurate roof information of buildings can be obtained from UAV high-resolution images. The large-scale accurate recognition of roof types (such as gabled, flat, hipped, complex and mono-pitched roofs) of rural buildings is crucial for rural planning and construction. At present, most UAV high-resolution optical images only have red, green and blue (RGB) band information, which aggravates the problems of inter-class similarity and intra-class variability of image features. Furthermore, the different roof types of rural buildings are complex, spatially scattered, and easily covered by vegetation, which in turn leads to the low accuracy of roof type identification by existing methods. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a method for identifying roof types of complex rural buildings based on visible high-resolution remote sensing images from UAVs. First, the fusion of deep learning networks with different visual features is investigated to analyze the effect of the different feature combinations of the visible difference vegetation index (VDVI) and Sobel edge detection features and UAV visible images on model recognition of rural building roof types. Secondly, an improved Mask R-CNN model is proposed to learn more complex features of different types of images of building roofs by using the ResNet152 feature extraction network with migration learning. After we obtained roof type recognition results in two test areas, we evaluated the accuracy of the results using the confusion matrix and obtained the following conclusions: (1) the model with RGB images incorporating Sobel edge detection features has the highest accuracy and enables the model to recognize more and more accurately the roof types of different morphological rural buildings, and the model recognition accuracy (Kappa coefficient (KC)) compared to that of RGB images is on average improved by 0.115; (2) compared with the original Mask R-CNN, U-Net, DeeplabV3 and PSPNet deep learning models, the improved Mask R-CNN model has the highest accuracy in recognizing the roof types of rural buildings, with F1-score, KC and OA averaging 0.777, 0.821 and 0.905, respectively. The method can obtain clear and accurate profiles and types of rural building roofs, and can be extended for green roof suitability evaluation, rooftop solar potential assessment, and other building roof surveys, management and planning.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) environment, an Internet of Things (IoT) device achieves a high data rate by increasing its transmission power. However, excessively high transmission power can cause an energy outage of an IoT device and have a detrimental effect on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of neighbor IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a neighbor-aware NOMA scheme (NA-NOMA) where each IoT device determines whether to transmit data to the base station and the transmission power at each time epoch in a distributed manner with the consideration of its energy level and other devices&rsquo; transmission powers. To maximize the aggregated data rate of IoT devices while keeping an acceptable average energy outage probability, a constrained stochastic game model is formulated, and the solution of the model is obtained using a best response dynamics-based algorithm. Evaluation results show that NA-NOMA can increase the average data rate up to 22% compared with a probability-based scheme while providing a sufficiently low energy outage probability (e.g., 0.05).

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Deep learning (DL) shows remarkable performance in extracting buildings from high resolution remote sensing images. However, how to improve the performance of DL based methods, especially the perception of spatial information, is worth further study. For this purpose, we proposed a building extraction network with feature highlighting, global awareness, and cross level information fusion (B-FGC-Net). The residual learning and spatial attention unit are introduced in the encoder of the B-FGC-Net, which simplifies the training of deep convolutional neural networks and highlights the spatial information representation of features. The global feature information awareness module is added to capture multiscale contextual information and integrate the global semantic information. The cross level feature recalibration module is used to bridge the semantic gap between low and high level features to complete the effective fusion of cross level information. The performance of the proposed method was tested on two public building datasets and compared with classical methods, such as UNet, LinkNet, and SegNet. Experimental results demonstrate that B-FGC-Net exhibits improved profitability of accurate extraction and information integration for both small and large scale buildings. The IoU scores of B-FGC-Net on WHU and INRIA Building datasets are 90.04% and 79.31%, respectively. B-FGC-Net is an effective and recommended method for extracting buildings from high resolution remote sensing images.

AB  - In recent years complex food security issues caused by climatic changes, limitations in human labour, and increasing production costs require a strategic approach in addressing problems. The emergence of artificial intelligence due to the capability of recent advances in computing architectures could become a new alternative to existing solutions. Deep learning algorithms in computer vision for image classification and object detection can facilitate the agriculture industry, especially in paddy cultivation, to alleviate human efforts in laborious, burdensome, and repetitive tasks. Optimal planting density is a crucial factor for paddy cultivation as it will influence the quality and quantity of production. There have been several studies involving planting density using computer vision and remote sensing approaches. While most of the studies have shown promising results, they have disadvantages and show room for improvement. One of the disadvantages is that the studies aim to detect and count all the paddy seedlings to determine planting density. The defective paddy seedlings&rsquo; locations are not pointed out to help farmers during the sowing process. In this work we aimed to explore several deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) models to determine which one performs the best for defective paddy seedling detection using aerial imagery. Thus, we evaluated the accuracy, robustness, and inference latency of one- and two-stage pretrained object detectors combined with state-of-the-art feature extractors such as EfficientNet, ResNet50, and MobilenetV2 as a backbone. We also investigated the effect of transfer learning with fine-tuning on the performance of the aforementioned pretrained models. Experimental results showed that our proposed methods were capable of detecting the defective paddy rice seedlings with the highest precision and an F1-Score of 0.83 and 0.77, respectively, using a one-stage pretrained object detector called EfficientDet-D1 EficientNet.

VL  - 14

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Urbanization processes greatly change urban landscape patterns and the urban thermal environment. Significant multi-scale correlation exists between the land surface temperature (LST) and landscape pattern. Compared with traditional linear regression methods, the regression model based on random forest has the advantages of higher accuracy and better learning ability, and can remove the linear correlation between regression features. Taking Beijing&rsquo;s metropolitan area as an example, this paper conducted multi-scale relationship analysis between 3D landscape patterns and LST using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression (RFR). The results indicated that LST was relatively high in the central area of Beijing, and decreased from the center to the surrounding areas. The interpretation effect of 3D landscape metrics on LST was more obvious than that of the 2D landscape metrics, and 3D landscape diversity and evenness played more important roles than the other metrics in the change of LST. The multi-scale relationship between LST and the landscape pattern was discovered in the fourth ring road of Beijing, the effect of the extent of change on the landscape pattern is greater than that of the grain size change, and the interpretation effect and correlation of landscape metrics on LST increase with the increase in the rectangle size. Impervious surfaces significantly increased the LST, while the impervious surfaces located at low building areas were more likely to increase LST than those located at tall building areas. It seems that increasing the distance between buildings to improve the rate of energy exchange between urban and rural areas can effectively decrease LST. Vegetation and water can effectively reduce LST, but large, clustered and irregularly shaped patches have a better effect on land surface cooling than small and discrete patches. The Coefficients of Rectangle Variation (CORV) power function fitting results of landscape metrics showed that the optimal rectangle size for studying the relationship between the 3D landscape pattern and LST is about 700 m. Our study is useful for future urban planning and provides references to mitigate the daytime urban heat island (UHI) effect.

Each year, two treatments with different reduction ratios of diffuse radiation fraction but with similar shading rates were set in the field experiment: In T1, total solar radiation shading rate was 14.10%, and diffuse radiation fraction was 31.09%; in T2, total solar radiation shading rate was 14.42%, and diffuse radiation fraction was 39.98%, respectively. A non-shading treatment was included as a control (CK). Canopy hyperspectral reflectance, soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD), and leaf area index (LAI) were measured under shading treatments on different days after heading. The red-edge parameters (position, &lambda;0; maximum amplitude, D&lambda;; area, &alpha;0; width, &sigma;) were calculated, as well as the area, depth, and width of three absorption bands. The location of the first absorption band appeared in the range of 553&ndash;788 nm, and the second and third absorption bands appeared in the range of 874&ndash;1257 nm. The results show that the shading treatment had a significant effect on the rice canopy&rsquo;s hyperspectral reflectance. Compared with CK, the canopy reflectance of T1 (the diffuse radiation fraction was 31.09%) and T2 (the diffuse radiation fraction was 39.98%) decreased in the visible light range (350&ndash;760 nm) and increased in the near-infrared range (800&ndash;1350 nm), while the red-edge parameters (&lambda;0, D&lambda;, &alpha;0), SPAD, and LAI increased. On the other hand, under shading treatment, the increase in diffuse radiation fraction also had a significant impact on the hyperspectral spectra of the rice canopy, especially at 14 days after heading. Compared with T1, the green peak (550 nm) of T2 reduced by 16.12%, and the average reflectance at 800&ndash;900 nm increased by 10%. Based on correlation analysis, it was found that these hyperspectral reflectance characteristics were mainly due to the increase in SPAD (2.31%) and LAI (7.62%), which also led to the increase in D&lambda; (8.70%) and &alpha;0 (13.89%). Then, the second and third absorption features of T2 were significantly different from that of T1, which suggests that the change in diffuse radiation fraction could affect the process of water vapor absorption by rice.

AB  - Of the recent epidemics, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly severe, not only putting our health at risk, but also negatively affecting our daily lives. As there are no developed algorithms for the use of drones in epidemiological situations, it is ideal to analyze the experience gained on drones so far and outline the effective methods for future good practice. The author relies on a method of analyzing widely available open information, such as images and videos available on the Internet, reports from drone users, announcements by drone manufacturers and the contents of newspaper articles. Furthermore, the author has relied on the results of the relevant literature, as well as previous experience as a drone user and fire commander. The study reveals numerous possibilities associated with drone usage in epidemic related situations, but previous applications are based on previous experience gained during a non-epidemic situation, without developed algorithms. Applications can be divided into different types of groups: drones can collect data for management and provide information to the public, perform general or special logistical tasks to support health care and disinfect to reduce the risk of spreading the epidemic.

AB  - Previously, it was shown that some people are better coordinators than others; however, the relative weight of intuitive (system 1) versus deliberate (system 2) modes of thinking in tacit coordination tasks is still not resolved. To address this question, we have extracted an electrophysiological index, the theta-beta ratio (TBR), from the Electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from participants while they were engaged in a semantic coordination task. Results have shown that individual coordination ability, game difficulty and response time are each positively correlated with cognitive load. These results suggest that better coordinators rely more on complex thought process and on more deliberate thinking while coordinating. The model we have presented may be used for the assessment of the depth of reasoning individuals engage in when facing different tasks requiring different degrees of allocation of resources. The findings as well as future research directions are discussed.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The road surface area extraction task is generally carried out via semantic segmentation over remotely-sensed imagery. However, this supervised learning task is often costly as it requires remote sensing images labelled at the pixel level, and the results are not always satisfactory (presence of discontinuities, overlooked connection points, or isolated road segments). On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require labelled data and can be employed for post-processing the geometries of geospatial objects extracted via semantic segmentation. In this work, we implement a conditional Generative Adversarial Network to reconstruct road geometries via deep inpainting procedures on a new dataset containing unlabelled road samples from challenging areas present in official cartographic support from Spain. The goal is to improve the initial road representations obtained with semantic segmentation models via generative learning. The performance of the model was evaluated on unseen data by conducting a metrical comparison where a maximum Intersection over Union (IoU) score improvement of 1.3% was observed when compared to the initial semantic segmentation result. Next, we evaluated the appropriateness of applying unsupervised generative learning using a qualitative perceptual validation to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method in very complex scenarios and gain a better intuition of the model&rsquo;s behaviour when performing large-scale post-processing with generative learning and deep inpainting procedures and observed important improvements in the generated data.

AB  - Water surface plastic pollution turns out to be a global issue, having aroused rising attention worldwide. How to monitor water surface plastic waste in real time and accurately collect and analyze the relevant numerical data has become a hotspot in water environment research. (1) Background: Over the past few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been progressively adopted to conduct studies on the monitoring of water surface plastic waste. On the whole, the monitored data are stored in the UAVS to be subsequently retrieved and analyzed, thereby probably causing the loss of real-time information and hindering the whole monitoring process from being fully automated. (2) Methods: An investigation was conducted on the relationship, function and relevant mechanism between various types of plastic waste in the water surface system. On that basis, this study built a deep learning-based lightweight water surface plastic waste detection model, which was capable of automatically detecting and locating different water surface plastic waste. Moreover, a UAV platform-based edge computing architecture was built. (3) Results: The delay of return task data and UAV energy consumption were effectively reduced, and computing and network resources were optimally allocated. (4) Conclusions: The UAV platform based on airborne depth reasoning is expected to be the mainstream means of water environment monitoring in the future.

AB  - Drones are becoming increasingly popular not only for recreational purposes but also in a variety of applications in engineering, disaster management, logistics, securing airports, and others. In addition to their useful applications, an alarming concern regarding physical infrastructure security, safety, and surveillance at airports has arisen due to the potential of their use in malicious activities. In recent years, there have been many reports of the unauthorized use of various types of drones at airports and the disruption of airline operations. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based method for the efficient detection and recognition of two types of drones and birds. Evaluation of the proposed approach with the prepared image dataset demonstrates better efficiency compared to existing detection systems in the literature. Furthermore, drones are often confused with birds because of their physical and behavioral similarity. The proposed method is not only able to detect the presence or absence of drones in an area but also to recognize and distinguish between two types of drones, as well as distinguish them from birds. The dataset used in this work to train the network consists of 10,000 visible images containing two types of drones as multirotors, helicopters, and also birds. The proposed deep learning method can directly detect and recognize two types of drones and distinguish them from birds with an accuracy of 83%, mAP of 84%, and IoU of 81%. The values of average recall, average accuracy, and average F1-score were also reported as 84%, 83%, and 83%, respectively, in three classes.

AB  - Federated learning (FL) allows UAVs to collaboratively train a globally shared machine learning model while locally preserving their private data. Recently, the FL in edge-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks has drawn an upsurge of research interest due to a bursting increase in heterogeneous data acquired by UAVs and the need to build the global model with privacy; however, a critical issue is how to deal with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) nature of heterogeneous data while ensuring the convergence of learning. To effectively address this challenging issue, this paper proposes a novel and high-performing FL scheme, namely, the hierarchical FL algorithm, for the edge-aided UAV network, which exploits the edge servers located in base stations as intermediate aggregators with employing commonly shared data. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical FL algorithm outperforms several baseline FL algorithms and exhibits better convergence behavior.

AB  - Drones have the potential to revolutionize malaria vector control initiatives through rapid and accurate mapping of potential malarial mosquito larval habitats to help direct field Larval Source Management (LSM) efforts. However, there are no clear recommendations on how these habitats can be extracted from drone imagery in an operational context. This paper compares the results of two mapping approaches: supervised image classification using machine learning and Technology-Assisted Digitising (TAD) mapping that employs a new region growing tool suitable for non-experts. These approaches were applied concurrently to drone imagery acquired at seven sites in Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania. Whilst the two approaches were similar in processing time, the TAD approach significantly outperformed the supervised classification approach at all sites (t = 5.1, p &lt; 0.01). Overall accuracy scores (mean overall accuracy 62%) suggest that a supervised classification approach is unsuitable for mapping potential malarial mosquito larval habitats in Zanzibar, whereas the TAD approach offers a simple and accurate (mean overall accuracy 96%) means of mapping these complex features. We recommend that this approach be used alongside targeted ground-based surveying (i.e., in areas inappropriate for drone surveying) for generating precise and accurate spatial intelligence to support operational LSM programmes.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Moving load and structural damage assessment has always been a crucial topic in bridge health monitoring, as it helps analyze the daily operating status of bridges and provides fundamental information for bridge safety evaluation. However, most studies and research consider these issues as two separate problems. In practice, unknown moving loads and damage usually coexist and influence the bridge vibration synergically. This paper proposes an innovative synchronized assessment method that determines structural damages and moving forces simultaneously. The method firstly improves the virtual distortion method, which shifts the structural damage into external virtual forces and hence transforms the damage assessment as well as the moving force identification to a multi-force reconstruction problem. Secondly, a truncated load shape function (TLSF) technique is developed to solve the forces in the time domain. As the technique smoothens the pulse function via a limited number of TLSF, the singularity and dimension of the system matrix in the force reconstruction is largely reduced. A continuous beam and a three-dimensional truss bridge are simulated as examples. Case studies show that the method can effectively identify various speeds and numbers of moving loads, as well as different levels of structural damages. The calculation efficiency and robustness to white noise are also impressive.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A better understanding of wheat nitrogen status is important for improving N fertilizer management in precision farming. In this study, four different sensors were evaluated for their ability to estimate winter wheat nitrogen. A Gaussian process regression (GPR) method with the sequential backward feature removal (SBBR) routine was used to identify the best combinations of vegetation indices (VIs) sensitive to wheat N indicators for different sensors. Wheat leaf N concentration (LNC), plant N concentration (PNC), and the nutrition index (NNI) were estimated by the VIs through parametric regression (PR), multivariable linear regression (MLR), and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The study results reveal that the optical fluorescence sensor provides more accurate estimates of winter wheat N status at a low-canopy coverage condition. The Dualex Nitrogen Balance Index (NBI) is the best leaf-level indicator for wheat LNC, PNC and NNI at the early wheat growth stage. At the early growth stage, Multiplex indices are the best canopy-level indicators for LNC, PNC, and NNI. At the late growth stage, ASD VIs provide accurate estimates for wheat N indicators. This study also reveals that the GPR with SBBR analysis method provides more accurate estimates of winter wheat LNC, PNC, and NNI, with the best VI combinations for these sensors across the different winter wheat growth stages, compared with the MLR and PR methods.

AB  - Monitoring salinity information of salinized soil efficiently and precisely using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is critical for the rational use and sustainable development of arable land resources. The sensitive parameter and a precise retrieval method of soil salinity, however, remain unknown. This study strived to explore the sensitive parameter and construct an optimal method for retrieving soil salinity. The UAV-borne multispectral image in China&rsquo;s Yellow River Delta was acquired to extract band reflectance, compute vegetation indexes and soil salinity indexes. Soil samples collected from 120 different study sites were used for laboratory salt content measurements. Grey correlation analysis and Pearson correlation coefficient methods were employed to screen sensitive band reflectance and indexes. A new soil salinity retrieval index (SSRI) was then proposed based on the screened sensitive reflectance. The Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Multivariable Linear Regression (MLR), Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) methods were employed to construct retrieval models based on the sensitive indexes. The results found that green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands were sensitive to soil salinity, which can be used to build SSRI. The SSRI-based RF method was the optimal method for accurately retrieving the soil salinity. Its modeling determination coefficient (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were 0.724 and 1.764, respectively; and the validation R2, RMSE, and Residual Predictive Deviation (RPD) were 0.745, 1.879, and 2.211.

AB  - The airfoil is the prime component of flying vehicles. For low-speed flights, low Reynolds number airfoils are used. The characteristic of low Reynolds number airfoils is a laminar separation bubble and an associated drag rise. This paper presents a framework for the design of a low Reynolds number airfoil. The contributions of the proposed research are twofold. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed for the aerodynamic coefficient prediction of low Reynolds number airfoils. Data generation is discussed in detail and XFOIL is selected to obtain aerodynamic coefficients. The performance of the CNN is evaluated using different learning rate schedulers and adaptive learning rate optimizers. The trained model can predict the aerodynamic coefficients with high accuracy. Second, the trained model is used with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for multi-objective optimization of the low Reynolds number airfoil at a specific angle of attack. A similar optimization is performed using NSGA-II directly calling XFOIL, to obtain the aerodynamic coefficients. The Pareto fronts of both optimizations are compared, and it is concluded that the proposed CNN can replicate the actual Pareto in considerably less time.

VL  - 22
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The perceived texture directionality is an important, not fully explored image characteristic. In many applications texture directionality detection is of fundamental importance. Several approaches have been proposed, such as the fast Fourier-based method. We recently proposed a method based on the interpolated grey-level co-occurrence matrix (iGLCM), robust to image blur and noise but slower than the Fourier-based method. Here we test the applicability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to texture directionality detection. To obtain the large amount of training data required, we built a training dataset consisting of synthetic textures with known directionality and varying perturbation levels. Subsequently, we defined and tested shallow and deep CNN architectures. We present the test results focusing on the CNN architectures and their robustness with respect to image perturbations. We identify the best performing CNN architecture, and compare it with the iGLCM, the Fourier and the local gradient orientation methods. We find that the accuracy of CNN is lower, yet comparable to the iGLCM, and it outperforms the other two methods. As expected, the CNN method shows the highest computing speed. Finally, we demonstrate the best performing CNN on real-life images. Visual analysis suggests that the learned patterns generalize to real-life image data. Hence, CNNs represent a promising approach for texture directionality detection, warranting further investigation.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Human activities in the sea, such as intensive fishing and exploitation of offshore wind farms, may impact negatively on the marine mega fauna. As an attempt to control such impacts, surveying, and tracking of marine animals are often performed on the sites where those activities take place. Nowadays, thank to high resolution cameras and to the development of machine learning techniques, tracking of wild animals can be performed remotely and the analysis of the acquired images can be automatized using state-of-the-art object detection models. However, most state-of-the-art detection methods require lots of annotated data to provide satisfactory results. Since analyzing thousands of images acquired during a flight survey can be a cumbersome and time consuming task, we focus in this article on the weakly supervised detection of marine animals. We propose a modification of the patch distribution modeling method (PaDiM), which is currently one of the state-of-the-art approaches for anomaly detection and localization for visual industrial inspection. In order to show its effectiveness and suitability for marine animal detection, we conduct a comparative evaluation of the proposed method against the original version, as well as other state-of-the-art approaches on two high-resolution marine animal image datasets. On both tested datasets, the proposed method yielded better F1 and recall scores (75% recall/41% precision, and 57% recall/60% precision, respectively) when trained on images known to contain no object of interest. This shows a great potential of the proposed approach to speed up the marine animal discovery in new flight surveys. Additionally, such a method could be adopted for bounding box proposals to perform faster and cheaper annotation within a fully-supervised detection framework.

AB  - Proximal soil sensors are receiving strong attention from several disciplinary fields, and this has led to a rise in their availability in the market in the last two decades. The aim of this work was to validate agronomically a zone management delineation procedure from electromagnetic induction (EMI) maps applied to two different rainfed durum wheat fields. The k-means algorithm was applied based on the gap statistic index for the identification of the optimal number of management zones and their positions. Traditional statistical analysis was performed to detect significant differences in soil characteristics and crop response of each management zones. The procedure showed the presence of two management zones at both two sites under analysis, and it was agronomically validated by the significant difference in soil texture (+24.17%), bulk density (+6.46%), organic matter (+39.29%), organic carbon (+39.4%), total carbonates (+25.34%), total nitrogen (+30.14%), protein (+1.50%) and yield data (+1.07 t ha&minus;1). Moreover, six unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight missions were performed to investigate the relationship between five vegetation indexes and the EMI maps. The results suggest performing the multispectral images acquisition during the flowering phenological stages to attribute the crop spatial variability to different soil proprieties.

AB  - The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, together with mobile network technology, has created a never-before-seen world of interconnection, evoking research on how to make it vaster, faster, and safer. To support the ongoing fight against the malicious misuse of networks, in this paper we propose a novel algorithm called AMDES (unmanned aerial system multifractal analysis intrusion detection system) for spoofing attack detection. This novel algorithm is based on both wavelet leader multifractal analysis (WLM) and machine learning (ML) principles. In earlier research on unmanned aerial systems (UAS), intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on multifractal (MF) spectral analysis have been used to provide accurate MF spectrum estimations of network traffic. Such an estimation is then used to detect and characterize flooding anomalies that can be observed in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network. However, the previous contributions have lacked the consideration of other types of network intrusions commonly observed in UAS networks, such as the man in the middle attack (MITM). In this work, this promising methodology has been accommodated to detect a spoofing attack within a UAS. This methodology highlights a robust approach in terms of false positive performance in detecting intrusions in a UAS location reporting system.

This study was established to develop an approach, using cutting-edge deep-learning convolutional neural networks and high-density laser scanning data, to detect logging trails in different stages of commercial thinning, in Southern Finland. We constructed a U-Net architecture, consisting of encoder and decoder paths with several convolutional layers, pooling and non-linear operations. The canopy height model (CHM), digital surface model (DSM), and digital elevation models (DEMs) were derived from the laser scanning data and were used as image datasets for training the model. The labeled dataset for the logging trails was generated from different references as well. Three forest areas were selected to test the efficiency of the algorithm that was developed for detecting logging trails. We designed 21 routes, including 390 samples of the logging trails and non-logging trails, covering all logging trails inside the stands. The results indicated that the trained U-Net using DSM (k = 0.846 and IoU = 0.867) shows superior performance over the trained model using CHM (k = 0.734 and IoU = 0.782), DEMavg (k = 0.542 and IoU = 0.667), and DEMmin (k = 0.136 and IoU = 0.155) in distinguishing logging trails from non-logging trails. Although the efficiency of the developed approach in young and mature stands that had undergone the commercial thinning is approximately perfect, it needs to be improved in old stands that have not received the second or third commercial thinning.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Coal gangue is an inevitable product in coal mining and processing and is the most important source of pollution in mines. Vegetation restoration of coal gangue piles must consider its special site conditions. Therefore, we conducted unmanned air vehicle (UAV) temperature monitoring, field investigation and experimental analysis on spontaneous combustion coal gangue piles in Lu&rsquo;an mining area. In the vegetation construction of coal gangue piles, high-temperature stress affects plant survival. The spontaneous combustion coal gangue piles have abnormal temperature, high surface temperature and few vegetation types. The plant community species diversity index (Shannon&ndash;Wiener index, Pielou&rsquo;s index and Species abundance index) is small, the plant community is single and the plant diversity is low. Spontaneous combustion of coal gangue leads to soil acidification, reducing soil water content, soil organic carbon (SOM), available nitrogen (AN), available potassium (AK) and available phosphorus (AP). These factors are single or interactive in plants and have an impact on plant survival and growth. The research results are of great significance to the vegetation restoration of spontaneous combustion coal gangue piles, ecological reconstruction and the improvement of the ecological environment of coal mine areas.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Current strategies for phenotyping above-ground biomass in field breeding nurseries demand significant investment in both time and labor. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can be used to derive vegetation indices (VIs) with high throughput and could provide an efficient way to predict forage yield with high accuracy. The main objective of the study is to investigate the potential of UAV-based multispectral data and machine learning approaches in the estimation of oat biomass. UAV equipped with a multispectral sensor was flown over three experimental oat fields in Volga, South Shore, and Beresford, South Dakota, USA, throughout the pre- and post-heading growth phases of oats in 2019. A variety of vegetation indices (VIs) derived from UAV-based multispectral imagery were employed to build oat biomass estimation models using four machine-learning algorithms: partial least squares (PLS), support vector machine (SVM), Artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF). The results showed that several VIs derived from the UAV collected images were significantly positively correlated with dry biomass for Volga and Beresford (r = 0.2&ndash;0.65), however, in South Shore, VIs were either not significantly or weakly correlated with biomass. For Beresford, approximately 70% of the variance was explained by PLS, RF, and SVM validation models using data collected during the post-heading phase. Likewise for Volga, validation models had lower coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.20&ndash;0.25) and higher error (RMSE = 700&ndash;800 kg/ha) than training models (R2 = 0.50&ndash;0.60; RMSE = 500&ndash;690 kg/ha). In South Shore, validation models were only able to explain approx. 15&ndash;20% of the variation in biomass, which is possibly due to the insignificant correlation values between VIs and biomass. Overall, this study indicates that airborne remote sensing with machine learning has potential for above-ground biomass estimation in oat breeding nurseries. The main limitation was inconsistent accuracy in model prediction across locations. Multiple-year spectral data, along with the inclusion of textural features like crop surface model (CSM) derived height and volumetric indicators, should be considered in future studies while estimating biophysical parameters like biomass.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - It is found that the remote sensing parameters such as spectral range, spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio directly affect the estimation accuracy of soil moisture content. However, the lack of research on the relationship between the parameters and estimation accuracy restricts the prolongation of application. Therefore, this study took the demand for this application as the foothold for developing spectrometry. Firstly, a method based on sensitivity analysis of soil radiative transfer model-successive projection algorithm (SA-SPA) was proposed to select sensitive wavelengths. Then, the spectral resampling method was used to select the best spectral resolution in the corresponding sensitive wavelengths. Finally, the noise-free spectral data simulated by the soil radiative transfer model was added with Gaussian random noise to change the signal-to-noise ratio, so as to explore the influence of signal-to-noise ratio on the estimation accuracy. The research results show that the estimation accuracy obtained through the SA-SPA (RMSEP &lt; 12.1 g kg&minus;1) is generally superior to that from full-spectrum data (RMSEP &lt; 14 g kg&minus;1). At selected sensitive wavelengths, the best spectral resolution is 34 nm, and the applicable signal-to-noise ratio ranges from 150 to 350. This study provides technical support for the efficient estimation of soil moisture content and the development of spectrometry, which comprehensively considers the common influence of spectral range, spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio on the estimation accuracy of soil moisture content.

TI  - Fractional Vegetation Cover Derived from UAV and Sentinel-2 Imagery as a Proxy for In Situ FAPAR in a Dense Mixed-Coniferous Forest?
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (FAPAR) is an essential climate variable for assessing the productivity of ecosystems. Satellite remote sensing provides spatially distributed FAPAR products, but their accurate and efficient validation is challenging in forest environments. As the FAPAR is linked to the canopy structure, it may be approximated by the fractional vegetation cover (FCOVER) under the assumption that incoming radiation is either absorbed or passed through gaps in the canopy. With FCOVER being easier to retrieve, FAPAR validation activities could benefit from a priori information on FCOVER. Spatially distributed FCOVER is available from satellite remote sensing or can be retrieved from imagery of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) at a centimetric resolution. We investigated remote sensing-derived FCOVER as a proxy for in situ FAPAR in a dense mixed-coniferous forest, considering both absolute values and spatiotemporal variability. Therefore, direct FAPAR measurements, acquired with a Wireless Sensor Network, were related to FCOVER derived from UAV and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery at different seasons. The results indicated that spatially aggregated UAV-derived FCOVER was close (RMSE = 0.02) to in situ FAPAR during the peak vegetation period when the canopy was almost closed. The S2 FCOVER product underestimated both the in situ FAPAR and UAV-derived FCOVER (RMSE &gt; 0.3), which we attributed to the generic nature of the retrieval algorithm and the coarser resolution of the product. We concluded that UAV-derived FCOVER may be used as a proxy for direct FAPAR measurements in dense canopies. As another key finding, the spatial variability of the FCOVER consistently surpassed that of the in situ FAPAR, which was also well-reflected in the S2 FAPAR and FCOVER products. We recommend integrating this experimental finding as consistency criteria in the context of ECV quality assessments. To facilitate the FAPAR sampling activities, we further suggest assessing the spatial variability of UAV-derived FCOVER to benchmark sampling sizes for in situ FAPAR measurements. Finally, our study contributes to refining the FAPAR sampling protocols needed for the validation and improvement of FAPAR estimates in forest environments.

AB  - This paper tests the suitability of automated point cloud classification tools provided by the popular image-based modeling (IBM) software package Agisoft Metashape for the generation of digital terrain models (DTMs) at moderately-vegetated archaeological sites. DTMs are often required for various forms of archaeological mapping and analysis. The suite of tools provided by Agisoft are relatively user-friendly as compared to many point cloud classification algorithms and do not require the use of additional software. Based on a case study from the Mycenaean site of Kastrouli, Greece, the mostly-automated, geometric classification tool &ldquo;Classify Ground Points&rdquo; provides the best results and produces a quality DTM that is sufficient for mapping and analysis. Each of the methods tested in this paper can likely be improved through manual editing of point cloud classification.

T2  - Agronomy

PY  - 2022
VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-4395

AB  - Winter wheat is a widely-grown cereal crop worldwide. Using growth-stage information to estimate winter wheat yields in a timely manner is essential for accurate crop management and rapid decision-making in sustainable agriculture, and to increase productivity while reducing environmental impact. UAV remote sensing is widely used in precision agriculture due to its flexibility and increased spatial and spectral resolution. Hyperspectral data are used to model crop traits because of their ability to provide continuous rich spectral information and higher spectral fidelity. In this study, hyperspectral image data of the winter wheat crop canopy at the flowering and grain-filling stages was acquired by a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and machine learning was used to predict winter wheat yields. Specifically, a large number of spectral indices were extracted from the spectral data, and three feature selection methods, recursive feature elimination (RFE), Boruta feature selection, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), were used to filter high spectral indices in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Four major basic learner models, (1) support vector machine (SVM), (2) Gaussian process (GP), (3) linear ridge regression (LRR), and (4) random forest (RF), were also constructed, and an ensemble machine learning model was developed by combining the four base learner models. The results showed that the SVM yield prediction model, constructed on the basis of the preferred features, performed the best among the base learner models, with an R2 between 0.62 and 0.73. The accuracy of the proposed ensemble learner model was higher than that of each base learner model; moreover, the R2 (0.78) for the yield prediction model based on Boruta&rsquo;s preferred characteristics was the highest at the grain-filling stage.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles are prone to several cyber-attacks, including Global Positioning System spoofing. Several techniques have been proposed for detecting such attacks. However, the recurrence and frequent Global Positioning System spoofing incidents show a need for effective security solutions to protect unmanned aerial vehicles. In this paper, we propose two dynamic selection techniques, Metric Optimized Dynamic selector and Weighted Metric Optimized Dynamic selector, which identify the most effective classifier for the detection of such attacks. We develop a one-stage ensemble feature selection method to identify and discard the correlated and low importance features from the dataset. We implement the proposed techniques using ten machine-learning models and compare their performance in terms of four evaluation metrics: accuracy, probability of detection, probability of false alarm, probability of misdetection, and processing time. The proposed techniques dynamically choose the classifier with the best results for detecting attacks. The results indicate that the proposed dynamic techniques outperform the existing ensemble models with an accuracy of 99.6%, a probability of detection of 98.9%, a probability of false alarm of 1.56%, a probability of misdetection of 1.09%, and a processing time of 1.24 s.

AB  - The accurate and automated diagnosis of potato late blight disease, one of the most destructive potato diseases, is critical for precision agricultural control and management. Recent advances in remote sensing and deep learning offer the opportunity to address this challenge. This study proposes a novel end-to-end deep learning model (CropdocNet) for accurate and automated late blight disease diagnosis from UAV-based hyperspectral imagery. The proposed method considers the potential disease-specific reflectance radiation variance caused by the canopy&rsquo;s structural diversity and introduces multiple capsule layers to model the part-to-whole relationship between spectral&ndash;spatial features and the target classes to represent the rotation invariance of the target classes in the feature space. We evaluate the proposed method with real UAV-based HSI data under controlled and natural field conditions. The effectiveness of the hierarchical features is quantitatively assessed and compared with the existing representative machine learning/deep learning methods on both testing and independent datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed model significantly improves accuracy when considering the hierarchical structure of spectral&ndash;spatial features, with average accuracies of 98.09% for the testing dataset and 95.75% for the independent dataset, respectively.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Remote sensing of land surface mostly obtains a mixture of spectral information of soil and vegetation. It is thus of great value if soil and vegetation information can be acquired simultaneously from one model. In this study, we designed a laboratory experiment to simulate land surface compositions, including various soil types with varying soil moisture and vegetation coverage. A model of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) was established to simultaneously estimate soil properties (organic matter, soil moisture, clay, and sand) and vegetation coverage based on the hyperspectral data measured in the experiment. The results showed that the model achieved excellent predictions for soil properties (R2 = 0.88&ndash;0.91, RPIQ = 4.01&ndash;5.78) and vegetation coverage (R2 = 0.95, RPIQ = 7.75). Compared with the partial least-squares regression (PLSR), the prediction accuracy of 1DCNN improved 42.20%, 45.82%, 43.32%, and 36.46% in terms of the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) for predicting soil organic matter, sand, clay, and soil moisture, respectively. The improvement might be caused by the fact that the spectral preprocessing and spectral features useful for predicting soil properties were successfully identified in the 1DCNN model. For the prediction of vegetation coverage, although the prediction accuracy by 1DCNN was excellent, its performance (R2 = 0.95, RPIQ = 7.75, RMSE = 3.92%) was lower than the PLSR model (R2 = 0.98, RPIQ = 12.57, RMSE = 2.41%). These results indicate that 1DCNN can simultaneously predict soil properties and vegetation coverage. However, the factors such as surface roughness and vegetation type that could affect the prediction accuracy should be investigated in the future.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Voltage regulation in distribution networks encounters a challenge of handling uncertainties caused by the high penetration of photovoltaics (PV). This research proposes an active exploration (AE) method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to respond to the uncertainties by regulating the voltage of a distribution network with battery energy storage systems (BESS). The proposed method integrates engineering knowledge to accelerate the training process of RL. The engineering knowledge is the chance-constrained optimization. We formulate the problem in a chance-constrained optimization with a linear load flow approximation. The optimization results are used to guide the action selection of the exploration for improving training efficiency and reducing the conserveness characteristic. The comparison of methods focuses on how BESSs are used, training efficiency, and robustness under varying uncertainties and BESS sizes. We implement the proposed algorithm, a chance-constrained optimization, and a traditional Q-learning in the IEEE 13 Node Test Feeder. Our evaluation shows that the proposed AE method has a better response to the training efficiency compared to traditional Q-learning. Meanwhile, the proposed method has advantages in BESS usage in conserveness compared to the chance-constrained optimization.

AB  - There is currently a strong societal demand for sustainability, quality, and safety in bread wheat production. To address these challenges, new and innovative knowledge, resources, tools, and methods to facilitate breeding are needed. This starts with the development of high throughput genomic tools including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, high density molecular marker maps, and full genome sequences. Such powerful tools are essential to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to implement genomic and phenomic selection, and to characterize the worldwide diversity. This is also useful to breeders to broaden the genetic basis of elite varieties through the introduction of novel sources of genetic diversity. Improvement in varieties particularly relies on the detection of genomic regions involved in agronomical traits including tolerance to biotic (diseases and pests) and abiotic (drought, nutrient deficiency, high temperature) stresses. When enough resolution is achieved, this can result in the identification of candidate genes that could further be characterized to identify relevant alleles. Breeding must also now be approached through in silico modeling to simulate plant development, investigate genotype &times; environment interactions, and introduce marker&ndash;trait linkage information in the models to better implement genomic selection. Breeders must be aware of new developments and the information must be made available to the world wheat community to develop new high-yielding varieties that can meet the challenge of higher wheat production in a sustainable and fluctuating agricultural context. In this review, we compiled all knowledge and tools produced during the BREEDWHEAT project to show how they may contribute to face this challenge in the coming years.

AB  - The leaf area index (LAI), a valuable variable for assessing vine vigor, reflects nutrient concentrations in vineyards and assists in precise management, including fertilization, improving yield, quality, and vineyard uniformity. Although some vegetation indices (VIs) have been successfully used to assess LAI variations, they are unsuitable for vineyards of different types and structures. By calibrating the light extinction coefficient of a digital photography algorithm for proximal LAI measurements, this study aimed to develop VI-LAI models for pergola-trained vineyards based on high-resolution RGB and multispectral images captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The models were developed by comparing five machine learning (ML) methods, and a robust ensemble model was proposed using the five models as base learners. The results showed that the ensemble model outperformed the base models. The highest R2 and lowest RMSE values that were obtained using the best combination of VIs with multispectral data were 0.899 and 0.434, respectively; those obtained using the RGB data were 0.825 and 0.547, respectively. By improving the results by feature selection, ML methods performed better with multispectral data than with RGB images, and better with higher spatial resolution data than with lower resolution data. LAI variations can be monitored efficiently and accurately for large areas of pergola-trained vineyards using this framework.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - As one type of object detection, small object detection has been widely used in daily-life-related applications with many real-time requirements, such as autopilot and navigation. Although deep-learning-based object detection methods have achieved great success in recent years, they are not effective in small object detection and most of them cannot achieve real-time processing. Therefore, this paper proposes a single-stage small object detection network (SODNet) that integrates the specialized feature extraction and information fusion techniques. An adaptively spatial parallel convolution module (ASPConv) is proposed to alleviate the lack of spatial information for target objects and adaptively obtain the corresponding spatial information through multi-scale receptive fields, thereby improving the feature extraction ability. Additionally, a split-fusion sub-module (SF) is proposed to effectively reduce the time complexity of ASPConv. A fast multi-scale fusion module (FMF) is proposed to alleviate the insufficient fusion of both semantic and spatial information. FMF uses two fast upsampling operators to first unify the resolution of the multi-scale feature maps extracted by the network and then fuse them, thereby effectively improving the small object detection ability. Comparative experimental results prove that the proposed method considerably improves the accuracy of small object detection on multiple benchmark datasets and achieves a high real-time performance.

AB  - Underground coal mining inevitably causes ground fissures, especially permanent cracks that cannot be closed at the boundary of the working face. Studying the underground three-dimensional morphology of the permanent cracks allows one to accurately constrain the formation and development of the ground fissures. This information will contribute to reducing mine disasters and is also a prerequisites to avoid environmental pollution. We selected the Zhangjiamao coal mine (China), which is situated in a collapsible loess area, as a case study for deciphering the formation of permanent cracks. After injecting gypsum slurry into the mine, a three-dimensional model of the ground fissures is obtained by three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner technology that records the 3D underground morphology. Integrating the geological context of a collapsible loess area, the characteristics and main processes of the ground fissure development are constrained: (1) The width of the ground fissure decreases to 0 with increasing depth and is strongly affected by the soil composition. (2) Along the vertical extension direction, the ground fissures are generally inclined to the inner-side of the working face, but the direction remains uncertain at different depths. (3) The transverse propagation direction of the ground fissure becomes more complex with increasing depth. (4) Under the influence of soil texture and water, loose soil fills the bottom of the ground fissure, thus affecting the underground 3D morphology.

AB  - Extraction of farming progress information in rice&ndash;wheat rotation regions is an important topic in smart field research. In this study, a new method for the classification of farming progress types using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB images and the proposed regional mean (RM) model is presented. First, RGB information was extracted from the images to create and select the optimal color indices. After index classification, we compared the brightness reflection of the corresponding grayscale map, the classification interval, and the standard deviation of each farming progress type. These comparisons showed that the optimal classification color indices were the normalized red&ndash;blue difference index (NRBDI), the normalized green&ndash;blue difference index (NGBDI), and the modified red&ndash;blue difference index (MRBDI). Second, the RM model was built according to the whole-field farming progress classification requirements to achieve the final classification. We verified the model accuracy, and the Kappa coefficients obtained by combining the NRBDI, NGBDI, and MRBDI with the RM model were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.88, respectively. The proposed method was then applied to predict UAV RGB images of unharvested wheat, harvested wheat, and tilled and irrigated fields. The results were compared with those obtained with traditional machine learning methods, that is, the support vector machine, maximum likelihood classification, and random forest methods. The NRBDI, NGBDI, and MRBDI were combined with the RM model to monitor farming progress of ground truth ROIs, and the Kappa coefficients obtained were 0.9134, 0.8738, and 0.9179, respectively, while traditional machine learning methods all produced a Kappa coefficient less than 0.7. The results indicate a significantly higher accuracy of the proposed method than those of the traditional machine learning classification methods for the identification of farming progress type. The proposed work provides an important reference for the application of UAV to the field classification of progress types.

AB  - In this article, the local spatial correlation of multiple remote sensing datasets, such as those from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and digital surface models (DSMs), are linked to machine learning (ML) regression algorithms for flash floodwater depth retrieval. Edge detection filters are applied to remote sensing images to extract features that are used as independent features by ML algorithms to estimate flood depths. Data of dependent variables were obtained from the Hydrologic Engineering Center&rsquo;s River Analysis System (HEC-RAS 2D) simulation model, as applied to the New Cairo, Egypt, post-flash flood event from 24&ndash;26 April 2018. Gradient boosting regression (GBR), random forest regression (RFR), linear regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR), multilayer perceptron neural network regression (MLPR), k-nearest neighbors regression (KNR), and support vector regression (SVR) were used to estimate floodwater depths; their outputs were compared and evaluated for accuracy using the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The RMSE accuracy for all ML algorithms was 0.18&ndash;0.22 m for depths less than 1 m (96% of all test data), indicating that ML models are relatively portable and capable of computing floodwater depths using remote sensing data as an input.

AB  - In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) is a core technology, and AI-based applications are expanding in various fields. This research explored the influencing factors on end-user&rsquo;s intentions and acceptance of AI-based technology in construction companies using the technology acceptance model (TAM) and technology&ndash;organisation&ndash;environment (TOE) framework. The analysis of end-users&rsquo; intentions for accepting AI-based technology was verified by applying the structure equation model. According to the research results, the technological factors along with external variables and an individual&rsquo;s personality had a positive influence (+) on the perceived usefulness and the perceived ease of use of end-users of AI-based technology. Conversely, environmental factors such as suggestions from others appeared to be disruptive to users&rsquo; technology acceptance. In order to effectively utilise AI-based technology, organisational factors such as the support, culture, and participation of the company as a whole were indicated as important factors for AI-based technology implementation.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - This paper points out the shortcomings of existing normalization methods, and proposes a brightness temperature inversion normalization method for multi-source remote sensing monitoring of forest fires. This method can satisfy both radiation normalization and observation angle normalization, and reduce the discrepancies in forest fire monitoring between multi-source sensors. The study was based on Himawari-8 data; the longitude, latitude, solar zenith angle, solar azimuth angle, emissivity, slope, aspect, elevation, and brightness temperature values were collected as modeling parameters. The mixed-effects brightness temperature inversion normalization (MEMN) model based on FY-4A and Himawari-8 satellite sensors is fitted by multiple stepwise regression and mixed-effects modeling methods. The results show that, when the model is tested by Himawari-8 data, the coefficient of determination (R2) reaches 0.8418, and when it is tested by FY-4A data, R2 reaches 0.8045. At the same time, through comparison and analysis, the accuracy of the MEMN method is higher than that of the random forest normalization method (RF) (R2=0.7318), the pseudo-invariant feature method (PIF) (R2=0.7264), and the automatic control scatter regression method (ASCR) (R2=0.6841). The MEMN model can not only reduce the discrepancies in forest fire monitoring owing to different satellite sensors between FY-4A and Himawari-8, but also improve the accuracy and timeliness of forest fire monitoring.

AB  - The increasing world population makes it necessary to fight challenges such as climate change and to realize production efficiently and quickly. However, the minimum cost, maximum income, environmental pollution protection and the ability to save water and energy are all factors that should be taken into account in this process. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agriculture to meet all of these criteria serves the purpose of precision agriculture. As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can easily obtain real-time data, they have a great potential to address and optimize solutions to the problems faced by agriculture. Despite some limitations, such as the battery, load, weather conditions, etc., UAVs will be used frequently in agriculture in the future because of the valuable data that they obtain and their efficient applications. According to the known literature, UAVs have been carrying out tasks such as spraying, monitoring, yield estimation, weed detection, etc. In recent years, articles related to agricultural UAVs have been presented in journals with high impact factors. Most precision agriculture applications with UAVs occur in outdoor environments where GPS access is available, which provides more reliable control of the UAV in both manual and autonomous flights. On the other hand, there are almost no UAV-based applications in greenhouses where all-season crop production is available. This paper emphasizes this deficiency and provides a comprehensive review of the use of UAVs for agricultural tasks and highlights the importance of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for a UAV solution in the greenhouse.

TI  - Using Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Map Seagrass Cover from Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Seagrass habitats are ecologically valuable and play an important role in sequestering and storing carbon. There is, thus, a need to estimate seagrass percentage cover in diverse environments in support of climate change mitigation, marine spatial planning and coastal zone management. In situ approaches are accurate but time-consuming, expensive and may not represent the larger spatial units collected by satellite imaging. Hence, there is a need for a consistent methodology that uses accurate point-based field surveys to deliver high-quality mapping of percentage seagrass cover at large spatial scales. Here, we develop a three-step approach that combines in situ (quadrats), aerial (unoccupied aerial vehicle&mdash;UAV) and satellite data to map percentage seagrass cover at Turneffe Atoll, Belize, the largest atoll in the northern hemisphere. First, the optical bands of four UAV images were used to calculate seagrass cover, in combination with in situ data. The seagrass cover calculated from the UAV was then used to develop training and validation datasets to estimate seagrass cover in Sentinel-2 pixels. Next, non-seagrass areas were identified in the Sentinel-2 data and removed by object-based classification, followed by a pixel-based regression to calculate seagrass percentage cover. Using this approach, percentage seagrass cover was mapped using UAVs (R2 = 0.91 between observed and mapped distributions) and using Sentinel-2 data (R2 = 0.73). This work provides the first openly available and explorable map of seagrass percentage cover across Turneffe Atoll, where we estimate approximately 242 km2 of seagrass above 10% cover is located. We estimate that this approach offers 30 times more data for training satellite data than traditional methods, therefore presenting a substantial reduction in cost-per-point for data. Furthermore, the increase in data helps deliver a high-quality seagrass cover map, suitable for resolving trends of deteriorating, stable or recovering seagrass environments at 10 m2 resolution to underpin evidence-based management and conservation of seagrass.

SN  - 1999-4907

AB  - Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (UAS) are beginning to replace conventional forest plot mensuration through their use as low-cost and powerful remote sensing tools for monitoring growth, estimating biomass, evaluating carbon stocks and detecting weeds; however, physical samples remain mostly collected through time-consuming, expensive and potentially dangerous conventional techniques. Such conventional techniques include the use of arborists to climb the trees to retrieve samples, shooting branches with firearms from the ground, canopy cranes or the use of pole-mounted saws to access lower branches. UAS hold much potential to improve the safety, efficiency, and reduce the cost of acquiring canopy samples. In this work, we describe and demonstrate four iterations of 3D printed canopy sampling UAS. This work includes detailed explanations of designs and how each iteration informed the design decisions in the subsequent iteration. The fourth iteration of the aircraft was tested for the collection of 30 canopy samples from three tree species: eucalyptus pulchella, eucalyptus globulus and acacia dealbata trees. The collection times ranged from 1 min and 23 s, up to 3 min and 41 s for more distant and challenging to capture samples. A vision for the next iteration of this design is also provided. Future work may explore the integration of advanced remote sensing techniques with UAS-based canopy sampling to progress towards a fully-automated and holistic forest information capture system.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Accurate knowledge of the spatial extent of seagrass habitats is essential for monitoring and management purposes given their ecological and economic significance. Extent data are typically presented in binary (presence/absence) or arbitrary, semi-quantitative density bands derived from low-resolution satellite imagery, which cannot resolve fine-scale features and intra-habitat variability. Recent advances in consumer-grade unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) have advanced our ability to survey large areas at higher resolution and at lower cost. This has improved the accessibility of mapping technologies to developing coastal nations, where a large proportion of the world&rsquo;s seagrass habitats are found. Here, we present the application of UAV-gathered imagery to determine seagrass habitat extent and percent of canopy cover. Four contrasting sites were surveyed in the Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve, Belize, and seagrass canopy cover was ground truthed from in situ quadrats. Orthomosaic images were created for each site from the UAV-gathered imagery. Three modelling techniques were tested to extrapolate the findings from quadrats to spatial information, producing binary (random forest) and canopy cover (random forest regression and beta regression) habitat maps. The most robust model (random forest regression) had an average absolute error of 6.8&ndash;11.9% (SE of 8.2&ndash;14), building upon previous attempts at mapping seagrass density from satellite imagery, which achieved errors between 15&ndash;20% approximately. The resulting maps exhibited great intra-habitat heterogeneity and different levels of patchiness, which were attributed to site energetics and, possibly, species composition. The extra information in the canopy cover maps provides greater detail and information for key management decisions and provides the basis for future spatial studies and monitoring programmes.

AB  - Combining data into a centralized, searchable, and linked platform will provide a data exploration platform to agricultural stakeholders and researchers for better agricultural decision making, thus fully utilizing existing data and preventing redundant research. Such a data repository requires readiness to share data, knowledge, and skillsets and working with Big Data infrastructures. With the adoption of new technologies and increased data collection, agricultural workforces need to update their knowledge, skills, and abilities. The partnerships for data innovation (PDI) effort integrates agricultural data by efficiently capturing them from field, lab, and greenhouse studies using a variety of sensors, tools, and apps and provides a quick visualization and summary of statistics for real-time decision making. This paper aims to evaluate and provide examples of case studies currently using PDI and use its long-term continental US database (18 locations and 24 years) to test the cover crop and grazing effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. The results show that legume and rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crops increased SOC storage by 36% and 50%, respectively, compared with oat (Avena sativa L.) and rye mixtures and low and high grazing intensities improving the upper SOC by 69&ndash;72% compared with a medium grazing intensity. This was likely due to legumes providing a more favorable substrate for SOC formation and high grazing intensity systems having continuous manure deposition. Overall, PDI can be used to democratize data regionally and nationally and therefore can address large-scale research questions aimed at addressing agricultural grand challenges.

AB  - Plant diversity is an important parameter in maintaining forest ecosystem services, functions and stability. Timely and accurate monitoring and evaluation of large-area wall-to-wall maps on plant diversity and its spatial heterogeneity are crucial for the conservation and management of forest resources. However, traditional botanical field surveys designed to estimate plant diversity are usually limited in their spatiotemporal resolutions. Using Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data at high spatiotemporal scales, combined with and referenced to botanical field surveys, may be the best choice to provide accurate plant diversity distribution information over a large area. In this paper, we predicted and mapped plant diversity in a subtropical forest using 24 months of freely and openly available S-1 and S-2 images (10 m &times; 10 m) data over a large study area (15,290 km2). A total of 448 quadrats (10 m &times; 10 m) of forestry field surveys were captured in a subtropical evergreen-deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest to validate a machine learning algorithm. The objective was to link the fine Sentinel spectral and radar data to several ground-truthing plant diversity indices in the forests. The results showed that: (1) The Simpson and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were the best predicted indices using random forest regression, with &#531;2 of around 0.65; (2) The use of S-1 radar data can enhance the accuracy of the predicted heterogeneity indices in the forests by approximately 0.2; (3) As for the mapping of Simpson and Shannon-Wiener, the overall accuracy was 67.4% and 64.2% respectively, while the texture diversity&rsquo;s overall accuracy was merely 56.8%; (4) From the evaluation and prediction map information, the Simpson, Shannon-Wiener and texture diversity values (and its confidence interval values) indicate spatial heterogeneity in pixel level. The large-area forest plant diversity indices maps add spatially explicit information to the ground-truthing data. Based on the results, we conclude that using the time-series of S-1 and S-2 radar and spectral characteristics, when coupled with limited ground-truthing data, can provide reasonable assessments of plant spatial heterogeneity and diversity across wide areas. It could also help promote forest ecosystem and resource conservation activities in the forestry sector.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Smallholder farmers depend on healthy and productive crop yields to sustain their socio-economic status and ensure livelihood security. Advances in South African precision agriculture in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide spatially explicit near-real-time information that can be used to assess crop dynamics and inform smallholder farmers. The use of UAVs with remote-sensing techniques allows for the acquisition of high spatial resolution data at various spatio-temporal planes, which is particularly useful at the scale of fields and farms. Specifically, crop chlorophyll content is assessed as it is one of the best known and reliable indicators of crop health, due to its biophysical pigment and biochemical processes that indicate plant productivity. In this regard, the study evaluated the utility of multispectral UAV imagery using the random forest machine learning algorithm to estimate the chlorophyll content of maize through the various growth stages. The results showed that the near-infrared and red-edge wavelength bands and vegetation indices derived from these wavelengths were essential for estimating chlorophyll content during the phenotyping of maize. Furthermore, the random forest model optimally estimated the chlorophyll content of maize over the various phenological stages. Particularly, maize chlorophyll was best predicted during the early reproductive, late vegetative, and early vegetative growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 40.4 &micro;mol/m&minus;2, 39 &micro;mol/m&minus;2, and 61.6 &micro;mol/m&minus;2, respectively. The least accurate chlorophyll content results were predicted during the mid-reproductive and late reproductive growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 66.6 &micro;mol/m&minus;2 and 69.6 &micro;mol/m&minus;2, respectively, as a consequence of a hailstorm. A resultant chlorophyll variation map of the maize growth stages captured the spatial heterogeneity of chlorophyll within the maize field. Therefore, the study&rsquo;s findings demonstrate that the use of remotely sensed UAV imagery with a robust machine algorithm is a critical tool to support the decision-making and management in smallholder farms.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Fast and accurate acquisition of the outline of rural buildings on remote sensing images is an efficient method to monitor illegal rural buildings. The traditional object detection method produces useless background information when detecting rural buildings; the semantic segmentation method cannot accurately segment the contours between buildings; the instance segmentation method cannot obtain regular building contours. The rotated object detection methods can effectively solve the problem that the traditional artificial intelligence method cannot accurately extract the outline of buildings. However, the rotated object detection methods are easy to lose location information of small objects in advanced feature maps and are sensitive to noise. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a two-stage rotated object detection network for rural buildings (TRDet) by using a deep feature fusion network (DFF-Net) and a pixel attention module (PAM). Specifically, TRDet first fuses low-level location and high-level semantic information through the DFF-Net and then reduces the interference of noise information to the network through the PAM. The experimental results show that the mean average precession (mAP), precision, recall rate, and F1 score of the proposed TRDet are 83.57%, 91.11%, 86.5%, and 88.74%, respectively, which outperform the R2CNN model by 15%, 15.54%, 4.01%, and 9.87%. The results demonstrate that the TRDet can achieve better detection in small rural buildings and dense rural buildings.

AB  - To control unmanned aerial systems, we rarely have a perfect system model. Safe and aggressive planning is also challenging for nonlinear and under-actuated systems. Expert pilots, however, demonstrate maneuvers that are deemed at the edge of plane envelope. Inspired by biological systems, in this paper, we introduce a framework that leverages methods in the field of control theory and reinforcement learning to generate feasible, possibly aggressive, trajectories. For the control policies, Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) imitate pilot-induced primitives, and DMPs are combined in parallel to generate trajectories to reach original or different goal points. The stability properties of DMPs and their overall systems are analyzed using contraction theory. For reinforcement learning, Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) was used for the maneuvers. The results in this paper show that PI2 updated policies are a feasible and parallel combination of different updated primitives transfer the learning in the contraction regions. Our proposed methodology can be used to imitate, reshape, and improve feasible, possibly aggressive, maneuvers. In addition, we can exploit trajectories generated by optimization methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), and a library of maneuvers can be instantly generated. For application, 3-DOF (degrees of freedom) Helicopter and 2D-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) models are utilized to demonstrate the main results.
