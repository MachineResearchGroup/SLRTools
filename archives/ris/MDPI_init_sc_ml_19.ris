AB  - With the rapid development of wireless networking technologies, the Internet of Things and heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) tend to be integrated to form a promising wireless network paradigm for 5G. Hyper-dense sensor and mobile devices will be deployed under the coverage of heterogeneous cells, so that each of them could freely select any available cell covering it and compete for resource with others selecting the same cell, forming a cell selection (CS) game between these devices. Since different types of cells usually share the same portion of the spectrum, devices selecting overlapped cells can experience severe inter-cell interference (ICI). In this article, we study the CS game among a large amount of densely-deployed sensor and mobile devices for their uplink transmissions in a two-tier HCN. ICI is embedded with the traditional congestion game (TCG), forming a congestion game with ICI (CGI) and a congestion game with capacity (CGC). For the three games above, we theoretically find the circular boundaries between the devices selecting the macrocell and those selecting the picocells, indicated by the pure strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE). Meanwhile, through a number of simulations with different picocell radii and different path loss exponents, the collapse of the PSNE impacted by severe ICI (i.e., a large number of picocell devices change their CS preferences to the macrocell) is profoundly revealed, and the collapse points are identified.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging key technology for future industries and everyday lives of people, where a myriad of battery operated sensors, actuators, and smart objects are connected to the Internet to provide services such as mobile healthcare, intelligent transport system, environmental monitoring, etc. Since energy efficiency is of utmost importance to these battery constrained IoT devices, IoT-related standards and research works have focused on the device energy conserving issues. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on energy conserving issues and solutions in using diverse wireless radio access technologies for IoT connectivity, e.g., the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) machine type communications, IEEE 802.11ah, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Z-Wave. We look into the literature in broad areas of standardization, academic research, and industry development, and structurally summarize the energy conserving solutions based on several technical criteria. We also propose future research directions regarding energy conserving issues in wireless networking-based IoT.

AB  - Nowadays, the number of vehicles has increased exponentially, but the bedrock capacities of roads and transportation systems have not developed in an equivalent way to efficiently cope with the number of vehicles traveling on them. Due to this, road jamming and traffic correlated pollution have increased with the associated adverse societal and financial effect on different markets worldwide. A static control system may block emergency vehicles due to traffic jams. Wireless Sensor networks (WSNs) have gained increasing attention in traffic detection and avoiding road congestion. WSNs are very trendy due to their faster transfer of information, easy installation, less maintenance, compactness and for being less expensive compared to other network options. There has been significant research on Traffic Management Systems using WSNs to avoid congestion, ensure priority for emergency vehicles and cut the Average Waiting Time (AWT) of vehicles at intersections. In recent decades, researchers have started to monitor real-time traffic using WSNs, RFIDs, ZigBee, VANETs, Bluetooth devices, cameras and infrared signals. This paper presents a survey of current urban traffic management schemes for priority-based signalling, and reducing congestion and the AWT of vehicles. The main objective of this survey is to provide a taxonomy of different traffic management schemes used for avoiding congestion. Existing urban traffic management schemes for the avoidance of congestion and providing priority to emergency vehicles are considered and set the foundation for further research.

AB  - Rising demand, climate change, growing fuel costs, outdated power system infrastructures, and new power generation technologies have made renewable distribution generators very attractive in recent years. Because of the increasing penetration level of renewable energy sources in addition to the growth of new electrical demand sectors, such as electrical vehicles, the power system may face serious problems and challenges in the near future. A revolutionary new power grid system, called smart grid, has been developed as a solution to these problems. The smart grid, equipped with modern communication and computation infrastructures, can coordinate different parts of the power system to enhance energy efficiency, reliability, and quality, while decreasing the energy cost. Since conventional distribution networks lack smart infrastructures, much research has been recently done in the distribution part of the smart grid, called smart distribution grid (SDG). This paper surveys contemporary literature in SDG from the perspective of the electricity market in addition to power system considerations. For this purpose, this paper reviews current demand side management methods, supply side management methods, and electrical vehicle charging and discharging techniques in SDG and also discusses their drawbacks. We also present future research directions to tackle new and existing challenges in the SDG.

AB  - The evolution of Smart City projects is pushing researchers and companies to develop more efficient embedded hardware and also more efficient communication technologies. These communication technologies are the focus of this work, presenting a new routing algorithm based on dynamically-allocated sub-networks and node roles. Among these features, our algorithm presents a fast set-up time, a reduced overhead and a hierarchical organization, which allows for the application of complex management techniques. This work presents a routing algorithm based on a dynamically-allocated hierarchical clustering, which uses the link quality indicator as a reference parameter, maximizing the network coverage and minimizing the control message overhead and the convergence time. The present work based its test scenario and analysis in the density measure, considered as a node degree. The routing algorithm is compared with some of the most well known routing algorithms for different scenario densities.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In this article, an Arrival and Departure Time Predictor (ADTP) for scheduling communication in opportunistic Internet of Things (IoT) is presented. The proposed algorithm learns about temporal patterns of encounters between IoT devices and predicts future arrival and departure times, therefore future contact durations. By relying on such predictions, a neighbour discovery scheduler is proposed, capable of jointly optimizing discovery latency and power consumption in order to maximize communication time when contacts are expected with high probability and, at the same time, saving power when contacts are expected with low probability. A comprehensive performance evaluation with different sets of synthetic and real world traces shows that ADTP performs favourably with respect to previous state of the art. This prediction framework opens opportunities for transmission planners and schedulers optimizing not only neighbour discovery, but the entire communication process.

AB  - In recent years, the evolution of urban environments, jointly with the progress of the Information and Communication sector, have enabled the rapid adoption of new solutions that contribute to the growth in popularity of Smart Cities. Currently, the majority of the world population lives in cities encouraging different stakeholders within these innovative ecosystems to seek new solutions guaranteeing the sustainability and efficiency of such complex environments. In this work, it is discussed how the experimentation with IoT technologies and other data sources form the cities can be utilized to co-create in the OrganiCity project, where key actors like citizens, researchers and other stakeholders shape smart city services and applications in a collaborative fashion. Furthermore, a novel architecture is proposed that enables this organic growth of the future cities, facilitating the experimentation that tailors the adoption of new technologies and services for a better quality of life, as well as agile and dynamic mechanisms for managing cities. In this work, the different components and enablers of the OrganiCity platform are presented and discussed in detail and include, among others, a portal to manage the experiment life cycle, an Urban Data Observatory to explore data assets, and an annotations component to indicate quality of data, with a particular focus on the city-scale opportunistic data collection service operating as an alternative to traditional communications.

VL  - 10

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Traditional power grid and its demand-side management (DSM) techniques are centralized and mainly focus on industrial consumers. The ignorance of residential and commercial sectors in DSM activities degrades the overall performance of a conventional grid. Therefore, the concept of DSM and demand response (DR) via residential sector makes the smart grid (SG) superior over the traditional grid. In this context, this paper proposes an optimized home energy management system (OHEMS) that not only facilitates the integration of renewable energy source (RES) and energy storage system (ESS) but also incorporates the residential sector into DSM activities. The proposed OHEMS minimizes the electricity bill by scheduling the household appliances and ESS in response to the dynamic pricing of electricity market. First, the constrained optimization problem is mathematically formulated by using multiple knapsack problems, and then solved by using the heuristic algorithms; genetic algorithm (GA), binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), wind driven optimization (WDO), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) and hybrid GA-PSO (HGPO) algorithms. The performance of the proposed scheme and heuristic algorithms is evaluated via MATLAB simulations. Results illustrate that the integration of RES and ESS reduces the electricity bill and peak-to-average ratio (PAR) by 19.94% and 21.55% respectively. Moreover, the HGPO algorithm based home energy management system outperforms the other heuristic algorithms, and further reduces the bill by 25.12% and PAR by 24.88%.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming increasingly popular with the advent of the Internet of things (IoT). Various real-world applications of WSNs such as in smart grids, smart farming and smart health would require a potential deployment of thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands of sensor nodes/actuators. To ensure proper working order and network efficiency of such a network of sensor nodes, an effective WSN management system has to be integrated. However, the inherent challenges of WSNs such as sensor/actuator heterogeneity, application dependency and resource constraints have led to challenges in implementing effective traditional WSN management. This difficulty in management increases as the WSN becomes larger. Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides a promising solution in flexible management WSNs by allowing the separation of the control logic from the sensor nodes/actuators. The advantage with this SDN-based management in WSNs is that it enables centralized control of the entire WSN making it simpler to deploy network-wide management protocols and applications on demand. This paper highlights some of the recent work on traditional WSN management in brief and reviews SDN-based management techniques for WSNs in greater detail while drawing attention to the advantages that SDN brings to traditional WSN management. This paper also investigates open research challenges in coming up with mechanisms for flexible and easier SDN-based WSN configuration and management.

AB  - The digitization of our lives cause a shift in the data production as well as in the required data management. Numerous nodes are capable of producing huge volumes of data in our everyday activities. Sensors, personal smart devices as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm lead to a vast infrastructure that covers all the aspects of activities in modern societies. In the most of the cases, the critical issue for public authorities (usually, local, like municipalities) is the efficient management of data towards the support of novel services. The reason is that analytics provided on top of the collected data could help in the delivery of new applications that will facilitate citizens’ lives. However, the provision of analytics demands intelligent techniques for the underlying data management. The most known technique is the separation of huge volumes of data into a number of parts and their parallel management to limit the required time for the delivery of analytics. Afterwards, analytics requests in the form of queries could be realized and derive the necessary knowledge for supporting intelligent applications. In this paper, we define the concept of a Query Controller (    Q C    ) that receives queries for analytics and assigns each of them to a processor placed in front of each data partition. We discuss an intelligent process for query assignments that adopts Machine Learning (ML). We adopt two learning schemes, i.e., Reinforcement Learning (RL) and clustering. We report on the comparison of the two schemes and elaborate on their combination. Our aim is to provide an efficient framework to support the decision making of the QC that should swiftly select the appropriate processor for each query. We provide mathematical formulations for the discussed problem and present simulation results. Through a comprehensive experimental evaluation, we reveal the advantages of the proposed models and describe the outcomes results while comparing them with a deterministic framework.

AB  - In recent works on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), “intelligent” and “sustainable” have been the buzzwords in the context of transportation. Maintaining sustainability in IoV is always a challenge. Sustainability in IoV can be achieved not only by the use of pollution-free vehicular systems, but also by maintenance of road traffic safety or prevention of accidents or collisions. With the aim of establishing an effective sustainable transportation planning system, this study performs a short analysis of existing sustainable transportation methods in the IoV. This study also analyzes various characteristics of sustainability and the advantages and disadvantages of existing transportation systems. Toward the end, this study provides a clear suggestion for effective sustainable transportation planning aimed at the maintenance of an eco-friendly environment and road traffic safety, which, in turn, would lead to a sustainable transportation system.

AB  - The rising human population in urban environments drives the mission towards smart cities, which envisions a wide deployment of sensors in order to improve the quality of living. In this regard, opportunistic networks (OppNets) present an economical means of collecting delay tolerant data from sensors to their respective gateways for providing various Smart City services. Due to the distributed nature of the network, encounter-based routing protocols achieve acceptable throughput by requiring nodes to exchange and update contact information on an encounter basis. Unfortunately, sufficient insight into the associated overhead is lacking in the literature. Hence, we contribute by modelling contact information overhead and investigating its impact on OppNet routing, particularly in terms of data exchange success and energy consumption on portable handheld devices. Our findings reveal that the expected contact information overhead in Smart City scenarios significantly reduces data exchange success and increases energy consumption on portable handheld devices, thereby threatening the feasibility of the technology. We address this issue by proposing an algorithm that can be incorporated into encounter-based routing protocols to reduce contact information overhead without compromising throughput. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces the average contact information overhead, increases throughput and reduces average energy consumption.

AB  - Opportunistic networks (OppNets) provide a scalable solution for collecting delay‑tolerant data from sensors for their respective gateways. Portable handheld user devices contribute significantly to the scalability of OppNets since their number increases according to user population and they closely follow human movement patterns. Hence, OppNets for sensed data collection are characterised by high node population and degrees of spatial locality inherent to user movement. We study the impact of these characteristics on the performance of existing OppNet message replication techniques. Our findings reveal that the existing replication techniques are not specifically designed to cope with these characteristics. This raises concerns regarding excessive message transmission overhead and throughput degradations due to resource constraints and technological limitations associated with portable handheld user devices. Based on concepts derived from the study, we suggest design guidelines to augment existing message replication techniques. We also follow our design guidelines to propose a message replication technique, namely Locality Aware Replication (LARep). Simulation results show that LARep achieves better network performance under high node population and degrees of spatial locality as compared with existing techniques.

AB  - Around the globe, innovation with integrating information and communication technologies (ICT) with physical infrastructure is a top priority for governments in pursuing smart, green living to improve energy efficiency, protect the environment, improve the quality of life, and bolster economy competitiveness. Cities today faces multifarious challenges, among which energy efficiency of homes and residential dwellings is a key requirement. Achieving it successfully with the help of intelligent sensors and contextual systems would help build smart cities of the future. In a Smart home environment Home Energy Management plays a critical role in finding a suitable and reliable solution to curtail the peak demand and achieve energy conservation. In this paper, a new method named as Home Energy Management as a Service (HEMaaS) is proposed which is based on neural network based Q-learning algorithm. Although several attempts have been made in the past to address similar problems, the models developed do not cater to maximize the user convenience and robustness of the system. In this paper, authors have proposed an advanced Neural Fitted Q-learning method which is self-learning and adaptive. The proposed method provides an agile, flexible and energy efficient decision making system for home energy management. A typical Canadian residential dwelling model has been used in this paper to test the proposed method. Based on analysis, it was found that the proposed method offers a fast and viable solution to reduce the demand and conserve energy during peak period. It also helps reducing the carbon footprint of residential dwellings. Once adopted, city blocks with significant residential dwellings can significantly reduce the total energy consumption by reducing or shifting their energy demand during peak period. This would definitely help local power distribution companies to optimize their resources and keep the tariff low due to curtailment of peak demand.

AB  - Human activity recognition is a challenging problem for context-aware systems and applications. It is gaining interest due to the ubiquity of different sensor sources, wearable smart objects, ambient sensors, etc. This task is usually approached as a supervised machine learning problem, where a label is to be predicted given some input data, such as the signals retrieved from different sensors. For tackling the human activity recognition problem in sensor network environments, in this paper we propose the use of deep learning (convolutional neural networks) to perform activity recognition using the publicly available OPPORTUNITY dataset. Instead of manually choosing a suitable topology, we will let an evolutionary algorithm design the optimal topology in order to maximize the classification F1 score. After that, we will also explore the performance of committees of the models resulting from the evolutionary process. Results analysis indicates that the proposed model was able to perform activity recognition within a heterogeneous sensor network environment, achieving very high accuracies when tested with new sensor data. Based on all conducted experiments, the proposed neuroevolutionary system has proved to be able to systematically find a classification model which is capable of outperforming previous results reported in the state-of-the-art, showing that this approach is useful and improves upon previously manually-designed architectures.

AB  - Smart city (SC) technologies can provide appropriate services according to citizens&rsquo; demands. One of the key enablers in a SC is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which enables a massive number of devices to connect with each other. However, these devices usually come from different manufacturers with different product standards, which confront interactive control problems. Moreover, these devices will produce large amounts of data, and efficiently analyzing these data for intelligent services. In this paper, we propose a novel artificial intelligence-based semantic IoT (AI-SIoT) hybrid service architecture to integrate heterogeneous IoT devices to support intelligent services. In particular, the proposed architecture is empowered by semantic and AI technologies, which enable flexible connections among heterogeneous devices. The AI technology can support very implement efficient data analysis and make accurate decisions on service provisions in various kinds. Furthermore, we also present several practical use cases of the proposed AI-SIoT architecture and the opportunities and challenges to implement the proposed AI-SIoT for future SCs are also discussed.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The emergence of smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices has highly favored the realization of smart homes in a down-stream sector of a smart grid. The underlying objective of Demand Response (DR) schemes is to actively engage customers to modify their energy consumption on domestic appliances in response to pricing signals. Domestic appliance scheduling is widely accepted as an effective mechanism to manage domestic energy consumption intelligently. Besides, to residential customers for DR implementation, maintaining a balance between energy consumption cost and users&rsquo; comfort satisfaction is a challenge. Hence, in this paper, a constrained Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based residential consumer-centric load-scheduling method is proposed. The method can be further featured with edge computing. In contrast with cloud computing, edge computing&mdash;a method of optimizing cloud computing technologies by driving computing capabilities at the IoT edge of the Internet as one of the emerging trends in engineering technology&mdash;addresses bandwidth-intensive contents and latency-sensitive applications required among sensors and central data centers through data analytics at or near the source of data. A non-intrusive load-monitoring technique proposed previously is utilized to automatic determination of physical characteristics of power-intensive home appliances from users&rsquo; life patterns. The swarm intelligence, constrained PSO, is used to minimize the energy consumption cost while considering users&rsquo; comfort satisfaction for DR implementation. The residential consumer-centric load-scheduling method proposed in this paper is evaluated under real-time pricing with inclining block rates and is demonstrated in a case study. The experimentation reported in this paper shows the proposed residential consumer-centric load-scheduling method can re-shape loads by home appliances in response to DR signals. Moreover, a phenomenal reduction in peak power consumption is achieved by 13.97%.

AB  - This paper develops a novel energy universal service bus system (EUSBS) based on emerging energy Internet (E-net) technologies. This EUSBS is a unified identification and plug-and-play interface platform to which high penetration distributed energy and equipment (DEE), including photovoltaic (PV), fans, electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs), energy storage equipment (ESE), and commercial and residential users (CRUs), can access in a coordinated control and optimized utilization mode. First, the functions design, overall framework and topology architecture design of the EUSBS are expounded, among which the EUSBS is mainly composed of a hardware system and a software platform. Moreover, several future application scenarios are presented. Then, the hardware part of EUSBS is designed and developed, including the framework design of this hardware subsystem, and development of the hardware equipment for PV access, fans access, EVCS access, ESE access, and CRU access. The hardware subsystem consists of smart socket, and household/floor/building concentrators. Based on this, the prototypes development of EUSBS hardware equipment is completely demonstrated. Third, the software part of the EUSBS is developed as a cloud service platform for electricity use data analysis of DEE. This software subsystem contains the power quality &amp; energy efficiency analysis module, optimization control module, information and service module, and data monitoring and electricity behavior analysis module. Based on this design, the software interfaces are developed. Finally, an application study on energy management and optimization of a smart commercial building is conducted to evaluate the functions and practicality of this EUSBS. The EUSBS developed in this paper is able to overcome difficulties in big data collection and utilization on sides of distribution network and electricity utilization, and eventually implement a deep information-energy fusion and a friendly supply-demand interaction between the grid and users. This contribution presents a detailed and systematic development scheme of the EUSBS, and moreover, the laboratory prototypes of the hardware and software subsystems have been developed based on E-net technologies. This paper can provide some thoughts and suggestions for the research of active distribution network and comprehensive energy management and optimization in power systems, as well as references and guidance for researchers to carry out research regarding energy management, optimization and coordinated control of the smart buildings.

AB  - Researchers have reached a consensus on the thermal discomfort known as the major cause of sick building syndrome, which hurts people&rsquo;s health and working efficiency greatly. As a result, the thermal environment satisfaction is important and thus many studies have been dedicated to thermal comfort over the past few decades. Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) is one of the globally used standards to express users&rsquo; comfort satisfaction with the given thermal moderate environments. It has been widely used in most of the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems to maintain this standard of thermal comfort for occupants of buildings. However, the PMV model is developed on indoor experimental data without taking into account conditions of outdoor space, which greatly affects the performance of the existing HVAC systems and varies with the seasons. In this paper, an enhanced Model-based Predictive Control practical system for maintaining the indoor thermal comfort is demonstrated, including a multiple linear regression predictive model and an innovative fuzzy controller considering both the PMV index and the outdoor environment conditions. To verify the usability of the designed system, an Internet of Things (IoT) smart space prototype was chosen and experimentally tested in a building in Jeju, Korea. Moreover, thermal comfort regulation performances using the proposed approach have been compared with the existing one. The results of our work indicate that the proposed solution is capable of optimizing the thermal comfort condition according to seasonality and outperforms the conventional approaches in different performance indexes.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 7
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The high rate of vehicle-crash victims has a fatal economic and social impact in today&rsquo;s societies. In particular, road crashes where heavy vehicles are involved cause more severe damage because they are prone to rollover. For this reason, many researches are focused on developing RSC Roll Stability Control (RSC) systems. Concerning the design of RSC systems with an adequate performance, it is mandatory to know the dynamics of the vehicle. The main problem arises from the lack of ability to directly capture several required dynamic vehicle variables, such as roll angle, from low-cost sensors. Previous studies demonstrate that low-cost sensors can provide data in real-time with the required precision and reliability. Even more, other research works indicate that neural networks are efficient mechanisms to estimate roll angle. Nevertheless, it is necessary to assess that the fusion of data coming from low-cost devices and estimations provided by neural networks can fulfill hard real-time processing constraints, achieving high level of accuracy during circulation of a vehicle in real situations. In order to address this issue, this study has two main goals: (1) Design and develop an IoT based architecture, integrating ANN in low cost kits with different hardware architectures in order to estimate under real-time constraints the vehicle roll angle. This architecture is able to work under high dynamic conditions, by following specific best practices and considerations during its design; (2) assess that the IoT architecture deployed in low-cost experimental kits achieve the hard real-time performance constraints estimating the roll angle with the required calculation accuracy. To fulfil these objectives, an experimental environment was set up, composed of a van with two set of low-cost kits, one including a Raspberry Pi 3 Model Band the other having an Intel Edison System on Chip linked to a SparkFun 9 Degrees of Freedom module. This experimental environment be tested in different maneuvers for comparison purposes. Neural networks embedded in low-cost sensor kits provide roll angle estimations highly approximated to real values. Even more, Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B have enough computing capabilities to successfully run roll angle estimation based on neural networks to determine rollover risk situations, fulfilling real-time operation restrictions stated for this problem.

AB  - The adaptive coordination of trust services can provide highly dependable and personalized solutions for industrial requirements in the service-oriented industrial internet of things (IIoT) architecture to achieve efficient utilization of service resources. Although great progress has been made, trust service coordination still faces challenging problems such as trustless industry service, poor coordination, and quality of service (QoS) personalized demand. In this paper, we propose a QoS-driven and adaptive trust service coordination method to implement Pareto-efficient allocation of limited industrial service resources in the background of the IIoT. First, we established a Pareto-effective and adaptive industrial IoT trust service coordination model and introduced a blockchain-based adaptive trust evaluation mechanism to achieve trust evaluation of industrial services. Then, taking advantage of a large and complex search space for solution efficiency, we introduced and compared multi-objective gray-wolf algorithms with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and dragonfly algorithms. The experimental results showed that by judging and blacklisting malicious raters quickly and accurately, our model can efficiently realize self-adaptive, personalized, and intelligent trust service coordination under the given constraints, improving not only the response time, but also the success rate in coordination.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The emerging fog computing technology is characterized by an ultralow latency response, which benefits a massive number of time-sensitive services and applications in the Internet of things (IoT) era. To this end, the fog computing infrastructure must minimize latencies for both service delivery and execution phases. While the transmission latency significantly depends on external factors (e.g., channel bandwidth, communication resources, and interferences), the computation latency can be considered as an internal issue that the fog computing infrastructure could actively self-handle. From this view point, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that utilizes the evolution strategies for real-time task assignment among fog servers to minimize the total computation latency during a long-term period. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the latency by approximately 16.1% compared to the existing methods. Additionally, the proposed learning algorithm has low computational complexity and an effectively parallel operation; therefore, it is especially appropriate to be implemented in modern heterogeneous computing platforms.

VL  - 11
IS  - 9
SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - The capability of efficiently processing the data streams emitted by nowadays ubiquitous sensing devices enables the development of new intelligent services. Data Stream Processing (DSP) applications allow for processing huge volumes of data in near real-time. To keep up with the high volume and velocity of data, these applications can elastically scale their execution on multiple computing resources to process the incoming data flow in parallel. Being that data sources and consumers are usually located at the network edges, nowadays the presence of geo-distributed computing resources represents an attractive environment for DSP. However, controlling the applications and the processing infrastructure in such wide-area environments represents a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a hierarchical solution for the autonomous control of elastic DSP applications and infrastructures. It consists of a two-layered hierarchical solution, where centralized components coordinate subordinated distributed managers, which, in turn, locally control the elastic adaptation of the application components and deployment regions. Exploiting this framework, we design several self-adaptation policies, including reinforcement learning based solutions. We show the benefits of the presented self-adaptation policies with respect to static provisioning solutions, and discuss the strengths of reinforcement learning based approaches, which learn from experience how to optimize the application performance and resource allocation.

AB  - Electric power systems are experiencing relevant changes involving the growing penetration of distributed generation and energy storage systems, the introduction of electric vehicles, the management of responsive loads, the proposals for new energy markets and so on. Such an evolution is pushing a paradigm shift that is one of the most important challenges in power network design: the management must move from traditional planning and manual intervention to full &ldquo;smartization&rdquo; of medium and low voltage networks. Peculiarities and criticalities of future power distribution networks originate from the complexity of the system which includes both the physical aspects of electric networks and the cyber aspects, like data elaboration, feature extraction, communication, supervision and control; only fully integrated advanced monitoring systems can foster this transition towards network automation. The design and development of such future networks require distinct kinds of expertise in the industrial and information engineering fields. In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive review of current challenges and multidisciplinary interactions in the development of smart distribution networks. The aim of this paper is to discuss, in an integrated and organized manner, the state of the art while focusing on the need for interaction between different disciplines and highlighting how innovative and future-proof outcomes of both research and practice can only emerge from a coordinated design of all the layers in the smart distribution network architecture.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent times, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are broadly applied in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in order to enhance the productivity and efficiency of existing and prospective manufacturing industries. In particular, an area of interest that concerns the use of WSNs in IIoT is the concept of sensor network virtualization and overlay networks. Both network virtualization and overlay networks are considered contemporary because they provide the capacity to create services and applications at the edge of existing virtual networks without changing the underlying infrastructure. This capability makes both network virtualization and overlay network services highly beneficial, particularly for the dynamic needs of IIoT based applications such as in smart industry applications, smart city, and smart home applications. Consequently, the study of both WSN virtualization and overlay networks has become highly patronized in the literature, leading to the growth and maturity of the research area. In line with this growth, this paper provides a review of the development made thus far concerning virtualized sensor networks, with emphasis on the application of overlay networks in IIoT. Principally, the process of virtualization in WSN is discussed along with its importance in IIoT applications. Different challenges in WSN are also presented along with possible solutions given by the use of virtualized WSNs. Further details are also presented concerning the use of overlay networks as the next step to supporting virtualization in shared sensor networks. Our discussion closes with an exposition of the existing challenges in the use of virtualized WSN for IIoT applications. In general, because overlay networks will be contributory to the future development and advancement of smart industrial and smart city applications, this review may be considered by researchers as a reference point for those particularly interested in the study of this growing field.

AB  - The nature of contemporary spatial data infrastructures lies in the provision of geospatial information in an on-demand fashion. Although recent applications identified the need to react to real-time information in a time-critical way, research efforts in the field of geospatial Internet of Things in particular have identified substantial gaps in this context, ranging from a lack of standardisation for event-based architectures to the meaningful handling of real-time information as &ldquo;events&rdquo;. This manuscript presents work in the field of event-driven architectures as part of spatial data infrastructures with a particular focus on sensor networks and the devices capturing in-situ measurements. The current landscape of spatial data infrastructures is outlined and used as the basis for identifying existing gaps that retain certain geospatial applications from using real-time information. We present a selection of approaches&mdash;developed in different research projects&mdash;to overcome these gaps. Being designed for specific application domains, these approaches share commonalities as well as orthogonal solutions and can build the foundation of an overall event-driven spatial data infrastructure.

AB  - Today, buildings consume more than 40% of primary energy in and produce more than 36% of CO2. So, an intelligent controller applied to the buildings for energy and comfort management could achieve significant reduction in energy consumption while improving occupant&rsquo;s comfort. Conventional on/off controllers were only able to automate the tasks in building and were not well suited for energy optimization tasks. Therefore, building energy management has become a focal point in recent years, promising the development of various technologies for various scenarios. This paper deals with a state of the art review on recent developments in building energy management system (BEMS) and occupants comfort, focusing on three model types: white box, black box, and gray box models. Through a comparative study, this paper presents pros and cons of each model.

AB  - Climate change and global warming are becoming important problems around the globe. To prevent these environmental problems, many countries try to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and manage the consumption of energy. The Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) introduced smart grid (SG) technologies to its branch office in 2014. This was the first demonstration of a smart grid on a building, called the Smart Grid Station (SGS). However, the smart grid industry is stagnant despite of the efforts of KEPCO. The authors analyzed the achievements to date, and proved the effects of the SGS by comparing its early targets to its performance. To evaluate the performance, we analyzed the data of 2015 with the data of 2014 in three aspects: peak reduction, power consumption reduction, and electricity fee savings. Furthermore, we studied the economic analysis including photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage system (ESS) electricity fee savings, as well as running cost savings by electric vehicles. Through the evaluation, the authors proved that the performance surpassed the early targets and that the system is economical. With the advantages of the SGS, we suggested directions to expand the system.

TI  - Dynamic Neural Network Modelling of Soil Moisture Content for Predictive Irrigation Scheduling

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Sustainable freshwater management is underpinned by technologies which improve the efficiency of agricultural irrigation systems. Irrigation scheduling has the potential to incorporate real-time feedback from soil moisture and climatic sensors. However, for robust closed-loop decision support, models of the soil moisture dynamics are essential in order to predict crop water needs while adapting to external perturbation and disturbances. This paper presents a Dynamic Neural Network approach for modelling of the temporal soil moisture fluxes. The models are trained to generate a one-day-ahead prediction of the volumetric soil moisture content based on past soil moisture, precipitation, and climatic measurements. Using field data from three sites, a      R 2      value above 0.94 was obtained during model evaluation in all sites. The models were also able to generate robust soil moisture predictions for independent sites which were not used in training the models. The application of the Dynamic Neural Network models in a predictive irrigation scheduling system was demonstrated using AQUACROP simulations of the potato-growing season. The predictive irrigation scheduling system was evaluated against a rule-based system that applies irrigation based on predefined thresholds. Results indicate that the predictive system achieves a water saving ranging between 20 and 46% while realizing a yield and water use efficiency similar to that of the rule-based system.

TI  - Optimal Computational Power Allocation in Multi-Access Mobile Edge Computing for Blockchain

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Blockchain has emerged as a decentralized and trustable ledger for recording and storing digital transactions. The mining process of Blockchain, however, incurs a heavy computational workload for miners to solve the proof-of-work puzzle (i.e., a series of the hashing computation), which is prohibitive from the perspective of the mobile terminals (MTs). The advanced multi-access mobile edge computing (MEC), which enables the MTs to offload part of the computational workloads (for solving the proof-of-work) to the nearby edge-servers (ESs), provides a promising approach to address this issue. By offloading the computational workloads via multi-access MEC, the MTs can effectively increase their successful probabilities when participating in the mining game and gain the consequent reward (i.e., winning the bitcoin). However, as a compensation to the ESs which provide the computational resources to the MTs, the MTs need to pay the ESs for the corresponding resource-acquisition costs. Thus, to investigate the trade-off between obtaining the computational resources from the ESs (for solving the proof-of-work) and paying for the consequent cost, we formulate an optimization problem in which the MTs determine their acquired computational resources from different ESs, with the objective of maximizing the MTs’ social net-reward in the mining process while keeping the fairness among the MTs. In spite of the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we exploit its layered structure and propose efficient distributed algorithms for the MTs to individually determine their optimal computational resources acquired from different ESs. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and the performance of our proposed multi-access MEC for Blockchain.

AB  - Provision of smart city services often relies on users contribution, e.g., of data, which can be costly for the users in terms of privacy. Privacy risks, as well as unfair distribution of benefits to the users, should be minimized as they undermine user participation, which is crucial for the success of smart city applications. This paper investigates privacy, fairness, and social welfare in smart city applications by means of computer simulations grounded on real-world data, i.e., smart meter readings and participatory sensing. We generalize the use of public good theory as a model for resource management in smart city applications, by proposing a design principle that is applicable across application scenarios, where provision of a service depends on user contributions. We verify its applicability by showing its implementation in two scenarios: smart grid and traffic congestion information system. Following this design principle, we evaluate different classes of algorithms for resource management, with respect to human-centered measures, i.e., privacy, fairness and social welfare, and identify algorithm-specific trade-offs that are scenario independent. These results could be of interest to smart city application designers to choose a suitable algorithm given a scenario-specific set of requirements, and to users to choose a service based on an algorithm that matches their privacy preferences.

AB  - With the dramatic increase of connected devices, the Internet of things (IoT) paradigm has become an important solution in supporting dense scenarios such as smart cities. The concept of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) has emerged as a viable solution to improving the capacity of cellular networks in such scenarios. However, achieving optimal load balancing is not trivial due to the complexity and dynamics in HetNets. For this reason, we propose a load balancing scheme based on machine learning techniques that uses both unsupervised and supervised methods, as well as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). As a use case, we apply our scheme to enhance the capabilities of an urban IoT network operating under the LoRaWAN standard. The simulation results show that the packet delivery ratio (PDR) is increased when our scheme is utilized in an unbalanced network and, consequently, the energy cost of data delivery is reduced. Furthermore, we demonstrate that better outcomes are attained when some techniques are combined, achieving a PDR improvement of up to about 50% and reducing the energy cost by nearly 20% in a multicell scenario with 5000 devices requesting downlink traffic.

ICN intends to replace the current IP-based model with the name-based content-centric model, as it aims at providing better security, scalability, and content distribution. However, it is a challenging task to conceive how ICN can be linked with the other most emerging paradigm, i.e., Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). In this article, we present an overview of the ICN-based VANET approach in line with its contributions and research challenges.In addition, the connectivity issues of vehicular ICN model is presented with some other emerging paradigms, such as Software Defined Network (SDN), Cloud, and Edge computing. Moreover, some ICN-based VANET research opportunities, in terms of security, mobility, routing, naming, caching, and fifth generation (5G) communications, are also covered at the end of the paper.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper deals with recently proposed algorithms for real-time distributed blind macro-calibration of sensor networks based on consensus (synchronization). The algorithms are completely decentralized and do not require a fusion center. The goal is to consolidate all of the existing results on the subject, present them in a unified way, and provide additional important analysis of theoretical and practical issues that one can encounter when designing and applying the methodology. We first present the basic algorithm which estimates local calibration parameters by enforcing asymptotic consensus, in the mean-square sense and with probability one (w.p.1), on calibrated sensor gains and calibrated sensor offsets. For the more realistic case in which additive measurement noise, communication dropouts and additive communication noise are present, two algorithm modifications are discussed: one that uses a simple compensation term, and a more robust one based on an instrumental variable. The modified algorithms also achieve asymptotic agreement for calibrated sensor gains and offsets, in the mean-square sense and w.p.1. The convergence rate can be determined in terms of an upper bound on the mean-square error. The case when the communications between nodes is completely asynchronous, which is of substantial importance for real-world applications, is also presented. Suggestions for design of a priori adjustable weights are given. We also present the results for the case in which the underlying sensor network has a subset of (precalibrated) reference sensors with fixed calibration parameters. Wide applicability and efficacy of these algorithms are illustrated on several simulation examples. Finally, important open questions and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - The urgent need for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions requires efficient and integrated energy communities in order to decrease final energy demand and sustain energy transitions towards renewable energy sources (RES). This introduces a big research challenge for future energy systems design and optimization, given the multi-level and inter-sectorial dimensions of the problem. Buildings cover a central role in this context, because they represent the nexus between different energy carrier networks. The study of the management of multi-sector and multi-energy systems presents several challenges, such as the need to take into account uncertainties, to represent the heterogeneity of the energy demand and the scalability of the problem. This paper aims at outlining such a framework, and at showing the state-of-the-art nature of the above-mentioned challenges.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The recently emerging cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) can enable efficient interactions between the social world and cyber-physical system (CPS). The wireless sensor network (WSN) with physical and social sensor nodes plays an important role in CPSS. The integration of the social sensors and physical sensors in CPSS provides an advantage for smart services in different application areas. However, the dynamics of social mobility for social sensors pose new challenges for implementing the coordination of transmission. Furthermore, the integration of social and physical sensors also faces the challenges in term of improving energy efficiency and increasing transmission range. To solve these problems, we integrate the model of social dynamics with collaborative beamforming (CB) technique to formulate the transmission optimization problem as a dynamic game. A novel transmission scheme based on reinforcement learning is proposed to solve the formulated problem. The corresponding implementation of the proposed transmission scheme in CPSS is presented by the design of message exchange processes. The extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transmission scheme presents lower interference to noise ratio (INR) and better signal to noise ratio (SNR) performance in comparison with the existing schemes. The results also indicate that the proposed method has effective adaptation to the dynamic mobility of social sensor nodes in CPSS.

PY  - 2018

SN  - 2410-387X

AB  - Authentication systems based on biometrics characteristics and data represents one of the most important trend in the evolution of the society, e.g., Smart City, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Big Data. In the near future, biometrics systems will be everywhere in the society, such as government, education, smart cities, banks etc. Due to its uniqueness, characteristic, biometrics systems will become more and more vulnerable, privacy being one of the most important challenges. The classic cryptographic primitives are not sufficient to assure a strong level of secureness for privacy. The current paper has several objectives. The main objective consists in creating a framework based on cryptographic modules which can be applied in systems with biometric authentication methods. The technologies used in creating the framework are: C#, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell. The wide range of technologies for developing the algorithms give the readers the possibility and not only, to choose the proper modules for their own research or business direction. The cryptographic modules contain algorithms based on machine learning and modern cryptographic algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption System), SHA-256, RC4, RC5, RC6, MARS, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, THREEFISH, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), Elliptic Curve, and Diffie Hellman. As methods for implementing with success the cryptographic modules, we will propose a methodology which can be used as a how-to guide. The article will focus only on the first category, machine learning, and data clustering, algorithms with applicability in the cloud computing environment. For tests we have used a virtual machine (Virtual Box) with Apache Hadoop and a Biometric Analysis Tool. The weakness of the algorithms and methods implemented within the framework will be evaluated and presented in order for the reader to acknowledge the latest status of the security analysis and the vulnerabilities founded in the mentioned algorithms. Another important result of the authors consists in creating a scheme for biometric enrollment (in Results). The purpose of the scheme is to give a big overview on how to use it, step by step, in real life, and how to use the algorithms. In the end, as a conclusion, the current work paper gives a comprehensive background on the most important and challenging aspects on how to design and implement an authentication system based on biometrics characteristics.

AB  - Traffic jams can be avoided by controlling traffic signals according to quickly building congestion with steep gradients on short temporal and small spatial scales. With the rising standards of computational technology, single-board computers, software packages, platforms, and APIs (Application Program Interfaces), it has become relatively easy for developers to create systems for controlling signals and informative systems. Hence, for enhancing the power of Intelligent Transport Systems in automotive telematics, in this study, we used crowdsourced traffic congestion data from Google to adjust traffic light cycle times with a system that is adaptable to congestion. One aim of the system proposed here is to inform drivers about the status of the upcoming traffic light on their route. Since crowdsourced data are used, the system does not entail the high infrastructure cost associated with sensing networks. A full system module-level analysis is presented for implementation. The system proposed is fail-safe against temporal communication failure. Along with a case study for examining congestion levels, generic information processing for the cycle time decision and status delivery system was tested and confirmed to be viable and quick for a restricted prototype model. The information required was delivered correctly over sustained trials, with an average time delay of 1.5 s and a maximum of 3 s.

AB  - Indoor localization has become a mature research area, but further scientific developments are limited due to the lack of open datasets and corresponding frameworks suitable to compare and evaluate specialized localization solutions. Although several competitions provide datasets and environments for comparing different solutions, they hardly consider novel technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is gaining more and more importance in indoor localization due to its wide availability in personal and environmental devices and to its low costs and flexibility. This paper contributes to cover this gap by: (i) presenting a new indoor BLE dataset; (ii) reviewing several, meaningful use cases in different application scenarios; and (iii) discussing alternative uses of the dataset in the evaluation of different positioning and navigation applications, namely localization, tracking, occupancy and social interaction.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Virtualization technologies are key enablers of softwarized 5G networks, and their usage in the vehicular domain can provide flexibility and reliability in real deployments, where mobility and processing needs may be an issue. Next-generation vehicular services, such as the ones in the area of urban mobility and, in general, those interconnecting on-board sensors, require continuous data gathering and processing, but current architectures are stratified in two-tier solutions in which data is collected by on-board units (OBU) and sent to cloud servers. In this line, intermediate cache and processing layers are needed in order to cover quasi-ubiquitous data-gathering needs of vehicles in scenarios of smart cities/roads considering vehicles as moving sensors. The SURROGATES solution presented in this paper proposes to virtualize vehicle OBUs and create a novel Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) layer with the aim of offloading processing from the vehicle and serving data-access requests. This deals with potential disconnection periods of vehicles, saves radio resources when accessing the physical OBU and improves data processing performance. A proof of concept has been implemented using OpenStack and Open Source MANO to virtualize resources and gather data from in-vehicle sensors, and a final traffic monitoring service has been implemented to validate the proposal. Performance results reveal a speedup of more than 50% in the data request resolution, with consequently great savings of network resources in the wireless segment. Thus, this work opens a novel path regarding the virtualization of end-devices in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) ecosystem.

AB  - The traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has evolved towards intelligent IoT applications which exploit knowledge produced by IoT devices using artificial intelligence techniques. Knowledge sharing between IoT devices is a challenging issue in this trend. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge of Things (KoT) framework which enables sharing self-taught knowledge between IoT devices which require similar or identical knowledge without help from the cloud. The proposed KoT framework allows an IoT device to effectively produce, cumulate, and share its self-taught knowledge with other devices at the edge in the vicinity. This framework can alleviate behavioral repetition in users and computational redundancy in systems in intelligent IoT applications. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we examine a smart home case study and build a prototype of the KoT framework-based smart home system. Experimental results show that the proposed KoT framework reduces the response time to use intelligent IoT devices from a user&rsquo;s perspective and the power consumption for compuation from a system&rsquo;s perspective.

This article analyses the product rank relevance provided by different commercial Big Data recommender systems (Grouplens film, Trip Advisor and Amazon); it also proposes an Intelligent Recommender System (IRS) based on the Random Neural Network; IRS acts as an interface between the customer and the different Recommender Systems that iteratively adapts to the perceived user relevance. In addition, a relevance metric that combines both relevance and rank is presented; this metric is used to validate and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm. On average, IRS outperforms the Big Data recommender systems after learning iteratively from its customer.

TI  - A Trusted Routing Scheme Using Blockchain and Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Sensor Networks

VL  - 19
IS  - 4
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A trusted routing scheme is very important to ensure the routing security and efficiency of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). There are a lot of studies on improving the trustworthiness between routing nodes, using cryptographic systems, trust management, or centralized routing decisions, etc. However, most of the routing schemes are difficult to achieve in actual situations as it is difficult to dynamically identify the untrusted behaviors of routing nodes. Meanwhile, there is still no effective way to prevent malicious node attacks. In view of these problems, this paper proposes a trusted routing scheme using blockchain and reinforcement learning to improve the routing security and efficiency for WSNs. The feasible routing scheme is given for obtaining routing information of routing nodes on the blockchain, which makes the routing information traceable and impossible to tamper with. The reinforcement learning model is used to help routing nodes dynamically select more trusted and efficient routing links. From the experimental results, we can find that even in the routing environment with 50% malicious nodes, our routing scheme still has a good delay performance compared with other routing algorithms. The performance indicators such as energy consumption and throughput also show that our scheme is feasible and effective.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - On-demand shared mobility is increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to address urban transport challenges in large and fast-growing cities. The appeal of this form of transport is largely attributed to its convenience, ease of use, and affordability made possible through digital platforms and innovations. The convergence of the shared economy with a number of established and emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud and Fog computing—is helping to expedite their deployment as a new form of public transport. Recently, this has manifested itself in the form of Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMoD) solutions, aimed at meeting personal travel demands through flexible routing and scheduling. Increasingly, these shared mobility solutions are blurring the boundaries with existing forms of public transport, particularly bus operations. This paper presents an environmental scan and analysis of the technological, social, and economic impacts surrounding disruptive technology-driven shared mobility trends. Specifically, the paper includes an examination of current and anticipated external factors that are of direct relevance to collaborative and low carbon mobility. The paper also outlines how these trends are likely to influence the mobility industries now and into the future. The paper collates information from a wide body of literature and reports on findings from actual ‘use cases’ that exist today which have used these disruptive mobility solutions to deliver substantial benefits to travellers around the world. Finally, the paper provides stakeholders with insight into identifying and responding to the likely needs and impacts of FMoD and informs their policy and strategy positions on the implementation of smart mobility systems in their cities and jurisdictions.

AB  - Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) has been a popular research area in the last decade. The dependability of CPS is still a critical issue, and few surveys have been published in this domain. CPS is a dynamic complex system, which involves various multidisciplinary technologies. To avoid human errors and to simplify management, self-management CPS (SCPS) is a wise choice. To achieve dependable self-management, systematic solutions are necessary to verify the design and to guarantee the safety of self-adaptation decisions, as well as to maintain the health of SCPS. This survey first recalls the concepts of dependability, and proposes a generic environment-in-loop processing flow of self-management CPS, and then analyzes the error sources and challenges of self-management through the formal feedback flow. Focusing on reducing the complexity, we first survey the self-adaptive architecture approaches and applied dependability means, then we introduce a hybrid multi-role self-adaptive architecture, and discuss the supporting technologies for dependable self-management at the architecture level. Focus on dependable environment-centered adaptation, we investigate the verification and validation (V&amp;V) methods for making safe self-adaptation decision and the solutions for processing decision dependably. For system-centered adaptation, the comprehensive self-healing methods are summarized. Finally, we analyze the missing pieces of the technology puzzle and the future directions. In this survey, the technical trends for dependable CPS design and maintenance are discussed, an all-in-one solution is proposed to integrate these technologies and build a dependable organic SCPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on dependable SCPS building and evaluation.

AB  - Radio-based locating systems allow for a robust and continuous tracking in industrial environments and are a key enabler for the digitalization of processes in many areas such as production, manufacturing, and warehouse management. Time difference of arrival (TDoA) systems estimate the time-of-flight (ToF) of radio burst signals with a set of synchronized antennas from which they trilaterate accurate position estimates of mobile tags. However, in industrial environments where multipath propagation is predominant it is difficult to extract the correct ToF of the signal. This article shows how deep learning (DL) can be used to estimate the position of mobile objects directly from the raw channel impulse responses (CIR) extracted at the receivers. Our experiments show that our DL-based position estimation not only works well under harsh multipath propagation but also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in line-of-sight situations.

AB  - As an emerging and promising computing paradigm in the Internet of things (IoT), edge computing can significantly reduce energy consumption and enhance computation capability for resource-constrained IoT devices. Computation offloading has recently received considerable attention in edge computing. Many existing studies have investigated the computation offloading problem with independent computing tasks. However, due to the inter-task dependency in various devices that commonly happens in IoT systems, achieving energy-efficient computation offloading decisions remains a challengeable problem. In this paper, a cloud-assisted edge computing framework with a three-tier network in an IoT environment is introduced. In this framework, we first formulated an energy consumption minimization problem as a mixed integer programming problem considering two constraints, the task-dependency requirement and the completion time deadline of the IoT service. To address this problem, we then proposed an Energy-efficient Collaborative Task Computation Offloading (ECTCO) algorithm based on a semidefinite relaxation and stochastic mapping approach to obtain strategies of tasks computation offloading for IoT sensors. Simulation results demonstrated that the cloud-assisted edge computing framework was feasible and the proposed ECTCO algorithm could effectively reduce the energy cost of IoT sensors.

AB  - In recent years, due to the unnecessary wastage of electrical energy in residential buildings, the requirement of energy optimization and user comfort has gained vital importance. In the literature, various techniques have been proposed addressing the energy optimization problem. The goal of each technique is to maintain a balance between user comfort and energy requirements, such that the user can achieve the desired comfort level with the minimum amount of energy consumption. Researchers have addressed the issue with the help of different optimization algorithms and variations in the parameters to reduce energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved yet due to its challenging nature. The gaps in the literature are due to advancements in technology, the drawbacks of optimization algorithms, and the introduction of new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly proposed optimization algorithms have produced better accuracy on the benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. Detailed discussion has been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort, visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge computing techniques used in smart homes.

AB  - With the aim of reducing cost, carbon emissions, and service periods and improving clients’ satisfaction with the logistics network, this paper investigates the optimization of a variant of the location-routing problem (LRP), namely the regional low-carbon LRP (RLCLRP), considering simultaneous pickup and delivery, hard time windows, and a heterogeneous fleet. In order to solve this problem, we construct a biobjective model for the RLCLRP with minimum total cost consisting of depot, vehicle rental, fuel consumption, carbon emission costs, and vehicle waiting time. This paper further proposes a novel hyper-heuristic (HH) method to tackle the biobjective model. The presented method applies a quantum-based approach as a high-level selection strategy and the great deluge, late acceptance, and environmental selection as the acceptance criteria. We examine the superior efficiency of the proposed approach and model by conducting numerical experiments using different instances. Additionally, several managerial insights are provided for logistics enterprises to plan and design a distribution network by extensively analyzing the effects of various domain parameters such as depot cost and location, client distribution, and fleet composition on key performance indicators including fuel consumption, carbon emissions, logistics costs, and travel distance and time.

AB  - In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and its subarea of deep learning have drawn the attention of many researchers.

With the availability of sensor data from various sources, sensor information fusion is in demand for effective integration of big data. In this article, we present an AI-based sensor-information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of transportation data generated and collected from various types of sensors, including remote sensed imagery for the geographic information system (GIS), accelerometers, as well as sensors for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and global positioning system (GPS). The discovered knowledge and information returned from our system provides analysts with a clearer understanding of trajectories or mobility of citizens, which in turn helps to develop better transportation models to achieve the ultimate goal of smarter cities. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and practicality of our AI-based sensor information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of big transportation data.

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The overcrowding of the wireless space has triggered a strict competition for scare network resources. Therefore, there is a need for a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technique that will ensure fair allocation of the available network resources for diverse network elements competing for the network resources. Spectrum handoff (SH) is a DSA technique through which cognitive radio (CR) promises to provide effective channel utilization, fair resource allocation, as well as reliable and uninterrupted real-time connection. However, SH may consume extra network resources, increase latency, and degrade network performance if the spectrum sensing technique used is ineffective and the channel selection strategy (CSS) is poorly implemented. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an SH policy that holistically considers the implementation of effective CSS, and spectrum sensing technique, as well as minimizes communication delays. In this work, two reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are integrated into the CSS to perform channel selection. The first algorithm is used to evaluate the channel future occupancy, whereas the second algorithm is used to determine the channel quality in order to sort and rank the channels in candidate channel list (CCL). A method of masking linearly dependent and useless state elements is implemented to improve the convergence of the learning. Our approach showed a significant reduction in terms of latency and a remarkable improvement in throughput performance in comparison to conventional approaches.

TI  - Quantitative Estimation of Soil Salinity Using UAV-Borne Hyperspectral and Satellite Multispectral Images

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Soil salinization is a global issue resulting in soil degradation, arable land loss and ecological environmental deterioration. Over the decades, multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing have enabled efficient and cost-effective monitoring of salt-affected soils. However, the potential of hyperspectral sensors installed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to estimate and map soil salinity has not been thoroughly explored. This study quantitatively characterized and estimated field-scale soil salinity using an electromagnetic induction (EMI) equipment and a hyperspectral camera installed on a UAV platform. In addition, 30 soil samples (0~20 cm) were collected in each field for the lab measurements of electrical conductivity. First, the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) values measured by EMI were calibrated using the lab measured electrical conductivity derived from soil samples based on empirical line method. Second, the soil salinity was quantitatively estimated using the random forest (RF) regression method based on the reflectance factors of UAV hyperspectral images and satellite multispectral data. The performance of models was assessed by Lin&rsquo;s concordance coefficient (CC), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and root mean square error (RMSE). Finally, the soil salinity of three study fields with different land cover were mapped. The results showed that bare land (field A) exhibited the most severe salinity, followed by dense vegetation area (field C) and sparse vegetation area (field B). The predictive models using UAV data outperformed those derived from GF-2 data with lower RMSE, higher CC and RPD values, and the most accurate UAV-derived model was developed using 62 hyperspectral bands of the image of the field A with the RMSE, CC, and RPD values of 1.40 dS m&minus;1, 0.94, and 2.98, respectively. Our results indicated that UAV-borne hyperspectral imager is a useful tool for field-scale soil salinity monitoring and mapping. With the help of the EMI technique, quantitative estimation of surface soil salinity is critical to decision-making in arid land management and saline soil reclamation.

AB  - Sustainable development is critical to ensure the future of humanity. Therefore, the assessment and governance of sustainability becomes a central challenge our society is facing. This paper provides a novel ICT framework for addressing sustainable development goals. It is characterized by both local and global considerations, in the context of economic, ecological, and social aspects of sustainable development. The framework consists of three modules: data module, sustainability module, and governance module. Data module integrates data from several sources, processes data, infers knowledge, and transforms data into understandable information and knowledge. The second module implements SDGs at the level of municipality/city, ensures ranking of locally transformed SDGs to arrange them in line with the values and needs of the local communities, and proposes an integrated approach in modeling the social-ecological systems. By implementing governance theories, the governance module permits an effective citizen engagement in governance of SDGs. The ICT framework addresses short-term and long-term SDGs and allows for the vertical and horizontal linkages among diverse stakeholders, as well as for their contributions to the nested rule structures employed at operational, collective, and constitutional levels. Thus, the framework we provide here ensures a paradigm shift in approaching SDGs for the advancement of our society.

AB  - With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), applications have become smarter and connected devices give rise to their exploitation in all aspects of a modern city. As the volume of the collected data increases, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are applied to further enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. The field of smart transportation has attracted many researchers and it has been approached with both ML and IoT techniques. In this review, smart transportation is considered to be an umbrella term that covers route optimization, parking, street lights, accident prevention/detection, road anomalies, and infrastructure applications. The purpose of this paper is to make a self-contained review of ML techniques and IoT applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and obtain a clear view of the trends in the aforementioned fields and spot possible coverage needs. From the reviewed articles it becomes profound that there is a possible lack of ML coverage for the Smart Lighting Systems and Smart Parking applications. Additionally, route optimization, parking, and accident/detection tend to be the most popular ITS applications among researchers.

As technology moves forward, it is becoming increasingly important for these IoT devices for environmental sensing to become self-powered to enable long-term operation. This paper provides an outlook on the current state-of-the-art in terms of energy harvesting for these low-power devices. An analytical approach is taken, first defining types of environments in which energy-harvesters operate, before exploring both well-known and novel energy harvesting techniques and their uses in modern-day sensing.

AB  - As the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge computing have been major paradigms for distributed data collection, communication, and processing, smart city applications in the real world tend to adopt IoT and edge computing broadly. Today, more and more machine learning algorithms would be deployed into front-end sensors, devices, and edge data centres rather than centralised cloud data centres. However, front-end sensors and devices are usually not so capable as those computing units in huge data centres, and for this sake, in practice, engineers choose to compromise for limited capacity of embedded computing and limited memory, e.g., neural network models being pruned to fit embedded devices. Visual object tracking is one of many important elements of a smart city, and in the IoT and edge computing context, high requirements to computing power and memory space severely prevent massive and accurate tracking. In this paper, we report on our contribution to object tracking on lightweight computing including (1) using limited computing capacity and memory space to realise tracking; (2) proposing a new algorithm region proposal correlation filter fitting for most edge devices. Systematic evaluations show that (1) our techniques can fit most IoT devices; (2) our techniques can keep relatively high accuracy; and (3) the generated model size is much less than others.

AB  - New technological advances based on software, hardware and new materials must be implemented in smart grids. In addition, these advanced electrical grids must incorporate elements of artificial intelligence. Advances in software development must be complemented with the development of new hardware (power electronics and active distribution among others). The aforementioned must rely on the development of new materials and sensors, which should be integrated into the smart grid. Therefore, the four areas of research based on the technologies are: Operation and Control, Maintenance and Lifespan Management, Grid Planning and Design, and Metering. The review presents the algorithms, materials, devices and others paradigms applied to smart grids, classifying the works according to the four areas of research. This review has focused on the four fundamental pillars of smart grids, on the one hand, the need for more efficient operation and control, followed by advanced maintenance management, to continue planning and designing the new grids, and for conclude with the advanced measurement. As you will see in the article, new devices, new techniques, and future scenarios will make possible the transition from the current grid to the future smart grid.

AB  - With the development of online cars, the demand for travel prediction is increasing in order to reduce the information asymmetry between passengers and drivers of online car-hailing. This paper proposes a travel demand forecasting model named OC-CNN based on the convolutional neural network to forecast the travel demand. In order to make full use of the spatial characteristics of the travel demand distribution, this paper meshes the prediction area and creates a travel demand data set of the graphical structure to preserve its spatial properties. Taking advantage of the convolutional neural network in image feature extraction, the historical demand data of the first twenty-five minutes of the entire region are used as a model input to predict the travel demand for the next five minutes. In order to verify the performance of the proposed method, one-month data from online car-hailing of the Chengdu Fourth Ring Road are used. The results show that the model successfully extracts the spatiotemporal features of the data, and the prediction accuracies of the proposed method are superior to those of the representative methods, including the Bayesian Ridge Model, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory networks.

AB  - With the development of the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT), soldiers have become key nodes of information collection and resource control on the battlefield. It has become a trend to develop wearable devices with diverse functions for the military. However, although densely deployed wearable sensors provide a platform for comprehensively monitoring the status of soldiers, wearable technology based on multi-source fusion lacks a generalized research system to highlight the advantages of heterogeneous sensor networks and information fusion. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-level fusion framework (MLFF) based on Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) of soldiers, and describes a model of the deployment of heterogeneous sensor networks. The proposed framework covers multiple types of information at a single node, including behaviors, physiology, emotions, fatigue, environments, and locations, so as to enable Soldier-BSNs to obtain sufficient evidence, decision-making ability, and information resilience under resource constraints. In addition, we systematically discuss the problems and solutions of each unit according to the frame structure to identify research directions for the development of wearable devices for the military.

AB  - This article reports on a study to investigate how the driving behaviour of autonomous vehicles influences trust and acceptance. Two different designs were presented to two groups of participants (n = 22/21), using actual autonomously driving vehicles. The first was a vehicle programmed to drive similarly to a human, &ldquo;peeking&rdquo; when approaching road junctions as if it was looking before proceeding. The second design had a vehicle programmed to convey the impression that it was communicating with other vehicles and infrastructure and &ldquo;knew&rdquo; if the junction was clear so could proceed without ever stopping or slowing down. Results showed non-significant differences in trust between the two vehicle behaviours. However, there were significant increases in trust scores overall for both designs as the trials progressed. Post-interaction interviews indicated that there were pros and cons for both driving styles, and participants suggested which aspects of the driving styles could be improved. This paper presents user information recommendations for the design and programming of driving systems for autonomous vehicles, with the aim of improving their users&rsquo; trust and acceptance.

AB  - This study sought to propose a big data analysis and prediction model for transmission line tower outliers to assess when something is wrong with transmission line tower big data based on deep reinforcement learning. The model enables choosing automatic cluster K values based on non-labeled sensor big data. It also allows measuring the distance of action between data inside a cluster with the Q-value representing network output in the altered transmission line tower big data clustering algorithm containing transmission line tower outliers and old Deep Q Network. Specifically, this study performed principal component analysis to categorize transmission line tower data and proposed an automatic initial central point approach through standard normal distribution. It also proposed the A-Deep Q-Learning algorithm altered from the deep Q-Learning algorithm to explore policies based on the experiences of clustered data learning. It can be used to perform transmission line tower outlier data learning based on the distance of data within a cluster. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed model recorded an approximately 2.29%~4.19% higher prediction rate and around 0.8% ~ 4.3% higher accuracy rate compared to the old transmission line tower big data analysis model.

AB  - Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) connects a wide range of objects and the types of environments in which IoT can be deployed dynamically change. Therefore, these environments can be modified dynamically at runtime considering the emergence of other requirements. Self-adaptive software alters its behavior to satisfy the requirements in a dynamic environment. In this context, the concept of self-adaptive software is suitable for some dynamic IoT environments (e.g., smart greenhouses, smart homes, and reality applications). In this study, we propose a self-adaptive framework for decision-making in an IoT environment at runtime. The framework comprises a finite-state machine model design and a game theoretic decision-making method for extracting efficient strategies. The framework was implemented as a prototype and experiments were conducted to evaluate its runtime performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can be applied to IoT environments at runtime. In addition, a smart greenhouse-based use case is included to illustrate the usability of the proposed framework.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Dust is one of the components causing heavy environmental pollution in open-pit mines, especially PM10. Some pathologies related to the lung, respiratory system, and occupational diseases have been identified due to the effects of PM10 in open-pit mines. Therefore, the prediction and control of PM10 concentration in the production process are necessary for environmental and health protection. In this study, PM10 concentration from drilling operations in the Coc Sau open-pit coal mine (Vietnam) was investigated and considered through a database including 245 datasets collected. A novel hybrid artificial intelligence model was developed based on support vector regression (SVR) and a swarm optimization algorithm (i.e., particle swarm optimization (PSO)), namely PSO-SVR, for estimating PM10 concentration from drilling operations at the mine. Polynomial (P), radial basis function (RBF), and linear (L) kernel functions were considered and applied to the development of the PSO-SVR models in the present study, abbreviated as PSO-SVR-P, PSO-SVR-RBF, and PSO-SVR-L. Also, three benchmark artificial intelligence techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and classification and regression trees (CART), were applied and developed for estimating PM10 concentration and then compared with the PSO-SVR models. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R2) were used as the statistical criteria for evaluating the performance of the developed models. The results exhibited that the PSO algorithm had an essential role in the optimization of the hyper-parameters of the SVR models. The PSO-SVR models (i.e., PSO-SVR-L, PSO-SVR-P, and PSO-SVR-RBF) had higher performance levels than the other models (i.e., RF, CART, and KNN) with an RMSE of 0.040, 0.042, and 0.043; and R2 of 0.954, 0.948, and 0.946; for the PSO-SVR-L, PSO-SVR-P, and PSO-SVR-RBF models, respectively. Of these PSO-SVR models, the PSO-SVR-L model was the most dominant model with an RMSE of 0.040 and R2 of 0.954. The remaining three benchmark models (i.e., RF, CART, and KNN) yielded a more unsatisfactory performance with an RMSE of 0.060, 0.052, and 0.067; and R2 of 0.894, 0.924, and 0.867, for the RF, CART, and KNN models, respectively. Furthermore, the findings of this study demonstrated that the density of rock mass, moisture content, and the penetration rate of the drill were essential parameters on the PM10 concentration caused by drilling operations in open-pit mines.

In this architecture, sensor devices are resident on the distribution grid and therefore have a unique awareness of multiple system parameters. This enables the use of ongoing ML techniques for implementation of critical applications in the Smart Grid. Monitoring devices are placed at the endpoints and monitoring/control devices are placed along the power line on various types of grid-resident systems. Because the devices are grid-resident and interact directly with other devices on the same physical link, applications such as ML-assisted DVO can be targeted with very high confidence.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) and Blockchain-based delivery framework, called DeliveryCoin, for drone-delivered services. The DeliveryCoin framework consists of four phases, including system initialization phase, creating the block, updating the blockchain, and intrusion detection phase. To achieve privacy-preservation, the DeliveryCoin framework employs hash functions and short signatures without random oracles and the Strong Diffie&ndash;Hellman (SDH) assumption in bilinear groups. To achieve consensus inside the blockchain-based delivery platform, we introduce a UAV-aided forwarding mechanism, named pBFTF. We also propose an IDS system in each macro eNB (5G) for detecting self-driving network attacks as well as false transactions between self-driving nodes. Furthermore, extensive simulations are conducted, and results confirm the efficiency of our proposed DeliveryCoin framework in terms of latency of blockchain consensus and accuracy.

AB  - Presently, the Internet of Things (IoT) concept involves a scattered collection of different multipurpose sensor networks that capture information, which is further processed and used in applications such as smart cities. These networks can send large amounts of information in a fairly efficient but insecure wireless environment. Energy consumption is a key aspect of sensor networks since most of the time, they are battery powered and placed in not easily accessible locations. Therefore, and regardless of the final application, wireless sensor networks require a careful energy consumption analysis that allows selection of the best operating protocol and energy optimization scheme. In this paper, a set of performance metrics is defined to objectively compare different kinds of protocols. Four of the most popular IoT protocols are selected: Zigbee, LoRa, Bluethooth, and WiFi. To test and compare their performance, multiple sensors are placed at different points of a university campus to create a network that can accurately simulate a smart city. Finally, the network is analyzed in detail using two different schemes: collaborative and cooperative.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - To build sustainable smart energy cities (SECs) around the world, many countries are now combining customized services and businesses within their energy infrastructure and urban environments. Such changes could then promote the development of platforms that ultimately provide benefits for citizens such as convenience, safety, and cost savings. Currently, the development of technologies for SECs focuses on independent products and unit technology. However, this is problematic, as it may not be possible to develop sustainable cities if there is a lack of connectivity between various elements within the SEC. To solve such problems, this paper presents an AI-based physical and virtual platform using a 5-layer architecture to develop a sustainable smart energy city (SSEC). The architecture employs both a top-down and bottom-up approach and the links between each energy element in the SSEC can readily be analyzed. The economic analysis based on return on investment (ROI) is carried out by comparing the economic benefits before and after the application of this system. Deploying the proposed platform will enable the speedy development and application of new services for SSECs and will provide SSECs with measures to ensure sustainable development, such as rapid urban development, and cost reductions.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Many receiver-based Preamble Sampling Medium Access Control (PS-MAC) protocols have been proposed to provide better performance for variable traffic in a wireless sensor network (WSN). However, most of these protocols cannot prevent the occurrence of incorrect traffic convergence that causes the receiver node to wake-up more frequently than the transmitter node. In this research, a new protocol is proposed to prevent the problem mentioned above. The proposed mechanism has four components, and they are Initial control frame message, traffic estimation function, control frame message, and adaptive function. The initial control frame message is used to initiate the message transmission by the receiver node. The traffic estimation function is proposed to reduce the wake-up frequency of the receiver node by using the proposed traffic status register (TSR), idle listening times (ILTn, ILTk), and &ldquo;number of wake-up without receiving beacon message&rdquo; (NWwbm). The control frame message aims to supply the essential information to the receiver node to get the next wake-up-interval (WUI) time for the transmitter node using the proposed adaptive function. The proposed adaptive function is used by the receiver node to calculate the next WUI time of each of the transmitter nodes. Several simulations are conducted based on the benchmark protocols. The outcome of the simulation indicates that the proposed mechanism can prevent the incorrect traffic convergence problem that causes frequent wake-up of the receiver node compared to the transmitter node. Moreover, the simulation results also indicate that the proposed mechanism could reduce energy consumption, produce minor latency, improve the throughput, and produce higher packet delivery ratio compared to other related works.

AB  - The integration of different networks has attracted significant attention in academia. Both terrestrial and maritime communications systems have been attracting keen interest for ways to deal with various applications. As the environment of cognitive vehicular and maritime networks is extremely dynamic, these networks suffer with a long delay because of intermittent links while providing services for different applications. To this end, here we introduce the integration of cognitive vehicular and maritime networks to design a coastal smart city by utilizing software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and fog computing under the same infrastructure. This novel integrated cognitive coastal city fulfills the demand of each application user in a hybrid environment with a quicker response time. The idea is to combine vehicular and maritime communications to meet different user demands. Different virtual networks are launched by network function virtualization, and are managed and controlled by a software-defined networking controller. From the integration of software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and fog computing, both vehicular and marine users are provided with stable paths to meet each application&rsquo;s demands.

AB  - Machine learning-based indoor localization used to suffer from the collection, construction, and maintenance of labeled training databases for practical implementation. Semi-supervised learning methods have been developed as efficient indoor localization methods to reduce use of labeled training data. To boost the efficiency and the accuracy of indoor localization, this paper proposes a new time-series semi-supervised learning algorithm. The key aspect of the developed method, which distinguishes it from conventional semi-supervised algorithms, is the use of unlabeled data. The learning algorithm finds spatio-temporal relationships in the unlabeled data, and pseudolabels are generated to compensate for the lack of labeled training data. In the next step, another balancing-optimization learning algorithm learns a positioning model. The proposed method is evaluated for estimating the location of a smartphone user by using a Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurement. The experimental results show that the developed learning algorithm outperforms some existing semi-supervised algorithms according to the variation of the number of training data and access points. Also, the proposed method is discussed in terms of why it gives better performance, by the analysis of the impact of the learning parameters. Moreover, the extended localization scheme in conjunction with a particle filter is executed to include additional information, such as a floor plan.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In photovoltaic and wind power storage systems, the reliability of the battery directly affects the overall reliability of the energy storage system. Failed batteries can seriously affect the stable operation of energy storage systems. This paper aims to improve the reliability of the storage systems by accurately predicting battery life and identifying failing batteries in time. The current prediction models mainly use artificial neural networks, Gaussian process regression and hybrid models. Although these models can achieve high prediction accuracy, the computational cost is high due to model complexity. Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is a computationally efficient alternative. Hence, this study combines the improved chicken swarm optimization algorithm (ICSO) and LSSVM into a hybrid ICSO-LSSVM model for the reliability of photovoltaic and wind power storage systems. The following are the contributions of this work. First, the optimal penalty parameter and kernel width are determined. Second, the chicken swarm optimization algorithm (CSO) is improved by introducing chaotic search behavior in the hen and an adaptive learning factor in the chicks. The performance of the ICSO algorithm is shown to be better than CSO using standard test problems. Third, the prediction accuracy of the three models is compared. For NMC1 battery, the predicted relative error of ICSO-LSSVM is 0.94%; for NMC2 battery, the relative error of ICSO-LSSVM is 1%. These findings show that the proposed model is suitable for predicting the failure of batteries in energy storage systems, which can improve preventive and predictive maintenance of such systems.

AB  - This paper studies the indoor localization based on Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI). In addition to position estimation, this study examines the expansion of applications using Wi-Fi RSSI data sets in three areas: (i) feature extraction, (ii) mobile fingerprinting, and (iii) mapless localization. First, the features of Wi-Fi RSSI observations are extracted with respect to different floor levels and designated landmarks. Second, the mobile fingerprinting method is proposed to allow a trainer to collect training data efficiently, which is faster and more efficient than the conventional static fingerprinting method. Third, in the case of the unknown-map situation, the trajectory learning method is suggested to learn map information using crowdsourced data. All of these parts are interconnected from the feature extraction and mobile fingerprinting to the map learning and the estimation. Based on the experimental results, we observed (i) clearly classified data points by the feature extraction method as regards the floors and landmarks, (ii) efficient mobile fingerprinting compared to conventional static fingerprinting, and (iii) improvement of the positioning accuracy owing to the trajectory learning.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Setting up an exclusive left-turn lane and corresponding signal phase for intersection traffic safety and efficiency will decrease the capacity of the intersection when there are less or no left-turn movements. This is especially true during rush hours because of the ineffective use of left-turn lane space and signal phase duration. With the advantages of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, a novel intersection signal control model is proposed which sets up variable lane direction arrow marking and turns the left-turn lane into a controllable shared lane for left-turn and through movements. The new intersection signal control model and its control strategy are presented and simulated using field data. After comparison with two other intersection control models and control strategies, the new model is validated to improve the intersection capacity in rush hours. Besides, variable lane lines and the corresponding control method are designed and combined with the left-turn waiting area to overcome the shortcomings of the proposed intersection signal control model and control strategy.

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are increasingly embraced around the world to advance smart mobility and more broadly, smart, and sustainable cities. Algorithms form the basis of decision-making in AVs, allowing them to perform driving tasks autonomously, efficiently, and more safely than human drivers and offering various economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, algorithmic decision-making in AVs can also introduce new issues that create new safety risks and perpetuate discrimination. We identify bias, ethics, and perverse incentives as key ethical issues in the AV algorithms&rsquo; decision-making that can create new safety risks and discriminatory outcomes. Technical issues in the AVs&rsquo; perception, decision-making and control algorithms, limitations of existing AV testing and verification methods, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can also undermine the performance of the AV system. This article investigates the ethical and technical concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making in AVs by exploring how driving decisions can perpetuate discrimination and create new safety risks for the public. We discuss steps taken to address these issues, highlight the existing research gaps and the need to mitigate these issues through the design of AV&rsquo;s algorithms and of policies and regulations to fully realise AVs&rsquo; benefits for smart and sustainable cities.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Public bike share (PBS) systems are meant to be a sustainable urban mobility solution in areas where different travel options and the practice of active transport modes can diminish the need on the vehicle and decrease greenhouse gas emission. Although PBS systems have been included in transportation plans in the last decades experiencing an important development and growth, it is crucial to know the main enablers and barriers that PBS systems are facing to reach their goals. In this paper, first, sentiment analysis techniques are applied to user generated content (UGC) in social media comments (Facebook, Twitter and TripAdvisor) to identify these enablers and barriers. This analysis provides a set of explanatory variables that are combined with data from official statistics and the PBS observatory in Spain. As a result, a statistical model that assesses the connection between PBS use and certain characteristics of the PBS systems, utilizing sociodemographic, climate, and positive and negative opinion data extracted from social media is developed. The outcomes of the research work show that the identification of the main enablers and barriers of PBS systems can be effectively achieved following the research method and tools presented in the paper. The findings of the research can contribute to transportation planners to uncover the main factors related to the adoption and use of PBS systems, by taking advantage of publicly available data sources.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Gross calorific value (GCV) is one of the essential parameters for evaluating coal quality. Therefore, accurate GCV prediction is one of the primary ways to improve heating value as well as coal production. A novel evolutionary-based predictive system was proposed in this study for predicting GCV with high accuracy, namely the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-support vector regression (SVR) model. It was developed based on the SVR and PSO algorithms. Three different kernel functions were employed to establish the PSO-SVR models, including radial basis function, linear, and polynomial functions. Besides, three benchmark machine learning models including classification and regression trees (CART), multiple linear regression (MLR), and principle component analysis (PCA) were also developed to estimate GCV and then compared with the proposed PSO-SVR model; 2583 coal samples were used to analyze the proximate components and GCV for this study. Then, they were used to develop the mentioned models as well as check their performance in experimental results. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R2), ranking, and intensity color criteria were used and computed to evaluate the GCV predictive models developed. The results revealed that the proposed PSO-SVR model with radial basis function had better accuracy than the other models. The PSO algorithm was optimized in the SVR model with high efficiency. These should be used as a supporting tool in practical engineering to determine the heating value of coal seams in complex geological conditions.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Collaboration between multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to establish a Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) is a growing trend since future applications claim for more autonomous and rapidly deployable systems. In this context, Software-Defined Networking FANET (SDN-FANET ) separates the control and data plane and provides network programmability, which considers a centralized controller to perform all FANET control functions based on global UAV context information, such as UAV positions, movement trajectories, residual energy, and others. However, control message dissemination in an SDN-FANET with low overhead and high performance is not a trivial task due to FANET particular characteristics, i.e., high mobility, failures in UAV to UAV communication, and short communication range. With this in mind, it is essential to predict UAV information for control message dissemination as well as consider hierarchical network architecture, reducing bandwidth consumption and signaling overhead. In this article, we present a Cluster-bAsed control Plane messages management in sOftware-defined flying ad-hoc NEtwork, called CAPONE. Based on UAV contextual information, the controller can predict UAV information without control message transmission. In addition, CAPONE divides the FANET into groups by computing the number of clusters using the Gap statistics method, which is input for a Fuzzy C-means method to determine the group leader and members. In this way, CAPONE reduces the bandwidth consumption and signaling overhead, while guaranteeing the control message delivering in FANET scenarios. Extensive simulations are used to show the gains of the CAPONE in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio, overhead, and energy compared to existing SDN-FANET architectures.

AB  - In view of the characteristics of various types of information system integrated hardware and software systems, complex network topology, complex causes of fault alarm and uncertainty, this paper studies the communication fault maintenance decision-making based on the inverse symmetry algorithm. Based on the principle of the inverse symmetry algorithm, the modulation and demodulation process of information system is determined, the redundant system attributes in the information system are reduced by rough set, and the Bayesian network model with minimum diagnosis set is obtained by combining the prior knowledge in the operation process of the information system. The input and output of the network are the condition attributes and decision attributes of the decision table, respectively. Through the above process, the optimal fault diagnosis rules are established. After the communication fault is diagnosed, different communication fault maintenance decisions of the information system are used to eliminate the fault. The experimental results show that this method can effectively diagnose the communication fault of the information system and make effective maintenance decisions. The average accuracy of data transmission of the information system using this method is over 99.5% under different operating distances, which has better communication performance.

VL  - 12
IS  - 2
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In recent years, deep learning technology has been widely used in the field of hyperspectral image classification and achieved good performance. However, deep learning networks need a large amount of training samples, which conflicts with the limited labeled samples of hyperspectral images. Traditional deep networks usually construct each pixel as a subject, ignoring the integrity of the hyperspectral data and the methods based on feature extraction are likely to lose the edge information which plays a crucial role in the pixel-level classification. To overcome the limit of annotation samples, we propose a new three-channel image build method (virtual RGB image) by which the trained networks on natural images are used to extract the spatial features. Through the trained network, the hyperspectral data are disposed as a whole. Meanwhile, we propose a multiscale feature fusion method to combine both the detailed and semantic characteristics, thus promoting the accuracy of classification. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve ideal results better than the state-of-art methods. In addition, the virtual RGB image can be extended to other hyperspectral processing methods that need to use three-channel images.

AB  - In order to protect human lives and infrastructure, as well as to minimize the risk of damage, it is important to predict and respond to natural disasters in advance. However, currently, the standardized disaster response system in South Korea still needs further advancement, and the response phase systems need to be improved to ensure that they are properly equipped to cope with natural disasters. Existing studies on intelligent disaster management systems (IDSSs) in South Korea have focused only on storms, floods, and earthquakes, and they have not used past data. This research proposes a new conceptual framework of an IDSS for disaster management, with particular attention paid to wildfires and cold/heat waves. The IDSS uses big data collected from open application programming interface (API) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to help decision-makers make faster and more accurate decisions. In addition, a simple example of the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect fire in surveillance video has been developed, which can be used for automatic fire detection and provide an appropriate response. The system will also consider connecting to open source intelligence (OSINT) to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and develop more robust security policies than those currently in place to prevent cyber-attacks.

AB  - The transition of the energy system into a more efficient state requires innovative ideas to finance new schemes and engage people into adjusting their behavioural patterns concerning consumption. Effective energy management combined with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) open new opportunities for local and regional authorities, but also for energy suppliers, utilities and other obligated parties, or even energy cooperatives, to implement mechanisms that allow people to become more efficient either by producing and trading energy or by reducing their energy consumption. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed connecting energy savings with a digital energy currency. This framework builds reward schemes where the energy end-users could benefit financially from saving energy, by receiving coins according to their real consumption compared to the predicted consumption if no actions were to take place. A pilot appraisal of such a scheme is presented for the case of Bahrain, so as to simulate the behaviour of the proposed framework in order for it to become a viable choice for intelligent energy management in future action plans.

AB  - High-speed wired and wireless Internet are one of the useful ways to acquire various types of media data easily. In this circumstance, people also can easily get media data including objects with exposed personal information through the Internet. Exposure of personal information emerges as a social issue. This paper proposes an effective blocking technique that makes it possible to robustly detect target objects with exposed personal information from various types of input images with the use of deep neural computing and to effectively block the detected objects&rsquo; regions. The proposed technique first utilizes the neural computing-based learning algorithm to robustly detect the target object including personal information from an image. It next generates a grid-type mosaic and lets the mosaic overlap the target object region detected in the previous step so as to effectively block the object region that includes personal information. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm robustly detects the target object region with exposed personal information from a variety of input images and effectively blocks the detected region through grid-type mosaic processing. The object blocking technique proposed in this paper is expected to be applied to various application fields such as image security, sustainable anticipatory computing, object tracking, and target blocking.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Perfect channel state information (CSI) is required in most of the classical physical-layer security techniques, while it is difficult to obtain the ideal CSI due to the time-varying wireless fading channel. Although imperfect CSI has a great impact on the security of MIMO communications, deep learning is becoming a promising solution to handle the negative effect of imperfect CSI. In this work, we propose two types of deep learning-based secure MIMO detectors for heterogeneous networks, where the macro base station (BS) chooses the null-space eigenvectors to prevent information leakage to the femto BS. Thus, the bit error rate of the associated user is adopted as the metric to evaluate the system performance. With the help of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the macro BS obtains the refined version from the imperfect CSI. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed algorithms. The impacts of system parameters, such as the correlation factor of imperfect CSI, the normalized doppler frequency, the number of antennas is investigated in different setup scenarios. The results show that considerable performance gains can be obtained from the deep learning-based detectors compared with the classical maximum likelihood algorithm.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Interest in the use of AI for urban innovation continues to grow. Particularly, the rise of smart cities&mdash;urban locations that are enabled by community, technology, and policy to deliver productivity, innovation, livability, wellbeing, sustainability, accessibility, good governance, and good planning&mdash;has increased the demand for AI-enabled innovations. There is, nevertheless, no scholarly work that provides a comprehensive review on the topic. This paper generates insights into how AI can contribute to the development of smarter cities. A systematic review of the literature is selected as the methodologic approach. Results are categorized under the main smart city development dimensions, i.e., economy, society, environment, and governance. The findings of the systematic review containing 93 articles disclose that: (a) AI in the context of smart cities is an emerging field of research and practice. (b) The central focus of the literature is on AI technologies, algorithms, and their current and prospective applications.

TI  - A Deep Learning-Based Method for Overhead Contact System Component Recognition Using Mobile 2D LiDAR

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The overhead contact system (OCS) is a critical railway infrastructure for train power supply. Periodic inspections, aiming at acquiring the operational condition of the OCS and detecting problems, are necessary to guarantee the safety of railway operations. One of the OCS inspection means is to analyze data of point clouds collected by mobile 2D LiDAR. Recognizing OCS components from the collected point clouds is a critical task of the data analysis. However, the complex composition of OCS makes the task difficult. To solve the problem of recognizing multiple OCS components, we propose a new deep learning-based method to conduct semantic segmentation on the point cloud collected by mobile 2D LiDAR. Both online data processing and batch data processing are supported because our method is designed to classify points into meaningful categories of objects scan line by scan line. Local features are important for the success of point cloud semantic segmentation. Thus, we design an iterative point partitioning algorithm and a module named as Spatial Fusion Network, which are two critical components of our method for multi-scale local feature extraction. We evaluate our method on point clouds where sixteen categories of common OCS components have been manually labeled. Experimental results show that our method is effective in multiple object recognition since mean Intersection-over-Unions (mIoUs) of online data processing and batch data processing are, respectively, 96.12% and 97.17%.

AB  - The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) systems has received much attention from the research community, and it has brought many innovations to smart cities, particularly through the Internet of Moving Things (IoMT). The dynamic geographic distribution of IoMT devices enables the devices to sense themselves and their surroundings on multiple spatio-temporal scales, interact with each other across a vast geographical area, and perform automated analytical tasks everywhere and anytime. Currently, most of the geospatial applications of IoMT systems are developed for abnormal detection and control monitoring. However, it is expected that, in the near future, optimization and prediction tasks will have a larger impact on the way citizens interact with smart cities. This paper examines the state of the art of IoMT systems and discusses their crucial role in supporting anticipatory learning. The maximum potential of IoMT systems in future smart cities can be fully exploited in terms of proactive decision making and decision delivery via an anticipatory action/feedback loop. We also examine the challenges and opportunities of anticipatory learning for IoMT systems in contrast to GIS. The holistic overview provided in this paper highlights the guidelines and directions for future research on this emerging topic.

TI  - Crowd-Based Cognitive Perception of the Physical World: Towards the Internet of Senses
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper introduces a possible architecture and discusses the research directions for the realization of the Cognitive Perceptual Internet (CPI), which is enabled by the convergence of wired and wireless communications, traditional sensor networks, mobile crowd-sensing, and machine learning techniques. The CPI concept stems from the fact that mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming an outstanding mean for zero-effort world-sensing and digitalization thanks to their pervasive diffusion and the increasing number of embedded sensors. Data collected by such devices provide unprecedented insights into the physical world that can be inferred through cognitive processes, thus originating a digital sixth sense. In this paper, we describe how the Internet can behave like a sensing brain, thus evolving into the Internet of Senses, with network-based cognitive perception and action capabilities built upon mobile crowd-sensing mechanisms. The new concept of hyper-map is envisioned as an efficient geo-referenced repository of knowledge about the physical world. Such knowledge is acquired and augmented through heterogeneous sensors, multi-user cooperation and distributed learning mechanisms. Furthermore, we indicate the possibility to accommodate proactive sensors, in addition to common reactive sensors such as cameras, antennas, thermometers and inertial measurement units, by exploiting massive antenna arrays at millimeter-waves to enhance mobile terminals perception capabilities as well as the range of new applications. Finally, we distillate some insights about the challenges arising in the realization of the CPI, corroborated by preliminary results, and we depict a futuristic scenario where the proposed Internet of Senses becomes true.

TI  - Two Optimization Algorithms for Name-Resolution Server Placement in Information-Centric Networking

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Information-centric networking (ICN) is an emerging network architecture that has the potential to address demands related to transmission latency and reliability in fifth-generation (5G) communication technology and the Internet of Things (IoT). As an essential component of ICN, name resolution provides the capability to translate identifiers into locators. Applications have different demands on name-resolution latency. To meet the demands, deploying name-resolution servers at the edge of the network by dividing it into multilayer overlay networks is effective. Moreover, optimization of the deployment of distributed name-resolution servers in such networks to minimize deployment costs is significant. In this paper, we first study the placement problem of the name-resolution server in ICN. Then, two algorithms called IIT-DOWN and IIT-UP are developed based on the heuristic ideas of inter-layer information transfer (IIT) and server reuse. They transfer server placement information and latency information between adjacent layers from different directions. Finally, experiments are conducted on both simulation networks and a real-world dataset. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as the latency-aware hierarchical elastic area partitioning (LHP) algorithm in finding more cost-efficient solutions with a shorter execution time.

AB  - The logistics industry around the world has proliferated over recent years as a large number of business organizations have come to recognize the importance of logistics. Cost control used to be emphasized to remain competitive, but recently green logistics has gained attention with the awareness of the integration of economy and society as a whole. Nowadays, green logistics is a useful concept to improve the sustainability of logistics operations, and its related policies and theoretical research have been investigated and explored. However, the practical applications of green logistics are impeded by real-time data sharing, which is common in the logistics industry. Blockchain technology is adopted to address this challenge and enable data sharing among related stakeholders. This paper presents a reference framework for green logistics based on blockchain to reach the sustainable operations of logistics, with the integration of the Internet of Things and big data. Finally, potential benefits and limitations are analyzed when implementing this framework.

AB  - With the continuous development of tourism, the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into tourism projects is considered a very promising technology. Smart tourism aims to use the IoT to maximize information communication; that is, the IoT technology will become an important element to meet the needs of a new generation of tourists. Therefore, in this study, we propose a human-guided machine learning classification method based on tourist selection behavior. This classification method can effectively help tourists make a decision in choosing a certain tourist destination. The results obtained from the cross-validation experiments and performance evaluation prove the effectiveness of this method.

AB  - The power system worldwide is going through a revolutionary transformation due to the integration with various distributed components, including advanced metering infrastructure, communication infrastructure, distributed energy resources, and electric vehicles, to improve the reliability, energy efficiency, management, and security of the future power system. These components are becoming more tightly integrated with IoT. They are expected to generate a vast amount of data to support various applications in the smart grid, such as distributed energy management, generation forecasting, grid health monitoring, fault detection, home energy management, etc. With these new components and information, artificial intelligence techniques can be applied to automate and further improve the performance of the smart grid. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques to support various applications in a distributed smart grid. In particular, we discuss how artificial techniques are applied to support the integration of renewable energy resources, the integration of energy storage systems, demand response, management of the grid and home energy, and security. As the smart grid involves various actors, such as energy produces, markets, and consumers, we also discuss how artificial intelligence and market liberalization can potentially help to increase the overall social welfare of the grid. Finally, we provide further research challenges for large-scale integration and orchestration of automated distributed devices to realize a truly smart grid.
