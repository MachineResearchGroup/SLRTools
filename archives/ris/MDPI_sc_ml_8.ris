AB  - In mobile crowd computing (MCC), smart mobile devices (SMDs) are utilized as computing resources. To achieve satisfactory performance and quality of service, selecting the most suitable resources (SMDs) is crucial. The selection is generally made based on the computing capability of an SMD, which is defined by its various fixed and variable resource parameters. As the selection is made on different criteria of varying significance, the resource selection problem can be duly represented as an MCDM problem. However, for the real-time implementation of MCC and considering its dynamicity, the resource selection algorithm should be time-efficient. In this paper, we aim to find out a suitable MCDM method for resource selection in such a dynamic and time-constraint environment. For this, we present a comparative analysis of various MCDM methods under asymmetric conditions with varying selection criteria and alternative sets. Various datasets of different sizes are used for evaluation. We execute each program on a Windows-based laptop and also on an Android-based smartphone to assess average runtimes. Besides time complexity analysis, we perform sensitivity analysis and ranking order comparison to check the correctness, stability, and reliability of the rankings generated by each method.

AB  - The number of smart homes is rapidly increasing. Smart homes typically feature functions such as voice-activated functions, automation, monitoring, and tracking events. Besides comfort and convenience, the integration of smart home functionality with data processing methods can provide valuable information about the well-being of the smart home residence. This study is aimed at taking the data analysis within smart homes beyond occupancy monitoring and fall detection. This work uses a multilayer perceptron neural network to recognize multiple human activities from wrist- and ankle-worn devices. The developed models show very high recognition accuracy across all activity classes. The cross-validation results indicate accuracy levels above 98% across all models, and scoring evaluation methods only resulted in an average accuracy reduction of 10%.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems and is of great significance for traffic management. The main issue of traffic forecasting is how to model spatial and temporal dependence. Current state-of-the-art methods tend to apply deep learning models; these methods are unexplainable and ignore the a priori characteristics of traffic flow. To address these issues, a temporal directed graph convolution network (T-DGCN) is proposed. A directed graph is first constructed to model the movement characteristics of vehicles, and based on this, a directed graph convolution operator is used to capture spatial dependence. For temporal dependence, we couple a keyframe sequence and transformer to learn the tendencies and periodicities of traffic flow. Using a real-world dataset, we confirm the superior performance of the T-DGCN through comparative experiments. Moreover, a detailed discussion is presented to provide the path of reasoning from the data to the model design to the conclusions.

AB  - This paper describes an automated method for the calibration of RSS-fingerprinting-based positioning systems. The method assumes using a robotic platform to gather fingerprints in the system environment and using them for training machine learning models. The obtained models are used for positioning purposes during the system operation. The presented calibration method covers all steps of the system calibration, from mapping the system environment using a GraphSLAM based algorithm to training models for radio map calibration. The study analyses four different models: fitting a log-distance path loss model, Gaussian Process Regression, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest Regression. The proposed method was tested in a BLE-based indoor localisation system set up in a fully furnished apartment. The results have shown that the tested models allow for localisation with accuracy comparable to those reported in the literature. In the case of the Neural Network regression, the median error of robot positioning was 0.87 m. The median of trajectory error in a walking person localisation scenario was 0.4 m.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have grown rapidly in recent years and are considered by both academia and industry to be key enablers for Industry 4.0. As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and human–robot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels. A route for AI-integration in multiscale/fidelity DTs with multiscale/fidelity data sources in Industry 4.0 is outlined.

TI  - An Attribute-Based Access Control for IoT Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 19
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - With opportunities brought by the Internet of Things (IoT), it is quite a challenge to maintain concurrency and privacy when a huge number of resource-constrained distributed devices are involved. Blockchain have become popular for its benefits, including decentralization, persistence, immutability, auditability, and consensus. Great attention has been received by the IoT based on the construction of distributed file systems worldwide. A new generation of IoT-based distributed file systems has been proposed with the integration of Blockchain technology, such as the Swarm and Interplanetary File System. By using IoT, new technical challenges, such as Credibility, Harmonization, large-volume data, heterogeneity, and constrained resources are arising. To ensure data security in IoT, centralized access control technologies do not provide credibility. In this work, we propose an attribute-based access control model for the IoT. The access control lists are not required for each device by the system. It enhances access management in terms of effectiveness. Moreover, we use blockchain technology for recording the attribute, avoiding data tempering, and eliminating a single point of failure at edge computing devices. IoT devices control the user’s environment as well as his or her private data collection; therefore, the exposure of the user’s personal data to non-trusted private and public servers may result in privacy leakage. To automate the system, smart contracts are used for data accessing, whereas Proof of Authority is used for enhancing the system’s performance and optimizing gas consumption. Through smart contracts, ciphertext can be stored on a blockchain by the data owner. Data can only be decrypted in a valid access period, whereas in blockchains, the trace function is achieved by the storage of invocation and the creation of smart contracts. Scalability issues can also be resolved by using the multichain blockchain. Eventually, it is concluded from the simulation results that the proposed system is efficient for IoT.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Using Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 standard, radio frequency waves are mainly used for communication on various devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and smart televisions. Apart from communication applications, the recent research in wireless technology has turned Wi-Fi into other exploration possibilities such as human activity recognition (HAR). HAR is a field of study that aims to predict motion and movement made by a person or even several people. There are numerous possibilities to use the Wi-Fi-based HAR solution for human-centric applications in intelligent surveillance, such as human fall detection in the health care sector or for elderly people nursing homes, smart homes for temperature control, a light control application, and motion detection applications. This paper’s focal point is to classify human activities such as EMPTY, LYING, SIT, SIT-DOWN, STAND, STAND-UP, WALK, and FALL with deep neural networks, such as long-term short memory (LSTM) and support vector machines (SVM). Special care was taken to address practical issues such as using available commodity hardware. Therefore, the open-source tool Nexmon was used for the channel state information (CSI) extraction on inexpensive hardware (Raspberry Pi 3B+, Pi 4B, and Asus RT-AC86U routers). We conducted three different types of experiments using different algorithms, which all demonstrated a similar accuracy in prediction for HAR with an accuracy between 97% and 99.7% (Raspberry Pi) and 96.2% and 100% (Asus RT-AC86U), for the best models, which is superior to previously published results. We also provide the acquired datasets and disclose details about the experimental setups.

SN  - 2075-4426

AB  - The psychiatric diagnostic procedure is currently based on self-reports that are subject to personal biases. Therefore, the diagnostic process would benefit greatly from data-driven tools that can enhance accuracy and specificity. In recent years, many studies have achieved promising results in detecting and diagnosing depression based on machine learning (ML) analysis. Despite these favorable results in depression diagnosis, which are primarily based on ML analysis of neuroimaging data, most patients do not have access to neuroimaging tools. Hence, objective assessment tools are needed that can be easily integrated into the routine psychiatric diagnostic process. One solution is to use behavioral data, which can be easily collected while still maintaining objectivity. The current paper summarizes the main ML-based approaches that use behavioral data in diagnosing depression and other psychiatric disorders. We classified these studies into two main categories: (a) laboratory-based assessments and (b) data mining, the latter of which we further divided into two sub-groups: (i) social media usage and movement sensors data and (ii) demographic and clinical information. The paper discusses the advantages and challenges in this field and suggests future research directions and implementations. The paper’s overarching aim is to serve as a first step in synthetizing existing knowledge about ML-based behavioral diagnosis studies in order to develop interventions and individually tailored treatments in the future.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - With data collected by Internet of Things sensors, deep learning (DL) models can forecast the generation capacity of photovoltaic (PV) power plants. This functionality is especially relevant for PV power operators and users as PV plants exhibit irregular behavior related to environmental conditions. However, DL models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which may lead to increased predictive error and wrong operational decisions. This work proposes a new scheme to detect adversarial examples and mitigate their impact on DL forecasting models. This approach is based on one-class classifiers and features extracted from the data inputted to the forecasting models. Tests were performed using data collected from a real-world PV power plant along with adversarial samples generated by the Fast Gradient Sign Method under multiple attack patterns and magnitudes. One-class Support Vector Machine and Local Outlier Factor were evaluated as detectors of attacks to Long-Short Term Memory and Temporal Convolutional Network forecasting models. According to the results, the proposed scheme showed a high capability of detecting adversarial samples with an average F1-score close to 90%. Moreover, the detection and mitigation approach strongly reduced the prediction error increase caused by adversarial samples.

AB  - This paper surveys the deep learning (DL) approaches for intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) in Internet of Things (IoT) and the associated datasets toward identifying gaps, weaknesses, and a neutral reference architecture. A comparative study of IDSs is provided, with a review of anomaly-based IDSs on DL approaches, which include supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid methods. All techniques in these three categories have essentially been used in IoT environments. To date, only a few have been used in the anomaly-based IDS for IoT. For each of these anomaly-based IDSs, the implementation of the four categories of feature(s) extraction, classification, prediction, and regression were evaluated. We studied important performance metrics and benchmark detection rates, including the requisite efficiency of the various methods. Four machine learning algorithms were evaluated for classification purposes: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Therefore, we compared each via the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The study model exhibits promising outcomes for all classes of attacks. The scope of our analysis examines attacks targeting the IoT ecosystem using empirically based, simulation-generated datasets (namely the Bot-IoT and the IoTID20 datasets).

AB  - Urban traffic congestion has a significant detrimental impact on the environment, public health and the economy, with at a high cost to society worldwide. Moreover, it is not possible to continually modify urban road infrastructure in order to mitigate increasing traffic demand. Therefore, it is important to develop traffic control models that can handle high-volume traffic data and synchronize traffic lights in an urban network in real time, without interfering with other initiatives. Within this context, this study proposes a model, based on deep reinforcement learning, for synchronizing the traffic signals of an urban traffic network composed of two intersections. The calibration of this model, including training of its neural network, was performed using real traffic data collected at the approach to each intersection. The results achieved through simulations were very promising, yielding significant improvements in indicators measured in relation to the pre-existing conditions in the network. The model was able to deal with a broad spectrum of traffic flows and, in peak demand periods, reduced delays and queue lengths by more than 28% and 42%, respectively.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 19
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A fingerprint-based localization system is an economic way to solve an indoor positioning problem. However, the traditional off-line fingerprint collection stage is a time-consuming and laborious process which limits the use of fingerprint-based localization systems. In this paper, based on ubiquitous Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) equipment and a low-cost Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging system (with only one UWB anchor), a ready-to-use indoor localization system is proposed to realize long-term and high-accuracy indoor positioning. More specifically, in this system, it is divided into two stages: (1) an initial stage, and (2) a positioning stage. In the initial stage, an Inertial Measure Unit (IMU) is used to calculate the position using Pedestrian Dead Reckon (PDR) algorithm within a preset number of steps, and the location-related fingerprints are collected to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression model; simultaneously, in order to make the UWB ranging system adapt to the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environment, the increments of acceleration and angular velocity in IMU and the increments of single UWB ranging measures are correlated to pre-train a Supported Vector Regression (SVR). After reaching the threshold of time or step number, the system is changed into a positioning stage, and the CNN predicts the position calibrated by corrected UWB ranging. At last, a series of practical experiments are conducted in the real environment; the experiment results show that, due to the corrected UWB ranging measures calibrating the CNN parameters in every positioning period, this system has stable localization results in a comparative long-term range. Additionally, it has the advantages of stability, low cost, anti-noise, etc.

AB  - Real-time health monitoring of civil infrastructures is performed to maintain their structural integrity, sustainability, and serviceability for a longer time. With smart electronics and packaging technology, large amounts of complex monitoring data are generated, requiring sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for their processing. With the advancement of technology, more complex AI models have been applied, from simple models to sophisticated deep learning (DL) models, for structural health monitoring (SHM). In this article, a comprehensive review is performed, primarily on the applications of AI models for SHM to maintain the sustainability of diverse civil infrastructures. Three smart data capturing methods of SHM, namely, camera-based, smartphone-based, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based methods, are also discussed, having made the utilization of intelligent paradigms easier. UAV is found to be the most promising smart data acquisition technology, whereas convolution neural networks are the most impressive DL model reported for SHM. Furthermore, current challenges and future perspectives of AI-based SHM systems are also described separately. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city concepts are explained to elaborate on the contributions of intelligent SHM systems. The integration of SHM with IoT and cloud-based computing is leading us towards the evolution of future smart cities.

AB  - Automatically estimating the number of people in unconstrained scenes is a crucial yet challenging task in different real-world applications, including video surveillance, public safety, urban planning, and traffic monitoring. In addition, methods developed to estimate the number of people can be adapted and applied to related tasks in various fields, such as plant counting, vehicle counting, and cell microscopy. Many challenges and problems face crowd counting, including cluttered scenes, extreme occlusions, scale variation, and changes in camera perspective. Therefore, in the past few years, tremendous research efforts have been devoted to crowd counting, and numerous excellent techniques have been proposed. The significant progress in crowd counting methods in recent years is mostly attributed to advances in deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) as well as to public crowd counting datasets. In this work, we review the papers that have been published in the last decade and provide a comprehensive survey of the recent CNNs based crowd counting techniques. We briefly review detection-based, regression-based, and traditional density estimation based approaches. Then, we delve into detail regarding the deep learning based density estimation approaches and recently published datasets. In addition, we discuss the potential applications of crowd counting and in particular its applications using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Traffic congestion has several causes, including insufficient road capacity, unrestricted demand and improper scheduling of traffic signal phases. A great variety of efforts have been made to properly program such phases. Some of them are based on traditional transportation assumptions, and others are adaptive, allowing the system to learn the control law (signal program) from data obtained from different sources. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a technique commonly used in previous research. However, properly determining the states and the reward is key to obtain good results and to have a real chance to implement it. This paper proposes and implements a traffic signal control system (TSCS), detailing its development stages: (a) Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) architecture design for the TSCS; (b) design and development of a system prototype, including an RL algorithm to minimize the vehicle queue at intersections, and detection and calculation of such queues by adapting a computer vision algorithm; and (c) design and development of system tests to validate operation of the algorithms and the system prototype. Results include the development of the tests for each module (vehicle queue measurement and RL algorithm) and real-time integration tests. Finally, the article presents a system simulation in the context of a medium-sized city in a developing country, showing that the proposed system allowed reduction of vehicle queues by 29%, of waiting time by 50%, and of lost time by 50%, when compared to fixed phase times in traffic signals.

SN  - 2504-3110

AB  - Fiber is effective in restricting cracks and improving the toughness of geopolymer composites, but few studies have focused on the surface crack characteristics of fiber-reinforced geopolymer composites. In this paper, after flexural tests of polypropylene fiber-reinforced geopolymer mortar, the surface cracking image was collected by a digital camera and cracking information was extract by deep learning. Finally, the cracking and fractal characteristics were specifically discussed. The semantic segmentation network can accurately extract surface cracks for calculating various parameters. The results showed that the mean intersection over union (mIoU) and mean pixel accuracy (mPA) of the cracks are 0.8451 and 0.9213, respectively. Generally, the crack length, width, area, and fractal dimension of the specimen are all increased with the increase in the fiber volume fraction. These crack parameters grow rapidly when the fiber content is small, and the growth of the crack parameters gradually slows down as the fiber volume fraction increases to approximately 1.5%. The highest crack parameter values were found in the geopolymer mortar, with a 0.48 water–binder ratio and 12 mm fiber length. The variation of the bottom crack length and the side crack fractal dimension can be used to represent the overall crack variation patterns. Meanwhile, the crack parameters increase with the increased fiber factor in a quadratic function. Based on these crack parameters, the critical fiber factor and dense fiber factor of polypropylene fiber-reinforced geopolymer mortar were 200 and 550, respectively. They are greater than those of fiber-reinforced Portland cementitious composites. The influence of various crack parameters on the flexural strength is in the order of the crack area, width, length, and fractal dimension.

AB  - The motorcycle market has experienced an upward trend. That growth brings along mobility, accidents, and environment-related issues; nevertheless, there is a scarcity of literature on evaluating the impact of motorcycle market policies. Consequently, it has been challenging for researchers and policymakers to develop evidence-based strategies to promote or control the growth of this market. This paper aims to review and analyze the scientific literature about motorcycle market policies, using tech-mining techniques and a cluster analysis of keywords, to provide insights about the most relevant world trends in this research area. For this purpose, the bibliographic information of publications in the field was retrieved from the Scopus database. As a result, three thematic clusters (sustainability, mobility, and electric motorcycles) were identified and explained. According to our findings, greenhouse gas emissions, sustainability, environmental impact, and developing countries are the hot research topics. The research leader countries on said topics are the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This study can, therefore, be used as a reference to define a future research agenda in the area. Consequently, it permits researchers and policymakers to identify trending topics and gaps in knowledge, as a baseline to include motorcycles in sustainable and affordable transport systems design.

TI  - Fraud Detection Using the Fraud Triangle Theory and Data Mining Techniques: A Literature Review

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2073-431X

AB  - Fraud entails deception in order to obtain illegal gains; thus, it is mainly evidenced within financial institutions and is a matter of general interest. The problem is particularly complex, since perpetrators of fraud could belong to any position, from top managers to payroll employees. Fraud detection has traditionally been performed by auditors, who mainly employ manual techniques. These could take too long to process fraud-related evidence. Data mining, machine learning, and, as of recently, deep learning strategies are being used to automate this type of processing. Many related techniques have been developed to analyze, detect, and prevent fraud-related behavior, with the fraud triangle associated with the classic auditing model being one of the most important of these. This work aims to review current work related to fraud detection that uses the fraud triangle in addition to machine learning and deep learning techniques. We used the Kitchenham methodology to analyze the research works related to fraud detection from the last decade. This review provides evidence that fraud is an area of active investigation. Several works related to fraud detection using machine learning techniques were identified without the evidence that they incorporated the fraud triangle as a method for more efficient analysis.

AB  - This paper presents and discusses the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) and crowdsourcing in constructing smart cities. The literature review shows an important and increasing concern of the scientific community for these three issues and their association as support for urban development. Based on an extensive literature review, the paper first presents the smart city concept, emphasizing smart city architecture and the role of data in smart city solutions. The second part presents the Internet of Things, focusing on IoT technology, the use of IoT in smart city applications, and security. Finally, the paper presents crowdsourcing with particular attention to mobile crowdsourcing and its role in smart cities. The paper shows that IoT and crowdsourcing have a crucial role in two fundamental layers of smart city applications, namely, the data collection and services layers. Since these two layers ensure the connection between the physical and digital worlds, they constitute the central pillars of smart city projects. The literature review also shows that the smart city development still requires stronger cooperation between the smart city technology-centered research, mainly based on the IoT, and the smart city citizens-centered research, mainly based on crowdsourcing. This cooperation could beneficiate in recent developments in the field of crowdsensing that combines IoT and crowdsourcing.

AB  - With the emergence of fog and edge computing, new possibilities arise regarding the data-driven management of citizens’ mobility in smart cities. Internet of Things (IoT) analytics refers to the use of these technologies, data, and analytical models to describe the current status of the city traffic, to predict its evolution over the coming hours, and to make decisions that increase the efficiency of the transportation system. It involves many challenges such as how to deal and manage real and huge amounts of data, and improving security, privacy, scalability, reliability, and quality of services in the cloud and vehicular network. In this paper, we review the state of the art of IoT in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), identify challenges posed by cloud, fog, and edge computing in ITS, and develop a methodology based on agile optimization algorithms for solving a dynamic ride-sharing problem (DRSP) in the context of edge/fog computing. These algorithms allow us to process, in real time, the data gathered from IoT systems in order to optimize automatic decisions in the city transportation system, including: optimizing the vehicle routing, recommending customized transportation modes to the citizens, generating efficient ride-sharing and car-sharing strategies, create optimal charging station for electric vehicles and different services within urban and interurban areas. A numerical example considering a DRSP is provided, in which the potential of employing edge/fog computing, open data, and agile algorithms is illustrated.

AB  - The concept of city information modeling (CIM) has become increasingly popular in recent years. A literature review of previous CIM studies is presented in this paper. First, a bibliometric analysis of the current global CIM research is described, revealing that CIM has become a significant research hotspot. Next, three main research areas of the current CIM technique, namely data collection, integration, and visualization, are summarized to describe the characteristics of CIM research. Furthermore, some widely used CIM platforms are compared, and typical application cases of the CIM technique at different stages of the city life cycle are summarized. Finally, the current issues in CIM research are discussed, and future development directions are proposed. The findings of this study are expected to help researchers understand the current state of CIM and identify future development directions, thereby promoting CIM research development.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Task scheduling is key to performance optimization and resource management in cloud computing systems. Because of its complexity, it has been defined as an NP problem. We introduce an online scheme to solve the problem of task scheduling under a dynamic load in the cloud environment. After analyzing the process, we propose a server level agreement constraint adaptive online task scheduling algorithm based on double deep Q-learning (SLA-DQTS) to reduce the makespan, cost, and average overdue time under the constraints of virtual machine (VM) resources and deadlines. In the algorithm, we prevent the change of the model input dimension with the number of VMs by taking the Gaussian distribution of related parameters as a part of the state space. Through the design of the reward function, the model can be optimized for different goals and task loads. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by comparing it with three heuristic algorithms (Min-Min, random, and round robin) under different loads. The results show that the algorithm in this paper can achieve similar or better results than the comparison algorithms at a lower cost.

AB  - The article presents a few issues related to the technical condition of a railway turnout, an important element of the railway network where about 90% of railway accidents occur. In the first part of the article, the results of railway turnout wear are presented. A comparison of normal forces (in wheel–rail contact) in vehicle traffic on straight track without a turnout and normal forces occurring when a rail vehicle passes a turnout is presented. Then, turnout wear processes for selected speeds are presented. In the next part of the paper, the possibilities of using a vision system are presented, which, in combination with tools for image processing analysis, makes it possible to detect wear and distances between the key elements of a railway turnout. The main idea of the proposed online diagnostic system solution is to use the analysis of received images (photos) with the help of a vision system. The basic problem to be solved in the proposed system was to develop algorithms responsible for generating wear areas from high-resolution images. The algorithms created within the work were implemented and tested in the MATLAB software environment. The presented method is an original procedure for diagnosing turnout elements for each time instant. The proposed system is compatible with railway traffic control systems.

AB  - With growing evidence of deep learning-assisted smart process planning, there is an essential demand for comprehending whether cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) are adequate in managing complexity and flexibility, configuring the smart factory. In this research, prior findings were cumulated indicating that the interoperability between Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics and cyber-physical process monitoring systems can decide upon the progression of operations advancing a system to the intended state in CPPSs. We carried out a quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science throughout March and August 2021, with search terms including “cyber-physical production systems”, “cyber-physical manufacturing systems”, “smart process manufacturing”, “smart industrial manufacturing processes”, “networked manufacturing systems”, “industrial cyber-physical systems,” “smart industrial production processes”, and “sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing systems”. As we analyzed research published between 2017 and 2021, only 489 papers met the eligibility criteria. By removing controversial or unclear findings (scanty/unimportant data), results unsupported by replication, undetailed content, or papers having quite similar titles, we decided on 164, chiefly empirical, sources. Subsequent analyses should develop on real-time sensor networks, so as to configure the importance of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics by use of cyber-physical production networks.

TI  - A Deep Learning Method for Monitoring Vehicle Energy Consumption with GPS Data
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 20
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - A monitoring method for energy consumption of vehicles is proposed in the study. It is necessary to have parameters estimating fuel economy with GPS data obtained while driving in the proposed method. The parameters are trained by fuel consumption data measured with a data logger for the reference cars. The data logger is equipped with a GPS sensor and OBD connection capability. The GPS sensor measures vehicle speed, acceleration rate and road gradient. The OBD connector gathers the fuel consumption signaled from OBD port built in the car. The parameters are trained by a 5-layer deep-learning construction with input data (speed, acceleration, gradient) and labels (fuel consumption data) in the typical classification approach. The number of labels is about 6–8 and the number of neurons for hidden layers increases in proportionate to the label numbers. There are about 160–200 parameters. The parameters are calibrated to consider the wide range of fuel efficiency and deterioration degree in age for various test cars. The calibration factor is made from the certified fuel economy and model year taken from the car registration form. The error range of the estimated fuel economy from the measured value is about −6% to +7% for the eight test cars. It is accurate enough to capture the vehicle dynamics for using the input and output data in point-to-point classification style for training steps. Further, it is simple enough to hit fuel economy of the other test cars because fuel economy is a kind of averaged value of fuel consumption for the time period or driven distance for monitoring steps. You can predict or monitor energy consumption for any vehicle with the GPS-measured speed/acceleration/gradient data by the pre-trained parameters and calibration factors of the reference vehicles according to fuel types such as gasoline, diesel and electric. The proposed method requires just a GPS sensor that is cheap and common, and the calculating procedure is so simple that you can monitor energy consumption of various vehicles in real-time with ease. However, it does not consider weight, weather and auxiliary changes and these effects will be addressed in the future works with a monitoring service system under preparation.

AB  - The scale of Internet of Things (IoT) systems has expanded in recent times and, in tandem with this, IoT solutions have developed symbiotic relationships with technologies, such as edge Computing. IoT has leveraged edge computing capabilities to improve the capabilities of IoT solutions, such as facilitating quick data retrieval, low latency response, and advanced computation, among others. However, in contrast with the benefits offered by edge computing capabilities, there are several detractors, such as centralized data storage, data ownership, privacy, data auditability, and security, which concern the IoT community. This study leveraged blockchain&rsquo;s inherent capabilities, including distributed storage system, non-repudiation, privacy, security, and immutability, to provide a novel, advanced edge computing architecture for IoT systems. Specifically, this blockchain-based edge computing architecture addressed centralized data storage, data auditability, privacy, data ownership, and security. Following implementation, the performance of this solution was evaluated to quantify performance in terms of response time and resource utilization. The results show the viability of the proposed and implemented architecture, characterized by improved privacy, device data ownership, security, and data auditability while implementing decentralized storage.

AB  - Taxi waiting times is an important criterion for taxi passengers to choose appropriate pick-up locations in urban environments. How to predict the taxi waiting time accurately at a certain time and location is the key solution for the imbalance between the taxis’ supplies and demands. Considering the life schedule of urban residents and the different functions of geogrid regions, the research developed in this paper introduces a spatio-temporal schedule-based neural network for urban taxi waiting time prediction. The approach integrates a series of multi-source data from taxi trajectories to city points of interest, different time frames and human behaviors in the city. We apply a grid-based and functional structuration of an urban space that provides a lower-level data representation. Overall, the neural network model can dynamically predict the waiting time of taxi passengers in real time under some given spatio-temporal constraints. The experimental results show that the granular-based grids and spatio-temporal neural network can effectively predict and optimize the accuracy of taxi waiting times. This work provides a decision support for intelligent travel predictions of taxi waiting time in a smart city.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 5
IS  - 4
SN  - 2504-2289

AB  - With the rapid development of 5G communications, enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine type communications and ultra-reliable low latency communications are widely supported. However, a 5G communication system is still based on Shannon’s information theory, while the meaning and value of information itself are not taken into account in the process of transmission. Therefore, it is difficult to meet the requirements of intelligence, customization, and value transmission of 6G networks. In order to solve the above challenges, we propose a 6G mailbox theory, namely a cognitive information carrier to enable distributed algorithm embedding for intelligence networking. Based on Mailbox, a 6G network will form an intelligent agent with self-organization, self-learning, self-adaptation, and continuous evolution capabilities. With the intelligent agent, redundant transmission of data can be reduced while the value transmission of information can be improved. Then, the features of mailbox principle are introduced, including polarity, traceability, dynamics, convergence, figurability, and dependence. Furthermore, key technologies with which value transmission of information can be realized are introduced, including knowledge graph, distributed learning, and blockchain. Finally, we establish a cognitive communication system assisted by deep learning. The experimental results show that, compared with a traditional communication system, our communication system performs less data transmission quantity and error.

AB  - Public transport has become one of the major transport options, especially when it comes to reducing motorized individual transport and achieving sustainability while reducing emissions, noise and so on. The use of public transport data has evolved and rapidly improved over the past decades. Indeed, the availability of data from different sources, coupled with advances in analytical and predictive approaches, has contributed to increased attention being paid to the exploitation of available data to improve public transport service. In this paper, we review the current state of the art of public transport data sources. More precisely, we summarize and analyze the potential and challenges of the main data sources. In addition, we show the complementary aspects of these data sources and how to merge them to broaden their contributions and face their challenges. This is complemented by an information management framework to enhance the use of data sources. Specifically, we seek to bridge the gap between traditional data sources and recent ones, present a unified overview of them and show how they can all leverage recent advances in data-driven methods and how they can help achieve a balance between transit service and passenger behavior.

AB  - The widespread use of mobile devices and sensors has motivated data-driven applications that can leverage the power of big data to benefit many aspects of our daily life, such as health, transportation, economy, and environment. Under the context of smart city, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), as a main building block of modern cities, and edge computing (EC), as an emerging computing service that targets addressing the limitations of cloud computing, have attracted increasing attention in the research community in recent years. It is well believed that the application of EC in ITS will have considerable benefits to transportation systems regarding efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Despite the growing trend in ITS and EC research, a big gap in the existing literature is identified: the intersection between these two promising directions has been far from well explored. In this paper, we focus on a critical part of ITS, i.e., sensing, and conducting a review on the recent advances in ITS sensing and EC applications in this field. The key challenges in ITS sensing and future directions with the integration of edge computing are discussed.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Tire mileage and wear provide important information for vehicle applications. There are more and more studies discussing intelligent tires, but few focus on the role of tire mileage and wear. The conventional tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) is one of the intelligent tire applications, but there has been no significant advancement in recent years in this regard. In order to increase the additional functions of intelligent tire applications, we propose a method that estimates the mileage and wear information of tires. The proposed method uses a three-axis sensor and a Hall sensor to implement the function. The proposed method also has a low power design to reduce the power consumption of the Hall sensor. The experimental results show the trend of tire wear status, rendering this method effective. This method also requires more accurate mileage information to support tire wear estimation. This experiment found that the correct rate of the proposed mileage estimation method is 99.4% and provides sufficient and correct mileage information for tire wear methods. If this method is used in autonomous vehicle applications, the autonomous control strategy algorithm has more conditions to plan the control strategy. The strategy system processes more meticulous control that increases the safety of autonomous vehicles.

AB  - In the context of hyper-connected cars and a growing heterogeneous digital ecosystem, we wish to make the most of the data available from the various sensors, devices and services that compose the ecosystem, in order to propose a proof of concept in-vehicle system that enhances the driving experience. We focus on improving the driving experience along three main directions, namely: (1) driving and trip planning, (2) health and well-being and (3) social and online activities. We approached the in-vehicle space as a smart interface to the intelligent driving environment. The digital data-producers in the ecosystem of the connected car are sources of raw data of various categories, such as data from the outside world, gathered from sensors or online services, data from the car itself and data from the driver gathered with various mobile and wearable devices, by means of observing his state and by means of his social media and online activity. Data is later processed into three information categories—driving, wellness, and social—and used to provide multi-modal interaction, namely visual, audio and gesture. The system is implemented to act in response to the trafficked information on different levels of autonomy, either in a reactive manner, by simple monitoring, or in a proactive manner. The system is designed to provide an in-vehicle system that assists the driver with planning the travel (Drive panel), by providing a comfortable environment for the driver while monitoring him (Wellness panel), and by adaptively managing interactions with their phone and the digital environment (Social panel). Heuristic evaluation of the system is performed, with respect to guidelines formulated for automated vehicles, and a SWOT analysis of the system is also presented in the paper.

AB  - This review describes a cloud-based intelligent power management system that uses analytics as a control signal and processes balance achievement pointer, and describes operator acknowledgments that must be shared quickly, accurately, and safely. The current study aims to introduce a conceptual and systematic structure with three main components: demand power (direct current (DC)-device), power mix between renewable energy (RE) and other power sources, and a cloud-based power optimization intelligent system. These methods and techniques monitor demand power (DC-device), load, and power mix between RE and other power sources. Cloud-based power optimization intelligent systems lead to an optimal power distribution solution that reduces power consumption or costs. Data has been collected from reliable sources such as Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed. The overall findings of these studies are visually explained in the proposed conceptual framework through the literature that are considered to be cloud computing based on storing and running the intelligent systems of power management and mixing.

AB  - Distance learning has assumed a relevant role in the educational scenario. The use of Virtual Learning Environments contributes to obtaining a substantial amount of educational data. In this sense, the analyzed data generate knowledge used by institutions to assist managers and professors in strategic planning and teaching. The discovery of students’ behaviors enables a wide variety of intelligent services for assisting in the learning process. This article presents a literature review in order to identify the intelligent services applied in distance learning. The research covers the period from January 2010 to May 2021. The initial search found 1316 articles, among which 51 were selected for further studies.

TI  - Carbon-Responsive Computing: Changing the Nexus between Energy and Computing

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - While extensive research has gone into demand response techniques in data centers, the energy consumed in edge computing systems and in network data transmission remains a significant part of the computing industry’s carbon footprint. The industry also has not fully leveraged the parallel trend of decentralized renewable energy generation, which creates new areas of opportunity for innovation in combined energy and computing systems. Through an interdisciplinary sociotechnical discussion of current energy, computer science and social studies of science and technology (STS) literature, we argue that a more comprehensive set of carbon response techniques needs to be developed that span the continuum of data centers, from the back-end cloud to the network edge. Such techniques need to address the combined needs of decentralized energy and computing systems, alongside the social power dynamics those combinations entail. We call this more comprehensive range “carbon-responsive computing,” and underscore that this continuum constitutes the beginnings of an interconnected infrastructure, elements of which are data-intensive and require the integration of social science disciplines to adequately address problems of inequality, governance, transparency, and definitions of “necessary” tasks in a climate crisis.

TI  - An Anthropocentric and Enhanced Predictive Approach to Smart City Management
T2  - Smart Cities

PY  - 2021
VL  - 4
IS  - 4
SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Cities are becoming increasingly complex to manage, as they increase in size and must provide higher living standards for their populations. New technology-based solutions must be developed towards attending this growth and ensuring that it is socially sustainable. This paper puts forward the notion that these solutions must share some properties: they should be anthropocentric, holistic, horizontal, multi-dimensional, multi-modal, and predictive. We propose an architecture in which streaming data sources that characterize the city context are used to feed a real-time graph of the city’s assets and states, as well as to train predictive models that hint into near future states of the city. This allows human decision-makers and automated services to take decisions, both for the present and for the future. To achieve this, multiple data sources about a city were gradually connected to a message broker, that enables increasingly rich decision-support. Results show that it is possible to predict future states of a city, in aspects such as traffic, air pollution, and other ambient variables. The key innovative aspect of this work is that, as opposed to the majority of existing approaches which focus on a real-time view of the city, we also provide insights into the near-future state of the city, thus allowing city services to plan ahead and adapt accordingly. The main goal is to optimize decision-making by anticipating future states of the city and make decisions accordingly.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Diverse forms of artificial intelligence (AI) are at the forefront of triggering digital security innovations based on the threats that are arising in this post-COVID world. On the one hand, companies are experiencing difficulty in dealing with security challenges with regard to a variety of issues ranging from system openness, decision making, quality control, and web domain, to mention a few. On the other hand, in the last decade, research has focused on security capabilities based on tools such as platform complacency, intelligent trees, modeling methods, and outage management systems in an effort to understand the interplay between AI and those issues. the dependence on the emergence of AI in running industries and shaping the education, transports, and health sectors is now well known in the literature. AI is increasingly employed in managing data security across economic sectors. Thus, a literature review of AI and system security within the current digital society is opportune. This paper aims at identifying research trends in the field through a systematic bibliometric literature review (LRSB) of research on AI and system security. the review entails 77 articles published in the Scopus® database, presenting up-to-date knowledge on the topic. the LRSB results were synthesized across current research subthemes. Findings are presented. the originality of the paper relies on its LRSB method, together with an extant review of articles that have not been categorized so far. Implications for future research are suggested.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 21
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) is playing a major role in smart cities to make a digital environment. Traffic congestion is a serious road issue because of an increasing number of vehicles in urban areas. Some crucial traffic problems include accidents and traffic jams that cause waste of fuel, health diseases, and a waste of time. Present traffic signaling systems are not efficient in resolving congestion problems because of the lack of traffic signals. Nowadays, traffic signaling systems are modeled with fixed time intervals in which no proper mechanism for emergency vehicles is available. Such traffic mechanisms failed to deal with traffic problems effectively. The major objective is to establish a robust traffic monitoring and signaling system that improves signal efficiency by providing a responsive scheme; appropriate routes; a mechanism for emergency vehicles and pedestrians in real-time using Vienna Development Method Specification Language (VDM-SL) formal method and graph theory. A formal model is constructed by considering objects, such as wireless sensors and cameras that are used for collecting information. Graph theory is used to represent the network and find appropriate routes. Unified Modeling Language is used to design the system requirements. The graph-based framework is converted into a formal model by using VDM-SL. The model has been validated and analyzed using many facilities available in the VDM-SL toolbox.

TI  - Intelligent Techniques for Detecting Network Attacks: Review and Research Directions

VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The significant growth in the use of the Internet and the rapid development of network technologies are associated with an increased risk of network attacks. Network attacks refer to all types of unauthorized access to a network including any attempts to damage and disrupt the network, often leading to serious consequences. Network attack detection is an active area of research in the community of cybersecurity. In the literature, there are various descriptions of network attack detection systems involving various intelligent-based techniques including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. However, although such techniques have proved useful within specific domains, no technique has proved useful in mitigating all kinds of network attacks. This is because some intelligent-based approaches lack essential capabilities that render them reliable systems that are able to confront different types of network attacks. This was the main motivation behind this research, which evaluates contemporary intelligent-based research directions to address the gap that still exists in the field. The main components of any intelligent-based system are the training datasets, the algorithms, and the evaluation metrics; these were the main benchmark criteria used to assess the intelligent-based systems included in this research article. This research provides a rich source of references for scholars seeking to determine their scope of research in this field. Furthermore, although the paper does present a set of suggestions about future inductive directions, it leaves the reader free to derive additional insights about how to develop intelligent-based systems to counter current and future network attacks.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021

IS  - 21
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Predicting the travel demand plays an indispensable role in urban transportation planning. Data collection methods for estimating the origin–destination (OD) demand matrix are being extensively shifted from traditional survey techniques to the pre-collected data from intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). This shift is partly due to the high cost of conducting traditional surveys and partly due to the diversity of scattered data produced by ITSs and the opportunity to derive extra benefits out of this big data. This study attempts to predict the OD matrix of Tehran metropolis using a set of ITS data, including the data extracted from automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, smart fare cards, loop detectors at intersections, global positioning systems (GPS) of navigation software, socio-economic and demographic characteristics as well as land-use features of zones. For this purpose, five models based on machine learning (ML) techniques are developed for training and test. In evaluating the performance of the models, the statistical methods show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to the best performance in terms of accuracy in predicting the OD matrix and has the lowest error in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Moreover, the predicted OD matrix was structurally compared with the ground truth matrix, and the CNN model also shows the highest structural similarity with the ground truth OD matrix in the presented case.

TI  - Semantic Fusion with Deep Learning and Formal Ontologies for Evaluation of Policies and Initiatives in the Smart City Domain

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Decision makers and policy analysts at different administrative levels often lack a holistic view of the problem as there are semantic variations in policy documents due to domain-specific content. For example, smart city initiatives are derived from national and international initiatives which may influence the incentives for local participants, but local initiatives reflect the local contextual elements of the city. Balanced assessment of smart city initiatives should include a systemic evaluation of the initiatives at multiple levels including the city, the country in which the city resides as well as at international level. In this paper, a knowledge elicitation methodology is presented for multi-granularity evaluation of policies and initiatives. The methodology is demonstrated on the evaluation of smart city initiatives generated at different administrative levels. Semantic networks are constructed using formal ontologies and deep learning methods for automatic semantic evaluation of initiatives to abstract knowledge found in text. Three smart city initiatives published by different administrative levels including international, national, and city level are evaluated in terms of relevance, coherence, and alignment of multi-level smart city initiatives. Experiments and analysis ultimately provide a holistic view of the problem which is necessary for decision makers and policy analysts of smart cities.

AB  - This article provides a critical study of a New European Bauhaus initiative in the context of transversality, relational nature and sustainability of construction, architecture and civil engineering. Social and environmental factors in this ecosystem of innovation are highlighted, as well as the perspectives of actors within it. The relationships between art, technology and science of historical Bauhaus are assessed. The investigation of transversality was carried out using a visual tool developed by the authors, CATI, considering sustainability as the backbone. The New European Bauhaus is a pool of innovation that is supported by governments, academia, industry, society and the (natural) environment. It aims at social, environmental and cultural sustainability and includes ideas of social transformation. It is necessary to absorb the impact and overwhelming cultural consequences of previous and current Industrial Revolutions, principally relying on cyber–physical systems to generate spaces and collective intelligence. The climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the need for new approaches, expanding the concept of smart cities to smart territories, taking into account participation in society and general inclusivity.

TI  - A User-Oriented Local Coastal Flooding Early Warning System Using Metamodelling Techniques
T2  - Journal of Marine Science and Engineering

PY  - 2021
VL  - 9
IS  - 11
SN  - 2077-1312

AB  - Given recent scientific advances, coastal flooding events can be properly modelled. Nevertheless, such models are computationally expensive (requiring many hours), which prevents their use for forecasting and warning. In addition, there is a gap between the model outputs and information actually needed by decision makers. The present work aims to develop and test a method capable of forecasting coastal flood information adapted to users’ needs. The method must be robust and fast and must integrate the complexity of coastal flood processes. The explored solution relies on metamodels, i.e., mathematical functions that precisely and efficiently (within minutes) estimate the results that would provide the numerical model. While the principle of relying on metamodel solutions is not new, the originality of the present work is to tackle and validate the entire process from the identification of user needs to the establishment and validation of the rapid forecast and early warning system (FEWS) while relying on numerical modelling, metamodelling, the development of indicators, and information technologies. The development and validation are performed at the study site of Gâvres (France). This site is subject to wave overtopping, so the numerical phase-resolving SWASH model is used to build the learning dataset required for the metamodel setup. Gaussian process- and random forest classifier-based metamodels are used and post-processed to estimate 14 indicators of interest for FEWS users. These metamodelling and post-processing schemes are implemented in an FEWS prototype, which is employed by local users and exhibits good warning skills during the validation period. Based on this experience, we provide recommendations for the improvement and/or application of this methodology and individual steps to other sites.

SN  - 2504-4990

AB  - The two-part series of papers provides a survey on recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an approach to simulate the human’s natural learning process, whose key is to let the agent learn by interacting with the stochastic environment. The fact that the agent has limited access to the information of the environment enables AI to be applied efficiently in most fields that require self-learning. It’s essential to have an organized investigation—we can make good comparisons and choose the best structures or algorithms when applying DRL in various applications. The first part of the overview introduces Markov Decision Processes (MDP) problems and Reinforcement Learning and applications of DRL for solving POMDP problems in games, robotics, and natural language processing. In part two, we continue to introduce applications in transportation, industries, communications and networking, etc. and discuss the limitations of DRL.

PY  - 2021

IS  - 4
SN  - 2571-9408

AB  - This article describes a Smart Heritage computational system that automatically produces a wide range of design proposals for new timber Gothic churches based on an intelligent interpretation of an architectural database of historic churches. The system enlists the software ‘Houdini’ and a digitally archived dataset of 19th Century timber Gothic churches. The cases presented here focus primarily on timber churches built in Wellington, New Zealand. Through a process of analysis and deconstruction of these historic churches into their characteristic architectural components, spatial organisation and geometric relationships, the system assembles them into novel designs based on high-level design parameters. This paper details this computational system, its development, its operation and its outputs. The role of the system that has been developed is two-fold. One is designing in an architectural heritage context, and one is as an aid to historical architectural investigations, or what can be called digital forensics. The particular outputs are automatically generated hybrid churches that capture the historical design values and complexities of Gothic inspired churches in New Zealand. However, the broader applications are as an investigative tool for historians, and as an objective generative tool for those involved in heritage reconstruction.

TI  - Atrous Convolutions and Residual GRU Based Architecture for Matching Power Demand with Supply
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 21
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Nowadays, for efficient energy management, local demand-supply matching in power grid is emerging research domain. However, energy demand is increasing day by day in many countries due to rapid growth of the population and most of their work being reliant on electronic devices. This problem has highlighted the significance of effectively matching power demand with supply for optimal energy management. To resolve this issue, we present an intelligent deep learning framework that integrates Atrous Convolutional Layers (ACL) with Residual Gated Recurrent Units (RGRU) to establish balance between the demand and supply. Moreover, it accurately predicts short-term energy and delivers a systematic method of communication between consumers and energy distributors as well. To cope with the varying nature of electricity data, first data acquisition step is performed where data are collected from various sources such as smart meters and solar plants. In the second step a pre-processing method is applied on raw data to normalize and clean the data. Next, the refined data are passed to ACL for spatial feature extraction. Finally, a sequential learning model RGRU is used that learns from complicated patterns for the final output. The proposed model obtains the smallest values of Mean Square Error (MSE) including 0.1753, 0.0001, 0.0177 over IHEPC, KCB, and Solar datasets, respectively, which manifests better performance as compared to existing approaches.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) networks have been integrated into industrial infrastructure schemes, positioning themselves as devices that communicate highly classified information for the most critical companies of world nations. Currently, and in order to look for alternatives to mitigate this risk, solutions based on Blockchain algorithms and Machine Learning techniques have been implemented separately with the aim of mitigating potential threats in IIoT networks. In this paper, we sought to integrate the previous solutions to create an integral protection mechanism for IoT device networks, which would allow the identification of threats, activate secure information transfer mechanisms, and it would be adapted to the computational capabilities of industrial IoT. The proposed solution achieved the proposed objectives and is presented as a viable mechanism for detecting and containing intruders in an IoT network. In some cases, it overcomes traditional detection mechanisms such as an IDS.

SN  - 2411-5134

AB  - Rivers close to populated or strategically important areas can cause damages and safety risks to people in the event of a flood. Traditional river flood monitoring systems like radar and ultrasonic sensors may not be completely reliable and require frequent on-site human interventions for calibration. This time-consuming and resource-intensive activity has attracted the attention of many researchers looking for highly reliable camera-based solutions. In this article we propose an automatic Computer Vision solution for river’s water-level monitoring, based on the processing of staff gauge images acquired by a V-IoT device. The solution is based on two modules. The first is implemented on the edge in order to avoid power consumption due to the transmission of poor quality frames, and another is implemented on the Cloud server, where the frames acquired and sent by the V-IoT device are processed for water level extraction. The proposed system was tested on sample images relating to more than a year of acquisitions at a river site. The first module of the proposed solution achieved excellent performances in discerning bad quality frames from good quality ones. The second module achieved very good results too, especially for what it concerns night frames.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Plant diseases pose a severe threat to crop yield. This necessitates the rapid identification of diseases affecting various crops using modern technologies. Many researchers have developed solutions to the problem of identifying plant diseases, but it is still considered a critical issue due to the lack of infrastructure in many parts of the world. This paper focuses on detecting and classifying diseases present in the leaf images by adopting a hybrid learning model. The proposed hybrid model uses k-means clustering for detecting the disease area from the leaf and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying the type of disease based on comparison between sampled and testing images. The images of leaves under consideration may be symmetrical or asymmetrical in shape. In the proposed methodology, the images of various leaves from diseased plants were first pre-processed to filter out the noise present to get an enhanced image. This improved image enabled detection of minute disease-affected regions. The infected areas were then segmented using k-means clustering algorithm that locates only the infected (diseased) areas by masking the leaves’ green (healthy) regions. The grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) methodology was used to fetch the necessary features from the affected portions. Since the number of fetched features was insufficient, more synthesized features were included, which were then given as input to CNN for training. Finally, the proposed hybrid model was trained and tested using the leaf disease dataset available in the UCI machine learning repository to examine the characteristics between trained and tested images. The hybrid model proposed in this paper can detect and classify different types of diseases affecting different plants with a mean classification accuracy of 92.6%. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed hybrid model, a comparison was made against the following classification approaches viz., support vector machine, extreme learning machine-based classification, and CNN. The proposed hybrid model was found to be more effective than the other three.

AB  - The advancement of sensing technologies coupled with the rapid progress in big data analysis has ushered in a new era in intelligent transport and smart city applications. In this context, transportation mode detection (TMD) of mobile users is a field that has gained significant traction in recent years. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach for transportation mode detection using multimodal sensor data elicited from user smartphones. The approach is based on long short-term Memory networks and Bayesian optimization of their parameters. We conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed approach, which attains very high recognition rates, against a multitude of machine learning approaches, including state-of-the-art methods. We also discuss issues regarding feature correlation and the impact of dimensionality reduction.

AB  - Empowered by the emergence of novel information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as sensors and high-performance digital communication systems, Europe has adapted its electricity distribution network into a modern infrastructure known as a smart grid (SG). The benefits of this new infrastructure include precise and real-time capacity for measuring and monitoring the different energy-relevant parameters on the various points of the grid and for the remote operation and optimization of distribution. Furthermore, a new user profile is derived from this novel infrastructure, known as a prosumer (a user that can produce and consume energy to/from the grid), who can benefit from the features derived from applying advanced analytics and semantic technologies in the rich amount of big data generated by the different subsystems. However, this novel, highly interconnected infrastructure also presents some significant drawbacks, like those related to information security (IS). We provide a systematic literature survey of the ICT-empowered environments that comprise SGs and homes, and the application of modern artificial intelligence (AI) related technologies with sensor fusion systems and actuators, ensuring energy efficiency in such systems. Furthermore, we outline the current challenges and outlook for this field. These address new developments on microgrids, and data-driven energy efficiency that leads to better knowledge representation and decision-making for smart homes and SGs.

AB  - Physical activity contributes to the maintenance of health conditions and functioning. However, the percentage of older adults who comply with the recommendations for physical activity levels is low when compared to the same percentages on younger groups. The SmartWalk system aims to encourage older adults to perform physical activity (i.e., walking in the city), which is monitored and adjusted by healthcare providers for best results. The study reported in this article focused on the implementation of SmartWalk security services to keep personal data safe during communications and while at rest, which were validated considering a comprehensive use case. The security framework offers various mechanisms, including an authentication system that was designed to complement the pairs of usernames and passwords with trusted execution environments and token-based features, authorization with different access levels, symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography, critical transactions review, and logging supported by blockchain technology. The resulting implementation contributes for a common understanding of the security features of trustful smart cities’ applications, which conforms with existing legislation and regulations.

AB  - Air pollution has become the most important issue concerning human evolution in the last century, as the levels of toxic gases and particles present in the air create health problems and affect the ecosystems of the planet. Scientists and environmental organizations have been looking for new ways to combat and control the air pollution, developing new solutions as technologies evolves. In the last decade, devices able to observe and maintain pollution levels have become more accessible and less expensive, and with the appearance of the Internet of Things (IoT), new approaches for combating pollution were born. The focus of the research presented in this paper was predicting behaviours regarding the air quality index using machine learning. Data were collected from one of the six atmospheric stations set in relevant areas of Bucharest, Romania, to validate our model. Several algorithms were proposed to study the evolution of temperature depending on the level of pollution and on several pollution factors. In the end, the results generated by the algorithms are presented considering the types of pollutants for two distinct periods. Prediction errors were highlighted by the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for each of the three machine learning algorithms used.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 21
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Due to the limitations of data transfer technologies, existing studies on urban traffic control mainly focused on isolated dimension control such as traffic signal control or vehicle route guidance to alleviate traffic congestion. However, in real traffic, the distribution of traffic flow is the result of multiple dimensions whose future state is influenced by each dimension’s decisions. Presently, the development of the Internet of Vehicles enables an integrated intelligent transportation system. This paper proposes an integrated intelligent transportation model that can optimize predictive traffic signal control and predictive vehicle route guidance simultaneously to alleviate traffic congestion based on their feedback regulation relationship. The challenges of this model lie in that the formulation of the nonlinear feedback relationship between various dimensions is hard to describe and the design of a corresponding solving algorithm that can obtain Pareto optimality for multi-dimension control is complex. In the integrated model, we introduce two medium variables—predictive traffic flow and the predictive waiting time—to two-way link the traffic signal control and vehicle route guidance. Inspired by game theory, an asymmetric information exchange framework-based updating distributed algorithm is designed to solve the integrated model. Finally, an experimental study in two typical traffic scenarios shows that more than 73.33% of the considered cases adopting the integrated model achieve Pareto optimality.

AB  - The contemporary innovations in financial technology (fintech) serve society with an environmentally friendly atmosphere. Fintech covers an enormous range of activities from data security to financial service deliverables that enable the companies to automate their existing business structure and introduce innovative products and services. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for scholars and professionals to identify the future trends and directions of the topic. This is why the present study conducted a bibliometric analysis in social, environmental, and computer sciences fields to analyse the implementation of environment-friendly computer applications to benefit societal growth and well-being. We have used the ‘bibliometrix 3.0’ package of the r-program to analyse the core aspects of fintech systematically. The study suggests that ‘ACM International Conference Proceedings’ is the core source of published fintech literature. China leads in both multiple and single country production of fintech publications. Bina Nusantara University is the most relevant affiliation. Arner and Buckley provide impactful fintech literature. In the conceptual framework, we analyse relationships between different topics of fintech and address dynamic research streams and themes. These research streams and themes highlight the future directions and core topics of fintech. The study deploys a co-occurrence network to differentiate the entire fintech literature into three research streams. These research streams are related to ‘cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, financial technology’, ‘financial industry stability, service, innovation, regulatory technology (regtech)’, and ‘machine learning and deep learning innovations’. The study deploys a thematic map to identify basic, emerging, dropping, isolated, and motor themes based on centrality and density. These various themes and streams are designed to lead the researchers, academicians, policymakers, and practitioners to narrow, distinctive, and significant topics.

AB  - Monitoring the progress on a construction site during the construction phase is crucial. An inadequate understanding of the project status can lead to mistakes and inappropriate actions, causing delays and increased costs. Monitoring and controlling projects via digital tools would reduce the risk of error and enable timely corrective actions. Although there is currently a wide range of technologies for these purposes, these technologies and interoperability between them are still limited. Because of this, it is important to know the possibilities of integration and interoperability regarding their implementation. This article presents a bibliographic synthesis and interpretation of 30 nonconventional digital tools for monitoring progress in terms of field data capture technologies (FDCT) and communication and collaborative technologies (CT) that are responsible for information processing and management. This research aims to perform an integration and interoperability analysis of technologies to demonstrate their potential for monitoring and controlling construction projects during the execution phase. A network analysis was conducted, and the results suggest that the triad formed by building information modeling (BIM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and photogrammetry is an effective tool; the use of this set extends not only to monitoring and control, but also to all phases of a project.

SN  - 2411-9660

AB  - The elderly are the most predicted users for smart home technology in the United Arab Emirates and the population over 65 is expected to increase to 24.3% by 2030. Despite the rapid development of smart home technology, research has been mainly focused on technology development. To encourage conservative elderly users, however, smart home technology should be implemented for UAE elderly users to accept and integrate it into their daily lives. The objective of this paper is to analyze the preferences and needs of smart home technologies to understand the behaviors of UAE elderly users, and the factors affecting the acceptance of technology. As a methodology, a survey and interview were conducted for 110 people in their 40s and 60s and a total of 105 valid survey responses were collected and used as data for frequency, mean, cross-analysis, independent sample t-test, one-way variance analysis, and multiple regression analysis with IBM SPSS statistics 27. The results showed that 67.0% of UAE elderly users have chronic diseases such as high blood pressure (16.2%), heart disease (3.8%), diabetes (32.4%), or arthritis (10.5%). Therefore, smart home technology for health management is inevitable to improve overall lifestyles. It was statistically proven that UAE elderly users want automatic fall detection in the living room (39.0%) and bedroom (25.7%). Lifestyle monitoring in living room (44.7%) and bedroom (18.1%); the elderly preferred living room most for daily life assistance (36.2%), environmental control (50.5%), health and biometric monitoring (49.5%), and video conferencing (82.9%). In the case of sensors, elderly preferred the switch at the entrance (36.2%), and motion detecting sensors (42.9%), video cameras (56.2%), and voice recognition (50.5%) sensors in the living room. However, UAE elderly users do not think smart home technology can protect their privacy. It is found that age group and computer technology affinity are the most influential variables and UAE elderly users have an anxiety about technology, which influenced the acceptance of smart home technology.

AB  - There is a tendency, during the last years, to migrate from the traditional homogeneous clouds and centralized provisioning of resources to heterogeneous clouds with specialized hardware governed in a distributed and autonomous manner. The CloudLightning architecture proposed recently introduced a dynamic way to provision heterogeneous cloud resources, by shifting the selection of underlying resources from the end-user to the system in an efficient way. In this work, an optimized Suitability Index and assessment function are proposed, along with their theoretical analysis, for improving the computational efficiency, energy consumption, service delivery and scalability of the distributed orchestration. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is being evaluated with the use of simulation, by comparing the optimized methods with the original approach and the traditional centralized resource management, on real and synthetic High Performance Computing applications. Finally, numerical results are presented and discussed regarding the improvements over the defined evaluation criteria.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Presently, due to the establishment of a sensor network, residual buildings in urban areas are being converted into smart buildings. Many sensors are deployed in various buildings to perform different functions, such as water quality monitoring and temperature monitoring. However, the major concern faced in smart building Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is energy depletion and security threats. Many researchers have attempted to solve these issues by various authors in different applications of WSNs. However, limited research has been conducted on smart buildings. Thus, the present research is focused on designing an energy-efficient and secure routing protocol for smart building WSNs. The process in the proposed framework is carried out in two stages. The first stage is the design of the optimal routing protocol based on the grid-clustering approach. In the grid-based model, a grid organizer was selected based on the sailfish optimization algorithm. Subsequently, a fuzzy expert system is used to select the relay node to reach the shortest path for data transmission. The second stage involves designing a trust model for secure data transmission using the two-fish algorithm. A simulation study of the proposed framework was conducted to evaluate its performance. Some metrics, such as the packet delivery ratio, end-end delay, and average residual energy, were calculated for the proposed model. The average residual energy for the proposed framework was 96%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed routing design.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is the main driving force behind smart manufacturing, industrial automation, and industry 4.0. Conversely, industrial IoT as the evolving technological paradigm is also becoming a compelling target for cyber adversaries. Particularly, advanced persistent threats (APT) and especially botnets are the foremost promising and potential attacks that may throw the complete industrial IoT network into chaos. IIoT-enabled botnets are highly scalable, technologically diverse, and highly resilient to classical and conventional detection mechanisms. Subsequently, we propose a deep learning (DL)-enabled novel hybrid architecture that can efficiently and timely tackle distributed, multivariant, lethal botnet attacks in industrial IoT. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated on a current state-of-the-art, publicly available dataset using standard performance evaluation metrics. Moreover, our proposed technique has been precisely verified with our constructed hybrid DL-enabled architectures and current benchmark DL algorithms. Our devised mechanism shows promising results in terms of high detection accuracy with a trivial trade-off in speed efficiency, assuring the proposed scheme as an optimal and legitimate cyber defense in prevalent IIoTs. Besides, we have cross-validated our results to show utterly unbiased performance.

AB  - Big Data, the Internet of Things, and robotic and augmented realities are just some of the technologies that belong to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions and increase productivity and the quality of industry production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. A new perspective is oriented towards social well-being and it is called Society 5.0. Industry 4.0 supports the transition to the new society, but other drivers are also needed. To guide the transition, it is necessary to identify the enabling factors that integrate Industry 4.0. A conceptual framework was developed in which these factors were identified through a literature review and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. Furthermore, the way in which they relate was evaluated with the help of the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology. The proposed framework fills a research gap, which has not yet consolidated a strategy that includes all aspects of Society 5.0. As a result, the main driver, in addition to technology, is international politics.

AB  - Many people living in urban environments nowadays are overexposed to noise, which results in adverse effects on their health. Thus, urban sound monitoring has emerged as a powerful tool that might enable public administrations to automatically identify and quantify noise pollution. Therefore, identifying multiple and simultaneous acoustic sources in these environments in a reliable and cost-effective way has emerged as a hot research topic. The purpose of this paper is to propose a two-stage classifier able to identify, in real time, a set of up to 21 urban acoustic events that may occur simultaneously (i.e., multilabel), taking advantage of physical redundancy in acoustic sensors from a wireless acoustic sensors network. The first stage of the proposed system consists of a multilabel deep neural network that makes a classification for each 4-s window. The second stage intelligently aggregates the classification results from the first stage of four neighboring nodes to determine the final classification result. Conducted experiments with real-world data and up to three different computing devices show that the system is able to provide classification results in less than 1 s and that it has good performance when classifying the most common events from the dataset. The results of this research may help civic organisations to obtain actionable noise monitoring information from automatic systems.

AB  - As an integral part of the electromagnetic system, antennas are becoming more advanced and versatile than ever before, thus making it necessary to adopt new techniques to enhance their performance. Machine Learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence, is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building with minimal human intervention. The potential for ML to solve unpredictable and non-linear complex challenges is attracting researchers in the field of electromagnetics (EM), especially in antenna and antenna-based systems. Numerous antenna simulations, synthesis, and pattern recognition of radiations as well as non-linear inverse scattering-based object identifications are now leveraging ML techniques. Although the accuracy of ML algorithms depends on the availability of sufficient data and expert handling of the model and hyperparameters, it is gradually becoming the desired solution when researchers are aiming for a cost-effective solution without excessive time consumption. In this context, this paper aims to present an overview of machine learning, and its applications in Electromagnetics, including communication, radar, and sensing. It extensively discusses recent research progress in the development and use of intelligent algorithms for antenna design, synthesis and analysis, electromagnetic inverse scattering, synthetic aperture radar target recognition, and fault detection systems. It also provides limitations of this emerging field of study. The unique aspect of this work is that it surveys the state-of the art and recent advances in ML techniques as applied to EM.

AB  - Individuals suffering from visual impairments and blindness encounter difficulties in moving independently and overcoming various problems in their routine lives. As a solution, artificial intelligence and computer vision approaches facilitate blind and visually impaired (BVI) people in fulfilling their primary activities without much dependency on other people. Smart glasses are a potential assistive technology for BVI people to aid in individual travel and provide social comfort and safety. However, practically, the BVI are unable move alone, particularly in dark scenes and at night. In this study we propose a smart glass system for BVI people, employing computer vision techniques and deep learning models, audio feedback, and tactile graphics to facilitate independent movement in a night-time environment. The system is divided into four models: a low-light image enhancement model, an object recognition and audio feedback model, a salient object detection model, and a text-to-speech and tactile graphics generation model. Thus, this system was developed to assist in the following manner: (1) enhancing the contrast of images under low-light conditions employing a two-branch exposure-fusion network; (2) guiding users with audio feedback using a transformer encoder–decoder object detection model that can recognize 133 categories of sound, such as people, animals, cars, etc., and (3) accessing visual information using salient object extraction, text recognition, and refreshable tactile display. We evaluated the performance of the system and achieved competitive performance on the challenging Low-Light and ExDark datasets.

AB  - Smart seaside cities can fully exploit the capabilities brought by Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of city services in traditional smart city applications: smart home, smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart surveillance, smart environment, cyber security, etc. However, smart coastal cities are characterized by their specific application domain, namely, beach monitoring. Beach attendance prediction is a beach monitoring application of particular importance for coastal managers to successfully plan beach services in terms of security, rescue, health and environmental assistance. In this paper, an experimental study that uses IoT data and deep learning to predict the number of beach visitors at Castelldefels beach (Barcelona, Spain) was developed. Images of Castelldefels beach were captured by a video monitoring system. An image recognition software was used to estimate beach attendance. A deep learning algorithm (deep neural network) to predict beach attendance was developed. The experimental results prove the feasibility of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for beach attendance prediction. For each beach, a classification of occupancy was estimated, depending on the number of beach visitors. The proposed model outperforms other machine learning models (decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest) and can successfully classify seven beach occupancy levels with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of 0.03, 92.7%, 92.9%, 92.7%, and 92.7%, respectively.

AB  - Forests play a fundamental role in preserving the environment and fighting global warming. Unfortunately, they are continuously reduced by human interventions such as deforestation, fires, etc. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework for automatically detecting illegal tree-cutting activity in forests through audio event classification. We envisage ultra-low-power tiny devices, embedding edge-computing microcontrollers and long-range wireless communication to cover vast areas in the forest. To reduce the energy footprint and resource consumption for effective and pervasive detection of illegal tree cutting, an efficient and accurate audio classification solution based on convolutional neural networks is proposed, designed specifically for resource-constrained wireless edge devices. With respect to previous works, the proposed system allows for recognizing a wider range of threats related to deforestation through a distributed and pervasive edge-computing technique. Different pre-processing techniques have been evaluated, focusing on a trade-off between classification accuracy with respect to computational resources, memory, and energy footprint. Furthermore, experimental long-range communication tests have been conducted in real environments. Data obtained from the experimental results show that the proposed solution can detect and notify tree-cutting events for efficient and cost-effective forest monitoring through smart IoT, with an accuracy of 85%.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - With the widespread use of surveillance image cameras and enhanced awareness of public security, objects, and persons Re-Identification (ReID), the task of recognizing objects in non-overlapping camera networks has attracted particular attention in computer vision and pattern recognition communities. Given an image or video of an object-of-interest (query), object identification aims to identify the object from images or video feed taken from different cameras. After many years of great effort, object ReID remains a notably challenging task. The main reason is that an object’s appearance may dramatically change across camera views due to significant variations in illumination, poses or viewpoints, or even cluttered backgrounds. With the advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), there have been many proposals for different network architectures achieving high-performance levels. With the aim of identifying the most promising methods for ReID for future robust implementations, a review study is presented, mainly focusing on the person and multi-object ReID and auxiliary methods for image enhancement. Such methods are crucial for robust object ReID, while highlighting limitations of the identified methods. This is a very active field, evidenced by the dates of the publications found. However, most works use data from very different datasets and genres, which presents an obstacle to wide generalized DNN model training and usage. Although the model’s performance has achieved satisfactory results on particular datasets, a particular trend was observed in the use of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), attention mechanisms to capture object-relevant features, and generative adversarial training to overcome data limitations. However, there is still room for improvement, namely in using images from urban scenarios among anonymized images to comply with public privacy legislation. The main challenges that remain in the ReID field, and prospects for future research directions towards ReID in dense urban scenarios, are also discussed.

AB  - Mining enterprises are widely introducing digital technologies and automation is one of such tools. Granularity monitoring, namely, the size determination of rock mass pieces is a common operational component of the processes that extract minerals by open-pit mining. The article proposes an approach that, in addition to the lump size distribution, makes it possible to estimate the lump form distribution as well. To investigate the effectiveness of monitoring the form of blasted rock mass lumps, the authors conducted experiments in four stages related to the rock condition. They include geological occurrence, explosive crushing, trommelling, and mill crushing. The relationship between these stages is presented and the change in the lumps fragment form is traced. The present article proposes an informational and analytical model of the processes at mining enterprises, extracting minerals by open-pit mining, as well as an algorithm for determining the lumps form and obtaining their distribution in the rock mass.

TI  - Evaluation of Total Nitrogen in Water via Airborne Hyperspectral Data: Potential of Fractional Order Discretization Algorithm and Discrete Wavelet Transform Analysis

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Controlling and managing surface source pollution depends on the rapid monitoring of total nitrogen in water. However, the complex factors affecting water quality (plant shading and suspended matter in water) make direct estimation extremely challenging. Considering the spectral response mechanisms of emergent plants, we coupled discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and fractional order discretization (FOD) techniques with three machine learning models (random forest (RF), bagging algorithm (bagging), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) to mine this potential spectral information. A total of 567 models were developed, and airborne hyperspectral data processed with various DWT scales and FOD techniques were compared. The effective information in the hyperspectral reflectance data were better emphasized after DWT processing. After DWT processing the original spectrum (OR), its sensitivity to TN in water was maximally improved by 0.22, and the correlation between FOD and TN in water was optimally increased by 0.57. The transformed spectral information enhanced the TN model accuracy, especially for FOD after DWT. For RF, 82% of the model R2 values improved by 0.02~0.72 compared to the model using FOD spectra; 78.8% of the bagging values improved by 0.01~0.53 and 65.0% of the XGBoost values improved by 0.01~0.64. The XGBoost model with DWT coupled with grey relation analysis (GRA) yielded the best estimation accuracy, with the highest precision of R2 = 0.91 for L6. In conclusion, appropriately scaled DWT analysis can substantially improve the accuracy of extracting TN from UAV hyperspectral images. These outcomes may facilitate the further development of accurate water quality monitoring in sophisticated global waters from drone or satellite hyperspectral data.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 11
SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - RGB–IR cross modality person re-identification (RGB–IR Re-ID) is an important task for video surveillance in poorly illuminated or dark environments. In addition to the common challenge of Re-ID, the large cross-modality variations between RGB and IR images must be considered. The existing RGB–IR Re-ID methods use different network structures to learn the global shared features associated with multi-modalities. However, most global shared feature learning methods are sensitive to background clutter, and contextual feature relationships are not considered among the mined features. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a dual-path attention network architecture MFCNet. SGA (Spatial-Global Attention) module embedded in MFCNet includes spatial attention and global attention branches to mine discriminative features. First, the SGA module proposed in this paper focuses on the key parts of the input image to obtain robust features. Next, the module mines the contextual relationships among features to obtain discriminative features and improve network performance. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of the network architecture proposed in this paper is better than that of state-of-the-art methods under various settings. In the all-search mode of the SYSU and RegDB data sets, the rank-1 accuracy reaches 51.64% and 69.76%, respectively.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Wireless sensor networks are used to monitor the operating status of the microgrids, which can effectively improve the stability of power supplies. The topology control is a critical issue of wireless sensor networks, which affects monitoring data transmission reliability and lifetime of wireless sensor networks. Meanwhile, the data acquisition accuracy of wireless sensor networks has a great impact on the quality of monitoring. Therefore, this paper focuses on improving wireless sensor networks data acquisition satisfaction and energy efficiency. A joint acquisition time design and sensor association optimization algorithm is proposed to prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks and enhance the stability of monitoring, which considers the cluster heads selection, data collection satisfaction and sensor association. First, a multi-constrained mixed-integer programming problem, which combines acquisition time design and sensor association, is formulated to maximize data acquisition satisfaction and minimize energy consumption. To solve this problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent technology. In each iteration, the acquisition time is obtained by Lagrangian duality. After that, the sensor association is modeled as a 0–1 knapsack problem, and the three different methods are proposed to solve it. Finally, the simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm proposed in this paper.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Available digital maps of indoor environments are limited to a description of the geometrical environment, despite there being an urgent need for more accurate information, particularly data about the electromagnetic (EM) properties of the materials used for walls. Such data would enable new possibilities in the design and optimization of wireless networks and the development of new radio services. In this paper, we introduce, formalize, and evaluate a framework for machine learning (ML) based wireless sensing of indoor surface materials in the form of EM properties. We apply the radio-environment (RE) signatures of the wireless link, which inherently contains environmental information due to the interaction of the radio waves with the environment. We specify the content of the RE signature suitable for surface-material classification as a set of multipath components given by the received power, delay, phase shift, and angle of arrival. The proposed framework applies an ML approach to construct a classification model using RE signatures labeled with the environmental information. The ML method exploits the data obtained from measurements or simulations. The performance of the framework in different scenarios is evaluated based on standard ML performance metrics, such as classification accuracy and F-score. The results of the elementary case prove that the proposed approach can be applied for the classification of the surface material for a plain environment, and can be further extended for the classification of wall materials in more complex indoor environments.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Recently, 5G networks have emerged as a new technology that can control the advancement of telecommunication networks and transportation systems. Furthermore, 5G networks provide better network performance while reducing network traffic and complexity compared to current networks. Machine-learning techniques (ML) will help symmetric IoT applications become a significant new data source in the future. Symmetry is a widely studied pattern in various research areas, especially in wireless network traffic. The study of symmetric and asymmetric faults and outliers (anomalies) in network traffic is an important topic. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) is an advanced approach in challenging wireless networks such as network management and optimization, anomaly detection, predictive analysis, lifetime value prediction, etc. However, its performance depends on the efficiency of training samples. DL is designed to work with large datasets and uses complex algorithms to train the model. The occurrence of outliers in the raw data reduces the reliability of the training models. In this paper, the performance of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) traffic was estimated using the DL algorithm. A set of robust statistical estimators, called M-estimators, have been proposed as robust loss functions as an alternative to the traditional MSE loss function, to improve the training process and robustize DL in the presence of outliers. We demonstrate their robustness in the presence of outliers on V2X traffic datasets.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The world’s energy consumption is outpacing supply due to population growth and technological advancements. For future energy demands, it is critical to progress toward a dependable, cost-effective, and sustainable renewable energy source. Solar energy, along with all other alternative energy sources, is a potential renewable resource to manage these enduring challenges in the energy crisis. Solar power generation is expanding globally as a result of growing energy demands and depleting fossil fuel reserves, which are presently the primary sources of power generation. In the realm of solar power generation, photovoltaic (PV) panels are used to convert solar radiation into energy. They are subjected to the constantly changing state of the environment, resulting in a wide range of defects. These defects should be discovered and remedied as soon as possible so that PV panels efficiency, endurance, and durability are not compromised. This paper focuses on five aspects, namely, (i) the various possible faults that occur in PV panels, (ii) the online/remote supervision of PV panels, (iii) the role of machine learning techniques in the fault diagnosis of PV panels, (iv) the various sensors used for different fault detections in PV panels, and (v) the benefits of fault identification in PV panels. Based on the investigated studies, recommendations for future research directions are suggested.

AB  - In this study, we explored the relationship between objective and subjective measures for usability evaluation in in-vehicle infotainment systems (IVISs). As a case study, four displays were evaluated based on cluster location and display orientation (that is, front–horizontal, front–vertical, right–horizontal, and right–vertical). Thirty-six participants performed tasks to manipulate the functions of the IVISs and data were collected through an electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor and questionnaire items. We analysed a model that estimated EEG-based objective indicators from subjective indicators. As a result, the objective indicators reflected the subjective indicators and were considered to explain the driver’s cognitive state. Although EEG data were collected from only four participants, this study proposed an experimental design that could be applied to the analysis of the relationship between the subject’s evaluation and EEG signals, as a preliminary study. We expect the experimental design and results of this study to be useful in analysing objective and subjective measures of usability evaluation.

AB  - We investigated the scientific research dissemination by analyzing the publications and citation data, implying that not all citations are significantly important. Therefore, as alluded to existing state-of-the-art models that employ feature-based techniques to measure the scholarly research dissemination between multiple entities, our model implements the convolutional neural network (CNN) with fastText-based pre-trained embedding vectors, utilizes only the citation context as its input to distinguish between important and non-important citations. Moreover, we speculate using focal-loss and class weight methods to address the inherited class imbalance problems in citation classification datasets. Using a dataset of 10 K annotated citation contexts, we achieved an accuracy of 90.7% along with a 90.6% f1-score, in the case of binary classification. Finally, we present a case study to measure the comprehensiveness of our deployed model on a dataset of 3100 K citations taken from the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus. We employed state-of-the-art graph visualization open-source tool Gephi to analyze the various aspects of citation network graphs, for each respective citation behavior.

AB  - With the rapid growth and development of cities, Intelligent Traffic Management and Control (ITMC) is becoming a fundamental component to address the challenges of modern urban traffic management, where a wide range of daily problems need to be addressed in a prompt and expedited manner. Issues such as unpredictable traffic dynamics, resource constraints, and abnormal events pose difficulties to city managers. ITMC aims to increase the efficiency of traffic management by minimizing the odds of traffic problems, by providing real-time traffic state forecasts to better schedule the intersection signal controls. Reliable implementations of ITMC improve the safety of inhabitants and the quality of life, leading to economic growth. In recent years, researchers have proposed different solutions to address specific problems concerning traffic management, ranging from image-processing and deep-learning techniques to forecasting the traffic state and deriving policies to control intersection signals. This review article studies the primary public datasets helpful in developing models to address the identified problems, complemented with a deep analysis of the works related to traffic state forecast and intersection-signal-control models. Our analysis found that deep-learning-based approaches for short-term traffic state forecast and multi-intersection signal control showed reasonable results, but lacked robustness for unusual scenarios, particularly during oversaturated situations, which can be resolved by explicitly addressing these cases, potentially leading to significant improvements of the systems overall. However, there is arguably a long path until these models can be used safely and effectively in real-world scenarios.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - A reverse vending machine motivates citizens to bring recyclable waste by rewarding them, which is a viable solution to increase the recycling rate. Reverse vending machines generally use near-infrared sensors, barcode sensors, or cameras to classify recycling resources. However, sensor-based reverse vending machines suffer from a high configuration cost and the limited scope of target objects, and conventional single image-based reverse vending machines usually make erroneous predictions about intentional fraud objects. This paper proposes a dual image-based convolutional neural network ensemble model to address these problems. For this purpose, we first created a prototype reverse vending machine and constructed an image dataset containing two cross-sections of objects, top and front view. Then, we chose convolutional neural network models widely used in image classification as the candidates for building an accurate and lightweight ensemble model. Considering the size and classification performance of candidates, we constructed the best-fit ensemble combination and evaluated its classification performance. The final ensemble model showed a classification accuracy higher than 95% for all target classes, including fraud objects. This result proves that our approach achieves better robustness against intentional fraud objects than single image-based models and thus can broaden the scope for target resources. The measurement results on lightweight embedded platforms also demonstrated that our model provides a short inference time that is enough to facilitate the real-time execution of reverse vending machines based on low-cost edge artificial intelligence devices.

AB  - A method of detecting and counting road vehicles using an acoustic sensor placed by the road is presented. The sensor measures sound intensity in two directions: parallel and perpendicular to the road. The sound intensity analysis performs acoustic event detection. A normalized position of the sound source is tracked and used to determine if the detected event is related to a moving vehicle and to establish the direction of movement. The algorithm was tested on a continuous 24-h recording made in real-world conditions. The overall results were: recall 0.95, precision 0.95, F-score 0.95. In the analysis of one-hour slots, the worst results obtained in dense traffic were: recall 0.9, precision 0.93, F-score 0.91. The proposed method is intended for application in a network of traffic monitoring sensors, such as a smart city system. Its advantages include using a small, low cost and passive sensor, low algorithm complexity, and satisfactory detection accuracy.

AB  - Urban parks are important recreational spaces of environmental interest for citizens and city visitors. Targeted and attractive promotion of these areas can help develop alternative forms of &ldquo;green tourism&rdquo; and increase environmental awareness among citizens, which is particularly important and vital for the future of the planet. New technologies are a key tool for improving the experience of touring urban parks, as they can make the tour much more attractive by highlighting interesting information about the flora and fauna of the park, as well as various other points of interest. This paper presents an integrated system based on augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and data analytics methodologies, comprising both mobile and web applications, focusing on urban parks touring and management, respectively. Through the mobile app for the park visitors, an attractive, interactive touring environment is created which highlights the environmental and historical interest of those areas. At the same time, the web applications for the park managers receive and analyze visitor data to help improve the visitor experience and the overall quality of the park. Finally, the developed integrated system is evaluated to ensure that it meets all user requirements and that its usability and functional components satisfy both groups of potential users, i.e., park visitors and park managers.

AB  - The digital twin is currently recognized as a key technology allowing the digital representation of a real-world system. In smart manufacturing, the digital twin enables the management and analysis of physical and digital processes, products, and people in order to foster the sustainability of their lifecycles. Although past research addressed this topic, fragmented studies, a lack of a holistic view, and a lack of in-depth knowledge about digital twin concepts and structures are still evident in the domain of the shop floor digital twin. Manufacturing companies need an integrated reference framework that fits the main components of both physical and digital space. On the basis of a systematic literature review, this research aims to investigate the characteristics of the digital twin for shop floor purposes in the context of smart manufacturing. The &ldquo;hexadimensional shop floor digital twin&rdquo; (HexaSFDT) is proposed as a comprehensive framework that integrates all the main components and describes their relationships. In this way, manufacturing organizations can rely on an inclusive framework for supporting their journey in understanding the shop floor digital twin from a methodological and technological viewpoint. Furthermore, the research strengthens the reference literature by collecting and integrating relevant contributions in a unique framework.

Many unsupervised methods were proposed, but previous works have confirmed that the classification-based models far exceeds the unsupervised models in ASD. In this paper, we adopt two classification-based anomaly detection models: (1) Outlier classifier is to distinguish anomalous sounds or outliers from the normal; (2) ID classifier identifies anomalies using both the confidence of classification and the similarity of hidden embeddings. We conduct experiments in task 2 of DCASE 2020 challenge, and our ensemble method achieves an averaged area under the curve (AUC) of 95.82% and averaged partial AUC (pAUC) of 92.32%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

AB  - The concept of Healthy Cities, introduced by the World Health Organization, demonstrates the value of health for the whole urban system. As one of the most important components of urban systems, transportation plays an important role in Healthy Cities. Many transportation evaluation systems focus on factors such as road networks, parking spaces, transportation speed, accessibility, convenience, and commuting time, while the vulnerability and resilience of urban transportation are rarely evaluated. This study presents the preliminary progress in the evaluation of traffic vulnerability and resilience during precipitation events in 39 Chinese cities. Traffic congestion index data, derived from the Baidu Map Smart Transportation Platform, and rainfall data, derived from NASA&rsquo;s global precipitation measurement, are utilized. Traffic vulnerability index, traffic resilience index, and the corresponding quantitative methods are proposed, and the analysis results are presented. This study is of value in improving the understanding of urban traffic vulnerability and resilience, and in enabling the quantitative evaluation of them in urban health assessment and the Healthy Cities program.

AB  - Nowadays, pavement management systems (PMS) are mainly based on monitoring processes that have been established for a long time, and strongly depend on acquired experience. However, with the emergence of smart technologies, such as internet of things and artificial intelligence, PMS could be improved by applying these new smart technologies to their decision support systems, not just by updating their data collection methodologies, but also their data analysis tools. The application of these smart technologies to the field of pavement monitoring and condition evaluation will undoubtedly contribute to more efficient, less costly, safer, and environmentally friendly methodologies. Thus, the main drive of the present work is to provide insight for the development of future decision support systems for smart pavement management by conducting a systematic literature review of the developed works that apply smart technologies to this field. The conclusions drawn from the analysis allowed for the identification of a series of future direction recommendations for researchers. In fact, future PMS should tend to be capable of collecting and analyzing data at different levels, both externally at the surface or inside the pavement, as well as to detect and predict all types of functional and structural flaws and defects.

AB  - Ukraine is an associate member of the European Union, and in the coming years, it is expected that all the data and services already used by European Union countries will become available for Ukraine. An important program, which is the basis for building European monitoring services for smart cities, is the Copernicus program. The two most important services of this program are the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). CLMS provides important information on land use in Europe. In the context of smart cities, the most valuable tool is the Urban Atlas service, which is related to local CLMS services and provides a detailed digital city plan in vector form, which is segmented into small functional areas classified by Coordinate Information on the Environment (CORINE) nomenclature. The Urban Atlas is a geospatial layer with high resolution, built for all European cities with a population of more than 100,000. It combines high-resolution satellite data, city segmentation by blocks and functional urban areas (FUAs), important city infrastructure, etc. This product is used as a basis for city planning and obtaining analytics on the most important indicators of city development, including air quality monitoring. For Ukraine, such geospatial products are not provided under the Copernicus program. In this article, FUAs are developed for Ukrainian cities using European technology. It is important to start work on this program&rsquo;s implementation as early as possible so that when the first city atlas appears, Ukraine will be ready to work with it together with the European community. This requires preparing the basis for national research and training national stakeholders and consumers to use this product. To make this happen, it is necessary to have a national geospatial product that can be used as an analogue of the city atlas. In this article, the authors analyzed the existing methods of air quality assessment and the Global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 11.6.2, &ldquo;Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted)&rdquo;, achieved for European cities. Based on this, indicator 11.6.2 was then evaluated for the first time in Ukraine, considering the next 5 years. For the correct use of global products for Ukraine, CAMS global satellite data and population data (Global Human Settlement Layer and NASA population data) for Ukrainian cities were validated. These studies showed a statistically significant result and, therefore, demonstrated that global products can be used to monitor air quality both at the city level and for Ukraine as a whole. The obtained results were analyzed, and the values of indicator 11.6.2 for Ukraine were compared with those for other European countries.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Several cities have recently moved towards becoming smart cities for better services and quality of life for residents and visitors, with: optimized resource utilization; increased environmental protection; enhanced infrastructure operations and maintenance; and strong safety and security measures. Smart cities depend on deploying current and new technologies and different optimization methods to enhance services and performance in their different sectors. Some of the technologies assisting smart city applications are the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing, and cloud computing. Integrating these three to serve one system (we will refer to it as integrated IoT-fog-cloud system (iIFC)) creates an advanced platform to develop and operate various types of smart city applications. This platform will allow applications to use the best features from the IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud services to deliver best capabilities and performance. Utilizing this powerful platform will provide many opportunities for enhancing and optimizing applications in energy, transportation, healthcare, and other areas. In this paper we survey various applications of iIFCs for smart cities. We identify different common issues associated with utilizing iIFCs for smart city applications. These issues arise due to the characteristics of iIFCs on the one side and the requirements of different smart city applications on the other. In addition, we outline the main requirements to effectively utilize iIFCs for smart city applications. These requirements are related to optimization, networking, and security.

AB  - This paper focuses on the consumer preferences for the so-called &ldquo;smart homes&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;smart houses&rdquo;) which represent a novel addition and a product of the on-going digitalization and the deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). The major scientific contribution of our study is the empirical model build on the data from the online questionnaire conducted with randomly selected respondents (N = 523) from four European Union (EU) countries and Russia. Even though our results are subject to limitations (no Southern of Northern European countries are included in the scope of this research, which might have yielded different results due to the differences in wealth of citizens and climate in comparison to the Central and Eastern European countries or Germany), they demonstrate that the users included in our sample generally feel inclined to the smart homes technologies and perceive them as a plausible means for improving the safety and security of their lives. On the other hand, some respondents from our sample expressed their concerns over the cybersecurity and technology dependence issues associated with smart homes. It is also apparent that younger respondents (aged 16&ndash;35) featured in our research are more worried about their personal data being monitored and analyzed (with a pending threat of leakages). All these results are original and constitute an important scientific value-added to the field of research in smart home technologies and their acceptance by the general public. We demonstrate that the further enhancement of smart homes, and the increase of their popularity and affordability among the customers both in the Central and Eastern European countries and beyond, might depend on the development of the smart grids which these smart homes are an integral part of. The reliability of the smart systems constitutes the key element for achieving the satisfaction of the smart homes residents, and hence needs to be achieved and secured in an effective way. This would ensure the right mix and balance of energy security and efficiency for all customers involved in this process.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The accurate estimation of real estate value helps the development of real estate policies that can respond to the complexities and instability of the real estate market. Previously, statistical methods were used to estimate real estate value, but machine learning methods have gained popularity because their predictions are more accurate. In contrast to existing studies that use various machine learning methods to estimate the transactions or list prices of real estate properties without separating the building and land prices, this study estimates land price using a large amount of land-use information obtained from various land- and building-related datasets. The random forest and XGBoost methods were used to estimate 52,900 land prices in Seoul, South Korea, from January 2017 to December 2020. The models were also separately trained for different land uses and different time periods. Overall, the results revealed that XGBoost yields a higher prediction accuracy. Whereas the XGBoost models were more accurate on the 2020 data than on the 2017&ndash;2020 data when analyzing residential areas, the random forest models were more accurate on the 2017&ndash;2020 data than on the 2020 data. Further analysis will extend the prediction model to consider submarkets determined by price volatility and locality.

TI  - Smart Homes as Enablers for Depression Pre-Diagnosis Using PHQ-9 on HMI through Fuzzy Logic Decision System
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Depression is a common mental illness characterized by sadness, lack of interest, or pleasure. According to the DSM-5, there are nine symptoms, from which an individual must present 4 or 5 in the last two weeks to fulfill the diagnosis criteria of depression. Nevertheless, the common methods that health care professionals use to assess and monitor depression symptoms are face-to-face questionnaires leading to time-consuming or expensive methods. On the other hand, smart homes can monitor householders&rsquo; health through smart devices such as smartphones, wearables, cameras, or voice assistants connected to the home. Although the depression disorders at smart homes are commonly oriented to the senior sector, depression affects all of us. Therefore, even though an expert needs to diagnose the depression disorder, questionnaires as the PHQ-9 help spot any depressive symptomatology as a pre-diagnosis. Thus, this paper proposes a three-step framework; the first step assesses the nine questions to the end-user through ALEXA or a gamified HMI. Then, a fuzzy logic decision system considers three actions based on the nine responses. Finally, the last step considers these three actions: continue monitoring through Alexa and the HMI, suggest specialist referral, and mandatory specialist referral.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Currently, a smart city is an emerging field in urban cities to improve the quality of life through information and communication technology (ICT). In general, the traditional solid waste management (SWM) approach taken by municipal authorities for waste collection in urban areas must be enhanced to achieve the green and smart city goals. This article is primarily focused on the progress of ICT technologies in solid waste management. With that aim, a thorough analysis is carried out in the article, and from the analysis, we have identified distinct ICT technologies that have been implemented in SWM. The function, application, and limitations of each technology are presented in the article. From the review, it is concluded that the implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role in minimizing the negative impact of waste on the environment. It is also identified that selection of the appropriate wireless communication protocol is critical during the implementation of IoT-based system because the sensor node at the bins is battery-powered. In addition, it is analysed that blockchain technology plays an essential role in realizing the waste&ndash;money model, as this model includes transactions between users and recyclers. Finally, in this article, we propose that the waste-to-money model, local network and gateway architecture, vision node, and customized prototype improve solid waste management system in terms of communication, energy consumption, and real-time monitoring.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 12
SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - The traditional page-grained buffer manager in database systems has a low hit ratio when only a few tuples within a page are frequently accessed. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a new buffering scheme called the AMG-Buffer (Adaptive Multi-Grained Buffer). AMG-Buffer proposes to use two page buffers and a tuple buffer to organize the whole buffer. In this way, the AMG-Buffer can hold more hot tuples than a single page-grained buffer. Further, we notice that the tuple buffer may cause additional read I/Os when writing dirty tuples into disks. Thus, we introduce a new metric named clustering rate to quantify the hot-tuple rate in a page. The use of the tuple buffer is determined by the clustering rate, allowing the AMG-Buffer to adapt to different workloads. We conduct experiments on various workloads to compare the AMG-Buffer with several existing schemes, including LRU, LIRS, CFLRU, CFDC, and MG-Buffer. The results show that AMG-Buffer can significantly improve the hit ratio and reduce I/Os compared to its competitors. Moreover, the AMG-Buffer achieves the best performance on a dynamic workload as well as on a large data set, suggesting its adaptivity and scalability to changing workloads.

VL  - 21
IS  - 23
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The 3D vehicle trajectory in complex traffic conditions such as crossroads and heavy traffic is practically very useful in autonomous driving. In order to accurately extract the 3D vehicle trajectory from a perspective camera in a crossroad where the vehicle has an angular range of 360 degrees, problems such as the narrow visual angle in single-camera scene, vehicle occlusion under conditions of low camera perspective, and lack of vehicle physical information must be solved. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the 3D bounding boxes of vehicles and extracting trajectories using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in an overlapping multi-camera crossroad scene. First, traffic data were collected using overlapping multi-cameras to obtain a wide range of trajectories around the crossroad. Then, 3D bounding boxes of vehicles were estimated and tracked in each single-camera scene through DCNN models (YOLOv4, multi-branch CNN) combined with camera calibration. Using the abovementioned information, the 3D vehicle trajectory could be extracted on the ground plane of the crossroad by calculating results obtained from the overlapping multi-camera with a homography matrix. Finally, in experiments, the errors of extracted trajectories were corrected through a simple linear interpolation and regression, and the accuracy of the proposed method was verified by calculating the difference with ground-truth data. Compared with other previously reported methods, our approach is shown to be more accurate and more practical.

AB  - Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has emerged as an advancement over the traditional Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) towards achieving a more efficient intelligent transportation system that is capable of providing various intelligent services and supporting different applications for the drivers and passengers on roads. In order for the IoV and VANETs environments to be able to offer such beneficial road services, huge amounts of data are generated and exchanged among the different communicated entities in these vehicular networks wirelessly via open channels, which could attract the adversaries and threaten the network with several possible types of security attacks. In this survey, we target the authentication part of the security system while highlighting the efficiency of blockchains in the IoV and VANETs environments. First, a detailed background on IoV and blockchain is provided, followed by a wide range of security requirements, challenges, and possible attacks in vehicular networks. Then, a more focused review is provided on the recent blockchain-based authentication schemes in IoV and VANETs with a detailed comparative study in terms of techniques used, network models, evaluation tools, and attacks counteracted. Lastly, some future challenges for IoV security are discussed that are necessary to be addressed in the upcoming research.

AB  - YouTube is a source of income for many people, and therefore a video&rsquo;s popularity ultimately becomes the top priority for sustaining a steady income, provided that the popularity of videos remains the highest. Analysts and researchers use different algorithms and models to predict the maximum viewership of popular videos. This study predicts the popularity of such videos using the XGBoost model, considering features selection, fusion, min-max normalization and some precision parameters such as gamma, eta, learning_rate etc. The XGBoost gives 86% accuracy and 64% precision. Moreover, the Tuned XGboost also shows enhanced accuracy and precision. We have also analyzed the classification of unpopular videos for a comparison with our results. Finally, cross-validation methods are also used to evaluate certain combination of parameter&rsquo;s values to validate our claims. Based on the obtained results, it can be said that our proposed models and techniques are very useful and can precisely and accurately predict the popularity of YouTube videos.

Moreover, we identify the key driving variables for ML models in predicting particulate matter (PM) pollutants by quantitative statistics. Additionally, a case study for wet nitrogen deposition estimation is carried out based on ML models. Finally, the prospects of ML for atmospheric prediction are discussed.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 12
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Previous VideoGIS integration methods mostly used geographic homography mapping. However, the related processing techniques were mainly for independent cameras and the software architecture was C/S, resulting in large deviations in geographic video mapping for small scenes, a lack of multi-camera video fusion, and difficulty in accessing real-time information with WebGIS. Therefore, we propose real-time web map construction based on the object height and camera posture (RTWM-HP for short). We first consider the constraint of having a similar height for each object by constructing an auxiliary plane and establishing a high-precision homography matrix (HP-HM) between the plane and the map; thus, the accuracy of geographic video mapping can be improved. Then, we map the objects in the multi-camera video with overlapping areas to geographic space and perform the object selection with the multi-camera (OS-CDD) algorithm, which includes the confidence of the object, the distance, and the angle between the objects and the center of the cameras. Further, we use the WebSocket technology to design a hybrid C/S and B/S software framework that is suitable for WebGIS integration. Experiments were carried out based on multi-camera videos and high-precision geospatial data in an office and a parking lot. The case study&rsquo;s results show the following: (1) The HP-HM method can achieve the high-precision geographic mapping of objects (such as human heads and cars) with multiple cameras; (2) the OS-CDD algorithm can optimize and adjust the positions of the objects in the overlapping area and achieve a better map visualization effect; (3) RTWM-HP can publish real-time maps of objects with multiple cameras, which can be browsed in real time through point layers and hot-spot layers through WebGIS. The methods can be applied to some fields, such as person or car supervision and the flow analysis of customers or traffic passengers.

TI  - Probabilistic Deep Learning to Quantify Uncertainty in Air Quality Forecasting

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Data-driven forecasts of air quality have recently achieved more accurate short-term predictions. However, despite their success, most of the current data-driven solutions lack proper quantifications of model uncertainty that communicate how much to trust the forecasts. Recently, several practical tools to estimate uncertainty have been developed in probabilistic deep learning. However, there have not been empirical applications and extensive comparisons of these tools in the domain of air quality forecasts. Therefore, this work applies state-of-the-art techniques of uncertainty quantification in a real-world setting of air quality forecasts. Through extensive experiments, we describe training probabilistic models and evaluate their predictive uncertainties based on empirical performance, reliability of confidence estimate, and practical applicability. We also propose improving these models using &ldquo;free&rdquo; adversarial training and exploiting temporal and spatial correlation inherent in air quality data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed models perform better than previous works in quantifying uncertainty in data-driven air quality forecasts. Overall, Bayesian neural networks provide a more reliable uncertainty estimate but can be challenging to implement and scale. Other scalable methods, such as deep ensemble, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and stochastic weight averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), can perform well if applied correctly but with different tradeoffs and slight variations in performance metrics. Finally, our results show the practical impact of uncertainty estimation and demonstrate that, indeed, probabilistic models are more suitable for making informed decisions.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Developing efficient communication between vehicles and everything (V2X) is a challenging task, mainly due to the characteristics of vehicular networks, which include rapid topology changes, large-scale sizes, and frequent link disconnections. This article proposes a deep learning model to enhance V2X communication. Various channel conditions such as interference, channel noise, and path loss affect the communication between a vehicle (V) and everything (X). Thus, the proposed model aims to determine the required optimum interference power to enhance connectivity, comply with the quality of service (QoS) constraints, and improve the communication link reliability. The proposed model fulfills the best QoS in terms of four metrics, namely, achievable data rate (Rb), packet delivery ratio (PDR), packet loss rate (PLR), and average end-to-end delay (E2E). The factors to be considered are the distribution and density of vehicles, average length, and minimum safety distance between vehicles. A mathematical formulation of the optimum required interference power is presented to achieve the given objectives as a constrained optimization problem, and accordingly, the proposed deep learning model is trained. The obtained results show the ability of the proposed model to enhance the connectivity between V2X for improving road traffic information efficiency and increasing road traffic safety.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has already gained the attention of the researchers involved in smart city (SC) initiatives, along with other advanced technologies such as IoT, big data, cloud computing, or analytics. In this context, researchers also realized that data can help in making the SC happen but also, the open data movement has encouraged more research works using machine learning. Based on this line of reasoning, the aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review to investigate open data-based machine learning applications in the six different areas of smart cities. The results of this research reveal that: (a) machine learning applications using open data came out in all the SC areas and specific ML techniques are discovered for each area, with deep learning and supervised learning being the first choices. (b) Open data platforms represent the most frequently used source of data. (c) The challenges associated with open data utilization vary from quality of data, to frequency of data collection, to consistency of data, and data format. Overall, the data synopsis as well as the in-depth analysis may be a valuable support and inspiration for the future smart city projects.

AB  - The role of energy is cardinal for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the enhancement and modernization of energy generation and management practices. The smart grid enables efficient communication between utilities and the end- users, and enhances the user experience by monitoring and controlling the energy transmission. The smart grid deals with an enormous amount of energy data, and the absence of proper techniques for data collection, processing, monitoring and decision-making ultimately makes the system ineffective. Big data analytics, in association with the smart grid, enable better grid visualization and contribute toward the attainment of sustainability.

AB  - The amount of arable land is limited, yet the demand for agricultural food products is increasing. This issue has led to the notion of precision farming, where smart city-based technologies (e.g., Internet of Things, digital twins, artificial intelligence) are employed in combination to cater for increased production with fewer resources. Widely used in manufacturing, augmented reality has demonstrated impactful solutions for information communication, remote monitoring and increased interaction. Yet, the technology has only recently begun to find a footing alongside precision farming solutions, despite the many benefits possible to farmers through augmenting the physical world with digital objects. Therefore, this article reflects on literature discussing current applied solutions within agriculture, where augmented realty has demonstrated a significant impact for monitoring and production. The findings discuss that augmented reality must be coupled with other technologies (e.g., simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms, global positioning systems, and sensors), specifically 9 are identified across 2 application domains (livestock and crop farming) to be beneficial. Attention is also provided on how augmented reality should be employed within agriculture, where related-work examples are drawn from in order to discuss suitable hardware approaches and constraints (e.g., mobility).

TI  - Future Shift for &lsquo;Big Things&rsquo;: From Starchitecture via Agritecture to Parkitecture

SN  - 2199-8531

AB  - This article analyses three recent shifts in what called the geography of &lsquo;Big Things&rsquo;, meaning the contemporary functions and adaptability of modern city centre architecture. We periodise the three styles conventionally into the fashionable &lsquo;Starchitecture&rsquo; of the 1990s, the repurposed &lsquo;Agritecture&rsquo; of the 2000s and the parodising &lsquo;Parkitecture&rsquo; of the 2010s. Starchitecture was the form of new architecture coinciding with the rise of neo-liberalism in its brief era of global urban competitiveness prevalent in the 1990s. After the Great Financial Crash of 2007&ndash;2008, the market for high-rise emblems of iconic, thrusting, skyscrapers and giant downtown and suburban shopping malls waned and online shopping and working from home destroyed the main rental values of the CBD. In some illustrious cases, &lsquo;Agritecture&rsquo; caused re-purposed office blocks and other CBD accompaniments to be re-purposed as settings for high-rise urban farming, especially aquaponics and hydroponic horticulture. Now, COVID-19 has further undermined traditional CBD property markets, causing some administrations to decide to bulldoze their &lsquo;deadmalls&rsquo; and replace them with urban prairie landscapes, inviting the designation &lsquo;Parkitecture&rsquo; for the bucolic results. This paper presents an account of these transitions with reference to questions raised by urban cultural scholars such as Jane M. Jacobs and Jean Gottmann to figure out answers in time and space to questions their work poses.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The multiclass prediction approach to the problem of recognizing the state of the drill by classifying images of drilled holes into three classes is presented. Expert judgement was made on the basis of the quality of the hole, by dividing the collected photographs into the classes: &ldquo;very fine,&rdquo; &ldquo;acceptable,&rdquo; and &ldquo;unacceptable.&rdquo; The aim of the research was to create a model capable of identifying different levels of quality of the holes, where the reduced quality would serve as a warning that the drill is about to wear down. This could reduce the damage caused by a blunt tool. To perform this task, real-world data were gathered, normalized, and scaled down, and additional instances were created with the use of data-augmentation techniques, a self-developed transformation, and with general adversarial networks. This approach also allowed us to achieve a slight rebalance of the dataset, by creating higher numbers of images belonging to the less-represented classes. The datasets generated were then fed into a series of convolutional neural networks, with different numbers of convolution layers used, modelled to carry out the multiclass prediction. The performance of the so-designed model was compared to predictions generated by Microsoft&rsquo;s Custom Vision service, trained on the same data, which was treated as the benchmark. Several trained models obtained by adjusting the structure and hyperparameters of the model were able to provide better recognition of less-represented classes than the benchmark.

AB  - The utilization of edge-enabled cloud computing in unmanned aerial vehicles has facilitated advances in autonomous control by employing computationally intensive algorithms frequently related to traversal among different locations in an environment. A significant problem remains in designing an effective strategy to offload tasks from the edge to the cloud. This work focuses on creating such a strategy by employing a network evaluation method built on the mean opinion score metrics in concoction with machine learning algorithms for path length prediction to assess computational complexity and classification models to perform an offloading decision on the data provided by both network metrics and solution depth prediction. The proposed system is applied to the A* path planning algorithm, and the presented results demonstrate up to 94% accuracy in offloading decisions.

AB  - The leakage of hazardous gases and chemical vapors is considered one of the dangerous accidents that can occur in laboratories, workshops, warehouses, and industrial sites that use or store these substances. The early detection and alarming of hazardous gases and volatile chemicals are significant to keep the safety conditions for the people and life forms who are work in and live around these places. In this paper, we investigate the available mobile detection and alarming systems for toxic, hazardous gases and volatile chemicals, especially in the laboratory environment. We included papers from January 2010 to August 2021 which may have the newest used sensors technologies and system components. We identified (236) papers from Clarivate Web of Science (WoS), IEEE, ACM Library, Scopus, and PubMed. Paper selection has been done based on a fast screening of the title and abstract, then a full-text reading was applied to filter the selected papers that resulted in (42) eligible papers. The main goal of this work is to discuss the available mobile hazardous gas detection and alarming systems based on several technical details such as the used gas detection technology (simple element, integrated, smart, etc.), sensor manufacturing technology (catalytic bead, MEMS, MOX, etc.) the sensor specifications (warm-up time, lifetime, response time, precision, etc.), processor type (microprocessor, microcontroller, PLC, etc.), and type of the used communication technology (Bluetooth/BLE, Wi-Fi/RF, ZigBee/XBee, LoRa, etc.). In this review, attention will be focused on the improvement of the detection and alarming system of hazardous gases with the latest invention in sensors, processors, communication, and battery technologies.

TI  - Use of AI Algorithms in Different Building Typologies for Energy Efficiency towards Smart Buildings
T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Buildings&rsquo; heating and cooling systems account for an important part of total energy consumption. The EU&rsquo;s directives and engagements motivate building owners and relevant stakeholders in the energy and construction sectors towards net zero energy buildings by maximizing the use of renewable energy sources, ICT, and automation systems. However, the high costs of investment for the renovation of buildings, in situ use of renewable energy production, and installation of expensive ICT infrastructure and automation systems in small&ndash;medium range buildings are the main obstacles for the wide adoption of EU building directives in small- and medium-range buildings. On the other hand, the concept of sharing computational and data storage resources among various buildings can be an alternative approach to achieving smart buildings and smart cities where the main control power resides on a server. Unlike other studies that focus on the implementation of AI techniques in a building or separated buildings with local processing resources and data storage, in this work a corporate server was employed to control the heating systems in three building typologies and to examine the potential benefits of controlling existing buildings in a unified energy-savings platform. The key finding of this work is that the AI algorithms incorporated into the proposed system achieved significant energy savings in the order of 20&ndash;40% regardless of building typology, building functionality, and type of heating system, despite the COVID-19 measures for frequent ventilation of the buildings, even in cases with older-type heating systems.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - New approaches and techniques are required for environmental management in workplaces that emit pollutants. The best available techniques (BATs) that are suggested by the integrated environmental permit system (IEPS) play a pivotal role in providing state-of-the-art approaches and techniques to workplaces. For the workplaces that install facilities with the BATs, it is necessary to perform real-time monitoring to determine whether pollutant emission facilities and treatment facilities are operating normally and whether such facilities can maintain the optimal condition during the emission of pollutants. The environmental management measures used before the IEPS had limitations for workplaces that are subjected to integrated environmental management because they consider the entire workplace as a single pollution source by combining all media. In addition, only the emission concentrations and amounts of pollutants were monitored because only the points at which most pollutants are discharged, i.e., stacks for air pollutant emission facilities and final effluent outlets for water pollutant emission facilities, are monitored. These monitoring approaches in a variety of facilities involve considerable costs, and most of them (95% for stacks in workplaces under IEPS, Korea) cannot perform real-time observation even though some of them are capable of it (5% for stacks managed by Tele Monitoring System, TMS). In this study, the applicability of a wireless sensor monitoring network was examined as a new approach for environmental management in workplaces. Based on the sensor monitoring network, surrogate parameters that can indirectly monitor the critical operating factors of pollutant emission and prevention facilities were developed and then measured in real time to examine the status of these facilities. Surrogate parameters can be used instead of directly measuring pollutants as the former has high efficiency, such as cost reduction, and can provide reliable data on the emission characteristics of pollutants. The wireless network is based on an Internet of Things (IoT) platform under real-time conditions in the emission and production facilities in a workplace. This study suggested that a wireless network using the IoT platform improves the BAT assessment methodology to understand the efficiency of environmental pollution reduction and the economic contribution to the workplace.

TI  - Block-Greedy and CNN Based Underwater Image Dehazing for Novel Depth Estimation and Optimal Ambient Light
T2  - Water

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 23
SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - A lack of adequate consideration of underwater image enhancement gives room for more research into the field. The global background light has not been adequately addressed amid the presence of backscattering. This paper presents a technique based on pixel differences between global and local patches in scene depth estimation. The pixel variance is based on green and red, green and blue, and red and blue channels besides the absolute mean intensity functions. The global background light is extracted based on a moving average of the impact of suspended light and the brightest pixels within the image color channels. We introduce the block-greedy algorithm in a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) proposed to normalize different color channels&rsquo; attenuation ratios and select regions with the lowest variance. We address the discontinuity associated with underwater images by transforming both local and global pixel values. We minimize energy in the proposed CNN via a novel Markov random field to smooth edges and improve the final underwater image features. A comparison of the performance of the proposed technique against existing state-of-the-art algorithms using entropy, Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation (UCIQE), Underwater Image Quality Measure (UIQM), Underwater Image Colorfulness Measure (UICM), and Underwater Image Sharpness Measure (UISM) indicate better performance of the proposed approach in terms of average and consistency. As it concerns to averagely, UICM has higher values in the technique than the reference methods, which explainsits higher color balance. The &mu; values of UCIQE, UISM, and UICM of the proposed method supersede those of the existing techniques. The proposed noted a percent improvement of 0.4%, 4.8%, 9.7%, 5.1% and 7.2% in entropy, UCIQE, UIQM, UICM and UISM respectively compared to the best existing techniques. Consequently, dehazed images have sharp, colorful, and clear features in most images when compared to those resulting from the existing state-of-the-art methods. Stable &sigma; values explain the consistency in visual analysis in terms of sharpness of color and clarity of features in most of the proposed image results when compared with reference methods. Our own assessment shows that only weakness of the proposed technique is that it only applies to underwater images. Future research could seek to establish edge strengthening without color saturation enhancement.

AB  - The emergence of new technologies and the era of IoT which will be based on compute-intensive applications. These applications will increase the traffic volume of today&rsquo;s network infrastructure and will impact more on emerging Fifth Generation (5G) system. Research is going in many details, such as how to provide automation in managing and configuring data analysis tasks over cloud and edges, and to achieve minimum latency and bandwidth consumption with optimizing task allocation. The major challenge for researchers is to push the artificial intelligence to the edge to fully discover the potential of the fog computing paradigm. There are existing intelligence-based fog computing frameworks for IoT based applications, but research on Edge-Artificial Intelligence (Edge-AI) is still in its initial stage. Therefore, we chose to focus on data analytics and offloading in our proposed architecture. To address these problems, we have proposed a prototype of our architecture, which is a multi-layered architecture for data analysis between cloud and fog computing layers to perform latency- sensitive analysis with low latency. The main goal of this research is to use this multi-layer fog computing platform for enhancement of data analysis system based on IoT devices in real-time. Our research based on the policy of the OpenFog Consortium which will offer the good outcomes, but also surveillance and data analysis functionalities. We presented through case studies that our proposed prototype architecture outperformed the cloud-only environment in delay-time, network usage, and energy consumption.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 23

AB  - In video processing, background initialization aims to obtain a scene without foreground objects. Recently, the background initialization problem has attracted the attention of researchers because of its real-world applications, such as video segmentation, computational photography, video surveillance, etc. However, the background initialization problem is still challenging because of the complex variations in illumination, intermittent motion, camera jitter, shadow, etc. This paper proposes a novel and effective background initialization method using singular spectrum analysis. Firstly, we extract the video&rsquo;s color frames and split them into RGB color channels. Next, RGB color channels of the video are saved as color channel spatio-temporal data. After decomposing the color channel spatio-temporal data by singular spectrum analysis, we obtain the stable and dynamic components using different eigentriple groups. Our study indicates that the stable component contains a background image and the dynamic component includes the foreground image. Finally, the color background image is reconstructed by merging RGB color channel images obtained by reshaping the stable component data. Experimental results on the public scene background initialization databases show that our proposed method achieves a good color background image compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - With possible new use cases and demanding requirements of future 5th generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks, the future of mobile communications sounds promising. However, the propagation medium has been considered a randomly acting agent between the transmitter and the receiver. With the advent of the digital age of wireless communications, the received signal quality is degrading due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding artifacts. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and assisted application areas. With the RIS, the network operators can control radio waves&rsquo; scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics by resolving the harmful properties of environmental wireless propagation. Further, the RIS can effectively control the wavefront, such as amplitude, phase, frequency, and even polarization, without requiring complex encoding, decoding, or radio wave processing techniques. Motivated by technological advances, the metasurfaces, reflectarrays, phase shift, and liquid crystals are potential candidates for implementing RIS. Thus, they can be considered the front runner for realizing the 5G and beyond network. Furthermore, the current research activities in the evolving field of wireless networks operated by RIS are reviewed and discussed thoroughly. Finally, to fully explore the potential of RISs in wireless networks, the fundamental research issues to be addressed have been discussed.

AB  - Due to the increasing use of private cars for urbanization and urban transport, the travel time of urban transportation is increasing. People spend a lot of time in the streets, and the queue length of waiting increases accordingly; this has direct effects on fuel consumption too. Traffic flow forecasts and traffic light schedules were studied separately in the urban traffic system. This paper presents a new stable TS (Takagi&ndash;Sugeno) fuzzy controller for urban traffic. The state-space dynamics are utilized to formulate both the vehicle&rsquo;s average waiting time at an isolated intersection and the length of queues. A fuzzy intelligent controller is designed for light control based upon the length of the queue, and eventually, the system&rsquo;s stability is proved using the Lyapunov theorem. Moreover, the input variables are the length of queue and number of input or output vehicles from each lane. The simulation results describe the appearance of the proposed controller. An illustrative example is also given to show the proposed method&rsquo;s effectiveness; the suggested method is more efficient than both the conventional fuzzy traffic controllers and the fixed time controller.

AB  - The recent development in the area of IoT technologies is likely to be implemented extensively in the next decade. There is a great increase in the crime rate, and the handling officers are responsible for dealing with a broad range of cyber and Internet issues during investigation. IoT technologies are helpful in the identification of suspects, and few technologies are available that use IoT and deep learning together for face sketch synthesis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other constructs of deep learning have become major tools in recent approaches. A new-found architecture of the neural network is anticipated in this work. It is called Spiral-Net, which is a modified version of U-Net fto perform face sketch synthesis (the phase is known as the compiler network C here). Spiral-Net performs in combination with a pre-trained Vgg-19 network called the feature extractor F. It first identifies the top n matches from viewed sketches to a given photo. F is again used to formulate a feature map based on the cosine distance of a candidate sketch formed by C from the top n matches. A customized CNN configuration (called the discriminator D) then computes loss functions based on differences between the candidate sketch and the feature. Values of these loss functions alternately update C and F. The ensemble of these nets is trained and tested on selected datasets, including CUFS, CUFSF, and a part of the IIT photo&ndash;sketch dataset. Results of this modified U-Net are acquired by the legacy NLDA (1998) scheme of face recognition and its newer version, OpenBR (2013), which demonstrate an improvement of 5% compared with the current state of the art in its relevant domain.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Twenty-three rainfall events were monitored to determine the characteristics of the stormwater runoff entering a rain garden facility and evaluate its performance in terms of pollutant removal and volume reduction. Data gathered during the five-year monitoring period were utilized to develop a deep learning-based model that can predict the concentrations of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Total Phosphorus (TP). Findings revealed that the rain garden was capable of effectively reducing solids, organics, nutrients, and heavy metals from stormwater runoff during the five-year period when hydrologic and climate conditions have changed. Volume reduction was also high but can decrease over time due to the accumulation of solids in the facility which reduced the infiltration capacity and increased ponding and overflows especially during heavy rainfalls. A preliminary development of a water quality prediction model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture was also developed to be able to potentially reduce the labor and costs associated with on-site monitoring in the future. The LSTM model predicted pollutant concentrations that are close to the actual values with a mean square error of 0.36 during calibration and a less than 10% difference from the measured values during validation. The study showed the potential of using deep learning architecture for the prediction of stormwater quality parameters entering rain gardens. While this study is still in the preliminary stage, it can potentially be improved for use in performance monitoring, decision-making regarding maintenance, and design of similar technologies in the future.

AB  - Microscopic simulation-based approaches are extensively used for determining good signal timing plans on traffic intersections. Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) such as wait time, throughput, fuel consumption, emission, and delays can be derived for variable signal timing parameters, traffic flow patterns, etc. However, these techniques are computationally intensive, especially when the number of signal timing scenarios to be simulated are large. In this paper, we propose InterTwin, a Deep Neural Network architecture based on Spatial Graph Convolution and Encoder-Decoder Recurrent networks that can predict the MOEs efficiently and accurately for a wide variety of signal timing and traffic patterns. Our methods can generate probability distributions of MOEs and are not limited to mean and standard deviation. Additionally, GPU implementations using InterTwin can derive MOEs, at least four to five orders of magnitude faster than microscopic simulations on a conventional 32 core CPU machine.

Cloud computing allowed intensive data processing and warehousing solution. Two different new cloud technologies that inherit some of the traditional cloud computing paradigm are fog computing and edge computing that is aims to simplify some of the complexity of cloud computing and leverage the computing capabilities within the local network in order to preform computation tasks rather than carrying it to the cloud. This makes this technology fits with the properties of IoT systems. However, using such technology introduces several new security and privacy challenges that could be huge obstacle against implementing these technologies. In this paper, we survey some of the main security and privacy challenges that faces fog and edge computing illustrating how these security issues could affect the work and implementation of edge and fog computing. Moreover, we present several countermeasures to mitigate the effect of these security issues.

AB  - Urban floods research has been attracting extensive attention with the increasing threat of flood risk and environmental hazards due to global climate change and urbanization. However, there is rarely a comprehensive review of this field and it remains unclear how the research topics on urban floods have evolved. In this study, we analyzed the development of urban floods research and explored the hotspots and frontiers of this field by scientific knowledge mapping. In total, 3314 published articles from 2006 to 2021 were analyzed. The results suggest that the number of published articles in the field of urban floods generally has an upward trend year by year, and the research focus has shifted from exploring hydrological processes to adopting advanced management measures to solve urban flood problems. Moreover, urban stormwater management and low impact development in the context of climate change and urbanization have gradually become research hotspots. Future research directions based on the status and trends of the urban floods field were also discussed. This research can not only inspire other researchers and policymakers, but also demonstrates the effectiveness of scientific knowledge mapping analysis by the use of the software CiteSpace and VOSviewer.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Modern cities require a tighter integration with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for bringing new services to the citizens. The Smart City is the revolutionary paradigm aiming at integrating the ICT with the citizen life; among several urban services, transports are one of the most important in modern cities, introducing several challenges to the Smart City paradigm. In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of new vehicular applications and services, Edge Computing (EC) is one of the most promising technologies when integrated into the Vehicular Networks (VNs). EC-enabled VNs can facilitate new latency-critical and data-intensive applications and services. However, ground-based EC platforms (i.e., Road Side Units&mdash;RSUs, 5G Base Stations&mdash;5G BS) can only serve a reduced number of Vehicular Users (VUs), due to short coverage ranges and resource shortage. In the recent past, several new aerial platforms with integrated EC facilities have been deployed for achieving global connectivity. Such air-based EC platforms can complement the ground-based EC facilities for creating a futuristic VN able to deploy several new applications and services. The goal of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a novel joint air-ground EC platform within a VN architecture for helping VUs with new intelligent applications and services. By exploiting most modern technologies, with particular attention towards network softwarization, vehicular edge computing, and machine learning, we propose here three possible layered air-ground EC-enabled VN scenarios. For each of the discussed scenarios, a list of the possible challenges is considered, as well possible solutions allowing to overcome all or some of the considered challenges. A proper comparison is also done, through the use of tables, where all the proposed scenarios, and the proposed solutions, are discussed.

AB  - Automatic floor plan analysis has gained increased attention in recent research. However, numerous studies related to this area are mainly experiments conducted with a simplified floor plan dataset with low resolution and a small housing scale due to the suitability for a data-driven model. For practical use, it is necessary to focus more on large-scale complex buildings to utilize indoor structures, such as reconstructing multi-use buildings for indoor navigation. This study aimed to build a framework using CNN (Convolution Neural Networks) for analyzing a floor plan with various scales of complex buildings. By dividing a floor plan into a set of normalized patches, the framework enables the proposed CNN model to process varied scale or high-resolution inputs, which is a barrier for existing methods. The model detected building objects per patch and assembled them into one result by multiplying the corresponding translation matrix. Finally, the detected building objects were vectorized, considering their compatibility in 3D modeling. As a result, our framework exhibited similar performance in detection rate (87.77%) and recognition accuracy (85.53%) to that of existing studies, despite the complexity of the data used. Through our study, the practical aspects of automatic floor plan analysis can be expanded.

AB  - Statistical reports say that, from 2011 to 2021, more than 11,915 stray animals, such as cats, dogs, goats, cows, etc., and wild animals were wounded in road accidents. Most of the accidents occurred due to negligence and doziness of drivers. These issues can be handled brilliantly using stray and wild animals-vehicle interaction and the pedestrians&rsquo; awareness. This paper briefs a detailed forum on GPU-based embedded systems and ODT real-time applications. ML trains machines to recognize images more accurately than humans. This provides a unique and real-time solution using deep-learning real 3D motion-based YOLOv3 (DL-R-3D-YOLOv3) ODT of images on mobility. Besides, it discovers methods for multiple views of flexible objects using 3D reconstruction, especially for stray and wild animals. Computer vision-based IoT devices are also besieged by this DL-R-3D-YOLOv3 model. It seeks solutions by forecasting image filters to find object properties and semantics for object recognition methods leading to closed-loop ODT.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - Blockchain technology is highly coupled with cryptocurrencies; however, it provides several other potential use cases, related to energy and sustainability, Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, smart mobility and more. Blockchain can offer security for Electric Vehicle (EV) transactions in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) concept, allowing electricity trading to be performed in a decentralized, transparent and secure way. Additionally, blockchain provides the necessary functionalities for IoV decentralized application development, such as data exchange, personal digital identity, sharing economy and optimized charging pattern. Moreover, blockchain technology has the potential to significantly increase energy efficiency, decrease management costs and guarantee the effective use of the energy recourses. Therefore, its application in the IoV concept provides secure, autonomous and automated energy trading between EVs. While several studies on blockchain technology in smart grids have been conducted, insufficient attention has been given to conducting a detailed review and state-of-the-art analysis of blockchain application in the IoV domain. To this end, this work provides a systematic literature review of blockchain-based applications in the IoV domain. The aim is to investigate the current challenges of IoV and to highlight how blockchain characteristics can contribute to this emerging paradigm. In addition, limitations and future research directions related to the integration of blockchain technology within the IoV are discussed. To this end, this study incorporates the theoretical foundations of several research articles published in scientific publications over the previous five years, as a method of simplifying our assessment and capturing the ever-expanding blockchain area. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of blockchain-enabled applications in the IoV domain, such as privacy and security, data protection and management, vehicle management, charging optimization and P2P energy trading, based on a structured, systematic review and content analysis of the discovered literature, and we identify key trends and emerging areas for research. The contribution of this article is two-fold: (a) we highlight the limitations presented in the relevant literature, particularly the barriers of blockchain technology and how they influence its integration into the IoV and (b) we present a number of research gaps and suggest future exploratory areas.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Owing to the hasty growth of communication technologies in the Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT), many researchers and industries focus on enhancing the existing technologies of UIoT systems for developing numerous applications such as oceanography, diver networks monitoring, deep-sea exploration and early warning systems. In a constrained UIoT environment, communication media such as acoustic, infrared (IR), visible light, radiofrequency (RF) and magnet induction (MI) are generally used to transmit information via digitally linked underwater devices. However, each medium has its technical limitations: for example, the acoustic medium has challenges such as narrow-channel bandwidth, low data rate, high cost, etc., and optical medium has challenges such as high absorption, scattering, long-distance data transmission, etc. Moreover, the malicious node can steal the underwater data by employing blackhole attacks, routing attacks, Sybil attacks, etc. Furthermore, due to heavyweight, the existing privacy and security mechanism of the terrestrial internet of things (IoT) cannot be applied directly to UIoT environment. Hence, this paper aims to provide a systematic review of recent trends, applications, communication technologies, challenges, security threats and privacy issues of UIoT system. Additionally, this paper highlights the methods of preventing the technical challenges and security attacks of the UIoT environment. Finally, this systematic review contributes much to the profit of researchers to analyze and improve the performance of services in UIoT applications.

AB  - The increasing role of emerging technologies, such as big data, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive technologies, cloud computing, and mobile technologies, is essential to the business process manager profession&rsquo;s sustainable development. Nevertheless, these technologies could involve new challenges in labor markets. The era of intelligent business process management (BPM) has begun, but how does it look in real labor markets? This paper examines the hypothesis that the transformation of the business process manager profession has been caused by certain determinants that involve the need for an improvement in BPM skills. The main contribution is a model of the dimensions of the impact of digital technologies on business process management supplemented with skills that influence the business process manager profession. The paper fills the gap in research on perspectives of the impact of digital technologies on business process management, considering both a literature analysis and labor market research. The purpose of the literature review was to identify the core dimensions that drive the use of emerging technologies in business process management. The labor market study was conducted in order to analyze the current demand for core skills of business process managers in the Polish labor market with a particular emphasis on the intelligent BPM concept. Additionally, to study the determinants that slow down the iBPM concept&rsquo;s development, the digital intensity level of the enterprises and public administration units in Poland was studied. Finally, a fuzzy cognitive map presenting the core determinants of the business process manager profession&rsquo;s transformation is described.

SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Complex and tall buildings have been constructed in many cities recently. Fire safety should be a major concern of building designers, engineers, and governments. Previous fire experience has made us understand the importance of acquiring fire-ground information to facilitate firefighting operations, evacuation processes, rescues, etc. Recently, the rapid advancement in Information Technology, Data Analytics, and other detection and monitoring systems has provided the basis for fire safety researchers to re-think fire safety strategies in the built environment. Amongst all fire safety studies, evacuation in tall buildings, including elevator evacuations, has attracted much attention. IoT-aided building fire evacuation is a new concept of the building evacuation mode, which improves the building evacuation process by making decisions of escape based on the real-time fire-ground information, such as the fire environment and occupant situations. Focusing on IoT applications in building fire evacuation, this paper explores the advantages and insufficiencies of current smart building fire evacuation systems. A conceptual design of an IoT-aided building fire evacuation control system is described. The system is introduced in the sequence of information needs, information sources and data transmission, and potential services and applications. Finally, new insights into promising 5G technologies for future building fire evacuations are discussed.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming integrated into a wide range of modern IoT applications. The growing number of networked IoT devices generates a large amount of data. However, processing and memorizing this massive volume of data at local nodes have been deemed critical challenges, especially when using artificial intelligence (AI) systems to extract and exploit valuable information. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a way to bring cloud computing (CC) processes within reach of users, to address computation-intensive offloading and latency issues. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the most relevant research works related to UAV technology applications in terms of enabled or assisted MEC architectures. It details the utility of UAV-enabled MEC architecture regarding emerging IoT applications and the role of both deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in meeting various limitations related to latency, task offloading, energy demand, and security. Furthermore, throughout this article, the reader gains an insight into the future of UAV-enabled MEC, the advantages and the critical challenges to be tackled when using AI.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of a massive number of smart devices capable of data collection, storage, processing, and communication. The adoption of the IoT has brought about tremendous innovation opportunities in industries, homes, the environment, and businesses. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of the IoT have sparked concerns for wide adoption and applications. Unlike traditional information technology (I.T.) systems, the IoT environment is challenging to secure due to resource constraints, heterogeneity, and distributed nature of the smart devices. This makes it impossible to apply host-based prevention mechanisms such as anti-malware and anti-virus. These challenges and the nature of IoT applications call for a monitoring system such as anomaly detection both at device and network levels beyond the organisational boundary. This suggests an anomaly detection system is strongly positioned to secure IoT devices better than any other security mechanism. In this paper, we aim to provide an in-depth review of existing works in developing anomaly detection solutions using machine learning for protecting an IoT system. We also indicate that blockchain-based anomaly detection systems can collaboratively learn effective machine learning models to detect anomalies.

T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Smart buildings (SBs) are developed in many different ways and are self-proclaimed smart. There are a great number of publications introducing smart systems using a wider range of tools and sensors. However, the level of smartness, functions of the smart system, and the usefulness of the system are not the same, which may give a wrong impression to clients or potential buyers of a building. Developing a scoring system that enables determining the overall smartness of a building is necessary. Despite the necessity, there is a dearth of studies in this area. Hence, the purpose of this study is to develop a scoring system to evaluate the level of smartness of Sri Lankan commercial buildings. Thus, initially, smart criteria were identified, defined, and categorized through a literature survey. Subsequently, 35 experts in the commercial building sector were interviewed. Finally, the relative importance of the smart criteria was derived through the AHP technique, and accordingly, a scoring system was developed. The study identified six main criteria to evaluate the smartness of buildings in the scoring system. The automation criterion with the highest relative weight was concluded to be the dominant criterion (45.59%) in the scoring system. Communication and data sharing were placed at second with a relative weight of 18.76% and indicates the importance given by the study findings in establishing the backbones of SBs. Occupants&rsquo; comfort, energy management, occupants&rsquo; health and safety, and sustainability criterion were ranked third, fourth, fifth, and sixth within the scoring system. This study is one of the first to investigate in detail the contribution of both soft and hard services of a facility in determining the overall smartness of a building. Property developers in the commercial building sector can benefit from this study by recognizing the necessary criteria to be embedded in their SB development projects in order to attract more tenants and customers.

T2  - Entropy

PY  - 2021
VL  - 23
IS  - 12
SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - With the proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide diverse critical services, such as surveillance, disaster management, and medicine delivery, the accurate detection of these small devices and the efficient classification of their flight modes are of paramount importance to guarantee their safe operation in our sky. Among the existing approaches, Radio Frequency (RF) based methods are less affected by complex environmental factors. The similarities between UAV RF signals and the diversity of frequency components make accurate detection and classification a particularly difficult task. To bridge this gap, we propose a joint Feature Engineering Generator (FEG) and Multi-Channel Deep Neural Network (MC-DNN) approach. Specifically, in FEG, data truncation and normalization separate different frequency components, the moving average filter reduces the outliers in the RF signal, and the concatenation fully exploits the details of the dataset. In addition, the multi-channel input in MC-DNN separates multiple frequency components and reduces the interference between them. A novel dataset that contains ten categories of RF signals from three types of UAVs is used to verify the effectiveness. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art UAV detection and classification approaches in terms of 98.4% and F1 score of 98.3%.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has frightened people worldwide, and coronavirus has become the most commonly used phrase in recent years. Therefore, there is a need for a systematic literature review (SLR) related to Big Data applications in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The objective is to highlight recent technological advancements. Many studies emphasize the area of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Our study categorizes the many applications used to manage and control the pandemic. There is a very limited SLR prospective of COVID-19 with Big Data. Our SLR study picked five databases: Science direct, IEEE Xplore, Springer, ACM, and MDPI. Before the screening, following the recommendation, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) were reported for 893 studies from 2019, 2020 and until September 2021. After screening, 60 studies met the inclusion criteria through COVID-19 data statistics, and Big Data analysis was used as the search string. Our research&rsquo;s findings successfully dealt with COVID-19 healthcare with risk diagnosis, estimation or prevention, decision making, and drug Big Data applications problems. We believe that this review study will motivate the research community to perform expandable and transparent research against the pandemic crisis of COVID-19.

TI  - Impact of Image Compression on the Performance of Steel Surface Defect Classification with a CNN
T2  - Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - Machine vision is increasingly replacing manual steel surface inspection. The automatic inspection of steel surface defects makes it possible to ensure the quality of products in the steel industry with high accuracy. However, the optimization of inspection time presents a great challenge for the integration of machine vision in high-speed production lines. In this context, compressing the collected images before transmission is essential to save bandwidth and energy, and improve the latency of vision applications. The aim of this paper was to study the impact of quality degradation resulting from image compression on the classification performance of steel surface defects with a CNN. Image compression was applied to the Northeastern University (NEU) surface-defect database with various compression ratios. Three different models were trained and tested with these images to classify surface defects using three different approaches. The obtained results showed that trained and tested models on the same compression qualities maintained approximately the same classification performance for all used compression grades. In addition, the findings clearly indicated that the classification efficiency was affected when the training and test datasets were compressed using different parameters. This impact was more obvious when there was a large difference between these compression parameters, and for models that achieved very high accuracy. Finally, it was found that compression-based data augmentation significantly increased the classification precision to perfect scores (98&ndash;100%), and thus improved the generalization of models when tested on different compression qualities. The importance of this work lies in exploiting the obtained results to successfully integrate image compression into machine vision systems, and as appropriately as possible.

AB  - Advancement in network technology has vastly increased the usage of the Internet. Consequently, there has been a rise in traffic volume and data sharing. This has made securing a network from sophisticated intrusion attacks very important to preserve users&rsquo; information and privacy. Our research focuses on combating and detecting intrusion attacks and preserving the integrity of online systems. In our research we first create a benchmark model for detecting intrusions and then employ various combinations of feature selection techniques based upon ensemble machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of the intrusion detection system. The performance of our model was investigated using three evaluation metrics namely: elimination time, accuracy and F1-score. The results of the experiment indicated that the random forest feature selection technique had the minimum elimination time, whereas the support vector machine model had the best accuracy and F1-score. Therefore, conclusive evidence could be drawn that the combination of random forest and support vector machine is suitable for low latency and highly accurate intrusion detection systems.

AB  - Background: treating infectious diseases in elderly individuals is difficult; patient referral to emergency services often occurs, since the elderly tend to arrive at consultations with advanced, serious symptoms. Aim: it was hypothesized that anticipating an infectious disease diagnosis by a few days could significantly improve a patient&rsquo;s well-being and reduce the burden on emergency health system services. Methods: vital signs from residents were taken daily and transferred to a database in the cloud. Classifiers were used to recognize patterns in the spatial domain process of the collected data. Doctors reported their diagnoses when any disease presented. A flexible microservice architecture provided access and functionality to the system. Results: combining two different domains, health and technology, is not easy, but the results are encouraging. The classifiers reported good results; the system has been well accepted by medical personnel and is proving to be cost-effective and a good solution to service disadvantaged areas. In this context, this research found the importance of certain clinical variables in the identification of infectious diseases. Conclusions: this work explores how to apply mobile communications, cloud services, and machine learning technology, in order to provide efficient tools for medical staff in nursing homes. The scalable architecture can be extended to big data applications that may extract valuable knowledge patterns for medical research.

AB  - Anomaly detection in the smart application domain can significantly improve the quality of data processing, especially when the size of a dataset is too small. Internet of Things (IoT) enables the development of numerous applications where sensor-data-aware anomalies can affect the decision making of the underlying system. In this paper, we propose a scheme: IoTDixon, which works on the Dixon&rsquo;s Q test to identify point anomalies from a simulated normally distributed dataset. The proposed technique involves Q statistics, Kolmogorov&ndash;Smirnov test, and partitioning of a given dataset into a specific data packet. The proposed techniques use Q-test to detect point anomalies. We find that value 76.37 is statistically significant where P=0.012&lt;&alpha;=0.05, thus rejecting the null hypothesis for a test data packet. In other data packets, no such significance is observed; thus, no outlier is statistically detected. The proposed approach of IoTDixon can help to improve small-scale point anomaly detection for a small-size dataset as shown in the conducted experiments.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Climate change and pollution fighting have become prominent global concerns in the twenty-first century. In this context, accurate estimates for polluting emissions and their evolution are critical for robust policy-making processes and ultimately for solving stringent global climate challenges. As such, the primary objective of this study is to produce more accurate forecasts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This in turn contributes to the timely evaluation of the progress achieved towards meeting global climate goals set by international agendas and also acts as an early-warning system. We forecast the evolution of GHG emissions in 12 top polluting economies by using data for the 1970&ndash;2018 period and employing six econometric and machine-learning models (the exponential smoothing state-space model (ETS), the Holt&ndash;Winters model (HW), the TBATS model, the ARIMA model, the structural time series model (STS), and the neural network autoregression model (NNAR)), along with a naive model. A battery of robustness checks is performed. Results confirm a priori expectations and consistently indicate that the neural network autoregression model (NNAR) presents the best out-of-sample forecasting performance for GHG emissions at different forecasting horizons by reporting the lowest average RMSE (root mean square error) and MASE (mean absolute scaled error) within the array of predictive models. Predictions made by the NNAR model for the year 2030 indicate that total GHG emissions are projected to increase by 3.67% on average among the world&rsquo;s 12 most polluting countries until 2030. Only four top polluters will record decreases in total GHG emissions values in the coming decades (i.e., Canada, the Russian Federation, the US, and China), although their emission levels will remain in the upper decile. Emission increases in a handful of developing economies will see significant growth rates (a 22.75% increase in GHG total emissions in Brazil, a 15.75% increase in Indonesia, and 7.45% in India) that are expected to offset the modest decreases in GHG emissions projected for the four countries. Our findings, therefore, suggest that the world&rsquo;s top polluters cannot meet assumed pollution reduction targets in the form of NDCs under the Paris agreement. Results thus highlight the necessity for more impactful policies and measures to bring the set targets within reach.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper introduces an integrated IoT architecture to handle the problem of cyber attacks based on a developed deep neural network (DNN) with a rectified linear unit in order to provide reliable and secure online monitoring for automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The developed IoT architecture based on a DNN introduces a new approach for the online monitoring of AGVs against cyber attacks with a cheap and easy implementation instead of the traditional cyber attack detection schemes in the literature. The proposed DNN is trained based on experimental AGV data that represent the real state of the AGV and different types of cyber attacks including a random attack, ramp attack, pulse attack, and sinusoidal attack that is injected by the attacker into the internet network. The proposed DNN is compared with different deep learning and machine learning algorithms such as a one dimension convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), a supported vector machine model (SVM), random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a decision tree for greater validation. Furthermore, the proposed IoT architecture based on a DNN can provide an effective detection for the AGV status with an excellent accuracy of 96.77% that is significantly greater than the accuracy based on the traditional schemes. The AGV status based on the proposed IoT architecture with a DNN is visualized by an advanced IoT platform named CONTACT Elements for IoT. Different test scenarios with a practical setup of an AGV with IoT are carried out to emphasize the performance of the suggested IoT architecture based on a DNN. The results approve the usefulness of the proposed IoT to provide effective cybersecurity for data visualization and tracking of the AGV status that enhances decision-making and improves industrial productivity.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Deep learning methods are currently used in industries to improve the efficiency and quality of the product. Detecting defects on printed circuit boards (PCBs) is a challenging task and is usually solved by automated visual inspection, automated optical inspection, manual inspection, and supervised learning methods, such as you only look once (YOLO) of tiny YOLO, YOLOv2, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5. Previously described methods for defect detection in PCBs require large numbers of labeled images, which is computationally expensive in training and requires a great deal of human effort to label the data. This paper introduces a new unsupervised learning method for the detection of defects in PCB using student&ndash;teacher feature pyramid matching as a pre-trained image classification model used to learn the distribution of images without anomalies. Hence, we extracted the knowledge into a student network which had same architecture as the teacher network. This one-step transfer retains key clues as much as possible. In addition, we incorporated a multi-scale feature matching strategy into the framework. A mixture of multi-level knowledge from the features pyramid passes through a better supervision, known as hierarchical feature alignment, which allows the student network to receive it, thereby allowing for the detection of various sizes of anomalies. A scoring function reflects the probability of the occurrence of anomalies. This framework helped us to achieve accurate anomaly detection. Apart from accuracy, its inference speed also reached around 100 frames per second.

AB  - Overall, 5G networks are expected to become the backbone of many critical IT applications. With 5G, new tech advancements and innovation are expected; 5G currently operates on software-defined networking. This enables 5G to implement network slicing to meet the unique requirements of every application. As a result, 5G is more flexible and scalable than 4G LTE and previous generations. To avoid the growing risks of hacking, 5G cybersecurity needs some significant improvements. Some security concerns involve the network itself, while others focus on the devices connected to 5G. Both aspects present a risk to consumers, governments, and businesses alike. There is currently no real-time vulnerability assessment framework that specifically addresses 5G Edge networks, with regard to their real-time scalability and dynamic nature. This paper studies the vulnerability assessment in the 5G networks and develops an optimized dynamic method that integrates the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) with the hexagonal fuzzy numbers to accurately analyze the vulnerabilities in 5G networks. The proposed method considers both the vulnerability and 5G network dynamic factors such as latency and accessibility to find the potential attack graph paths where the attack might propagate in the network and quantifies the attack cost and security level of the network. We test and validate the proposed method using our 5G testbed and we compare the optimized method to the classical TOPSIS and the known vulnerability scanner tool, Nessus.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has changed the worldwide network of people, smart devices, intelligent things, data, and information as an emergent technology. IoT development is still in its early stages, and numerous interrelated challenges must be addressed. IoT is the unifying idea of embedding everything. The Internet of Things offers a huge opportunity to improve the world&rsquo;s accessibility, integrity, availability, scalability, confidentiality, and interoperability. However, securing the Internet of Things is a difficult issue. The IoT aims to connect almost everything within the framework of a common infrastructure. This helps in controlling devices and, will allow device status to be updated everywhere and at any time. To develop technology via IoT, several critical scientific studies and inquiries have been carried out. However, many obstacles and problems remain to be tackled in order to reach IoT&rsquo;s maximum potential. These problems and concerns must be taken into consideration in different areas of the IoT, such as implementation in remote areas, threats to the system, development support, social and environmental impacts, etc. This paper reviews the current state of the art in different IoT architectures, with a focus on current technologies, applications, challenges, IoT protocols, and opportunities. As a result, a detailed taxonomy of IoT is presented here which includes interoperability, scalability, security and energy efficiency, among other things. Moreover, the significance of blockchains and big data as well as their analysis in relation to IoT, is discussed. This article aims to help readers and researchers understand the IoT and its applicability to the real world.

TI  - DGG: A Novel Framework for Crowd Gathering Detection
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2022
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Crowd gathering detection plays an important role in security supervision of public areas. Existing image-processing-based methods are not robust for complex scenes, and deep-learning-based methods for gathering detection mainly focus on the design of the network, which ignores the inner feature of the crowd gathering action. To alleviate such problems, this work proposes a novel framework Detection of Group Gathering (DGG) based on the crowd counting method using deep learning approaches and statistics to detect crowd gathering. The DGG mainly contains three parts, i.e., Detecting Candidate Frame of Gathering (DCFG), Gathering Area Detection (GAD), and Gathering Judgement (GJ). The DCFG is proposed to find the frame index in a video that has the maximum people number based on the crowd counting method. This frame means that the crowd has gathered and the specific gathering area will be detected next. The GAD detects the local area that has the maximum crowd density in a frame with a slide search box. The local area contains the inner feature of the gathering action and represents that the crowd gathering in this local area, which is denoted by grid coordinates in a video frame. Based on the detected results of the DCFG and the GAD, the GJ is proposed to analyze the statistical relationship between the local area and the global area to find the stable pattern for the crowd gathering action. Experiments based on benchmarks show that the proposed DGG has a robust representation of the gathering feature and a high detection accuracy. There is the potential that the DGG can be used in social security and smart city domains.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Most 3D CityGML building models in street-view maps (e.g., Google, Baidu) lack texture information, which is generally used to reconstruct real-scene 3D models by photogrammetric techniques, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mapping. However, due to its simplified building model and inaccurate location information, the commonly used photogrammetric method using a single data source cannot satisfy the requirement of texture mapping for the CityGML building model. Furthermore, a single data source usually suffers from several problems, such as object occlusion. We proposed a novel approach to achieve CityGML building model texture mapping by multiview coplanar extraction from UAV remotely sensed or terrestrial images to alleviate these problems. We utilized a deep convolutional neural network to filter out object occlusion (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles, and trees) and obtain building-texture distribution. Point-line-based features are extracted to characterize multiview coplanar textures in 2D space under the constraint of a homography matrix, and geometric topology is subsequently conducted to optimize the boundary of textures by using a strategy combining Hough-transform and iterative least-squares methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach enables texture mapping for building fa&ccedil;ades to use 2D terrestrial images without the requirement of exterior orientation information; that is, different from the photogrammetric method, a collinear equation is not an essential part to capture texture information. In addition, the proposed approach can significantly eliminate blurred and distorted textures of building models, so it is suitable for automatic and rapid texture updates.

T2  - Infrastructures

PY  - 2022
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
SN  - 2412-3811

AB  - In the last few years, there has been a significant rise in the number of private vehicles ownership, migration of people from rural areas to urban cities, and the rise in the number of under-maintained freeways; all these have added to the perennial problem of traffic congestion. Traffic flow prediction has been recognized as the solution in alleviating and reducing the problem of traffic congestion. In this research, we developed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system trained by particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO) by performing an evaluative performance of the model through traffic flow modelling of vehicles on five freeways (N1,N3,N12,N14&nbsp;and&nbsp;N17) using South Africa Transportation System as a case study. Six hundred and fifty (650) traffic data were collected using inductive loop detectors and video cameras from the five freeways. The traffic data used for developing these models comprises traffic volume, traffic density, speed of vehicles, time, and different types of vehicles. The traffic data were divided into 70% and 30% for the training and validation of the model. The model results show a positively correlated optimal performance between the inputs and the output with a regression value R2&nbsp; of 0.9978 and 0.9860 for the training and testing. The result of this research shows that the soft computing model ANFIS-PSO used in this research can model vehicular traffic flow on freeways. Furthermore, the evidence from this research suggests that the on-peak and off-peak hours are significant determinants of vehicular traffic flow on freeways. The modelling approach developed in this research will assist urban planners in developing practical ways to tackle traffic congestion and assist motorists and pedestrians in travel behaviour decision-making. Finally, the approach used in this study will assist transportation engineers in making constructive and safety dependent guidelines for drivers and pedestrians on freeways.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 6

SN  - 2504-446X

AB  - Manual inspection of infrastructure damages such as building cracks is difficult due to the objectivity and reliability of assessment and high demands of time and costs. This can be automated using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery of damages. Numerous computer vision-based approaches have been applied to address the limitations of crack detection but they have their limitations that can be overcome by using various hybrid approaches based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs), an application of the deep learning (DL) method, display remarkable potential for automatically detecting image features such as damages and are less sensitive to image noise. A modified deep hierarchical CNN architecture has been used in this study for crack detection and damage assessment in civil infrastructures. The proposed architecture is based on 16 convolution layers and a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). For this study, the crack images were collected using UAVs and open-source images of mid to high rise buildings (five stories and above) constructed during 2000 in Sydney, Australia. Conventionally, a CNN network only utilizes the last layer of convolution. However, our proposed network is based on the utility of multiple layers. Another important component of the proposed CNN architecture is the application of guided filtering (GF) and conditional random fields (CRFs) to refine the predicted outputs to get reliable results. Benchmarking data (600 images) of Sydney-based buildings damages was used to test the proposed architecture. The proposed deep hierarchical CNN architecture produced superior performance when evaluated using five methods: GF method, Baseline (BN) method, Deep-Crack BN, Deep-Crack GF, and SegNet. Overall, the GF method outperformed all other methods as indicated by the global accuracy (0.990), class average accuracy (0.939), mean intersection of the union overall classes (IoU) (0.879), precision (0.838), recall (0.879), and F-score (0.8581) values. Overall, the proposed CNN architecture provides the advantages of reduced noise, highly integrated supervision of features, adequate learning, and aggregation of both multi-scale and multilevel features during the training procedure along with the refinement of the overall output predictions.

AB  - The rapid expansion of a country&rsquo;s economy is highly dependent on timely product distribution, which is hampered by terrible traffic congestion. Additional staff are also required to follow the delivery vehicle while it transports documents or records to another destination. This study proposes Delicar, a self-driving product delivery vehicle that can drive the vehicle on the road and report the current geographical location to the authority in real-time through a map. The equipped camera module captures the road image and transfers it to the computer via socket server programming. The raspberry pi sends the camera image and waits for the steering angle value. The image is fed to the pre-trained deep learning model that predicts the steering angle regarding that situation. Then the steering angle value is passed to the raspberry pi that directs the L298 motor driver which direction the wheel should follow. Based upon this direction, L298 decides either forward or left or right or backwards movement. The 3-cell 12V LiPo battery handles the power supply to the raspberry pi and L298 motor driver. A buck converter regulates a 5V 3A power supply to the raspberry pi to be working. Nvidia CNN architecture has been followed, containing nine layers including five convolution layers and three dense layers to develop the steering angle predictive model. Geoip2 (a python library) retrieves the longitude and latitude from the equipped system&rsquo;s IP address to report the live geographical position to the authorities. After that, Folium is used to depict the geographical location. Moreover, the system&rsquo;s infrastructure is far too low-cost and easy to install.

AB  - Today, critical infrastructure is more interconnected, which allows more vulnerabilities in the case of disasters. In addition, the effect of one infrastructure can lead to one or more cascading failures in another infrastructure due to the dependency complexity between them. This article introduces a holistic approach using network indicators and machine learning to better understand the geographical representation of critical infrastructure. Previous work on a similar model was based on a single measure; such as in fashion, this paper introduces four measures utilized to identify the most vital geographic zone in the city. The model aims to increase resilience, focusing on the preparedness phase by assessing the essential nodes of infrastructure, which allows more space to adopt risk mitigation strategies before any disturbance event. Holding in-depth knowledge of the vital zones of small scales and accordingly ranking them will positively improve the overall system resilience.

AB  - In the construction of new smart cities, traditional fire-detection systems can be replaced with vision-based systems to establish fire safety in society using emerging technologies, such as digital cameras, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. In this study, we developed a fire detector that accurately detects even small sparks and sounds an alarm within 8 s of a fire outbreak. A novel convolutional neural network was developed to detect fire regions using an enhanced You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4network. Based on the improved YOLOv4 algorithm, we adapted the network to operate on the Banana Pi M3 board using only three layers. Initially, we examined the originalYOLOv4 approach to determine the accuracy of predictions of candidate fire regions. However, the anticipated results were not observed after several experiments involving this approach to detect fire accidents. We improved the traditional YOLOv4 network by increasing the size of the training dataset based on data augmentation techniques for the real-time monitoring of fire disasters. By modifying the network structure through automatic color augmentation, reducing parameters, etc., the proposed method successfully detected and notified the incidence of disastrous fires with a high speed and accuracy in different weather environments&mdash;sunny or cloudy, day or night. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method can be used successfully for the protection of smart cities and in monitoring fires in urban areas. Finally, we compared the performance of our method with that of recently reported fire-detection approaches employing widely used performance matrices to test the fire classification results achieved.

AB  - There is a constant risk of iron ore collapsing during its transfer between processing stages in beneficiation plants. Existing instrumentation is not only expensive but also complex and challenging to maintain. In this research, we propose using edge artificial intelligence for early detection of landslide risk based on images of iron ore transported on conveyor belts. During this work, we defined the device edge and the deep neural network model. Then, we built a prototype will to collect images that will be used for training the model. This model will be compressed for use in the device edge. This same prototype will be used for field tests of the model under operational conditions. In building the prototype, a real-time clock was used to ensure the synchronization of image records with the plant&rsquo;s process information, ensuring the correct classification of images by the process specialist. The results obtained in the field tests of the prototype with an accuracy of 91% and a recall of 96% indicate the feasibility of using deep learning at the edge to detect the type of iron ore and prevent its risk of avalanche.

AB  - Cloud computing has become integral lately due to the ever-expanding Internet-of-things (IoT) network. It still is and continues to be the best practice for implementing complex computational applications, emphasizing the massive processing of data. However, the cloud falls short due to the critical constraints of novel IoT applications generating vast data, which entails a swift response time with improved privacy. The newest drift is moving computational and storage resources to the edge of the network, involving a decentralized distributed architecture. The data processing and analytics perform at proximity to end-users, and overcome the bottleneck of cloud computing. The trend of deploying machine learning (ML) at the network edge to enhance computing applications and services has gained momentum lately, specifically to reduce latency and energy consumed while optimizing the security and management of resources. There is a need for rigorous research efforts oriented towards developing and implementing machine learning algorithms that deliver the best results in terms of speed, accuracy, storage, and security, with low power consumption. This extensive survey presented on the prominent computing paradigms in practice highlights the latest innovations resulting from the fusion between ML and the evolving computing paradigms and discusses the underlying open research challenges and future prospects.

SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - Particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is an effective metaheuristic that can determine Pareto-optimal solutions. We propose an extended PSO by introducing quantum gates in order to ensure the diversity of particle populations that are looking for efficient alternatives. The quality of solutions was verified in the issue of assignment of resources in the computing cloud to improve the live migration of virtual machines. We consider the multi-criteria optimization problem of deep learning-based models embedded into virtual machines. Computing clouds with deep learning agents can support several areas of education, smart city or economy. Because deep learning agents require lots of computer resources, seven criteria are studied such as electric power of hosts, reliability of cloud, CPU workload of the bottleneck host, communication capacity of the critical node, a free RAM capacity of the most loaded memory, a free disc memory capacity of the most busy storage, and overall computer costs. Quantum gates modify an accepted position for the current location of a particle. To verify the above concept, various simulations have been carried out on the laboratory cloud based on the OpenStack platform. Numerical experiments have confirmed that multi-objective quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization algorithm provides better solutions than the other metaheuristics.

AB  - Intelligent traffic management is an important issue for smart cities. City councils try to implement the newest techniques and performant technologies in order to avoid traffic congestion, to optimize the use of traffic lights, to efficiently use car parking, etc. To find the best solution to this problem, Birmingham City Council decided to allow open-source predictive traffic forecasting by making the real-time datasets available. This paper proposes a multi-agent system (MAS) approach for intelligent urban traffic management in Birmingham using forecasting and classification techniques. The designed agents have the following tasks: forecast the occupancy rates for traffic flow, road junctions and car parking; classify the faults; control and monitor the entire process. The experimental results show that k-nearest neighbor forecasts with high accuracy rates for the traffic data and decision trees build the most accurate model for classifying the faults for their detection and repair in the shortest possible time. The whole learning process is coordinated by a monitoring agent in order to automate Birmingham city&rsquo;s traffic management.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Metro-bikeshare integration, an important way of improving the efficiency of public transportation, has grown rapidly during the last decades in many countries. However, most previous analysis of metro-bikeshare transfer trips were based on limited sample size and the number of recognized metro-bikeshare trips were not sufficient. The primary objective of this study is to derive a method to recognize metro-bikeshare transfer trips. The two data sources are provided by Nanjing Metro Company and Nanjing Public Bicycle Company over the same period from 9&ndash;29 March 2016. The identifying method includes three steps: (1) Matching Card Pairs (2) Filtering Card Pairs and (3) Identifying Card Pairs. The case study indicates that the Support Vector Classification (SVC) performs best with a high prediction accuracy of 95.9% using seamless smartcards. The identifying method is then used to recognize the transfer trips from other types of cards, resulting in 17,022 valid metro-bikeshare transfer trips made by 2948 travelers. Finally, travel patterns extracted from the two groups of identified transfer trips are analyzed comparatively. The method proposed presents new opportunities for analyzing metro-bikeshare transfer trip characteristics.

AB  - Fifth-generation (5G) technology will play a vital role in future wireless networks. The breakthrough 5G technology will unleash a massive Internet of Everything (IoE), where billions of connected devices, people, and processes will be simultaneously served. The services provided by 5G include several use cases enabled by the enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine-type communications, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication. Fifth-generation networks potentially merge multiple networks on a single platform, providing a landscape for seamless connectivity, particularly for high-mobility devices. With their enhanced speed, 5G networks are prone to various research challenges. In this context, we provide a comprehensive survey on 5G technologies that emphasize machine learning-based solutions to cope with existing and future challenges. First, we discuss 5G network architecture and outline the key performance indicators compared to the previous and upcoming network generations. Second, we discuss next-generation wireless networks and their characteristics, applications, and use cases for fast connectivity to billions of devices. Then, we confer physical layer services, functions, and issues that decrease the signal quality. We also present studies on 5G network technologies, 5G propelling trends, and architectures that help to achieve the goals of 5G. Moreover, we discuss signaling techniques for 5G massive multiple-input and multiple-output and beam-forming techniques to enhance data rates with efficient spectrum sharing. Further, we review security and privacy concerns in 5G and standard bodies&rsquo; actionable recommendations for policy makers. Finally, we also discuss emerging challenges and future directions.

TI  - A Two-Stage Approach to Important Area Detection in Gathering Place Using a Novel Multi-Input Attention Network
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - An important area in a gathering place is a region attracting the constant attention of people and has evident visual features, such as a flexible stage or an open-air show. Finding such areas can help security supervisors locate the abnormal regions automatically. The existing related methods lack an efficient means to find important area candidates from a scene and have failed to judge whether or not a candidate attracts people&rsquo;s attention. To realize the detection of an important area, this study proposes a two-stage method with a novel multi-input attention network (MAN). The first stage, called important area candidate generation, aims to generate candidate important areas with an image-processing algorithm (i.e., K-means++, image dilation, median filtering, and the RLSA algorithm). The candidate areas can be selected automatically for further analysis. The second stage, called important area candidate classification, aims to detect an important area from candidates with MAN. In particular, MAN is designed as a multi-input network structure, which fuses global and local image features to judge whether or not an area attracts people&rsquo;s attention. To enhance the representation of candidate areas, two modules (i.e., channel attention and spatial attention modules) are proposed on the basis of the attention mechanism. These modules are mainly based on multi-layer perceptron and pooling operation to reconstruct the image feature and provide considerably efficient representation. This study also contributes to a new dataset called gathering place important area detection for testing the proposed two-stage method. Lastly, experimental results show that the proposed method has good performance and can correctly detect an important area.

AB  - COVID-19 was responsible for devastating social, economic, and political effects all over the world. Although the health authorities imposed restrictions provided relief and assisted with trying to return society to normal life, it is imperative to monitor people&rsquo;s behavior and risk factors to keep virus transmission levels as low as possible. This article focuses on the application of deep learning algorithms to detect the presence of masks on people in public spaces (using RGB cameras), as well as the detection of the caruncle in the human eye area to make an accurate measurement of body temperature (using thermal cameras). For this task, synthetic data generation techniques were used to create hybrid datasets from public ones to train state-of-the-art algorithms, such as YOLOv5 object detector and a keypoint detector based on Resnet-50. For RGB mask detection, YOLOv5 achieved an average precision of 82.4%. For thermal masks, glasses, and caruncle detection, YOLOv5 and keypoint detector achieved an average precision of 96.65% and 78.7%, respectively. Moreover, RGB and thermal datasets were made publicly available.

AB  - This paper reviews the research trends that link the advanced technical aspects of recommendation systems that are used in various service areas and the business aspects of these services. First, for a reliable analysis of recommendation models for recommendation systems, data mining technology, and related research by application service, more than 135 top-ranking articles and top-tier conferences published in Google Scholar between 2010 and 2021 were collected and reviewed. Based on this, studies on recommendation system models and the technology used in recommendation systems were systematized, and research trends by year were analyzed. In addition, the application service fields where recommendation systems were used were classified, and research on the recommendation system model and recommendation technique used in each field was analyzed. Furthermore, vast amounts of application service-related data used by recommendation systems were collected from 2010 to 2021 without taking the journal ranking into consideration and reviewed along with various recommendation system studies, as well as applied service field industry data. As a result of this study, it was found that the flow and quantitative growth of various detailed studies of recommendation systems interact with the business growth of the actual applied service field. While providing a comprehensive summary of recommendation systems, this study provides insight to many researchers interested in recommendation systems through the analysis of its various technologies and trends in the service field to which recommendation systems are applied.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a fact today where a high number of nodes are used for various applications. From small home networks to large-scale networks, the aim is the same: transmitting data from the sensors to the base station. However, these data are susceptible to different factors that may affect the collected data efficiency or the network functioning, and therefore the desired quality of service (QoS). In this context, one of the main issues requiring more research and adapted solutions is the outlier detection problem. The challenge is to detect outliers and classify them as either errors to be ignored, or important events requiring actions to prevent further service degradation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive literature review of recent outlier detection techniques used in the IoTs context. First, we provide the fundamentals of outlier detection while discussing the different sources of an outlier, the existing approaches, how we can evaluate an outlier detection technique, and the challenges facing designing such techniques. Second, comparison and discussion of the most recent outlier detection techniques are presented and classified into seven main categories, which are: statistical-based, clustering-based, nearest neighbour-based, classification-based, artificial intelligent-based, spectral decomposition-based, and hybrid-based. For each category, available techniques are discussed, while highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each of them. The related works for each of them are presented. Finally, a comparative study for these techniques is provided.

TI  - Mobile Charging Strategy for Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks

VL  - 22

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In a wireless sensor network, the sensing and data transmission for sensors will cause energy depletion, which will lead to the inability to complete the tasks. To solve this problem, wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) have been developed to extend the lifetime of the entire network. In WRSNs, a mobile charging robot (MR) is responsible for wireless charging each sensor battery and collecting sensory data from the sensor simultaneously. Thereby, MR needs to traverse along a designed path for all sensors in the WRSNs. In this paper, dual-side charging strategies are proposed for MR traversal planning, which minimize the MR traversal path length, energy consumption, and completion time. Based on MR dual-side charging, neighboring sensors in both sides of a designated path can be wirelessly charged by MR and sensory data sent to MR simultaneously. The constructed path is based on the power diagram according to the remaining power of sensors and distances among sensors in a WRSN. While the power diagram is built, charging strategies with dual-side charging capability are determined accordingly. In addition, a clustering-based approach is proposed to improve minimizing MR moving total distance, saving charging energy and total completion time in a round. Moreover, integrated strategies that apply a clustering-based approach on the dual-side charging strategies are presented in WRSNs. The simulation results show that, no matter with or without clustering, the performances of proposed strategies outperform the baseline strategies in three respects, energy saving, total distance reduced, and completion time reduced for MR in WSRNs.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Accurate and robust scale estimation in visual object tracking is a challenging task. To obtain a scale estimation of the target object, most methods rely either on a multi-scale searching scheme or on refining a set of predefined anchor boxes. These methods require heuristically selected parameters, such as scale factors of the multi-scale searching scheme, or sizes and aspect ratios of the predefined candidate anchor boxes. On the contrary, a centerness-aware anchor-free tracker (CAT) is designed in this work. First, the location and scale of the target object are predicted in an anchor-free fashion by decomposing tracking into parallel classification and regression problems. The proposed anchor-free design obviates the need for hyperparameters related to the anchor boxes, making CAT more generic and flexible. Second, the proposed centerness-aware classification branch can identify the foreground from the background while predicting the normalized distance from the location within the foreground to the target center, i.e., the centerness. The proposed centerness-aware classification branch improves the tracking accuracy and robustness significantly by suppressing low-quality state estimates. The experiments show that our centerness-aware anchor-free tracker, with its appealing features, achieves salient performance in a wide variety of tracking scenarios.

SN  - 2673-4001

AB  - In the past few years, Internet of Things (IoT) devices have evolved faster and the use of these devices is exceedingly increasing to make our daily activities easier than ever. However, numerous security flaws persist on IoT devices due to the fact that the majority of them lack the memory and computing resources necessary for adequate security operations. As a result, IoT devices are affected by a variety of attacks. A single attack on network systems or devices can lead to significant damages in data security and privacy. However, machine-learning techniques can be applied to detect IoT attacks. In this paper, a hybrid machine learning scheme called XGB-RF is proposed for detecting intrusion attacks. The proposed hybrid method was applied to the N-BaIoT dataset containing hazardous botnet attacks. Random forest (RF) was used for the feature selection and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) classifier was used to detect different types of attacks on IoT environments. The performance of the proposed XGB-RF scheme is evaluated based on several evaluation metrics and demonstrates that the model successfully detects 99.94% of the attacks. After comparing it with state-of-the-art algorithms, our proposed model has achieved better performance for every metric. As the proposed scheme is capable of detecting botnet attacks effectively, it can significantly contribute to reducing the security concerns associated with IoT systems.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The demand for wheelchairs has increased recently as the population of the elderly and patients with disorders increases. However, society still pays less attention to infrastructure that can threaten the wheelchair user, such as sidewalks with cracks/potholes. Although various studies have been proposed to recognize such challenges, they mainly depend on RGB images or IMU sensors, which are sensitive to outdoor conditions such as low illumination, bad weather, and unavoidable vibrations, resulting in unsatisfactory and unstable performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel system based on various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically classify the condition of sidewalks using images captured with depth and infrared modalities. Moreover, we compare the performance of training CNNs from scratch and the transfer learning approach, where the weights learned from the natural image domain (e.g., ImageNet) are fine-tuned to the depth and infrared image domain. In particular, we propose applying the ResNet-152 model pre-trained with self-supervised learning during transfer learning to leverage better image representations. Performance evaluation on the classification of the sidewalk condition was conducted with 100% and 10% of training data. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach and bring future research directions.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The increased demand for better accuracy and precision and wider data size has strained current the floating point system and motivated the development of the POSIT system. The POSIT system supports flexible formats and tapered precision and provides equivalent accuracy with fewer bits. This paper examines the POSIT and floating point systems, comparing the performance of 32-bit POSIT and 32-bit floating point systems using IIR notch filter implementation. Given that the bulk of the calculations in the filter are multiplication operations, an Enhanced Radix-4 Modified Booth Multiplier (ERMBM) is implemented to increase the calculation speed and efficiency. ERMBM enhances area, speed, power, and energy compared to the POSIT regular multiplier by 26.80%, 51.97%, 0.54%, and 52.22%, respectively, without affecting the accuracy. Moreover, the Taylor series technique is adopted to implement the division operation along with cosine arithmetic unit for POSIT numbers. After comparing POSIT with floating point, the accuracy of POSIT is 92.31%, which is better than floating point&rsquo;s accuracy of 23.08%. Moreover, POSIT reduces area by 21.77% while increasing the delay. However, when the ERMBM is utilized instead of the POSIT regular multiplier in implementing the filter, POSIT outperforms floating point in all the performance metrics including area, speed, power, and energy by 35.68%, 20.66%, 31.49%, and 45.64%, respectively.

AB  - Nowadays, technology makes it possible to admire objects and artworks exhibited all over the world remotely. We have been able to appreciate this convenience even more in the last period, in which the pandemic has forced us into our homes for a long time. However, visiting art sites in person remains a truly unique experience. Even during on-site visits, technology can help make them much more satisfactory, by assisting visitors during the fruition of cultural and artistic resources. To this aim, it is necessary to monitor the active user for acquiring information about their behavior. We, therefore, need systems able to monitor and analyze visitor behavior. The literature proposes several techniques for the timing and tracking of museum visitors. In this article, we propose a novel approach to indoor tracking that can represent a promising and non-expensive solution for some of the critical issues that remain. In particular, the system we propose relies on low-cost equipment (i.e., simple badges and off-the-shelf RGB cameras) and harnesses one of the most recent deep neural networks (i.e., Faster R-CNN) for detecting specific objects in an image or a video sequence with high accuracy. An experimental evaluation performed in a real scenario, namely, the &ldquo;Exhibition of Fake Art&rdquo; at Roma Tre University, allowed us to test our system on site. The collected data has proven to be accurate and helpful for gathering insightful information on visitor behavior.

AB  - In this paper, an encryption and trust evaluation model is proposed on the basis of a blockchain in which the identities of the Aggregator Nodes (ANs) and Sensor Nodes (SNs) are stored. The authentication of ANs and SNs is performed in public and private blockchains, respectively. However, inauthentic nodes utilize the network&rsquo;s resources and perform malicious activities. Moreover, the SNs have limited energy, transmission range and computational capabilities, and are attacked by malicious nodes. Afterwards, the malicious nodes transmit wrong information of the route and increase the number of retransmissions due to which the SNs&rsquo; energy is rapidly consumed. The lifespan of the wireless sensor network is reduced due to the rapid energy dissipation of the SNs. Furthermore, the throughput increases and packet loss increase with the presence of malicious nodes in the network. The trust values of SNs are computed to eradicate the malicious nodes from the network. Secure routing in the network is performed considering residual energy and trust values of the SNs. Moreover, the Rivest&ndash;Shamir&ndash;Adleman (RSA), a cryptosystem that provides asymmetric keys, is used for securing data transmission. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of high packet delivery ratio.

AB  - Vehicular communication is a promising technology that has been announced as a main use-case of the fifth-generation cellular system (5G). Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is the vehicular communication paradigm that enables the communications and interactions between vehicles and other network entities, e.g., road-side units (RSUs). This promising technology faces many challenges related to reliability, availability and security of the exchanged data. To this end, this work aims to solve the scientific problem of building a vehicular network architecture for reliable delivery of correct and uncompromised data within the V2X concept to improve the safety of road users, using blockchain technology and mobile edge computing (MEC). The proposed work provides a formalized mathematical model of the system, taking into account the interconnection of objects and V2X information channels and an energy-efficient offloading algorithm to manage traffic offloading to the MEC server. The main applications of the blockchain and MEC technology in the developed system are discussed. Furthermore, the developed system, with the introduced sub-systems and algorithms, was evaluated over a reliable environment, for different simulation scenarios, and the obtained results are discussed.

TI  - Estimation of Mean Radiant Temperature in Urban Canyons Using Google Street View: A Case Study on Seoul

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Extreme heat exposure has severe negative impacts on humans, and the issue is exacerbated by climate change. Estimating spatial heat stress such as mean radiant temperature (MRT) is currently difficult to apply at city scale. This study constructed a method for estimating the MRT of street canyons using Google Street View (GSV) images and investigated its large-scale spatial patterns at street level. We used image segmentation using deep learning to calculate the view factor (VF) and project panorama into fisheye images. We calculated sun paths to estimate MRT using panorama images from Google Street View. This paper shows that regression analysis can be used to validate between estimated short-wave, long-wave radiation and the measurement data at seven field measurements in the clear-sky (0.97 and 0.77, respectively). Additionally, we compared the calculated MRT and land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat 8 on a city scale. As a result of investigating spatial patterns of MRT in Seoul, South Korea, we found that a high MRT of street canyons (&gt;59.4 &deg;C) is mainly distributed in open space areas and compact low-rise density buildings where the sky view factor is 0.6&ndash;1.0 and the building view factor (BVF) is 0.35&ndash;0.5, or west-east oriented street canyons with an SVF of 0.3&ndash;0.55. However, high-density buildings (BVF: 0.4&ndash;0.6) or high-density tree areas (Tree View Factor, TVF: 0.6&ndash;0.99) showed low MRT (&lt;47.6). The mapped MRT results had a similar spatial distribution to the LST; however, the MRT was lower than the LST in low tree density or low-rise high-density building areas. The method proposed in this study is suitable for a complex urban environment consisting of buildings, trees, and streets. This will help decision makers understand spatial patterns of heat stress at the street level.

TI  - Federated Learning in Edge Computing: A Systematic Survey

VL  - 22

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Edge Computing (EC) is a new architecture that extends Cloud Computing (CC) services closer to data sources. EC combined with Deep Learning (DL) is a promising technology and is widely used in several applications. However, in conventional DL architectures with EC enabled, data producers must frequently send and share data with third parties, edge or cloud servers, to train their models. This architecture is often impractical due to the high bandwidth requirements, legalization, and privacy vulnerabilities. The Federated Learning (FL) concept has recently emerged as a promising solution for mitigating the problems of unwanted bandwidth loss, data privacy, and legalization. FL can co-train models across distributed clients, such as mobile phones, automobiles, hospitals, and more, through a centralized server, while maintaining data localization. FL can therefore be viewed as a stimulating factor in the EC paradigm as it enables collaborative learning and model optimization. Although the existing surveys have taken into account applications of FL in EC environments, there has not been any systematic survey discussing FL implementation and challenges in the EC paradigm. This paper aims to provide a systematic survey of the literature on the implementation of FL in EC environments with a taxonomy to identify advanced solutions and other open problems. In this survey, we review the fundamentals of EC and FL, then we review the existing related works in FL in EC. Furthermore, we describe the protocols, architecture, framework, and hardware requirements for FL implementation in the EC environment. Moreover, we discuss the applications, challenges, and related existing solutions in the edge FL. Finally, we detail two relevant case studies of applying FL in EC, and we identify open issues and potential directions for future research. We believe this survey will help researchers better understand the connection between FL and EC enabling technologies and concepts.

AB  - Analyzing data related to the conditions of city streets and avenues could help to make better decisions about public spending on mobility. Generally, streets and avenues are fixed as soon as they have a citizen report or when a major incident occurs. However, it is uncommon for cities to have real-time reactive systems that detect the different problems they have to fix on the pavement. This work proposes a solution to detect anomalies in streets through state analysis using sensors within the vehicles that travel daily and connecting them to a fog-computing architecture on a V2I network. The system detects and classifies the main road problems or abnormal conditions in streets and avenues using Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA), comparing roughness against a flat reference. An instrumented vehicle obtained the reference through accelerometry sensors and then sent the data through a mid-range communication system. With these data, the system compared an Artificial Neural Network (supervised MLA) and a K-Nearest Neighbor (Supervised MLA) to select the best option to handle the acquired data. This system makes it desirable to visualize the streets&rsquo; quality and map the areas with the most significant anomalies.

AB  - Following the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Space (IoS), we are now approaching IoP (Internet of People), or the Internet of Individuals, with the integration of chips inside people that link to other chips and the Internet. Low latency is required in order to achieve great service quality in these ambient assisted living facilities. Failures, on the other hand, are not tolerated, and assessing the performance of such systems in a real-world setting is difficult. Analytical models may be used to examine these types of systems even in the early phases of design. The performance of aged care monitoring systems is evaluated using an M/M/c/K queuing network. The model enables resource capacity, communication, and service delays to be calibrated. The proposed model was shown to be capable of predicting the system&rsquo;s MRT (mean response time) and calculating the quantity of resources required to satisfy certain user requirements. To analyze data from IoT solutions, the examined architecture incorporates cloud and fog resources. Different circumstances were analyzed as case studies, with four main characteristics taken into consideration. These case studies look into how cloud and fog resources differ. Simulations were also run to test various routing algorithms with the goal of improving performance metrics. As a result, our study can assist in the development of more sophisticated health monitoring systems without incurring additional costs.

AB  - With the emergence of networked devices, from the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes and cellular phones to vehicles connected to the Internet, there has been an ever-growing expansion of attack surfaces in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In the past decade, there has been a rapid growth in the automotive industry as network-enabled and electronic devices are now integral parts of vehicular ecosystems. These include the development of automobile technologies, namely, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and electric vehicles. Attacks on IoV may lead to malfunctioning of Electronic Control Unit (ECU), brakes, control steering issues, and door lock issues that can be fatal in CAV. To mitigate these risks, there is need for a lightweight model to identify attacks on vehicular systems. In this article, an efficient model of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to detect anomalies in the vehicular system. The dataset used in this study is an In-Vehicle Network (IVN) communication protocol, i.e., Control Area Network (CAN) dataset generated in a real-time environment. The model classifies different types of attacks on vehicles into reconnaissance, Denial of Service (DoS), and fuzzing attacks. Experimentation with performance metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score are compared across a variety of classification models. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other classification models.

AB  - In recent years, technology has advanced to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), where the Internet of things (IoTs), fog computing, computer security, and cyberattacks have evolved exponentially on a large scale. The rapid development of IoT devices and networks in various forms generate enormous amounts of data which in turn demand careful authentication and security. Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the most promising methods for addressing cybersecurity threats and providing security. In this study, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) that categorize, map and survey the existing literature on AI methods used to detect cybersecurity attacks in the IoT environment. The scope of this SLR includes an in-depth investigation on most AI trending techniques in cybersecurity and state-of-art solutions. A systematic search was performed on various electronic databases (SCOPUS, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI). Out of the identified records, 80 studies published between 2016 and 2021 were selected, surveyed and carefully assessed. This review has explored deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques used in IoT security, and their effectiveness in detecting attacks. However, several studies have proposed smart intrusion detection systems (IDS) with intelligent architectural frameworks using AI to overcome the existing security and privacy challenges. It is found that support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) are among the most used methods, due to high accuracy detection another reason may be efficient memory. In addition, other methods also provide better performance such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural networks (NN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). This analysis also provides an insight into the AI roadmap to detect threats based on attack categories. Finally, we present recommendations for potential future investigations.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2227-7080

AB  - Nowadays, many cities have problems with traffic congestion at certain peak hours, which produces more pollution, noise and stress for citizens. Neural networks (NN) and machine-learning (ML) approaches are increasingly used to solve real-world problems, overcoming analytical and statistical methods, due to their ability to deal with dynamic behavior over time and with a large number of parameters in massive data. In this paper, machine-learning (ML) and deep-learning (DL) algorithms are proposed for predicting traffic flow at an intersection, thus laying the groundwork for adaptive traffic control, either by remote control of traffic lights or by applying an algorithm that adjusts the timing according to the predicted flow. Therefore, this work only focuses on traffic flow prediction. Two public datasets are used to train, validate and test the proposed ML and DL models. The first one contains the number of vehicles sampled every five minutes at six intersections for 56 days using different sensors. For this research, four of the six intersections are used to train the ML and DL models. The Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) obtained better results (R-Squared and EV score of 0.93) and took less training time, followed closely by Gradient Boosting then Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), with good metrics results but the longer training time, and finally Random Forest, Linear Regression and Stochastic Gradient. All ML and DL algorithms scored good performance metrics, indicating that they are feasible for implementation on smart traffic light controllers.

AB  - Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm such that client data are processed at the periphery of the network, as close as possible to the originating source. Since the 21st century has come to be known as the century of data due to the rapid increase in the quantity of exchanged data worldwide (especially in smart city applications such as autonomous vehicles), collecting and processing such data from sensors and Internet of Things devices operating in real time from remote locations and inhospitable operating environments almost anywhere in the world is a relevant emerging need. Indeed, edge computing is reshaping information technology and business computing. In this respect, the paper is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of what edge computing is as well as the most relevant edge use cases, tradeoffs, and implementation considerations. In particular, this review article is focused on highlighting (i) the most recent trends relative to edge computing emerging in the research field and (ii) the main businesses that are taking operations at the edge as well as the most used edge computing platforms (both proprietary and open source). First, the paper summarizes the concept of edge computing and compares it with cloud computing. After that, we discuss the challenges of optimal server placement, data security in edge networks, hybrid edge-cloud computing, simulation platforms for edge computing, and state-of-the-art improved edge networks. Finally, we explain the edge computing applications to 5G/6G networks and industrial internet of things. Several studies review a set of attractive edge features, system architectures, and edge application platforms that impact different industry sectors. The experimental results achieved in the cited works are reported in order to prove how edge computing improves the efficiency of Internet of Things networks. On the other hand, the work highlights possible vulnerabilities and open issues emerging in the context of edge computing architectures, thus proposing future directions to be investigated.

AB  - Region-level traffic information can characterize dynamic changes of urban traffic at the macro level. Real-time region-level traffic prediction help city traffic managers with traffic demand analysis, traffic congestion control, and other activities, and it has become a research hotspot. As more vehicles are equipped with GPS devices, remote sensing data can be collected and used to conduct data-driven region-level-based traffic prediction. However, due to dynamism and randomness of urban traffic and the complexity of urban road networks, the study of such issues faces many challenges. This paper proposes a new deep learning model named TmS-GCN to predict region-level traffic information, which is composed of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The GCN part captures spatial dependence among regions, while the GRU part captures the dynamic change of traffic within the region. Model verification and comparison are carried out using real taxi GPS data from Shenzhen. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms both the classic time series prediction model and the deep learning model at different scales.

AB  - Due to the value and importance of patient health records (PHR), security is the most critical feature of encryption over the Internet. Users that perform keyword searches to gain access to the PHR stored in the database are more susceptible to security risks. Although a blockchain-based healthcare system can guarantee security, present schemes have several flaws. Existing techniques have concentrated exclusively on data storage and have utilized blockchain as a storage database. In this research, we developed a unique deep-learning-based secure search-able blockchain as a distributed database using homomorphic encryption to enable users to securely access data via search. Our suggested study will increasingly include secure key revocation and update policies. An IoT dataset was used in this research to evaluate our suggested access control strategies and compare them to benchmark models. The proposed algorithms are implemented using smart contracts in the hyperledger tool. The suggested strategy is evaluated in comparison to existing ones. Our suggested approach significantly improves security, anonymity, and monitoring of user behavior, resulting in a more efficient blockchain-based IoT system as compared to benchmark models.

Finally, transfer learning and group normalization were adopted to accelerate our network training. Experimental results show that the precision, recall and mAP of our method, compared with the original RetinaNet, are improved by 9.08%, 9.09% and 7.32%, respectively.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - Big data analytics can be used by smart cities to improve their citizens&rsquo; liveability, health, and wellbeing. Social surveys and also social media can be employed to engage with their communities, and these can require sophisticated analysis techniques. This research was focused on carrying out a sentiment analysis from social surveys. Data analysis techniques using RStudio and Python were applied to several open-source datasets, which included the 2018 Social Indicators Survey dataset published by the City of Melbourne (CoM) and the Casey Next short survey 2016 dataset published by the City of Casey (CoC). The qualitative nature of the CoC dataset responses could produce rich insights using sentiment analysis, unlike the quantitative CoM dataset. RStudio analysis created word cloud visualizations and bar charts for sentiment values. These were then used to inform social media analysis via the Twitter application programming interface. The R codes were all integrated within a Shiny application to create a set of user-friendly interactive web apps that generate sentiment analysis both from the historic survey data and more immediately from the Twitter feeds. The web apps were embedded within a website that provides a customisable solution to estimate sentiment for key issues. Global sentiment was also compared between the social media approach and the 2016 survey dataset analysis and showed some correlation, although there are caveats on the use of social media for sentiment analysis. Further refinement of the methodology is required to improve the social media app and to calibrate it against analysis of recent survey data.

AB  - The IoT refers to the interconnection of things to the physical network that is embedded with software, sensors, and other devices to exchange information from one device to the other. The interconnection of devices means there is the possibility of challenges such as security, trustworthiness, reliability, confidentiality, and so on. To address these issues, we have proposed a novel group theory (GT)-based binary spring search (BSS) algorithm which consists of a hybrid deep neural network approach. The proposed approach effectively detects the intrusion within the IoT network. Initially, the privacy-preserving technology was implemented using a blockchain-based methodology. Security of patient health records (PHR) is the most critical aspect of cryptography over the Internet due to its value and importance, preferably in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Search keywords access mechanism is one of the typical approaches used to access PHR from a database, but it is susceptible to various security vulnerabilities. Although blockchain-enabled healthcare systems provide security, it may lead to some loopholes in the existing state of the art. In literature, blockchain-enabled frameworks have been presented to resolve those issues. However, these methods have primarily focused on data storage and blockchain is used as a database. In this paper, blockchain as a distributed database is proposed with a homomorphic encryption technique to ensure a secure search and keywords-based access to the database. Additionally, the proposed approach provides a secure key revocation mechanism and updates various policies accordingly. As a result, a secure patient healthcare data access scheme is devised, which integrates blockchain and trust chain to fulfill the efficiency and security issues in the current schemes for sharing both types of digital healthcare data. Hence, our proposed approach provides more security, efficiency, and transparency with cost-effectiveness. We performed our simulations based on the blockchain-based tool Hyperledger Fabric and OrigionLab for analysis and evaluation. We compared our proposed results with the benchmark models, respectively. Our comparative analysis justifies that our proposed framework provides better security and searchable mechanism for the healthcare system.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the energy sector. The new behavior of industrial and non-commercial consumers changes the energy consumption model. In addition, the constraints associated with the coronavirus crisis have led to environmental effects from declining economic activity. The research is based on evidence from around the world showing significant reductions in emissions and improved air quality. This situation requires rethinking the energy development strategy, particularly the construction of smart grids as a leading direction of energy development. Evaluating the efficiency of smart grids is a vital tool for disseminating successful experience in improving their management. This paper proposes an approach to a comprehensive assessment of smart grids based on a comparative analysis of existing methods, taking into account the changes that need to be considered after the experience gained from the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach provides an accurate set of efficiency indicators for assessing smart grids to account for the direct and indirect effects of smart grids&rsquo; implementation. This evaluation approach can be helpful to policymakers in developing energy efficiency programs and implementing energy policy.

AB  - Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has emerged in many aspects of life, such as transportation, healthcare, and even education. IoT technology incorporates several tasks to achieve the goals for which it was developed through smart services. These services are intelligent activities that allow devices to interact with the physical world to provide suitable services to users anytime and anywhere. However, the remarkable advancement of this technology has increased the number and the mechanisms of attacks. Attackers often take advantage of the IoTs&rsquo; heterogeneity to cause trust problems and manipulate the behavior to delude devices&rsquo; reliability and the service provided through it. Consequently, trust is one of the security challenges that threatens IoT smart services. Trust management techniques have been widely used to identify untrusted behavior and isolate untrusted objects over the past few years. However, these techniques still have many limitations like ineffectiveness when dealing with a large amount of data and continuously changing behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes a model for trust management in IoT devices and services based on the simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm. The SMART is used for calculating the trust value, while LSTM is used for identifying changes in the behavior based on the trust threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using accuracy, loss rate, precision, recall, and F-measure on different data samples with different sizes. Comparisons with existing deep learning and machine learning models show superior performance with a different number of iterations. With 100 iterations, the proposed model achieved 99.87% and 99.76% of accuracy and F-measure, respectively.

AB  - Recommender systems can assist with decision-making by delivering a list of item recommendations tailored to user preferences. Context-aware recommender systems additionally consider context information and adapt the recommendations to different situations. A process of context matching, therefore, enables the system to utilize rating profiles in the matched contexts to produce context-aware recommendations. However, it suffers from the sparsity problem since users may not rate items in various context situations. One of the major solutions to alleviate the sparsity issue is measuring the similarity of contexts and utilizing rating profiles with similar contexts to build the recommendation model. In this paper, we summarize the context-aware collaborative filtering methods using context similarity, and deliver an empirical comparison based on multiple context-aware data sets.

AB  - Accidents are continuously reported for autonomous driving vehicles including those with advanced sensors installed. Some of accidents are usually caused by bad weather, poor lighting conditions and non-line-of-sight obstacles. Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) radio technology can significantly improve those weak spots for autonomous driving. This paper describes one of the C-V2X system solutions: Vulnerable Road User Collision Warning (VRUCW) for autonomous driving. The paper provides the system architecture, design logic, network topology, message flow, artificial intelligence (AI) and network security feature.

AB  - Behavior modeling has multiple applications in the intelligent environment domain. It has been used in different tasks, such as the stratification of different pathologies, prediction of the user actions and activities, or modeling the energy usage. Specifically, behavior prediction can be used to forecast the future evolution of the users and to identify those behaviors that deviate from the expected conduct. In this paper, we propose the use of embeddings to represent the user actions, and study and compare several behavior prediction approaches. We test multiple model (LSTM, CNNs, GCNs, and transformers) architectures to ascertain the best approach to using embeddings for behavior modeling and also evaluate multiple embedding retrofitting approaches. To do so, we use the Kasteren dataset for intelligent environments, which is one of the most widely used datasets in the areas of activity recognition and behavior modeling.

AB  - Smart devices are used in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide efficient and reliable access to services. IoT technology can recognize comprehensive information, reliably deliver information, and intelligently process that information. Modern industrial systems have become increasingly dependent on data networks, control systems, and sensors. The number of IoT devices and the protocols they use has increased, which has led to an increase in attacks. Global operations can be disrupted, and substantial economic losses can be incurred due to these attacks. Cyberattacks have been detected using various techniques, such as deep learning and machine learning. In this paper, we propose an ensemble staking method to effectively reveal cyberattacks in the IoT with high performance. Experiments were conducted on three different datasets: credit card, NSL-KDD, and UNSW datasets. The proposed stacked ensemble classifier outperformed the individual base model classifiers.

AB  - Decoupled data and control planes in Software Defined Networks (SDN) allow them to handle an increasing number of threats by limiting harmful network links at the switching stage. As storage, high-end servers, and network devices, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is designed to replace purpose-built network elements with VNFs (Virtualized Network Functions). A Software Defined Network Function Virtualization (SDNFV) network is designed in this paper to boost network performance. Stateful firewall services are deployed as VNFs in the SDN network in this article to offer security and boost network scalability. The SDN controller&rsquo;s role is to develop a set of guidelines and rules to avoid hazardous network connectivity. Intruder assaults that employ numerous socket addresses cannot be adequately protected by these strategies. Machine learning algorithms are trained using traditional network threat intelligence data to identify potentially malicious linkages and probable attack targets. Based on conventional network data (DT), Bayesian Network (BayesNet), Naive-Bayes, C4.5, and Decision Table (DT) algorithms are used to predict the target host that will be attacked. The experimental results shows that the Bayesian Network algorithm achieved an average prediction accuracy of 92.87%, Native&ndash;Bayes Algorithm achieved an average prediction accuracy of 87.81%, C4.5 Algorithm achieved an average prediction accuracy of 84.92%, and the Decision Tree algorithm achieved an average prediction accuracy of 83.18%. There were 451 k login attempts from 178 different countries, with over 70 k source IP addresses and 40 k source port addresses recorded in a large dataset from nine honeypot servers.

AB  - Saffron, one of the most expensive crops on earth, having a vast domain of applications, has the potential to boost the economy of India. The cultivation of saffron has been immensely affected in the past few years due to the changing climate. Despite the use of different artificial methods for cultivation, hydroponic approaches using the IoT prove to give the best results. The presented study consists of potential artificial approaches used for cultivation and the selection of hydroponics as the best approach out of these based on different parameters. This paper also provides a comparative analysis of six present hydroponic approaches. The research work on different factors of saffron, such as the parameters responsible for growth, reasons for the decline in growth, and different agronomical variables, has been shown graphically. A smart hydroponic system for saffron cultivation has been proposed using the NFT (nutrient film technique) and renewable sources of energy.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Arsenic is a deleterious heavy metal that is usually removed from polluted water based on adsorption processes. The latest mode of modeling such a process is to implement artificial intelligence (AI). In the current work, a new artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to predict the adsorption efficiency of arsenate (As(III)) from contaminated water by analyzing different architectures of an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The database for the current study consisted of the experimental data of the adsorption of As(III) by different adsorbents/biosorbents. The data were randomly divided into two sets: 70% for the training phase and 30% for the testing phase. Four statistical evaluation metrics, namely, mean square error (MSE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient (R%), and the determination coefficient (R2) were used for the analysis. The best performing ANFIS model was characterized with the average values of 97.72%, 0.9333, 0.137, and 0.274 of R%, R2, MSE, and RMSE, respectively. In addition, a parametric investigation revealed that the most dominating parameters on the adsorption process efficiency were in the following order: pH, As initial concentration, contact time, adsorbent dosage, inoculum size, and temperature. The results of the current study would be useful in the adsorption process scale-up and optimization.

TI  - Applying Federated Learning in Software-Defined Networks: A Survey
T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Federated learning (FL) is a type of distributed machine learning approacs that trains global models through the collaboration of participants. It protects data privacy as participants only contribute local models instead of sharing private local data. However, the performance of FL highly relies on the number of participants and their contributions. When applying FL over conventional computer networks, attracting more participants, encouraging participants to contribute more local resources, and enabling efficient and effective collaboration among participants become very challenging. As software-defined networks (SDNs) enable open and flexible networking architecture with separate control and data planes, SDNs provide standardized protocols and specifications to enable fine-grained collaborations among devices. Applying FL approaches over SDNs can take use such advantages to address challenges. A SDN control plane can have multiple controllers organized in layers; the controllers in the lower layer can be placed in the network edge to deal with the asymmetries in the attached switches and hosts, and the controller in the upper layer can supervise the whole network centrally and globally. Applying FL in SDNs with a layered-distributed control plane may be able to protect the data privacy of each participant while improving collaboration among participants to produce higher-quality models over asymmetric networks. Accordingly, this paper aims to make a comprehensive survey on the related mechanisms and solutions that enable FL in SDNs. It highlights three major challenges, an incentive mechanism, privacy and security, and model aggregation, which affect the quality and quantity of participants, the security and privacy in model transferring, and the performance of the global model, respectively. The state of the art in mechanisms and solutions that can be applied to address such challenges in the current literature are categorized based on the challenges they face, followed by suggestions of future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first effort in surveying the state of the art in combining FL with SDNs.

AB  - Artificial intelligence techniques are now being applied in different medical solutions ranging from disease screening to activity recognition and computer-aided diagnosis. The combination of computer science methods and medical knowledge facilitates and improves the accuracy of the different processes and tools. Inspired by these advances, this paper performs a literature review focused on state-of-the-art glaucoma screening, segmentation, and classification based on images of the papilla and excavation using deep learning techniques. These techniques have been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity in glaucoma screening based on papilla and excavation images. The automatic segmentation of the contours of the optic disc and the excavation then allows the identification and assessment of the glaucomatous disease&rsquo;s progression. As a result, we verified whether deep learning techniques may be helpful in performing accurate and low-cost measurements related to glaucoma, which may promote patient empowerment and help medical doctors better monitor patients.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a sensing paradigm that allows ordinary citizens to use mobile and wearable technologies and become active observers of their surroundings. MCS services generate a massive amount of data due to the vast number of devices engaging in MCS tasks, and the intrinsic mobility of users can quickly make information obsolete, requiring efficient data processing. Our previous work shows that the Bloom filter (BF) is a promising technique to reduce the quantity of redundant data in a hierarchical edge-based MCS ecosystem, allowing users engaging in MCS tasks to make autonomous informed decisions on whether or not to transmit data. This paper extends the proposed BF algorithm to accept multiple data readings of the same type at an exact location if the MCS task requires such functionality. In addition, we thoroughly evaluate the overall behavior of our approach by taking into account the overhead generated in communication between edge servers and end-user devices on a real-world dataset. Our results indicate that using the proposed algorithm makes it possible to significantly reduce the amount of transmitted data and achieve energy savings up to 62% compared to a baseline approach.
