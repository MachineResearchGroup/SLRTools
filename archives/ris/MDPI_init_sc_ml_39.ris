TI  - Efficient Water Quality Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Water makes up about 70% of the earth&rsquo;s surface and is one of the most important sources vital to sustaining life. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to a deterioration of water quality at an alarming rate, resulting in harrowing diseases. Water quality has been conventionally estimated through expensive and time-consuming lab and statistical analyses, which render the contemporary notion of real-time monitoring moot. The alarming consequences of poor water quality necessitate an alternative method, which is quicker and inexpensive. With this motivation, this research explores a series of supervised machine learning algorithms to estimate the water quality index (WQI), which is a singular index to describe the general quality of water, and the water quality class (WQC), which is a distinctive class defined on the basis of the WQI. The proposed methodology employs four input parameters, namely, temperature, turbidity, pH and total dissolved solids. Of all the employed algorithms, gradient boosting, with a learning rate of 0.1 and polynomial regression, with a degree of 2, predict the WQI most efficiently, having a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.9642 and 2.7273, respectively. Whereas multi-layer perceptron (MLP), with a configuration of (3, 7), classifies the WQC most efficiently, with an accuracy of 0.8507. The proposed methodology achieves reasonable accuracy using a minimal number of parameters to validate the possibility of its use in real time water quality detection systems.

AB  - It is crucial to predict PM2.5 concentration for early warning regarding and the control of air pollution. However, accurate PM2.5 prediction has been challenging, especially in long-term prediction. PM2.5 monitoring data comprise a complex time series that contains multiple components with different characteristics; therefore, it is difficult to obtain an accurate prediction by a single model. In this study, an integrated predictor is proposed, in which the original data are decomposed into three components, that is, trend, period, and residual components, and then different sub-predictors including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and two gated recurrent units are used to separately predict the different components. Finally, all the predictions from the sub-predictors are combined in fusion node to obtain the final prediction for the original data. The results of predicting the PM2.5 time series for Beijing, China showed that the proposed predictor can effectively improve prediction accuracy for long-term prediction.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 21
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Due to the integration of fluctuating weather-dependent energy sources into the grid, the importance of weather and power forecasts grows constantly. This paper describes the implementation of a short-term forecast of solar surface irradiance named SESORA (seamless solar radiation). It is based on the the optical flow of effective cloud albedo and available for Germany and parts of Europe. After the clouds are shifted by applying cloud motion vectors, solar radiation is calculated with SPECMAGIC NOW (Spectrally Resolved Mesoscale Atmospheric Global Irradiance Code), which computes the global irradiation spectrally resolved from satellite imagery. Due to the high spatial and temporal resolution of satellite measurements, solar radiation can be forecasted from 15 min up to 4 h or more with a spatial resolution of 0.05     ∘    . An extensive validation of this short-term forecast is presented in this study containing two different validations based on either area or stations. The results are very promising as the mean RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of this study equals 59 W/m     2     (absolute bias = 42 W/m     2    ) after 15 min, reaches its maximum of 142 W/m     2     (absolute bias = 97 W/m     2    ) after 165 min, and slowly decreases after that due to the setting of the sun. After a brief description of the method itself and the method of the validation the results will be presented and discussed.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Optical sensing that integrates communication and sensing functions is playing a more and more important role in both military and civil applications. Incorporating optical sensing and optical communication, optical sensor networks (OSNs) that undertake the task of high-speed and large-capacity applications and sensing data transmissions have become an important communication infrastructure. However, multiple failures and disasters in OSNs can cause serious sensing provisioning problems. To ensure uninterrupted sensing data transmission, survivability has always been an important research emphasis. This paper focuses on the survivable deployment of OSNs against multiple failures and disasters. We first review and evaluate the existing survivability technologies developed for or applied to OSNs, such as fiber bus protection, self-healing architecture, and 1 + 1 protection. We then elaborate on the disaster-resilient survivability requirement of OSNs. Moreover, we propose a new k-node (edge) sensing connectivity concept, which ensures the connectivity between sensing data and users. Based on k-node (edge) sensing connectivity, the disaster-resilient survivability technologies are developed. The key technologies necessary to implement k-node (edge) sensing connectivity are also elaborated. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly. It can be used to improve the survivability of OSNs. This paper details potential development directions of survivability technologies of optical sensing in OSNs employing AI.

VL  - 9

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Earthmoving is an integral civil engineering operation of significance, and tracking its productivity requires the statistics of loads moved by dump trucks. Since current truck loads&rsquo; statistics methods are laborious, costly, and limited in application, this paper presents the framework of a novel, automated, non-contact field earthmoving quantity statistics (FEQS) for projects with large earthmoving demands that use uniform and uncovered trucks. The proposed FEQS framework utilizes field surveillance systems and adopts vision-based deep learning for full/empty-load truck classification as the core work. Since convolutional neural network (CNN) and its transfer learning (TL) forms are popular vision-based deep learning models and numerous in type, a comparison study is conducted to test the framework&rsquo;s core work feasibility and evaluate the performance of different deep learning models in implementation. The comparison study involved 12 CNN or CNN-TL models in full/empty-load truck classification, and the results revealed that while several provided satisfactory performance, the VGG16-FineTune provided the optimal performance. This proved the core work feasibility of the proposed FEQS framework. Further discussion provides model choice suggestions that CNN-TL models are more feasible than CNN prototypes, and models that adopt different TL methods have advantages in either working accuracy or speed for different tasks.

TI  - PM2.5 Prediction with a Novel Multi-Step-Ahead Forecasting Model Based on Dynamic Wind Field Distance
T2  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health

PY  - 2019
VL  - 16
IS  - 22
SN  - 1660-4601

AB  - Particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5      &mu; m      (PM2.5) has damaged public health globally for a decade. Accurate forecasts of PM2.5 concentration can provide early warnings to prevent the public from hazard exposure. However, existing methods have not considered the available spatiotemporal data sufficiently due to their architecture or inadequate input, and most neglected wind impact on spatiotemporal correlation when selecting related sites. To fill this gap, we proposed a long short-term memory-convolutional neural network based on dynamic wind field distance (LSTM-CNN-DWFD) to predict PM2.5 concentration of a specific site for the next 24 h. A KNN method based on dynamic wind field distance was developed and applied to select highly related sites considering wind impact. A local stateful LSTM model was employed to capture temporal correlations in historical air quality and meteorological data for each related site. Then, these temporal features were integrated as a spatiotemporal matrix, and input into CNN for extracting spatiotemporal correlation features. Weather forecasts were also integrated into the model to promote accuracy. Hourly PM2.5 data from 36 monitoring sites in Beijing, China collected from 1 May 2014 to 30 April 2015 were used as experimental dataset. Six-fold rolling origin method was employed to conduct experiments on each site, and the results of 216 experiments validated the performance of the proposed LSTM-CNN-DWFD model. The mean      R 2      values of the next 1&ndash;6 h prediction were 0.85, 0.81, 0.76, 0.70, 0.64, and 0.59, respectively, showing a decrease trend, indicating that the prediction accuracy decreases as the prediction time increases. Comparisons of LSTM-CNN-DWFD results to results from six other methods show that it delivered higher accuracy PM2.5 predictions, with the mean RMSE (MAE) of 1&ndash;6, 7&ndash;12, and 13&ndash;24 h prediction were 43.90 (29.17), 57.89 (42.16), and 63.14 (47.64), respectively. The results also demonstrate that the sites selected based on dynamic wind field distance are more related to the central site than that based on geographical distance, also contributing to prediction accuracy.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Cattle, buffalo and cow identification plays an influential role in cattle traceability from birth to slaughter, understanding disease trajectories and large-scale cattle ownership management. Muzzle print images are considered discriminating cattle biometric identifiers for biometric-based cattle identification and traceability. This paper presents an exploration of the performance of the bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) approach in cattle identification using local invariant features extracted from a database of muzzle print images. Two local invariant feature detectors&mdash;namely, speeded-up robust features (SURF) and maximally stable extremal regions (MSER)&mdash;are used as feature extraction engines in the BoVW model. The performance evaluation criteria include several factors, namely, the identification accuracy, processing time and the number of features. The experimental work measures the performance of the BoVW model under a variable number of input muzzle print images in the training, validation, and testing phases. The identification accuracy values when utilizing the SURF feature detector and descriptor were 75%, 83%, 91%, and 93% for when 30%, 45%, 60%, and 75% of the database was used in the training phase, respectively. However, using MSER as a points-of-interest detector combined with the SURF descriptor achieved accuracies of 52%, 60%, 67%, and 67%, respectively, when applying the same training sizes. The research findings have proven the feasibility of deploying the BoVW paradigm in cattle identification using local invariant features extracted from muzzle print images.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Movies have become one of the major sources of entertainment in the current era, which are based on diverse ideas. Action movies have received the most attention in last few years, which contain violent scenes, because it is one of the undesirable features for some individuals that is used to create charm and fantasy. However, these violent scenes have had a negative impact on kids, and they are not comfortable even for mature age people. The best way to stop under aged people from watching violent scenes in movies is to eliminate these scenes. In this paper, we proposed a violence detection scheme for movies that is comprised of three steps. First, the entire movie is segmented into shots, and then a representative frame from each shot is selected based on the level of saliency. Next, these selected frames are passed from a light-weight deep learning model, which is fine-tuned using a transfer learning approach to classify violence and non-violence shots in a movie. Finally, all the non-violence scenes are merged in a sequence to generate a violence-free movie that can be watched by children and as well violence paranoid people. The proposed model is evaluated on three violence benchmark datasets, and it is experimentally proved that the proposed scheme provides a fast and accurate detection of violent scenes in movies compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Nowadays, the problem of parking guidance information (PGI) is one of the great challenges of smart cities. Sensor networks have been traditionally used, but they sometimes constitute a high administrative cost. For this reason, this paper presents social parking, a system that is based on the citizens as sensors paradigm, where data are collected by users and are processed using data mining techniques. Moreover, an ontology is used to enable the standardization of information. This way, social parking is compatible with the FIWARE platform. A forecast algorithm was also designed and verified to estimate the number of free parking spots inside a parking lot. With this aim, we used public parking data from eight parking lots in the city of Zaragoza. Client applications allowed testing of all the functions of the parking system. These tests were carried out in three experimental parking lots in the city of M&aacute;laga.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Currently, enhancing sustainability, and in particular reducing energy consumption, is a huge challenge for manufacturing enterprises. The vision of the fourth industrial revolution (so-called &ldquo;industry 4.0&rdquo;) is not only to optimize production and minimize costs, but also to reduce energy consumption and enhance product life-cycle management. To address this challenge, a multi-agent architecture aimed at elaborating predictive and reactive energy-efficient scheduling through collaboration between cyber physical production and energy systems is proposed in this paper. Smart, sustainable decision tools for cyber physical production systems (CPPS) and cyber physical energy systems (CPES) are proposed. The decision tools are data-driven, agent-based models with dynamic interaction. The main aim of agent behaviours in the cyber part of CPPS is to find a predictive and reactive energy-efficient schedule. The role of agents in CPES is to control the energy consumption of connected factories and switch between the different renewable energy sources. Dynamic mechanisms in CPPS and CPES are proposed to adjust the energy consumption of production systems based on the availability of the renewable energy. The proposed approach was validated on a physically distributed architecture using networked embedded systems and real-time data sharing from connected sensors in each cyber physical systems. A series of instances inspired from the literature were tested to assess the performance of the proposed method. The results prove the efficiency of the proposed approach in adapting the energy consumption of connected factories based on a real-time energy threshold.

AB  - With the development of industrialization and urbanization, air pollution in many countries has become more serious and has affected people&rsquo;s health. The air quality has been continuously concerned by environmental managers and the public. Therefore, accurate air quality deterioration warning system can avoid health hazards. In this study, an air quality index (AQI) warning system based on Azure cloud computing platform is proposed. The prediction model is based on DFR (Decision Forest Regression), NNR (Neural Network Regression), and LR (Linear Regression) machine learning algorithms. The best algorithm was selected to calculate the 6 pollutants required for the AQI calculation of the air quality monitoring in real time. The experimental results show that the LR algorithm has the best performance, and the method of this study has a good prediction on the AQI index warning for the next one to three hours. Based on the ACES system proposed, it is hoped that it can prevent personal health hazards and help to reduce medical costs in public.

AB  - Nowadays, the importance of energy management and optimization by means of smart devices has arisen as an important issue. On the other hand, the intelligent application of smart devices stands as a key element in establishing smart cities, which have been suggested as the solution to complicated future urbanization difficulties in coming years. Considering the scarcity of traditional fossil fuels in the near future, besides their ecological problems the new smart grids have demonstrated the potential to merge the non-renewable and renewable energy resources into each other leading to the reduction of environmental problems and optimizing operating costs. The current paper clarifies the importance of smart grids in launching smart cities by reviewing the advancement of micro/nano grids, applications of renewable energies, energy-storage technologies, smart water grids in smart cities. Additionally a review of the major European smart city projects has been carried out. These will offer a wider vision for researchers in the operation, monitoring, control and audit of smart-grid systems.

AB  - Many direct and indirect methods, processes, and sensors available on the market today are used to monitor the occupancy of selected Intelligent Building (IB) premises and the living activities of IB residents. By recognizing the occupancy of individual spaces in IB, IB can be optimally automated in conjunction with energy savings. This article proposes a novel method of indirect occupancy monitoring using CO2, temperature, and relative humidity measured by means of standard operating measurements using the KNX (Konnex (standard EN 50090, ISO/IEC 14543)) technology to monitor laboratory room occupancy in an intelligent building within the Internet of Things (IoT). The article further describes the design and creation of a Software (SW) tool for ensuring connectivity of the KNX technology and the IoT IBM Watson platform in real-time for storing and visualization of the values measured using a Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol and data storage into a CouchDB type database. As part of the proposed occupancy determination method, the prediction of the course of CO2 concentration from the measured temperature and relative humidity values were performed using mathematical methods of Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and Random Tree (using IBM SPSS Modeler) with an accuracy higher than 90%. To increase the accuracy of the prediction, the application of suppression of additive noise from the CO2 signal predicted by CO2 using the Least mean squares (LMS) algorithm in adaptive filtering (AF) method was used within the newly designed method. In selected experiments, the prediction accuracy with LMS adaptive filtration was better than 95%.

AB  - Nowadays, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and this number continues increasing. Consequently, there are more and more scientific publications that analyze health problems of people associated with living in these highly urbanized locations. In particular, some of the recent work has focused on relating people’s health to the quality and quantity of urban green areas. In this context, and considering the huge amount of land area in large cities that must be supervised, our work seeks to develop a deep learning-based solution capable of determining the level of health of the land and to assess whether it is contaminated. The main purpose is to provide health institutions with software capable of creating updated maps that indicate where these phenomena are presented, as this information could be very useful to guide public health goals in large cities. Our software is released as open source code, and the data used for the experiments presented in this paper are also freely available.

To mitigate these problems, the idea of the smart city was born, seeking to provide robust solutions integrating sensors and electronics, information technologies, and communication networks. More particularly, to face transportation challenges, intelligent transportation systems are a vital component in this quest, helped by vehicular communication networks, which offer a communication framework for vehicles, road infrastructure, and pedestrians. The extreme conditions of vehicular environments, nonetheless, make communication between nodes that may be moving at very high speeds very difficult to achieve, so non-deterministic approaches are necessary to maximize the chances of packet delivery. In this paper, we address this problem using artificial intelligence from a hybrid perspective, focusing on both the best next message to replicate and the best next hop in its path. Furthermore, we propose a deep learning&ndash;based router (DLR+), a router with a prioritized type of message scheduler and a routing algorithm based on deep learning. Simulations done to assess the router performance show important gains in terms of network overhead and hop count, while maintaining an acceptable packet delivery ratio and delivery delays, with respect to other popular routing protocols in vehicular networks.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Urban traffic routing is deemed to be a significant challenge in intelligent transportation systems. Existing implementations suffer from several intrinsic issues such as scalability in centralized systems, unnecessary complexity of mechanisms and communication in distributed systems, and lack of privacy. These imply force intensive computational tasks in the traffic control center, continuous communication in real-time with involved stakeholders which require drivers to reveal their location, origin, and destination of their trips. In this paper we present an innovative urban traffic routing framework and reference architecture (multimap traffic control architecture, MuTraff), which is based on the strategical generation and distribution of a set of traffic network maps (traffic weighted multimaps, TWM) to vehicle categories or fleets. Each map in a TWM map set has the same topology but a different distribution of link weights, which are computed by considering policies and constraints that may apply to different vehicle groups. MuTraff delivers a traffic management system (TMS), where a traffic control center generates and distributes maps, while routing computation is performed at the vehicles. We show how this balance between generation, distribution, and routing computation improves scalability, eases communication complexities, and solves former privacy issues. Our study presents case studies in a real city environment for (a) global congestion management using random maps; (b) congestion control on road incidents; and c) emergency fleets routing. We show that MuTraff is a promising foundation framework that is easy to deploy, and is compatible with other existing TMS frameworks.

VL  - 8

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Metropolitan cities are facing many socio-economic problems (e.g., frequent traffic congestion, unexpected emergency events, and even human-made disasters) related to urban crowd flows, which can be described in terms of the gathering process of a flock of moving objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) towards specific destinations during a given time period via different travel routes. Understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban crowd flows is therefore of critical importance to traffic management and public safety, yet it is very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, including spatial dependencies, temporal dependencies, and environmental conditions. In this research, we propose a novel matrix-computation-based method for modeling the morphological evolutionary patterns of urban crowd flows. The proposed methodology consists of four connected steps: (1) defining urban crowd levels, (2) deriving urban crowd regions, (3) quantifying their morphological changes, and (4) delineating the morphological evolution patterns. The proposed methodology integrates urban crowd visualization, identification, and correlation into a unified and efficient analytical framework. We validated the proposed methodology under both synthetic and real-world data scenarios using taxi mobility data in Wuhan, China as an example. Results confirm that the proposed methodology can enable city planners, municipal managers, and other stakeholders to identify and understand the gathering process of urban crowd flows in an informative and intuitive manner. Limitations and further directions with regard to data representativeness, data sparseness, pattern sensitivity, and spatial constraint are also discussed.

AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting the effects of climate change and decreasing the environmental, social and economic costs of energy production are some of the main issues related to the sustainable development of modern society. Energy communities, envisioned to enable local energy exchange between consumers and producers of renewable energy, represent a possible scenario towards a cleaner and sustainable energy system. In this paper, an energy community management model called Power Cloud and presented in previous papers is proposed for a real-world practical application at the University of Calabria. In particular, the implementation of the information and communication technology (ICT) architecture and other enabling technologies, such as the nanogrid and the smart energy box, are discussed in detail. The experiment results show that by adopting the Power Cloud management model it is possible to obtain significant savings in terms of energy cost, which provide benefit for a community, such as a university campus.

AB  - Solar energy is one of the most promising sources of energy that could be used to address distributed supply problems. Global warming and decarbonization are significant global concerns, particularly for countries that are not fossil fuel providers. This paper presents a study focused on Spain, a country with a favorable location with respect to horizontal irradiance. The study addresses the future energy demand forecast and how photovoltaic energy could supply an important part of electricity needs. Our approach focuses on two analyses. First, several traditional statistical techniques are discussed in order to obtain a model that best suits Spanish energy demand forecasts for the future years. Different algorithms are compared in order to determine which is the most appropriate for the considered purpose. Second, the evolution of solar photovoltaic technology in Spain is analyzed. The latitude of Spanish cities makes them suitable for utilizing this kind of technology. In this sense, seasonal and monthly trends are identified with high levels of detail, considering a large historical dataset. The increase of the capacity of electricity generation based on this procedure is evaluated. Finally, a discussion about matching electricity demand forecasts and photovoltaic production is offered. Considering the selected model for the photovoltaic power of Spain, from    5    to     42     GW in 2030, the Spanish production is determined as     81     TWh. The obtained results suggest that a possible energy transition is feasible. However, some challenges have to be considered, such us the design of an effective strategy to store excess energy produced when generation is higher than electricity demand. In this way, the electrical distribution system could be fed by the stored energy when solar energy production is deficient.

AB  - With the rapid development of information technology, the problem of the network security of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become increasingly prominent. In order to solve the intrusion detection problem of massive, high-dimensional, and nonlinear data, this paper proposes an intrusion detection method based on the deep belief network (DBN) optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). First, a classification model based on the DBN is constructed, and the PSO algorithm is then used to optimize the number of hidden layer nodes of the DBN, to obtain the optimal DBN structure. The simulations are conducted on a benchmark intrusion dataset, and the results show that the accuracy of the DBN-PSO algorithm reaches 92.44%, which is higher than those of the support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), deep neural network (DNN), and Adaboost. It can be seen from comparative experiments that the optimization effect of PSO is better than those of the genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, and Bayesian optimization algorithm. The method of PSO-DBN provides an effective solution to the problem of intrusion detection of UAV networks.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Two main approaches exist when deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on resource-constrained IoT devices: either scale a large model down or use a small model designed specifically for resource-constrained environments. Small architectures typically trade accuracy for computational cost by performing convolutions as depth-wise convolutions rather than standard convolutions like in large networks. Large models focus primarily on state-of-the-art performance and often struggle to scale down sufficiently. We propose a new model, namely IoTNet, designed for resource-constrained environments which achieves state-of-the-art performance within the domain of small efficient models. IoTNet trades accuracy with computational cost differently from existing methods by factorizing standard 3 &times; 3 convolutions into pairs of 1 &times; 3 and 3 &times; 1 standard convolutions, rather than performing depth-wise convolutions. We benchmark IoTNet against state-of-the-art efficiency-focused models and scaled-down large architectures on data sets which best match the complexity of problems faced in resource-constrained environments. We compare model accuracy and the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) performed as a measure of efficiency. We report state-of-the-art accuracy improvement over MobileNetV2 on CIFAR-10 of 13.43% with 39% fewer FLOPs, over ShuffleNet on Street View House Numbers (SVHN) of 6.49% with 31.8% fewer FLOPs and over MobileNet on German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) of 5% with 0.38% fewer FLOPs.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The advancement of hardware and software technologies makes it possible to use smartphones or Internet of things for monitoring environments in realtime. In recent years, much effort has been made to develop a smartphone based earthquake early warning system, where low-cost acceleration sensors inside a smartphones are used for capturing earthquake signals. However, because a smartphone comes with a powerful CPU, spacious memory, and several sensors, it is waste of such resources to use it only for detecting earthquakes. Furthermore, because a smartphone is mostly in use during the daytime, the acquired data cannot be used for detecting earthquakes due to human activities. Therefore, in this article, we introduce a stand-alone device equipped with a low-cost acceleration sensor and least computing resources to detect earthquakes. To that end, we first select an appropriate acceleration sensor by assessing the performance and accuracy of four different sensors. Then, we design and develop an earthquake alert device. To detect earthquakes, we employ a simple machine learning technique which trains an earthquake detection model with daily motions, noise data recorded in buildings, and earthquakes recorded in the past. Furthermore, we evaluate the four acceleration sensors by recording two realistic earthquakes on a shake-table. In the experiments, the results show that the developed earthquake alert device can successfully detect earthquakes and send a warning message to nearby devices, thereby enabling proactive responses to earthquakes.

VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Flying ad hoc network (FANET) is a self-organizing wireless network that enables inexpensive, flexible, and easy-to-deploy flying nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to communicate among themselves in the absence of fixed network infrastructure. FANET is one of the emerging networks that has an extensive range of next-generation applications. Hence, FANET plays a significant role in achieving application-based goals. Routing enables the flying nodes to collaborate and coordinate among themselves and to establish routes to radio access infrastructure, particularly FANET base station (BS). With a longer route lifetime, the effects of link disconnections and network partitions reduce. Routing must cater to two main characteristics of FANETs that reduce the route lifetime. Firstly, the collaboration nature requires the flying nodes to exchange messages and to coordinate among themselves, causing high energy consumption. Secondly, the mobility pattern of the flying nodes is highly dynamic in a three-dimensional space and they may be spaced far apart, causing link disconnection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the limited research work of routing schemes in FANETs. Different aspects, including objectives, challenges, routing metrics, characteristics, and performance measures, are covered. Furthermore, we present open issues.

AB  - Traditional handcrafted crowd-counting techniques in an image are currently transformed via machine-learning and artificial-intelligence techniques into intelligent crowd-counting techniques. This paradigm shift offers many advanced features in terms of adaptive monitoring and the control of dynamic crowd gatherings. Adaptive monitoring, identification/recognition, and the management of diverse crowd gatherings can improve many crowd-management-related tasks in terms of efficiency, capacity, reliability, and safety. Despite many challenges, such as occlusion, clutter, and irregular object distribution and nonuniform object scale, convolutional neural networks are a promising technology for intelligent image crowd counting and analysis. In this article, we review, categorize, analyze (limitations and distinctive features), and provide a detailed performance evaluation of the latest convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. We also highlight the potential applications of convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. Finally, we conclude this article by presenting our key observations, providing strong foundation for future research directions while designing convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. Further, the article discusses new advancements toward understanding crowd counting in smart cities using the Internet of Things (IoT).

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Employing league championship optimization (LCA) technique for adjusting the membership function parameters of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is the focal objective of the present study. The mentioned optimization is carried out for better estimation of the soil compression coefficient (SCC) using twelve key factors of soil, namely depth of sample, percentage of sand, percentage of loam, percentage of clay, percentage of moisture content, wet density, dry density, void ratio, liquid limit, plastic limit, plastic Index, and liquidity index. This information is widely useable in designing high-rise buildings located in smart cities. Notably, the used data is collocated from a real-world construction project in Vietnam. The hybrid ensemble of LCA-ANFIS is developed, and the best structure is determined by a three-step sensitivity analysis process. The prediction accuracy of the proposed hybrid model is compared with typical ANFIS to examine the efficiency of the combined LCA. Based on the results, applying the LCA algorithm lead to a 4.88% and 6.19% decrease in prediction error, in terms of root mean square error and mean absolute error, respectively. Moreover, the correlation index rose from 0.7351 to 0.7539, which indicates the higher consistency of the hybrid model results. Due to the acceptable accuracy of the proposed LCA-ANFIS model, it can be a promising alternative to common empirical and laboratory methods.

AB  - Automatic License Plate Recognition has been a recurrent research topic due to the increasing number of cameras available in cities, where most of them, if not all, are connected to the Internet. The video traffic generated by the cameras can be analyzed to provide useful insights for the transportation segment. This paper presents the development of an intelligent vehicle identification system based on optical character recognition (OCR) method to be used on intelligent transportation systems. The proposed system makes use of an intelligent parking system named Smart Parking Service (SPANS), which is used to manage public or private spaces. Using computer vision techniques, the SPANS system is used to detect if the parking slots are available or not. The proposed system makes use of SPANS framework to capture images of the parking spaces and identifies the license plate number of the vehicles that are moving around the parking as well as parked in the parking slots. The recognition of the license plate is made in real-time, and the performance of the proposed system is evaluated in real-time.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper presents a sound source distance estimation (SSDE) method using a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). We approach the sound source distance estimation task as an image classification problem, and we aim to classify a given audio signal into one of three predefined distance classes—one meter, two meters, and three meters—irrespective of its orientation angle. For the purpose of training, we create a dataset by recording audio signals at the three different distances and three angles in different rooms. The CRNN is trained using time-frequency representations of the audio signals. Specifically, we transform the audio signals into log-scaled mel spectrograms, allowing the convolutional layers to extract the appropriate features required for the classification. When trained and tested with combined datasets from all rooms, the proposed model exhibits high classification accuracies; however, training and testing the model in separate rooms results in lower accuracies, indicating that further study is required to improve the method’s generalization ability. Our experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to estimate sound source distances in known environments by classification using the log-scaled mel spectrogram.

AB  - The increasing availability of trajectory recordings has led to the mining of a massive amount of historical track data, allowing for a better understanding of travel behaviors by revealing meaningful motion patterns. In the context of human mobility analysis, the problem of motion prediction assumes a central role and is beneficial for a wide range of applications, including for touristic purposes, such as personalized services or targeted recommendations, and sustainability studies related to crowd management and resource redistribution. This paper tackles a particular case of the trajectory prediction problem, focusing on large-scale mobility traces of short-term foreign tourists. These sparse trajectories, short and non-repetitive, lack spatial and temporal regularity, making prediction analysis based on individual historical motion data unreliable. To face this issue, we hereby propose a deep learning-based approach, taking into account the collective mobility of tourists over the territory. The underlying semantics of motion patterns are captured by means of a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model trained on pre-processed location sequences, aiming to predict the next visited place in the trajectory. We tested the methodology on a real-world big dataset, demonstrating its higher feasibility with respect to traditional approaches.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - To generate indoor as-built building information models (AB BIMs) automatically and economically is a great technological challenge. Many approaches have been developed to address this problem in recent years, but it is far from being settled, particularly for the point cloud segmentation and the extraction of the relationship among different elements due to the complicated indoor environment. This is even more difficult for the low-quality point cloud generated by low-cost scanning equipment. This paper proposes an automatic as-built BIMs generation framework that transforms the noisy 3D point cloud produced by a low-cost RGB-D sensor (about 708 USD for data collection equipment, 379 USD for the Structure sensor and 329 USD for iPad) to the as-built BIMs, without any manual intervention. The experiment results show that the proposed method has competitive robustness and accuracy, compared to the high-quality Terrestrial Lidar System (TLS), with the element extraction accuracy of 100%, mean dimension reconstruction accuracy of 98.6% and mean area reconstruction accuracy of 93.6%. Also, the proposed framework makes the BIM generation workflows more efficient in both data collection and data processing. In the experiments, the time consumption of data collection for a typical room, with an area of 45&ndash;67      m 2     , is reduced to 4&ndash;6 min with an RGB-D sensor from 50&ndash;60 min with TLS. The processing time to generate BIM models is about half minutes automatically, from around 10 min with a conventional semi-manual method.

AB  - With the rise of Internet of Things (IoT), low-cost resource-constrained devices have to be more capable than traditional embedded systems, which operate on stringent power budgets. In order to add new capabilities such as learning, the power consumption planning has to be revised. Approximate computing is a promising paradigm for reducing power consumption at the expense of inaccuracy introduced to the computations. In this paper, we set forth approximate computing features of a processor that will exist in the next generation low-cost resource-constrained learning IoT devices. Based on these features, we design an approximate IoT processor which benefits from RISC-V ISA. Targeting machine learning applications such as classification and clustering, we have demonstrated that our processor reinforced with approximate operations can save power up to 23% for ASIC implementation while at least 90% top-1 accuracy is achieved on the trained models and test data set.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This article introduces a new way of using a fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensor for detecting the presence and number of occupants in the monitored space in a smart home (SH). CO2 sensors are used to determine the CO2 concentration of the monitored rooms in an SH. CO2 sensors can also be used for occupancy recognition of the monitored spaces in SH. To determine the presence of occupants in the monitored rooms of the SH, the newly devised method of CO2 prediction, by means of an artificial neural network (ANN) with a scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) algorithm using measurements of typical operational technical quantities (indoor temperature, relative humidity indoor and CO2 concentration in the SH) is used. The goal of the experiments is to verify the possibility of using the FBG sensor in order to unambiguously detect the number of occupants in the selected room (R104) and, at the same time, to harness the newly proposed method of CO2 prediction with ANN SCG for recognition of the SH occupancy status and the SH spatial location (rooms R104, R203, and R204) of an occupant. The designed experiments will verify the possibility of using a minimum number of sensors for measuring the non-electric quantities of indoor temperature and indoor relative humidity and the possibility of monitoring the presence of occupants in the SH using CO2 prediction by means of the ANN SCG method with ANN learning for the data obtained from only one room (R203). The prediction accuracy exceeded 90% in certain experiments. The uniqueness and innovativeness of the described solution lie in the integrated multidisciplinary application of technological procedures (the BACnet technology control SH, FBG sensors) and mathematical methods (ANN prediction with SCG algorithm, the adaptive filtration with an LMS algorithm) employed for the recognition of number persons and occupancy recognition of selected monitored rooms of SH.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The importance of sustainable development has risen in recent years due to the significant number of people affected by lack of access to essential resources as well as the need to prepare for and adapt to intensifying climate change and rapid urbanization. Modeling frameworks capable of effectively assessing and tracking sustainability lie at the heart of creating effective policies to address these issues. Conventional frameworks, such as the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), that support such policies often involve ranking countries based on a weighted sum of a number of relevant environmental metrics. However, the selection and weighing processes are often biased. Moreover, the ranking process fails to provide policymakers with possible avenues to improve their country&rsquo;s environmental sustainability. This study aimed to address these gaps by proposing a novel data-driven framework to assess the environmental sustainability of countries objectively by leveraging unsupervised learning theory. Specifically, this framework harnesses a clustering technique known as Self-Organized Maps to group countries based on their characteristic environmental performance metrics and track progression in terms of shifts within clusters over time. The results support the hypothesis that the inconsistencies in the EPI calculation can lead to misrepresentations of the relative sustainability of countries over time. The proposed framework, which does not rely on ranking or data transformations, enables countries to make more informed decisions by identifying effective and specific pathways towards improving their environmental sustainability.

AB  - Though the technological advancement of smart city infrastructure has significantly improved urban pedestrians&rsquo; health and safety, there remains a large number of road traffic accident victims, making it a pressing current transportation concern. In particular, unsignalized crosswalks present a major threat to pedestrians, but we lack dense behavioral data to understand the risks they face. In this study, we propose a new model for potential pedestrian risky event (PPRE) analysis, using video footage gathered by road security cameras already installed at such crossings. Our system automatically detects vehicles and pedestrians, calculates trajectories, and extracts frame-level behavioral features. We use k-means clustering and decision tree algorithms to classify these events into six clusters, then visualize and interpret these clusters to show how they may or may not contribute to pedestrian risk at these crosswalks. We confirmed the feasibility of the model by applying it to video footage from unsignalized crosswalks in Osan city, South Korea.

AB  - The stochastic nature of renewable energy sources, especially solar PV output, has created uncertainties for the power sector. It threatens the stability of the power system and results in an inability to match power consumption and production. This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach consisting of different architectures, such as the regular CNN, multi-headed CNN, and CNN-LSTM (CNN-Long Short-Term Memory), which utilizes a sliding window data-level approach and other data pre-processing techniques to make accurate forecasts. The output of the solar panels is linked to input parameters such as irradiation, module temperature, ambient temperature, and windspeed. The benchmarking and accuracy metrics are calculated for 1 h, 1 day, and 1 week for the CNN based methods which are then compared with the results from the autoregressive moving average and multiple linear regression models in order to demonstrate its efficacy in making short-term and medium-term forecasts.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The prediction of electrical power produced in combined cycle power plants is a key challenge in the electrical power and energy systems field. This power production can vary depending on environmental variables, such as temperature, pressure, and humidity. Thus, the business problem is how to predict the power production as a function of these environmental conditions, in order to maximize the profit. The research community has solved this problem by applying Machine Learning techniques, and has managed to reduce the computational and time costs in comparison with the traditional thermodynamical analysis. Until now, this challenge has been tackled from a batch learning perspective, in which data is assumed to be at rest, and where models do not continuously integrate new information into already constructed models. We present an approach closer to the Big Data and Internet of Things paradigms, in which data are continuously arriving and where models learn incrementally, achieving significant enhancements in terms of data processing (time, memory and computational costs), and obtaining competitive performances. This work compares and examines the hourly electrical power prediction of several streaming regressors, and discusses about the best technique in terms of time processing and predictive performance to be applied on this streaming scenario.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Noise pollution is one of the major urban environmental pollutions, and it is increasingly becoming a matter of crucial public concern. Monitoring and predicting environmental noise are of great significance for the prevention and control of noise pollution. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, urban noise monitoring is emerging in the direction of a small interval, long time, and large data amount, which is difficult to model and predict with traditional methods. In this study, an IoT-based noise monitoring system was deployed to acquire the environmental noise data, and a two-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) network was proposed for the prediction of environmental noise under the condition of large data volume. The optimal hyperparameters were selected through testing, and the raw data sets were processed. The urban environmental noise was predicted at time intervals of 1 s, 1 min, 10 min, and 30 min, and their performances were compared with three classic predictive models: random walk (RW), stacked autoencoder (SAE), and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed model outperforms the other three existing classic methods. The time interval of the data set has a close connection with the performance of all models. The results revealed that the LSTM network could reflect changes in noise levels within one day and has good prediction accuracy. Impacts of monitoring point location on prediction results and recommendations for environmental noise management were also discussed in this paper.

TI  - Noise Resilient Outdoor Traffic Light Visible Light Communications System Based on Logarithmic Transimpedance Circuit: Experimental Demonstration of a 50 m Reliable Link in Direct Sun Exposure

PY  - 2020

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The usage of Visible Light Communications (VLC) technology in automotive applications is very promising. Nevertheless, in outdoor conditions, the performances of existing VLC systems are strongly affected by the sun or other sources of light. In such situations, the strong parasitic light can saturate the photosensitive element and block data communication. To address the issue, this article analyzes the usage of an adaptive logarithmic transimpedance circuit as an alternative to the classical linear transimpedance circuit. The simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrate benefits of the proposed technique, as it significantly expands the communication distance and optical noise functionality range of the VLC systems and reduces the possibility of photoelement saturation. As a result, this approach might enable outdoor VLC sensors to work in strong sun conditions, the experimental results confirming its validity not only in the laboratory but also in outdoor conditions. A reliable 50 m communication distance is reported for outdoor sunny conditions using a standard power traffic light VLC emitter and a PIN photodiode VLC sensor.

AB  - City growth goes together with the development of infrastructure, and the power network is one of the most relevant towards economic development. The study of urban infrastructure through the analysis of anthropization coupled with power network growth can produce a tool that supports sustainable infrastructure planning, both economic and environmental. The case study focuses on Ambato, Ecuador, in the period from 1950 to 2019, and assesses quantitatively the changes in the city layout and the evolution of its power network. The data are adjusted to a sigmoid-type objective function through a non-linear least squares problem, that is solved using the Broyden&ndash;Fletcher&ndash;Goldfarb&ndash;Shanno (BFGS) method. Anthropization data show how the urban area grew during the study period: 37% (1950&ndash;1960), 53% (1960&ndash;1970), 80% (1970&ndash;1980), 35% (1980&ndash;1990), 39% (1990&ndash;2000), 38% (2000&ndash;2010), and 11% (2010&ndash;2019), mostly at the expense of agricultural land. The forecast for new power network users by 2050 yields a result of 203,630 total users with a population density of 4850 people/km2. The conclusion is that this type of analysis can help city planners and decision makers further understand city and infrastructure growth dynamics and produce policies that bolster sustainable city growth.

AB  - Traditional teaching based on masterclasses or techniques where the student develops a passive role has proven to be inefficient methods in the learning process. The use of technology in universities helps to generate active learning where the student&rsquo;s interest improves making him the main actor in his education. However, implementing an environment where active learning takes place requires a great deal of effort given the number of variables involved in this objective. To identify these variables, it is necessary to analyze the data generated by the students in search of patterns that allow them to be classified according to their needs. Once these needs are identified, it is possible to make decisions that contribute to the learning of each student; for this, the use of artificial intelligence is considered. These techniques emulate the processes of human thought using structures that contain knowledge and experience of human experts.

AB  - The neighborhood rough set theory was adopted for attributes reduction and the weight distribution of condition attributes based on the concept of importance level. Smart elderly care coverage rate is low in China. A decisive role in the adoption of smart elderly care is still a problem that needs to be addressed. This study contributes to the adoption of smart elderly care was selected as the decision attribute. The remaining attributes are used as conditional attributes and the multi-level symmetric attribute set for assessing acceptance of smart elderly care. Prior studies are not included smart elderly care adoption attributes in multi-levels; hence, this problem needs to be addressed. The results of this study indicate that the condition attribute of gender has the greatest influence on the decision attribute. The condition attribute of living expenses for smart elderly care has the second largest impact on decision attribute. Children&rsquo;s support for the elderly decency of the novel elderly care system and the acceptance of non-traditional elderly care methods belong to the primary condition attribute of traditional concept. The result indicates traditional concepts have a certain impact on the adoption of smart elderly care and a condition attribute of residence also has a slight influence on the symmetric decision attribute. The sensitivity analysis shows the insights for uncertainties and provides as a basis for the analysis of the attributes in the smart elderly care service adoption.

AB  - AI (artificial intelligence)-based analysis of geospatial data has gained a lot of attention. Geospatial datasets are multi-dimensional; have spatiotemporal context; exist in disparate formats; and require sophisticated AI workflows that include not only the AI algorithm training and testing, but also data preprocessing and result post-processing. This complexity poses a huge challenge when it comes to full-stack AI workflow management, as researchers often use an assortment of time-intensive manual operations to manage their projects. However, none of the existing workflow management software provides a satisfying solution on hybrid resources, full file access, data flow, code control, and provenance. This paper introduces a new system named Geoweaver to improve the efficiency of full-stack AI workflow management. It supports linking all the preprocessing, AI training and testing, and post-processing steps into a single automated workflow. To demonstrate its utility, we present a use case in which Geoweaver manages end-to-end deep learning for in-time crop mapping using Landsat data. We show how Geoweaver effectively removes the tedium of managing various scripts, code, libraries, Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, servers, and platforms, greatly reducing the time, cost, and effort researchers must spend on such AI-based workflows. The concepts demonstrated through Geoweaver serve as an important building block in the future of cyberinfrastructure for AI research.

AB  - Precision Agriculture (PA) is an ever-expanding field that takes modern technological advancements and applies it to farming practices to reduce waste and increase output. One advancement that can play a significant role in achieving precision agriculture is wireless technology, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Small, inch scale and low-cost devices can be used to monitor great agricultural areas. In this paper, a system for precision viticulture which uses IoT devices for real-time monitoring is proposed. The different components of the system are programmed properly and the interconnection between them is designed to minimize energy consumption. Wireless sensor nodes measure soil moisture and soil temperature in the field and transmit the information to a base station. If the conditions are optimal for a disease or pest to occur, a drone flies towards the area. When the drone is over the node, pictures are captured and then it returns to the base station for further processing. The feasibility of the system is examined through experimentation in a realistic scenario.

AB  - It is possible to classify students according to the manner they recognize, process, and store information. This classification should be considered when developing adaptive e-learning systems. It also creates a comprehension of the different styles students demonstrate while in the process of learning, which can help adaptive e-learning systems offer advice and instructions to students, teachers, administrators, and parents in order to optimize students&rsquo; learning processes. Moreover, e-learning systems using computational and statistical algorithms to analyze students&rsquo; learning may offer the opportunity to complement traditional learning evaluation methods with new ones based on analytical intelligence. In this work, we propose a method based on deep multi-target prediction algorithm using Felder&ndash;Silverman learning styles model to improve students&rsquo; learning evaluation using feature selection, learning styles models, and multiple target classification. As a result, we present a set of features and a model based on an artificial neural network to investigate the possibility of improving the accuracy of automatic learning styles identification. The obtained results show that learning styles allow adaptive e-learning systems to improve the learning processes of students.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The transition of the energy system into a more efficient state requires innovative ideas to finance new schemes and engage people into adjusting their behavioural patterns concerning consumption. Effective energy management combined with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) open new opportunities for local and regional authorities, but also for energy suppliers, utilities and other obligated parties, or even energy cooperatives, to implement mechanisms that allow people to become more efficient either by producing and trading energy or by reducing their energy consumption. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed connecting energy savings with a digital energy currency. This framework builds reward schemes where the energy end-users could benefit financially from saving energy, by receiving coins according to their real consumption compared to the predicted consumption if no actions were to take place. A pilot appraisal of such a scheme is presented for the case of Bahrain, so as to simulate the behaviour of the proposed framework in order for it to become a viable choice for intelligent energy management in future action plans.

AB  - Estimating air pollution exposure has long been a challenge for environmental health researchers. Technological advances and novel machine learning methods have allowed us to increase the geographic range and accuracy of exposure models, making them a valuable tool in conducting health studies and identifying hotspots of pollution. Here, we have created a prediction model for daily PM2.5 levels in the Greater London area from 1st January 2005 to 31st December 2013 using an ensemble machine learning approach incorporating satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), land use, and meteorological data. The predictions were made on a 1 km &times; 1 km scale over 3960 grid cells. The ensemble included predictions from three different machine learners: a random forest (RF), a gradient boosting machine (GBM), and a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) approach. Our ensemble model performed very well, with a ten-fold cross-validated R2 of 0.828. Of the three machine learners, the random forest outperformed the GBM and KNN. Our model was particularly adept at predicting day-to-day changes in PM2.5 levels with an out-of-sample temporal R2 of 0.882. However, its ability to predict spatial variability was weaker, with a R2 of 0.396. We believe this to be due to the smaller spatial variation in pollutant levels in this area.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 6
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Urban particulate matter forecasting is regarded as an essential issue for early warning and control management of air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, existing methods for PM2.5 concentration prediction neglect the effects of featured states at different times in the past on future PM2.5 concentration, and most fail to effectively simulate the temporal and spatial dependencies of PM2.5 concentration at the same time. With this consideration, we propose a deep learning-based method, AC-LSTM, which comprises a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and attention-based network, for urban PM2.5 concentration prediction. Instead of only using air pollutant concentrations, we also add meteorological data and the PM2.5 concentrations of adjacent air quality monitoring stations as the input to our AC-LSTM. Hence, the spatiotemporal correlation and interdependence of multivariate air quality-related time-series data are learned by the CNN&ndash;LSTM network in AC-LSTM. The attention mechanism is applied to capture the importance degrees of the effects of featured states at different times in the past on future PM2.5 concentration. The attention-based layer can automatically weigh the past feature states to improve prediction accuracy. In addition, we predict the PM2.5 concentrations over the next 24 h by using air quality data in Taiyuan city, China, and compare it with six baseline methods. To compare the overall performance of each method, the mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) are applied to the experiments in this paper. The experimental results indicate that our method is capable of dealing with PM2.5 concentration prediction with the highest performance.

VL  - 9

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The article describes an application of global positioning system (GPS) tracking data (floating bike data) for measuring delays for cyclists at signalized intersections. For selected intersections, we used trip data collected by smartphone tracking to calculate the average delay for cyclists by interpolation between GPS locations before and after the intersection. The outcomes were proven to be stable for different strategies in selecting the GPS locations used for calculation, although GPS locations too close to the intersection tended to lead to an underestimation of the delay. Therefore, the sample frequency of the GPS tracking data is an important parameter to ensure that suitable GPS locations are available before and after the intersection. The calculated delays are realistic values, compared to the theoretically expected values, which are often applied because of the lack of observed data. For some of the analyzed intersections, however, the calculated delays lay outside of the expected range, possibly because the statistics assumed a random arrival rate of cyclists. This condition may not be met when, for example, bicycles arrive in platoons because of an upstream intersection. This justifies that GPS-based delays can form a valuable addition to the theoretically expected values.

AB  - The video created by a surveillance cameras plays a crucial role in crime prevention and examinations in smart cities. The closed-circuit television camera (CCTV) is essential for a range of public uses in a smart city; combined with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies they can turn into smart sensors that help to ensure safety and security. However, the authenticity of the camera itself raises issues of building up integrity and suitability of data. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based system to guarantee the trustworthiness of the stored recordings, allowing authorities to validate whether or not a video has been altered. It helps to discriminate fake videos from original ones and to make sure that surveillance cameras are authentic. Since the distributed ledger of the blockchain records the metadata of the CCTV video as well, it is obstructing the chance of forgery of the data. This immutable ledger diminishes the risk of copyright encroachment for law enforcement agencies and clients users by securing possession and identity.

This was mainly stimulated by the annual Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) competition with its first edition in 2013. All competitions so far involved one or multiple ASC tasks. With a focus on deep learning based ASC algorithms, this article summarizes and groups existing approaches for data preparation, i.e., feature representations, feature pre-processing, and data augmentation, and for data modeling, i.e., neural network architectures and learning paradigms. Finally, the paper discusses current algorithmic limitations and open challenges in order to preview possible future developments towards the real-life application of ASC systems.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In urban areas, the accuracy and reliability of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) vehicle positioning decline due to substantial non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals and multipath effects. Recently, positioning enhancement approaches with supervised GNSS signal type classification based on 3D building model-aided labelling have received widespread attention. Despite the reduced computing costs and improved real-time performance, the strict requirements of 3D building models on accuracy and timeliness limit the popularization of the technology to some extent. Meanwhile, the diversity of anomalous observation sources is beyond the reach of NLOS/multipath detection methods. This paper attempts to construct an alternative framework for quality identification of GNSS observations combining clustering-based anomaly detection and supervised classification, in which the hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm is used to label the offline dataset as normal and anomalous observations without the aid of 3D building models, and the supervised classifier in the online system learns the classification rule for real-time anomaly detection. The experimental results based on the measured vehicle GPS/BeiDou data show that after excluding anomalous observations the single point positioning accuracy of the offline dataset is improved by 87.0%, 45.9%, and 69.6% in the east, north, and up directions, respectively, and the positioning accuracy of two online datasets is improved by 48.4%/45.7%, 39.6%/63.3%, and 49.6%/49.1% in the three directions. Through a large number of comparative experiments and discussion on key issues, it is certified that the proposed method is highly feasible and has great potential in the practical application of urban GNSS vehicle positioning.

AB  - High-speed wired and wireless Internet are one of the useful ways to acquire various types of media data easily. In this circumstance, people also can easily get media data including objects with exposed personal information through the Internet. Exposure of personal information emerges as a social issue. This paper proposes an effective blocking technique that makes it possible to robustly detect target objects with exposed personal information from various types of input images with the use of deep neural computing and to effectively block the detected objects&rsquo; regions. The proposed technique first utilizes the neural computing-based learning algorithm to robustly detect the target object including personal information from an image. It next generates a grid-type mosaic and lets the mosaic overlap the target object region detected in the previous step so as to effectively block the object region that includes personal information. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm robustly detects the target object region with exposed personal information from a variety of input images and effectively blocks the detected region through grid-type mosaic processing. The object blocking technique proposed in this paper is expected to be applied to various application fields such as image security, sustainable anticipatory computing, object tracking, and target blocking.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely applied in modern human life, e.g., smart home and intelligent transportation. However, it is vulnerable to malicious attacks, and the current existing security mechanisms cannot completely protect the IoT. As a security technology, intrusion detection can defend IoT devices from most malicious attacks. However, unfortunately the traditional intrusion detection models have defects in terms of time efficiency and detection efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an improved linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based extreme learning machine (ELM) classification for the intrusion detection algorithm (ILECA). First, we improve the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and then use it to reduce the feature dimensions. Moreover, we use a single hidden layer neural network extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm to classify the dimensionality-reduced data. Considering the high requirement of IoT devices for detection efficiency, our scheme not only ensures the accuracy of intrusion detection, but also improves the execution efficiency, which can quickly identify the intrusion. Finally, we conduct experiments on the NSL-KDD dataset. The evaluation results show that the proposed ILECA has good generalization and real-time characteristics, and the detection accuracy is up to 92.35%, which is better than other typical algorithms.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Due to the increasing consumption of food products and demand for food quality and safety, most food processing facilities in the United States utilize machines to automate their processes, such as cleaning, inspection and grading, packing, storing, and shipping. Machine vision technology has been a proven solution for inspection and grading of food products since the late 1980s. The remaining challenges, especially for small to midsize facilities, include the system and operating costs, demand for high-skilled workers for complicated configuration and operation and, in some cases, unsatisfactory results. This paper focuses on the development of an embedded solution with learning capability to alleviate these challenges. Three simple application cases are included to demonstrate the operation of this unique solution. Two datasets of more challenging cases were created to analyze and demonstrate the performance of our visual inspection algorithm. One dataset includes infrared images of Medjool dates of four levels of skin delamination for surface quality grading. The other one consists of grayscale images of oysters with varying shape for shape quality evaluation. Our algorithm achieved a grading accuracy of 95.0% on the date dataset and 98.6% on the oyster dataset, both easily surpassed manual grading, which constantly faces the challenges of human fatigue or other distractions. Details of the design and functions of our smart camera and our simple visual inspection algorithm are discussed in this paper.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Nowadays, traffic infrastructures and vehicles are connected through the network benefiting from the development of Internet of Things (IoT). Connected automated cars can provide some useful traffic information. An architecture and algorithm of mobile service computing are proposed for traffic state sensing by integration between IoT and transport system models (TSMs). The formation process of queue at this intersection is analyzed based on the state information of connected vehicles and the velocity of shockwave is calculated to predict queue length. The computing results can be delivered to the traffic information edge server. However, not all the vehicles are capable of connecting to the network and will affect the queue length estimation accuracy. At the same time, traffic cameras transmit the traffic image to the edge server and a deep neuron network (DNN) is constructed on the edge server to tackle the traffic image. It can recognize and classify the vehicles in the image but takes several seconds to work with the complex DNN. At last, the final queue length is determined according to the weight of the two computing results. The integrated result is delivered to the traffic light controller and traffic monitoring center cloud. It reveals that the estimation from DNN can compensate the estimation from shockwave when the penetration rate of connected vehicles is low. A testbed is built based on VISSIM, and the evaluation results demonstrate the availability and accuracy of the integrated queue length estimation algorithm.

AB  - This study focuses on the design of a measuring system for monitoring the power quality within the SMART street lighting test polygon at university campuses with relation to testing an adaptive current control strategy for three-phase shunt active power filters. Unlike conventional street lighting, SMART elements are powered 24/7. Due to the electronic character of the power part of such mass appliances, there are increased problems with the power quality of the electric energy. Compared to the current concept of street lighting, there is a significant increase in the content of higher current harmonic components, which cause several problems in the distribution system. The test polygon contains 16 luminaires made by various manufacturers and mounted with various SMART components. Using the polygon control and monitoring system, dynamic load scenarios were selected. These scenarios tested the possibilities of different adaptive current control strategies for three-phase shunt active power filters to improve the power quality of electricity. This study focuses on three adaptive algorithms that respond to dynamic changes of current harmonics level in real-time. The possibility of active filter control was tested using FPGA, mainly due to the low latency of the filter control part.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Due to the rapid increase in human population, the use of energy in daily life is increasing day by day. One solution is to increase the power generation in the same ratio as the human population increase. However, that is usually not possible practically. Thus, in order to use the existing resources of energy efficiently, smart grids play a significant role. They minimize electricity consumption and their resultant cost through demand side management (DSM). Universities and similar organizations consume a significant portion of the total generated energy; therefore, in this work, using DSM, we scheduled different appliances of a university campus to reduce the consumed energy cost and the probable peak to average power ratio. We have proposed two nature-inspired algorithms, namely, the multi-verse optimization (MVO) algorithm and the sine-cosine algorithm (SCA), to solve the energy optimization problem. The proposed schemes are implemented on a university campus load, which is divided into two portions, morning session and evening session. Both sessions contain different shiftable and non-shiftable appliances. After scheduling of shiftable appliances using both MVO and SCA techniques, the simulations showed very useful results in terms of energy cost and peak to average ratio reduction, maintaining the desired threshold level between electricity cost and user waiting time.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Interest in the use of AI for urban innovation continues to grow. Particularly, the rise of smart cities&mdash;urban locations that are enabled by community, technology, and policy to deliver productivity, innovation, livability, wellbeing, sustainability, accessibility, good governance, and good planning&mdash;has increased the demand for AI-enabled innovations. There is, nevertheless, no scholarly work that provides a comprehensive review on the topic. This paper generates insights into how AI can contribute to the development of smarter cities. A systematic review of the literature is selected as the methodologic approach. Results are categorized under the main smart city development dimensions, i.e., economy, society, environment, and governance. The findings of the systematic review containing 93 articles disclose that: (a) AI in the context of smart cities is an emerging field of research and practice. (b) The central focus of the literature is on AI technologies, algorithms, and their current and prospective applications. (c) AI applications in the context of smart cities mainly concentrate on business efficiency, data analytics, education, energy, environmental sustainability, health, land use, security, transport, and urban management areas. (d) There is limited scholarly research investigating the risks of wider AI utilization. (e) Upcoming disruptions of AI in cities and societies have not been adequately examined. Current and potential contributions of AI to the development of smarter cities are outlined in this paper to inform scholars of prospective areas for further research.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - About 15% of the world&rsquo;s population suffers from some form of disability. In developed countries, about 1.5% of children are diagnosed with autism. Autism is a developmental disorder distinguished mainly by impairments in social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Since the cause of autism is still unknown, there have been many studies focused on screening for autism based on behavioral features. Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to present an architecture focused on data integration and analytics, allowing the distributed processing of input data. Furthermore, the proposed architecture allows the identification of relevant features as well as of hidden correlations among parameters. To this end, we propose a methodology able to integrate diverse data sources, even data that are collected separately. This methodology increases the data variety which can lead to the identification of more correlations between diverse parameters. We conclude the paper with a case study that used autism data in order to validate our proposed architecture, which showed very promising results.

AB  - This paper elucidates the development of a deep learning&ndash;based driver assistant that can prevent driving accidents arising from drowsiness. As a precursor to this assistant, the relationship between the sensation of sleep depravity among drivers during long journeys and CO2 concentrations in vehicles is established. Multimodal signals are collected by the assistant using five sensors that measure the levels of CO, CO2, and particulate matter (PM), as well as the temperature and humidity. These signals are then transmitted to a server via the Internet of Things, and a deep neural network utilizes this information to analyze the air quality in the vehicle. The deep network employs long short-term memory (LSTM), skip-generative adversarial network (GAN), and variational auto-encoder (VAE) models to build an air quality anomaly detection model. The deep learning models gather data via LSTM, while the semi-supervised deep learning models collect data via GANs and VAEs. The purpose of this assistant is to provide vehicle air quality information, such as PM alerts and sleep-deprived driving alerts, to drivers in real time and thereby prevent accidents.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The significant increase of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart homes and other smart infrastructure, and the recent attacks on these IoT devices, are motivating factors to secure and protect IoT networks. The primary security challenge to develop a methodology to identify a malicious activity correctly and mitigate the impact of such activity promptly. In this paper, we propose a two-level anomalous activity detection model for intrusion detection system in IoT networks. The level-1 model categorizes the network flow as normal flow or abnormal flow, while the level-2 model classifies the category or subcategory of detected malicious activity. When the network flow classified as an anomaly by the level-1 model, then the level-1 model forwards the stream to the level-2 model for further investigation to find the category or subcategory of the detected anomaly. Our proposed model constructed on flow-based features of the IoT network. Flow-based detection methodologies only inspect packet headers to classify the network traffic. Flow-based features extracted from the IoT Botnet dataset and various machine learning algorithms were investigated and tested via different cross-fold validation tests to select the best algorithm. The decision tree classifier yielded the highest predictive results for level-1, and the random forest classifier produced the highest predictive results for level-2. Our proposed model Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F score for level-1 were measured as 99.99% and 99.90% for level-2. A two-level anomalous activity detection system for IoT networks we proposed will provide a robust framework for the development of malicious activity detection system for IoT networks. It would be of interest to researchers in academia and industry.

The present study focuses on the analysis of the scientific production and performance of the Machine Learning and Big Data (MLBD) concepts. A bibliometric methodology of scientific mapping has been used, based on processes of estimation, quantification, analytical tracking, and evaluation of scientific research. A total of 4240 scientific publications from the Web of Science (WoS) have been analyzed. Our results show a constant and ascending evolution of the scientific production on MLBD, 2018 and 2019 being the most productive years. The productions are mainly in English language. The topics are variable in the different periods analyzed, where &ldquo;machine-learning&rdquo; is the one that shows the greatest bibliometric indicators, it is found in most of motor topics and is the one that offers the greatest line of continuity between the different periods. It can be concluded that research on MLBD is of interest and relevance to the scientific community, which focuses its studies on the branch of machine-learning.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - An accurate estimate of rainfall levels is fundamental in numerous application scenarios: weather forecasting, climate models, design of hydraulic structures, precision agriculture, etc. An accurate estimate becomes essential to be able to warn of the imminent occurrence of a calamitous event and reduce the risk to human beings. Unfortunately, to date, traditional techniques for estimating rainfall levels present numerous critical issues. The algorithm applies the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) directly to the audio signal, using 3 s sliding windows with an offset of only 100 milliseconds. Therefore, by using low cost and low power hardware, the proposed algorithm allows implementing critical high rainfall event alerting mechanisms with short response times and low estimation errors. More specifically, this paper proposes a new approach to rainfall estimation based on the classification of different acoustic timbres that rain produces at different intensities and on CNN. The results obtained on seven classes ranging from &ldquo;No rain&rdquo; to &ldquo;Cloudburst&rdquo; indicate an average accuracy of 75%, which rises to 93% if the misclassifications of the adjacent classes are not considered. Some application contexts concern smart cities for which the integration of an audio sensor inside the luminaire of a street lamp is foreseen, precision agriculture, as well as highway safety, by minimizing the risks of aquaplaning.

AB  - The paper presented the methodology for the construction of a soft sensor used for activated sludge bulking identification. Devising such solutions fits within the current trends and development of a smart system and infrastructure within smart cities. In order to optimize the selection of the data-mining method depending on the data collected within a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), a number of methods were considered, including: artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, boosted trees, and logistic regression. The analysis conducted sought the combinations of independent variables for which the devised soft sensor is characterized with high accuracy and at a relatively low cost of determination. With the measurement results pertaining to the quantity and quality of wastewater as well as the temperature in the activated sludge chambers, a good fit can be achieved with the boosted trees method. In order to simplify the selection of an optimal method for the identification of activated sludge bulking depending on the model requirements and the data collected within the WWTP, an original system of weight estimation was proposed, enabling a reduction in the number of independent variables in a model&mdash;quantity and quality of wastewater, operational parameters, and the cost of conducting measurements.

AB  - The current methods that aim at monitoring the structural health status (SHS) of road pavements allow detecting surface defects and failures. This notwithstanding, there is a lack of methods and systems that are able to identify concealed cracks (particularly, bottom-up cracks) and monitor their growth over time. For this reason, the objective of this study is to set up a supervised machine learning (ML)-based method for the identification and classification of the SHS of a differently cracked road pavement based on its vibro-acoustic signature. The method aims at collecting these signatures (using acoustic-sensors, located at the roadside) and classifying the pavement&rsquo;s SHS through ML models. Different ML classifiers (i.e., multilayer perceptron, MLP, convolutional neural network, CNN, random forest classifier, RFC, and support vector classifier, SVC) were used and compared. Results show the possibility of associating with great accuracy (i.e., MLP = 91.8%, CNN = 95.6%, RFC = 91.0%, and SVC = 99.1%) a specific vibro-acoustic signature to a differently cracked road pavement. These results are encouraging and represent the bases for the application of the proposed method in real contexts, such as monitoring roads and bridges using wireless sensor networks, which is the target of future studies.

AB  - It is necessary to optimize clustering processing of communication big data numerical attribute feature information in order to improve the ability of numerical attribute mining of communication big data, and thus a big data clustering algorithm based on cloud computing was proposed. The cloud extended distributed feature fitting method was used to process the numerical attribute linear programming of communication big data, and the mutual information feature quantity of communication big data numerical attribute was extracted. Combined with fuzzy C-means clustering and linear regression analysis, the statistical analysis of big data numerical attribute feature information was carried out, and the associated attribute sample set of communication big data numerical attribute cloud grid distribution was constructed. Cloud computing and adaptive quantitative recurrent classifiers were used for data classification, and block template matching and multi-sensor information fusion were combined to search the clustering center automatically to improve the convergence of clustering. The simulation results show that, after the application of this method, the information fusion performance of the clustering process was better, the automatic searching ability of the data clustering center was stronger, the frequency domain equalization control effect was good, the bit error rate was low, the energy consumption was small, and the ability of fuzzy weighted clustering retrieval of numerical attributes of communication big data was effectively improved.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Efficient alternatives in energy production and consumption are constantly being investigated and conducted by increasingly strict policies. Buildings have a significant influence on electricity consumption, and their management may contribute to the sustainability of the electricity sector. Additionally, with growing incentives in the distributed generation (DG) and electric vehicle (EV) industries, it is believed that smart buildings (SBs) can play a key role in sustainability goals. In this work, an energy management system is developed to reduce the power demands of a residential building, considering the flexibility of the contracted power of each apartment. In order to balance the demand and supply, the electrical power provided by the external grid is supplemented by microgrids such as battery energy storage systems (BESS), EVs, and photovoltaic (PV) generation panels. Here, a mixed binary linear programming formulation (MBLP) is proposed to optimize the scheduling of the EVs charge and discharge processes and also those of BESS, in which the binary decision variables represent the charging and discharging of EVs/BESS in each period. In order to show the efficiency of the model, a case study involving three scenarios and an economic analysis are considered. The results point to a 65% reduction in peak load consumption supplied by an external power grid and a 28.4% reduction in electricity consumption costs.

AB  - The possibilities of collecting the necessary information using multi-touch cameras and ways to improve road traffic data collection are considered. An increase in the number of vehicles leads to traffic jams, which in turn leads to an increase in travel time, additional fuel consumption and other negative consequences. To solve this problem, it is necessary to have a reliable information collection system and apply modern effective methods of processing the collected information. The technology considered in the article allows taking into account pedestrians crossing the intersection. The purpose of this article is to determine the most important traffic characteristics that affect the traffic capacity of the intersection, in other words, the actual number of passing cars. Throughput is taken as a dependent variable. Based on the results of the regression analysis, a model was developed to predict the intersection throughput taking into account the most important traffic characteristics. Besides, this model is based on the fuzzy logic method and using the Fuzzy TECH 5.81d Professional Edition computer program.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In this paper, an innovative method for managing a smart-community microgrid (SCM) with a centralized electrical storage system (CESS) is proposed. The method consists of day-ahead optimal power flow (DA&ndash;OPF) for day-ahead SCM managing and its subsequent evaluation, considering forecast uncertainties. The DA&ndash;OPF is based on a data forecast system that uses a deep learning (DL) long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The OPF problem is formulated as a mathematical mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. Following this, the developed DA&ndash;OPF strategy was evaluated under possible operations, using a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The MCS allowed us to obtain potential deviations of forecasted data during possible day-ahead operations and to evaluate the impact of the data forecast errors on the SCM, and that of unit limitation and the emergence of critical situations. Simulation results on a real existing rural conventional community endowed with a centralized community renewable generation (CCRG) and CESS, confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed operation method. The economic analysis showed significant benefits and an electricity price reduction for the considered community if compared to a conventional distribution system, as well as the easy applicability of the proposed method due to the CESS and the developed operating systems.

TI  - A Comprehensive Multi-Scenario Routing Algorithm Based on Fuzzy Control Theory in Opportunistic Social Network

AB  - With the flourishing of big data and the 5G era, the amount of data to be transmitted in the communication process is increasing, and end-to-end communication in traditional social networks has been unable to meet the current communication needs. Therefore, in order to improve the success rate of data forwarding, social networks propose that the sender of the message should reasonably choose the next hop node. However, existing routing and forwarding algorithms do not take into account nodes that are live in different scenarios, and the applicable next hop node metrics are also different. These algorithms only consider the forwarding preferences of the nodes during working hours and do not consider the forwarding preferences of the nodes during non-working hours. We propose a routing algorithm based on fuzzy decision theory, which aims at a more accurate decision on selecting the next hop. A routing and forwarding algorithm based on fuzzy decision is proposed in this paper. This algorithm symmetrical divides scenes in opportunistic social networks into working time and non-working time according to real human activity. In addition, metrics are designed symmetrically for these two scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that, in the best case, the proposed scheme presents an average delivery ratio of 0.95 and reduces the average end-to-end delay and average overhead compared with the epidemic routing algorithm, the EIMSTalgorithm, the ICMT algorithm, and the FCNSalgorithm.

TI  - Image Representation Method Based on Relative Layer Entropy for Insulator Recognition
T2  - Entropy

PY  - 2020
VL  - 22
IS  - 4
SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with alternating convolutional, pooling and decimation layers are widely used in computer vision, yet current works tend to focus on deeper networks with many layers and neurons, resulting in a high computational complexity. However, the recognition task is still challenging for insufficient and uncomprehensive object appearance and training sample types such as infrared insulators. In view of this, more attention is focused on the application of a pretrained network for image feature representation, but the rules on how to select the feature representation layer are scarce. In this paper, we proposed a new concept, the layer entropy and relative layer entropy, which can be referred to as an image representation method based on relative layer entropy (IRM_RLE). It was designed to excavate the most suitable convolution layer for image recognition. First, the image was fed into an ImageNet pretrained DCNN model, and deep convolutional activations were extracted. Then, the appropriate feature layer was selected by calculating the layer entropy and relative layer entropy of each convolution layer. Finally, the number of the feature map was selected according to the importance degree and the feature maps of the convolution layer, which were vectorized and pooled by VLAD (vector of locally aggregated descriptors) coding and quantifying for final image representation. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs competitively against previous methods across all datasets. Furthermore, for the indoor scenes and actions datasets, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Nowadays, urban noise emerges as a distinct threat to people&rsquo;s physiological and psychological health. Previous works mainly focus on the measurement and mapping of the noise by using Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASNs) and further propose some methods that can effectively reduce the noise pollution in urban environments. In addition, the research on the combination of environmental noise measurement and acoustic events recognition are rapidly progressing. In a real-life application, there still exists the challenges on the hardware design with enough computational capacity, the reduction of data amount with a reasonable method, the acoustic recognition with CNNs, and the deployment for the long-term outdoor monitoring. In this paper, we develop a novel system that utilizes the WASNs to monitor the urban noise and recognize acoustic events with a high performance. Specifically, the proposed system mainly includes the following three stages: (1) We used multiple sensor nodes that are equipped with various hardware devices and performed with assorted signal processing methods to capture noise levels and audio data; (2) the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) take such captured data as inputs and classify them into different labels such as car horn, shout, crash, explosion; (3) we design a monitoring platform to visualize noise maps, acoustic event information, and noise statistics. Most importantly, we consider how to design effective sensor nodes in terms of cost, data transmission, and outdoor deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can measure the urban noise and recognize acoustic events with a high performance in real-life scenarios.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) forms the foundation of next generation infrastructures, enabling development of future cities that are inherently sustainable. Intrusion detection for such paradigms is a non-trivial challenge which has attracted further significance due to extraordinary growth in the volume and variety of security threats for such systems. However, due to unique characteristics of such systems i.e., battery power, bandwidth and processor overheads and network dynamics, intrusion detection for IoT is a challenge, which requires taking into account the trade-off between detection accuracy and performance overheads. In this context, we are focused at highlighting this trade-off and its significance to achieve effective intrusion detection for IoT. Specifically, this paper presents a comprehensive study of existing intrusion detection systems for IoT systems in three aspects: computational overhead, energy consumption and privacy implications. Through extensive study of existing intrusion detection approaches, we have identified open challenges to achieve effective intrusion detection for IoT infrastructures. These include resource constraints, attack complexity, experimentation rigor and unavailability of relevant security data. Further, this paper is envisaged to highlight contributions and limitations of the state-of-the-art within intrusion detection for IoT, and aid the research community to advance it by identifying significant research directions.

AB  - Recognizing human physical activities from streaming smartphone sensor readings is essential for the successful realization of a smart environment. Physical activity recognition is one of the active research topics to provide users the adaptive services using smart devices. Existing physical activity recognition methods lack in providing fast and accurate recognition of activities. This paper proposes an approach to recognize physical activities using only2-axes of the smartphone accelerometer sensor. It also investigates the effectiveness and contribution of each axis of the accelerometer in the recognition of physical activities. To implement our approach, data of daily life activities are collected labeled using the accelerometer from 12 participants. Furthermore, three machine learning classifiers are implemented to train the model on the collected dataset and in predicting the activities. Our proposed approach provides more promising results compared to the existing techniques and presents a strong rationale behind the effectiveness and contribution of each axis of an accelerometer for activity recognition. To ensure the reliability of the model, we evaluate the proposed approach and observations on standard publicly available dataset WISDM also and provide a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art studies. The proposed approach achieved 93% weighted accuracy with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, which is almost 13% higher than the existing methods.

AB  - Leukemia is a fatal disease that threatens the lives of many patients. Early detection can effectively improve its rate of remission. This paper proposes two automated classification models based on blood microscopic images to detect leukemia by employing transfer learning, rather than traditional approaches that have several disadvantages. In the first model, blood microscopic images are pre-processed; then, features are extracted by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network named AlexNet, which makes classifications according to numerous well-known classifiers. In the second model, after pre-processing the images, AlexNet is fine-tuned for both feature extraction and classification. Experiments were conducted on a dataset consisting of 2820 images confirming that the second model performs better than the first because of 100% classification accuracy.

TI  - A Generic Data-Driven Recommendation System for Large-Scale Regular and Ride-Hailing Taxi Services

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Modern taxi services are usually classified into two major categories: traditional taxicabs and ride-hailing services. For both services, it is required to design highly efficient recommendation systems to satisfy passengers&rsquo; quality of experience and drivers&rsquo; benefits. Customers desire to minimize their waiting time before rides, while drivers aim to speed up their customer hunting. In this paper, we propose to leverage taxi service efficiency by designing a generic and smart recommendation system that exploits the benefits of Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs). Aiming at optimizing three key performance metrics, number of pick-ups, customer waiting time, and vacant traveled distance for both taxi services, the proposed recommendation system starts by efficiently estimating the future customer demands in different clusters of the area of interest. Then, it proposes an optimal taxi-to-region matching according to the location of each taxi and the future requested demand of each region. Finally, an optimized geo-routing algorithm is developed to minimize the navigation time spent by drivers. Our simulation model is applied to the borough of Manhattan and is validated with realistic data. Selected results show that significant performance gains are achieved thanks to the additional cooperation among taxi drivers enabled by VSN, as compared to traditional cases.

AB  - In developed countries, buildings are involved in almost 50% of total energy use and 30% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. The operational energy needs of buildings are highly dependent on various building physical, operational, and functional characteristics, as well as meteorological and temporal properties. Besides physics-based energy modeling of buildings, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to provide faster and higher accuracy estimates, given buildings&rsquo; historic energy consumption data. Looking beyond individual building levels, forecasting building energy performance can help city and community managers have a better understanding of their future energy needs, and to plan for satisfying them more efficiently. Focusing at an urban scale, this research develops a campus energy use prediction tool for predicting the effects of long-term climate change on the energy performance of buildings using AI techniques. The tool comprises four steps: Data Collection, AI Development, Model Validation, and Model Implementation, and can predict the energy use of campus buildings with 90% accuracy. We have relied on energy use data of buildings situated in the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida (FL). To study the impact of climate change, we have used climate properties of three future weather files of Gainesville, FL, developed by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), represented based on their impact: median (year 2063), hottest (2057), and coldest (2041).

PY  - 2020

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In recent years, taking advantage of renewable energy sources (RESs) has increased considerably due to their unique capabilities, such as a flexible nature and sustainable energy production. Prosumers, who are defined as proactive users of RESs and energy storage systems (ESSs), are deploying economic opportunities related to RESs in the electricity market. The prosumers are contracted to provide specific power for consumers in a neighborhood during daytime. This study presents optimal scheduling and operation of a prosumer owns RESs and two different types of ESSs, namely stationary battery (SB) and plugged-in electric vehicle (PHEV). Due to the intermittent nature of RESs and their dependency on weather conditions, this study introduces a weather prediction module in the energy management system (EMS) by the use of a feed-forward artificial neural network (FF-ANN). Linear regression results for predicted and real weather data have achieved 0.96, 0.988, and 0.230 for solar irradiance, temperature, and wind speed, respectively. Besides, this study considers the depreciation cost of ESSs in an objective function based on the depth of charge (DOD) reduction. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, predicted output and the real power of RESs are deployed, and a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is used to solve the presented day-ahead optimization problem. Based on the obtained results, the predicted output of RESs yields a desirable operation cost with a minor difference (US$0.031) compared to the operation cost of the system using real weather data, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed EMS in this study. Furthermore, optimum scheduling with regard to ESSs depreciation term has resulted in the reduction of operation cost of the prosumer and depreciation cost of ESS in the objective function has improved the daily operation cost of the prosumer by $0.8647.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Advancements in protocols, computing paradigms, and electronics have enabled the development of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with high potential for various location-based applications in different fields. One of the most important topics in WSNs is the localization in environments with sensor nodes being scattered randomly over a region. Localization techniques are often challenged by localization latency, efficient energy consumption, accuracy, environmental factors, and others. The objective of this study was to improve the technique for detecting the nearest Bluetooth Low Energy sensor, which would enable the development of more efficient mobile applications for location advertising at fairs, exhibitions, and museums. The technique proposed in this study was based on the iBeacon protocol, and it was tested in a controlled room with three environmental settings regarding the density of obstacles, as well as in a real-world setting at the Expo Museum at Postojna in Slovenia. The results of several independent measures, conducted in the controlled room and in the real-world environment, showed that the proposed algorithm outperformed the standard algorithm, especially in the environments with a medium or high densities of obstacles. The results of this study can be used for the more effective planning of placing beacons in space and for optimizing the algorithms for detecting transmitters in mobile location-based applications that provide users with contextual information based on their current location.

This article pursues the maximization of area coverage and area k-coverage by using computational intelligence algorithms, i.e., a genetic algorithm and a particle swarm optimization algorithm. Their performance was evaluated via comparative simulation tests, made not only against each other but also against two other well-known algorithms. This appraisal was made using statistical testing.

AB  - Short-term load forecasting ensures the efficient operation of power systems besides affording continuous power supply for energy consumers. Smart meters that are capable of providing detailed information on buildings energy consumption, open several doors of opportunity to short-term load forecasting at the individual building level. In the current paper, four machine learning methods have been employed to forecast the daily peak and hourly energy consumption of domestic buildings. The utilized models depend merely on buildings historical energy consumption and are evaluated on the profiles that were not previously trained on. It is evident that developing data-driven models lacking external information such as weather and building data are of great importance under the situations that the access to such information is limited or the computational procedures are costly. Moreover, the performance evaluation of the models on separated house profiles determines their generalization ability for unseen consumption profiles. The conducted experiments on the smart meter data of several UK houses demonstrated that if the models are fed with sufficient historical data, they can be generalized to a satisfactory level and produce quite accurate results even if they only use past consumption values as the predictor variables. Furthermore, among the four applied models, the ones based on deep learning and ensemble techniques, display better performance in predicting daily peak load consumption than those of others.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This paper proposes a video-based smoke detection technique for early warning in antifire surveillance systems. The algorithm is developed to detect the smoke behavior in a restricted video surveillance environment, both indoor (e.g., railway carriage, bus wagon, industrial plant, or home/office) or outdoor (e.g., storage area or parking area). The proposed technique exploits a Kalman estimator, color analysis, image segmentation, blob labeling, geometrical features analysis, and M of N decisor, in order to extract an alarm signal within a strict real-time deadline. This new technique requires just a few seconds to detect fire smoke, and it is 15 times faster compared to the requirements of fire-alarm standards for industrial or transport systems, e.g., the EN50155 standard for onboard train fire-alarm systems. Indeed, the EN50155 considers a response time of at least 60 s for onboard systems. The proposed technique has been tested and compared with state-of-art systems using the open access Firesense dataset developed as an output of a European FP7 project, including several fire/smoke indoor and outdoor scenes. There is an improvement of all the detection metrics (recall, accuracy, F1 score, precision, etc.) when comparing Advanced Video SmokE Detection (AdViSED) with other video-based antifire works recently proposed in literature. The proposed technique is flexible in terms of input camera type and frame size and rate and has been implemented on a low-cost embedded platform to develop a distributed antifire system accessible via web browser.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - To further promote the low-carbon and sustainable development of China&rsquo;s power industry, the Chinese government is vigorously introducing competition into power sales market. Simultaneously, On November 15, 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the &ldquo;Notice on Implementing the Renewable Portfolio Standards (Draft)&rdquo; to propose the implementation of power sales side Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), which cannot be realized without an effective government regulation mechanism. However, information asymmetry and the limited rationality of the regulatory agencies and private power sales companies in the regulation process make the regulatory effect uncertain to the detriment of a sustainable regulation of the power industry. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the regulation mechanism of the RPS policy in China. We considered the competitive relationship between integrated power sales companies and independent power sales companies, and established an evolutionary game model based on a limited rationality. We also analyzed the implementation effects of the static reward penalty mechanism and dynamic reward penalty mechanism, respectively. The system dynamics (SD) simulation results showed that under the static reward penalty mechanism, there is no evolutionary stable equilibrium solution, and there will be volatility that exists in the evolution process. However, the dynamic reward penalty mechanism can effectively solve these problems. What is more, our results implied that governments should formulate appropriate RPS quotas, improve the green certificate trading mechanism, and take into account the market size of power sales while implementing RPS policy.

AB  - A groundbreaking design of radio access networks (RANs) is needed to fulfill 5G traffic requirements. To this aim, a cost-effective and flexible strategy consists of complementing terrestrial RANs with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, several problems must be solved in order to effectively deploy such UAV-based RANs (U-RANs). Indeed, due to the high complexity and heterogeneity of these networks, model-based design approaches, often relying on restrictive assumptions and constraints, exhibit severe limitation in real-world scenarios. Moreover, design of a set of appropriate protocols for such U-RANs is a highly sophisticated task. In this context, machine learning (ML) emerges as a useful tool to obtain practical and effective solutions. In this paper, we discuss why, how, and which types of ML methods are useful for designing U-RANs, by focusing in particular on supervised and reinforcement learning strategies.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper introduces a possible architecture and discusses the research directions for the realization of the Cognitive Perceptual Internet (CPI), which is enabled by the convergence of wired and wireless communications, traditional sensor networks, mobile crowd-sensing, and machine learning techniques. The CPI concept stems from the fact that mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming an outstanding mean for zero-effort world-sensing and digitalization thanks to their pervasive diffusion and the increasing number of embedded sensors. Data collected by such devices provide unprecedented insights into the physical world that can be inferred through cognitive processes, thus originating a digital sixth sense. In this paper, we describe how the Internet can behave like a sensing brain, thus evolving into the Internet of Senses, with network-based cognitive perception and action capabilities built upon mobile crowd-sensing mechanisms. The new concept of hyper-map is envisioned as an efficient geo-referenced repository of knowledge about the physical world. Such knowledge is acquired and augmented through heterogeneous sensors, multi-user cooperation and distributed learning mechanisms. Furthermore, we indicate the possibility to accommodate proactive sensors, in addition to common reactive sensors such as cameras, antennas, thermometers and inertial measurement units, by exploiting massive antenna arrays at millimeter-waves to enhance mobile terminals perception capabilities as well as the range of new applications. Finally, we distillate some insights about the challenges arising in the realization of the CPI, corroborated by preliminary results, and we depict a futuristic scenario where the proposed Internet of Senses becomes true.

AB  - Metro systems play a key role in meeting urban transport demands in large cities. The close relationship between historical weather conditions and the corresponding passenger flow has been widely analyzed by researchers. However, few studies have explored the issue of how to use historical weather data to make passenger flow forecasting more accurate. To this end, an hourly metro passenger flow forecasting model using a deep long short-term memory neural network (LSTM_NN) was developed. The optimized traditional input variables, including the different temporal data and historical passenger flow data, were combined with weather variables for data modeling. A comprehensive analysis of the weather impacts on short-term metro passenger flow forecasting is discussed in this paper. The experimental results confirm that weather variables have a significant effect on passenger flow forecasting. It is interesting to find out that the previous variables of one-hour temperature and wind speed are the two most important weather variables to obtain more accurate forecasting results on rainy days at Taipei Main Station, which is a primary interchange station in Taipei. Compared to the four widely used algorithms, the deep LSTM_NN is an extremely powerful method, which has the capability of making more accurate forecasts when suitable weather variables are included.

AB  - Smart, secure and energy-efficient data collection (DC) processes are key to the realization of the full potentials of future Internet of Things (FIoT)-based systems. Currently, challenges in this domain have motivated research efforts towards providing cognitive solutions for IoT usage. One such solution, termed cognitive sensing (CS) describes the use of smart sensors to intelligently perceive inputs from the environment. Further, CS has been proposed for use in FIoT in order to facilitate smart, secure and energy-efficient data collection processes. In this article, we provide a survey of different Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques used over the last decade to provide cognitive sensing solutions for different FIoT applications. We present some state-of-the-art approaches, potentials, and challenges of AI techniques for the identified solutions. This survey contributes to a better understanding of AI techniques deployed for cognitive sensing in FIoT as well as future research directions in this regard.

AB  - The evolution of the Internet of Things is significantly affected by legal restrictions imposed for personal data handling, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The main purpose of this regulation is to provide people in the digital age greater control over their personal data, with their freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent to collect and process the data concerning them. ADVOCATE is an advanced framework that fully complies with the requirements of GDPR, which, with the extensive use of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies, aims to provide an environment that will support users in maintaining control of their personal data in the IoT ecosystem. This paper proposes and presents the Intelligent Policies Analysis Mechanism (IPAM) of the ADVOCATE framework, which, in an intelligent and fully automated manner, can identify conflicting rules or consents of the user, which may lead to the collection of personal data that can be used for profiling. In order to clearly identify and implement IPAM, the problem of recording user data from smart entertainment devices using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) was simulated. FCMs are an intelligent decision-making system that simulates the processes of a complex system, modeling the correlation base, knowing the behavioral and balance specialists of the system. Respectively, identifying conflicting rules that can lead to a profile, training is done using Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), which are highly efficient neural systems of small and flexible architecture that can work optimally in complex environments.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - This article reviewed the state-of-the-art applications of the Internet of things (IoT) technology applied in homes for making them smart, automated, and digitalized in many respects. The literature presented various applications, systems, or methods and reported the results of using IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and geographic information system (GIS) at homes. Because the technology has been advancing and users are experiencing IoT boom for smart built environment applications, especially smart homes and smart energy systems, it is necessary to identify the gaps, relation between current methods, and provide a coherent instruction of the whole process of designing smart homes. This article reviewed relevant papers within databases, such as Scopus, including journal papers published in between 2010 and 2019. These papers were then analyzed in terms of bibliography and content to identify more related systems, practices, and contributors. A designed systematic review method was used to identify and select the relevant papers, which were then reviewed for their content by means of coding. The presented systematic critical review focuses on systems developed and technologies used for smart homes. The main question is &rdquo;What has been learned from a decade trailing smart system developments in different fields?&rdquo;. We found that there is a considerable gap in the integration of AI and IoT and the use of geospatial data in smart home development. It was also found that there is a large gap in the literature in terms of limited integrated systems for energy efficiency and aged care system development. This article would enable researchers and professionals to fully understand those gaps in IoT-based environments and suggest ways to fill the gaps while designing smart homes where users have a higher level of thermal comfort while saving energy and greenhouse gas emissions. This article also raised new challenging questions on how IoT and existing developed systems could be improved and be further developed to address other issues of energy saving, which can steer the research direction to full smart systems. This would significantly help to design fully automated assistive systems to improve quality of life and decrease energy consumption.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In the intelligent traffic system, real-time and accurate detections of vehicles in images and video data are very important and challenging work. Especially in situations with complex scenes, different models, and high density, it is difficult to accurately locate and classify these vehicles during traffic flows. Therefore, we propose a single-stage deep neural network YOLOv3-DL, which is based on the Tensorflow framework to improve this problem. The network structure is optimized by introducing the idea of spatial pyramid pooling, then the loss function is redefined, and a weight regularization method is introduced, for that, the real-time detections and statistics of traffic flows can be implemented effectively. The optimization algorithm we use is the DL-CAR data set for end-to-end network training and experiments with data sets under different scenarios and weathers. The analyses of experimental data show that the optimized algorithm can improve the vehicles&rsquo; detection accuracy on the test set by 3.86%. Experiments on test sets in different environments have improved the detection accuracy rate by 4.53%, indicating that the algorithm has high robustness. At the same time, the detection accuracy and speed of the investigated algorithm are higher than other algorithms, indicating that the algorithm has higher detection performance.

AB  - Multiple nations have implemented policies for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction since the 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015. In this convention, participants voluntarily agreed to a new climate regime that aimed to decrease GHG emissions. Subsequently, a reduction in GHG emissions with specific reduction technologies (renewable energy) to decrease energy consumption has become a necessity and not a choice. With the launch of the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) in 2015, Korea has certified and financed GHG reduction projects to decrease emissions. To help the user make informed decisions for economic and environmental benefits from the use of renewable energy, an assessment model was developed. This study establishes a simple assessment method (SAM), an assessment database (DB) of 1199 GHG reduction technologies implemented in Korea, and a machine learning-based GHG reduction technology assessment model (GRTM). Additionally, we make suggestions on how to evaluate economic benefits, which can be obtained in conjunction with the environmental benefits of GHG reduction technology. Finally, we validate the applicability of the assessment model on a public building in Korea.

TI  - A Novel Accurate and Fast Converging Deep Learning-Based Model for Electrical Energy Consumption Forecasting in a Smart Grid
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 9
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Energy consumption forecasting is of prime importance for the restructured environment of energy management in the electricity market. Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient energy management in the smart grid (SG); however, the energy consumption pattern is non-linear with a high level of uncertainty and volatility. Forecasting such complex patterns requires accurate and fast forecasting models. In this paper, a novel hybrid electrical energy consumption forecasting model is proposed based on a deep learning model known as factored conditional restricted Boltzmann machine (FCRBM). The deep learning-based FCRBM model uses a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and a multivariate autoregressive technique for the network training. The proposed model predicts future electrical energy consumption for efficient energy management in the SG. The proposed model is a novel hybrid model comprising four modules: (i) data processing and features selection module, (ii) deep learning-based FCRBM forecasting module, (iii) genetic wind driven optimization (GWDO) algorithm-based optimization module, and (iv) utilization module. The proposed hybrid model, called FS-FCRBM-GWDO, is tested and evaluated on real power grid data of USA in terms of four performance metrics: mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD), variance, correlation coefficient, and convergence rate. Simulation results validate that the proposed hybrid FS-FCRBM-GWDO model has superior performance than existing models such as accurate fast converging short-term load forecasting (AFC-STLF) model, mutual information-modified enhanced differential evolution algorithm-artificial neural network (MI-mEDE-ANN)-based model, features selection-ANN (FS-ANN)-based model, and Bi-level model, in terms of forecast accuracy and convergence rate.

AB  - In this study, the factors that affect the implementation of intelligent systems in motor production lines are analyzed. A motor production line located in Vietnam is used as the research object. The research methods include secondary data collection, field study, and interviews. This study demonstrates the following: firstly, the implementation of intelligent systems in motor production lines is heading toward Industry 4.0. Secondly, it is proposed that three functional systems&mdash;robot arm, image recognition, and big data analysis&mdash;can be introduced in the motor production line. This study analyzes the process involved in coil and motor production lines and attempts to combine intelligent system functions. It is expected that in the future, manpower will be reduced, production line productivity will increase, and intelligent production lines will be proposed. The factors that affect the introduction of intelligent systems in motor production lines are improved, and the importance of intelligent systems, which has been rarely considered in previous studies, is highlighted. In the implementation criteria of the intelligent system in the process management of the motor production line, this study provides some suggestions (to coil and motor assembly line) for the production process management. These suggestions can be provided as a reference for production lines that acquaint with intelligent systems.

AB  - Over the years, the flourish of crowd computing has enabled enterprises to accomplish computing tasks through crowdsourcing in a large-scale and high-quality manner, and therefore how to efficiently and securely implement crowd computing becomes a hotspot. Some recent work innovatively adopted a P2P (peer-to-peer) network as the communication environment of crowdsourcing. Based on its decentralized control, issues like single-point-of-failure or DDoS attack can be overcome to some extent, but the huge computing capacity and storage costs required by this scheme is always unbearable. Federated learning is a distributed machine learning that supports local storage of data, and clients implement training through interactive gradient values. In our work, we combine blockchain with federated learning and propose a crowdsourcing framework named CrowdSFL, that users can implement crowdsourcing with less overhead and higher security. In addition, to protect the privacy of participants, we design a new re-encryption algorithm based on Elgamal to ensure that interactive values and other information will not be exposed to other participants outside the workflow. Finally, we have proved through experiments that our framework is superior to some similar work in accuracy, efficiency, and overhead.

AB  - A heavy workload is required for sample collection for urban land use classification, and researchers are in urgent need of sampling strategies as a guide to achieve more effective work. In this paper, we make use of an urban land use survey to obtain a complete sample set of a city, test the impact of different training and validation sample sizes on the accuracy, and summarize the sampling strategy. The following conclusions are drawn based on our systematic analysis in Shenzhen. (1) For the best classification accuracy, the number of training samples should be no less than 40% of the total number of parcels or no less than 5500 parcels. For the best labor cost performance, the number should be no less than 7% or no less than 900. (2) The accuracy evaluation is stable and reliable and requires validation sample numbers of no less than 10% of the total or no less than 1200. (3) Samples with a purity of 60&ndash;90% are preferred, and the classification effectiveness is better in samples with a purity greater than 90% under the same number. (4) If spatial equilibrium sampling cannot be carried out, sampling areas with complex land use patterns should be preferred.

AB  - Smart cities follow different strategies to face public health challenges associated with socio-economic objectives. Buildings play a crucial role in smart cities and are closely related to people&rsquo;s health. Moreover, they are equally essential to meet sustainable objectives. People spend most of their time indoors. Therefore, indoor air quality has a critical impact on health and well-being. With the increasing population of elders, ambient-assisted living systems are required to promote occupational health and well-being. Furthermore, living environments must incorporate monitoring systems to detect unfavorable indoor quality scenarios in useful time. This paper reviews the current state of the art on indoor air quality monitoring systems based on Internet of Things and wireless sensor networks in the last five years (2014&ndash;2019). This document focuses on the architecture, microcontrollers, connectivity, and sensors used by these systems. The main contribution is to synthesize the existing body of knowledge and identify common threads and gaps that open up new significant and challenging future research directions. The results show that 57% of the indoor air quality monitoring systems are based on Arduino, 53% of the systems use Internet of Things, and WSN architectures represent 33%. The CO2 and PM monitoring sensors are the most monitored parameters in the analyzed literature, corresponding to 67% and 29%, respectively.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Nowadays, communication engineering technology is merging with the Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of numerous connected devices (referred to as things) around the world. Many researchers have shown significant growth of sensor deployments for multiple smart engineering technologies, such as smart-healthcare, smart-industries, smart-cities, and smart-transportation, etc. In such intelligent engineering technologies, sensors continuously generate a bunch of messages in the network. To enhance the value of the data in the messages, we must know the actuality of the data embedded inside the messages. For this purpose, the contextual information of the data creates a vital challenge. Recently, context-aware computing has emerged to be fruitful in dealing with sensor information. In the ubiquitous computing domain, location is commonly considered one of the most essential sources of context. However, whenever users or applications are concerned with objects, and their site or spatial relationships, location models or spatial models are necessary to form a model of the environment. This paper investigates the area of context-aware messaging and addressing services in diverse IoT applications. The paper examines the notion of context and the use of context within the data exchanged by the sensors in an IoT application for messaging and addressing purposes. Based on the importance and need for context of the information, we identify three critical categories of new IoT applications for context-aware messaging and addressing services: emergency applications, applications for guiding and reminding, and social networking applications. For this purpose, a representative range of systems is reviewed according to the application type, the technology being used, their architecture, the context information, and the services they provide. This survey assists the work of defining an approach for context-aware messaging services domain by discovering the area of context-aware messaging.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The future of the Internet of Things (IoT) is interlinked with digital communication in smart cities. The digital signal power spectrum of smart IoT devices is greatly needed to provide communication support. The line codes play a significant role in data bit transmission in digital communication. The existing line-coding techniques are designed for traditional computing network technology and power spectrum density to translate data bits into a signal using various line code waveforms. The existing line-code techniques have multiple kinds of issues, such as the utilization of bandwidth, connection synchronization (CS), the direct current (DC) component, and power spectrum density (PSD). These highlighted issues are not adequate in IoT devices in smart cities due to their small size. However, there is a need to design an effective line-code method to deal with these issues in digital IoT-based communication for smart technologies, which enables smart services for smart cities. In this paper, the Shadow Encoding Scheme (SES) is proposed to transmit data bits efficiently by using a physical waveform in the smart cities&rsquo; ecosystem. SES provides a reliable transmission over the physical medium without using extra bandwidth and with ideal PSD. In it, the shadow copy of the repeating bitstream is forwarded, rather than repeating the actual stream again and again. The PSD is calculated with the help of mathematical equations to validate SES. MATLAB simulator is used to simulate SES and compared with other well-known digital line-code techniques. The bit error rate is also compared between SES and the chirp spread spectrum (CSS) for the specific data frames. The coordinates of the PSD graph are also shown in tabular form, which shows a vivid picture of the working conditions of various line codes.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Sub-micron aerosols are a vital air pollutant to be measured because they pose health effects. These particles are quantified as particle number concentration (PN). However, PN measurements are not always available in air quality measurement stations, leading to data scarcity. In order to compensate this, PN modeling needs to be developed. This paper presents a PN modeling framework using sensitivity analysis tested on a one year aerosol measurement campaign conducted in Amman, Jordan. The method prepares a set of different combinations of all measured meteorological parameters to be descriptors of PN concentration. In this case, we resort to artificial neural networks in the forms of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and a time-delay neural network (TDNN) as modeling tools, and then, we attempt to find the best descriptors using all these combinations as model inputs. The best modeling tools are FFNN for daily averaged data (with R      2  = 0.77    ) and TDNN for hourly averaged data (with R      2  = 0.66    ) where the best combinations of meteorological parameters are found to be temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and wind speed. As the models follow the patterns of diurnal cycles well, the results are considered to be satisfactory. When PN measurements are not directly available or there are massive missing PN concentration data, PN models can be used to estimate PN concentration using available measured meteorological parameters.

AB  - Nowadays, an infectious disease outbreak is considered one of the most destructive effects in the sustainable development process. The outbreak of new coronavirus (COVID-19) as an infectious disease showed that it has undesirable social, environmental, and economic impacts, and leads to serious challenges and threats. Additionally, investigating the prioritization parameters is of vital importance to reducing the negative impacts of this global crisis. Hence, the main aim of this study is to prioritize and analyze the role of certain environmental parameters. For this purpose, four cities in Italy were selected as a case study and some notable climate parameters&mdash;such as daily average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed&mdash;and an urban parameter, population density, were considered as input data set, with confirmed cases of COVID-19 being the output dataset. In this paper, two artificial intelligence techniques, including an artificial neural network (ANN) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and differential evolution (DE) algorithm, were used for prioritizing climate and urban parameters. The analysis is based on the feature selection process and then the obtained results from the proposed models compared to select the best one. Finally, the difference in cost function was about 0.0001 between the performances of the two models, hence, the two methods were not different in cost function, however, ANN-PSO was found to be better, because it reached to the desired precision level in lesser iterations than ANN-DE. In addition, the priority of two variables, urban parameter, and relative humidity, were the highest to predict the confirmed cases of COVID-19.

AB  - Power restoring time in power distribution systems (PDS) can be minimized by using efficient fault localization techniques. This paper proposes a novel, robust and scalable cloud based internet of things (IoT) solution for identification and localization of faults in PDS. For this purpose, a new algorithm is developed that can detect single and multiple simultaneous faults in the presence of single and multiple device or sensor failures. The algorithm has utilized a zone based approach that divides a PDS into different zones. A current sensing device (CSD) was deployed at the boundary of a zone. The function of CSD is to provide time synchronized current measurements and communicate with a cloud server through an edge device (ED). Another contribution of this research work is the unique implementation of context aware policy (CAP) in ED. Due to CAP, only those measurements are transmitted to cloud server that differ from the previously transmitted measurements. The cloud server performed calculations at regular intervals to detect faults in PDS. A relational database model was utilized to log various fault events that occur in PDS. An IEEE 37 node test feeder was selected as PDS to observe the performance of our solution. Two test cases were designed to simulate individual and multiple simultaneous faults in PDS. A third test case was implemented to demonstrate the robustness and scalability of proposed solution to detect multiple simultaneous faults in PDS when single and multiple sensor failures were encountered. It was observed that the new algorithm successfully localized the faults for all the three cases. Consequently, significant reductions were noticed in the amount of data that was sent to the cloud server. In the end, a comparison study of a proposed solution was performed with existing methods to further highlight the benefits of our technique.

AB  - Data integrity in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is very important because incorrect or missing values could result in the system making suboptimal or catastrophic decisions. Data imputation allows for a system to counteract the effect of data loss by substituting faulty or missing sensor values with system-defined virtual values. This paper proposes a virtual sensor system that uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to impute sensor values in a WSN. The MLP was trained using a genetic algorithm which efficiently reached an optimal solution for each sensor node. The system was able to successfully identify and replace physical sensor nodes that were disconnected from the network with corresponding virtual sensors. The virtual sensors imputed values with very high accuracies when compared to the physical sensor values.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of visual impairment and blindness across the world. It is usually found in patients who suffer from diabetes for a long period. The major focus of this work is to derive optimal representation of retinal images that further helps to improve the performance of DR recognition models. To extract optimal representation, features extracted from multiple pre-trained ConvNet models are blended using proposed multi-modal fusion module. These final representations are used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) used for DR identification and severity level prediction. As each ConvNet extracts different features, fusing them using 1D pooling and cross pooling leads to better representation than using features extracted from a single ConvNet. Experimental studies on benchmark Kaggle APTOS 2019 contest dataset reveals that the model trained on proposed blended feature representations is superior to the existing methods. In addition, we notice that cross average pooling based fusion of features from Xception and VGG16 is the most appropriate for DR recognition. With the proposed model, we achieve an accuracy of 97.41%, and a kappa statistic of 94.82 for DR identification and an accuracy of 81.7% and a kappa statistic of 71.1% for severity level prediction. Another interesting observation is that DNN with dropout at input layer converges more quickly when trained using blended features, compared to the same model trained using uni-modal deep features.

SN  - 2227-7390

AB  - Several epidemiological models are being used around the world to project the number of infected individuals and the mortality rates of the COVID-19 outbreak. Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to the lack of essential data and uncertainty, the epidemiological models have been challenged regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19, and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are proposed to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for 9 days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs. This paper provides an initial benchmarking to demonstrate the potential of machine learning for future research.

SN  - 2226-4310

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are affordable these days. For that reason, there are currently examples of the use of UAVs in recreational, professional and research applications. Most of the commercial UAVs use Px4 for their operating system. Even though Px4 allows one to change the flight controller structure, the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) format is still by far the most popular choice. A selection of the PID controller parameters is required before the UAV can be used. Although there are guidelines for the design of PID parameters, they do not guarantee the stability of the UAV, which in many cases, leads to collisions involving the UAV during the calibration process. In this paper, an offline tuning procedure based on the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm for the attitude and altitude control of a Px4-based UAV is proposed. A Pareto dominance concept is used for the MOPSO to find values for the PID comparing parameters of step responses (overshoot, rise time and root-mean-square). Experimental results are provided to validate the proposed tuning procedure by using a quadrotor as a case study.

Traffic congestion causes delays, inconvenience, and economic losses to drivers, as well as air pollution. Identification and quantification of traffic congestion are crucial for decision-makers to initiate mitigation strategies to improve the overall transportation system&rsquo;s sustainability. In this paper, the currently available measures are detailed and compared by implementing them on a daily and weekly traffic historical dataset. The results showed each measure showed significant variations in congestion states while indicating a similar congestion trend. The advantages and disadvantages of each measure are identified from the data analysis.

AB  - There are a number of significant changes taking place in modern city development and most of them are based on the number of recent technological progress. This paper provides a review and analysis of recent approaches of biotechnology that can find a place in today&rsquo;s cities and discusses how those technologies can be integrated into a city&rsquo;s Internet of Things (IoT). Firstly, several biotechnologies that focus on rain gardens, urban vertical farming systems, and city photobioreactors are discussed in the context of their integration in a city&rsquo;s IoT. The next possible application of biofuel cells to the sensor network&rsquo;s energy supply is discussed. It is shown that such devices can influence the low-power sensor network structure as an additional energy source for transmitters. This paper shows the possibility of bioelectrochemical biosensor applications, discusses self-powered biosensors, and shows that such a system can be widely applied to rainwater monitoring in rain gardens and green streets. Significant attention is paid to recent approaches in synthetic biology. Both cell-based biosensors and bioactuators with synthetic genetic circuits are discussed. The development of cell-based biosensors can significantly enhance the sensing possibilities of a city&rsquo;s IoT. We show the possible ways to develop cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with the systems mentioned above. Aspects of data handling for the discussed biotechnologies and the methods of intelligent systems, including those that are machine learning-based, applied to the IoT in a city are presented.

AB  - Positioning capabilities have become essential in context-aware user services, which make easier daily activities and let the emergence of new business models in the trendy area of smart cities. Thanks to wireless connection capabilities of smart mobile devices and the proliferation of wireless attachment points in buildings, several positioning systems have appeared in the last years to provide indoor positioning and complement GPS for outdoors. Wi-Fi fingerprinting is one of the most remarkable approaches, although ongoing smart deployments in the area of smart cities can offer extra possibilities to exploit hybrid schemes, in which the final location takes into account different positioning sources. In this paper we propose a positioning system that leverages common infrastructure and services already present in smart spaces to enhance indoor positioning. Thus, GPS and WiFi are complemented with access control services (i.e., ID card) or Bluetooth Low Energy beaconing, to determine the user location within a smart space. Better position estimations can be calculated by hybridizing the positioning information coming from different technologies, and a handover mechanism between technologies or algorithms is used exploiting semantic information saved in fingerprints. The solution implemented is highly optimized by reducing tedious computation, by means of opportunistic selection of fingerprints and floor change detection, and a battery saving subsystem reduces power consumption by disabling non-needed technologies. The proposal has been showcased over a smart campus deployment to check its real operation and assess the positioning accuracy, experiencing the noticeable advantage of integrating technologies usually available in smart spaces and reaching an average real error of 4.62 m.

AB  - Early fault detection and diagnosis in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems may reduce the damage of equipment, improving the reliability and safety of smart buildings, generating social and economic benefits. Data models for fault detection and diagnosis are increasingly used for extracting knowledge in the supervisory tasks. This article proposes an autonomic cycle of data analysis tasks (ACODAT) for the supervision of the building&rsquo;s HVAC systems. Data analysis tasks incorporate data mining models for extracting knowledge from the system monitoring, analyzing abnormal situations and automatically identifying and taking corrective actions. This article shows a case study of a real building&rsquo;s HVAC system, for the supervision with our ACODAT, where the HVAC subsystems have been installed over the years, providing a good example of a heterogeneous facility. The proposed supervisory functionality of the HVAC system is capable of detecting deviations, such as faults or gradual increment of energy consumption in similar working conditions. The case study shows this capability of the supervisory autonomic cycle, usually a key objective for smart buildings.

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have caught people&rsquo;s attention in recent years, not only from an academic or developmental viewpoint but also because of the wide range of applications that these vehicles may entail, such as intelligent mobility and logistics, as well as for industrial purposes, among others. The open literature contains a variety of works related to the subject. They employ a diversity of techniques ranging from probabilistic to ones based on Artificial Intelligence. The increase in computing capacity, well known to many, has opened plentiful opportunities for the algorithmic processing needed by these applications, making way for the development of autonomous navigation, in many cases with astounding results. The following paper presents a low-cost but high-performance minimal sensor open architecture implemented in a modular vehicle. It was developed in a short period of time, surpassing many of the currently available solutions found in the literature. Diverse experiments were carried out in the controlled and circumscribed environment of an autonomous circuit that demonstrates the efficiency of the applicability of the developed solution.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Studies on room monitoring have only focused on objects in a singular and uniform posture or low-density groups. Considering the wide use of convolutional neural networks for object detection, especially person detection, we use deep learning and perspective correction techniques to propose a room monitoring system that can detect persons with different motion states, high-density groups, and small-sized persons owing to the distance from the camera. This system uses consecutive frames from the monitoring camera as input images. Two approaches are used: perspective correction and person detection. First, perspective correction is used to transform an input image into a 2D top-view image. This allows users to observe the system more easily with different views (2D and 3D views). Second, the proposed person detection scheme combines the Mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) scheme and the tile technique for person detection, especially for detecting small-sized persons. All results are stored in a cloud database. Moreover, new person coordinates in 2D images are generated from the final bounding boxes and heat maps are created according to the 2D images; these enable users to examine the system quickly in different views. Additionally, a system prototype is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system. Experimental results prove that our proposed system outperforms existing schemes in terms of accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

AB  - The growing trend in electrical vehicle (EV) deployment has transformed independent power network and transportation network studies into highly congested interdependent network performance evaluations assessing their impact on power and transportation systems. Electrified transportation is highly capable of intensifying the interdependent correlations across charging service, transportation, and power networks. However, the evaluation of the complex coupled relationship across charging services, transportation, and power networks poses several challenges, including an impact on charging scheduling, traffic congestion, charging loads on the power grid, and high costs. Therefore, this article presents comparative survey analytics of large-scale EV integration&rsquo;s impact on charging service network scheduling, transportation networks, and power networks. Moreover, price mechanism strategies to determine the charging fares, minimize investment profits, diminish traffic congestion, and reduce power distribution constraints under the influence of various factors were carried out. Additionally, the survey analysis stipulates the interdependent network performance index, ascertaining travel distance, route selection, long-term and short-term planning, and different infrastructure strategies. Finally, the limitations of the proposed study, potential research trends, and critical technologies are demonstrated for future inquiries.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - The proper management of a municipal water system is essential to sustain cities and support the water security of societies. Urban water estimating has always been a challenging task for managers of water utilities and policymakers. This paper applies a novel methodology that includes data pre-processing and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) optimized with the Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA-ANN) to estimate monthly water demand in relation to previous water consumption. Historical data of monthly water consumption in the Gauteng Province, South Africa, for the period 2007&ndash;2016, were selected for the creation and evaluation of the methodology. Data pre-processing techniques played a crucial role in the enhancing of the quality of the data before creating the prediction model. The BSA-ANN model yielded the best result with a root mean square error and a coefficient of efficiency of 0.0099 mega liters and 0.979, respectively. Moreover, it proved more efficient and reliable than the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA-ANN), based on the scale of error. Overall, this paper presents a new application for the hybrid model BSA-ANN that can be successfully used to predict water demand with high accuracy, in a city that heavily suffers from the impact of climate change and population growth.

AB  - Air pollution in urban regions remains a crucial subject of study, given its implications on health and environment, where much effort is often put into monitoring pollutants and producing accurate trend estimates over time, employing expensive tools and sensors. In this work, we study the problem of air quality estimation in the urban area of Milan (IT), proposing different machine learning approaches that combine meteorological and transit-related features to produce affordable estimates without introducing sensor measurements into the computation. We investigated different configurations employing machine and deep learning models, namely a linear regressor, an Artificial Neural Network using Bayesian regularization, a Random Forest regressor and a Long Short Term Memory network. Our experiments show that affordable estimation results over the pollutants can be achieved even with simpler linear models, therefore suggesting that reasonably accurate Air Quality Index (AQI) measurements can be obtained without the need for expensive equipment.

AB  - Knowing an accurate passengers attendance estimation on each metro car contributes to the safely coordination and sorting the crowd-passenger in each metro station. In this work we propose a multi-head Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained to infer an estimation of passenger attendance in a metro car. The proposed network architecture consists of two main parts: a convolutional backbone, which extracts features over the whole input image, and a multi-head layers able to estimate a density map, needed to predict the number of people within the crowd image. The network performance is first evaluated on publicly available crowd counting datasets, including the ShanghaiTech part_A, ShanghaiTech part_B and UCF_CC_50, and then trained and tested on our dataset acquired in subway cars in Italy. In both cases a comparison is made against the most relevant and latest state of the art crowd counting architectures, showing that our proposed MH-MetroNet architecture outperforms in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Square Error (MSE) and passenger-crowd people number prediction.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is one of the most important use cases related to smart cities. In addition to assisting traffic management authorities, traffic forecasting can help drivers to choose the best path to their destinations. Accurate traffic forecasting is a basic requirement for traffic management. We propose a traffic forecasting approach that utilizes air pollution and atmospheric parameters. Air pollution levels are often associated with traffic intensity, and much work is already available in which air pollution has been predicted using road traffic. However, to the best of our knowledge, an attempt to improve forecasting road traffic using air pollution and atmospheric parameters is not yet available in the literature. In our preliminary experiments, we found out the relation between traffic intensity, air pollution, and atmospheric parameters. Therefore, we believe that addition of air pollutants and atmospheric parameters can improve the traffic forecasting. Our method uses air pollution gases, including     C O , N O , N  O 2  , N  O x  ,     and     O 3    . We chose these gases because they are associated with road traffic. Some atmospheric parameters, including pressure, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed have also been considered, as these parameters can play an important role in the dispersion of the above-mentioned gases. Data related to traffic flow, air pollution, and the atmosphere were collected from the open data portal of Madrid, Spain. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) was used in this paper to perform traffic forecasting.

AB  - Currently, there is great interest in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels (and other non-renewable energy sources) in order to preserve the environment; smart buildings are commonly proposed for this purpose as they are capable of producing their own energy and using it optimally. However, at times, solar energy is not able to supply the energy demand fully; it is mandatory to know the quantity of energy needed to optimize the system. This research focuses on the prediction of output temperature from a solar thermal collector. The aim is to measure solar thermal energy and optimize the energy system of a house (or building). The dataset used in this research has been taken from a real installation in a bio-climate house located on the Sotavento Experimental Wind Farm, in north-west Spain. A hybrid intelligent model has been developed by combining clustering and regression methods such as neural networks, polynomial regression, and support vector machines. The main findings show that, by dividing the dataset into small clusters on the basis of similarity in behavior, it is possible to create more accurate models. Moreover, combining different regression methods for each cluster provides better results than when a global model of the whole dataset is used. In temperature prediction, mean absolute error was lower than 4      ∘    C.

Wearable sensors can provide a viable solution for monitoring people in danger of falls with minimal external involvement from health or care home workers. In this work, we recorded accelerometer data from 35 healthy individuals performing various ADLs, as well as falls. Spatial and frequency domain features were extracted and used for the training of machine learning models with the aim of distinguishing between fall and no fall events, as well as between falls and other ADLs. Supervised classification experiments demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed approach, achieving an F1-score of 98.41% for distinguishing between fall and no fall events, and an F1-score of 88.11% for distinguishing between various ADLs, including falls. Furthermore, the created dataset, named &ldquo;ShimFall&amp;ADL&rdquo; will be publicly released to facilitate further research on the field.

AB  - Mobile edge computing (MEC) within 5G networks brings the power of cloud computing, storage, and analysis closer to the end user. The increased speeds and reduced delay enable novel applications such as connected vehicles, large-scale IoT, video streaming, and industry robotics. Machine Learning (ML) is leveraged within mobile edge computing to predict changes in demand based on cultural events, natural disasters, or daily commute patterns, and it prepares the network by automatically scaling up network resources as needed. Together, mobile edge computing and ML enable seamless automation of network management to reduce operational costs and enhance user experience. In this paper, we discuss the state of the art for ML within mobile edge computing and the advances needed in automating adaptive resource allocation, mobility modeling, security, and energy efficiency for 5G networks.

AB  - With the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the security of the IoT network has become an important issue. Traditional intrusion detection systems have their limitations when applied to the IoT network due to resource constraints and the complexity. This research focusses on the design, implementation and testing of an intrusion detection system which uses a hybrid placement strategy based on a multi-agent system, blockchain and deep learning algorithms. The system consists of the following modules: data collection, data management, analysis, and response. The National security lab&ndash;knowledge discovery and data mining NSL-KDD dataset is used to test the system. The results demonstrate the efficiency of deep learning algorithms when detecting attacks from the transport layer. The experiment indicates that deep learning algorithms are suitable for intrusion detection in IoT network environment.

AB  - A probabilistic prediction interval (PI) model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and a kernel extreme learning machine using the firefly algorithm (FA-KELM) is presented to tackle the problem of photovoltaic (PV) power for intra-day-ahead prediction. Firstly, considering the non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of a PV power output sequence, the decomposition of the original PV power output series is carried out using VMD. Secondly, to further improve the prediction accuracy, KELM is established for each decomposed component and the firefly algorithm is introduced to optimize the penalty factor and kernel parameter. Finally, the point predicted value is obtained through the summation of predicted results of each component and then using the nonlinear kernel density estimation to fit it. The cubic spline interpolation algorithm is applied to obtain the shortest confidence interval. Results from practical cases show that this probabilistic prediction interval could achieve higher accuracy as compared with other prediction models.

AB  - The 2020 collapse of the global economy due to the Covid-19 pandemic has enabled us to think about long term trends and what the future could hold for our cities and regions, especially due to the climate agenda. The paper sets out the historical precedents for economic transitions after collapses that unleash new technologically based innovation waves. These are shown to be associated with different energy and infrastructure priorities and their transport and resulting urban forms. The new technologies in the past were emerging but mainstreamed as the new economy was built on new investments. The paper suggests that the new economy, for the next 30 years, is likely to be driven by the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agendas (summarised as zero carbon–zero poverty) and will have a strong base in a cluster of innovative technologies: renewable energy, electromobility, smart cities, hydrogen-based industry, circular economy technologies, and biophilic urbanism. The first three are well underway, and the other three will need interventions if not cultural changes and may miss being mainstreamed in this recovery but could still play a minor role in the new economy. The resulting urban transformations are likely to build on Covid-19 through “global localism” and could lead to five new features: (1) relocalised centres with distributed infrastructure, (2) tailored innovations in each urban fabric, (3) less car dependence, (4) symbiotic partnerships for funding, and (5) rewritten manuals for urban professionals. This period needs human creativity to play a role in revitalising the human dimension of cities. The next wave following this may be more about regenerative development.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular in surveillance, security, and remote monitoring. However, they also pose serious security threats to public privacy. The timely detection of a malicious drone is currently an open research issue for security provisioning companies. Recently, the problem has been addressed by a plethora of schemes. However, each plan has a limitation, such as extreme weather conditions and huge dataset requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework consisting of the hybrid handcrafted and deep feature to detect and localize malicious drones from their sound and image information. The respective datasets include sounds and occluded images of birds, airplanes, and thunderstorms, with variations in resolution and illumination. Various kernels of the support vector machine (SVM) are applied to classify the features. Experimental results validate the improved performance of the proposed scheme compared to other related methods.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The concept of smart cities has become prominent in modern metropolises due to the emergence of embedded and connected smart devices, systems, and technologies. They have enabled the connection of every &ldquo;thing&rdquo; to the Internet. Therefore, in the upcoming era of the Internet of Things, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) will play a crucial role in newly developed smart cities. The IoV has the potential to solve various traffic and road safety problems effectively in order to prevent fatal crashes. However, a particular challenge in the IoV, especially in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications, is to ensure fast, secure transmission and accurate recording of the data. In order to overcome these challenges, this work is adapting Blockchain technology for real time application (RTA) to solve Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications problems. Therefore, the main novelty of this paper is to develop a Blockchain-based IoT system in order to establish secure communication and create an entirely decentralized cloud computing platform. Moreover, the authors qualitatively tested the performance and resilience of the proposed system against common security attacks. Computational tests showed that the proposed solution solved the main challenges of Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communications such as security, centralization, and lack of privacy. In addition, it guaranteed an easy data exchange between different actors of intelligent transportation systems.

VL  - 12
IS  - 14
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Remote sensing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) facilitates photogrammetry for environmental and infrastructural monitoring. Models are created with less computational cost by reducing the number of photos required. Optimal camera locations for reducing the number of photos needed for structure-from-motion (SfM) are determined through eight mathematical set-covering algorithms as constrained by solve time. The algorithms examined are: traditional greedy, reverse greedy, carousel greedy (CG), linear programming, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, genetic, and ant colony optimization. Coverage and solve time are investigated for these algorithms. CG is the best method for choosing optimal camera locations as it balances number of photos required and time required to calculate camera positions as shown through an analysis similar to a Pareto Front. CG obtains a statistically significant 3.2 fewer cameras per modeled area than base greedy algorithm while requiring just one additional order of magnitude of solve time. For comparison, linear programming is capable of fewer cameras than base greedy but takes at least three orders of magnitude longer to solve. A grid independence study serves as a sensitivity analysis of the CG algorithms    &alpha;    (iteration number) and    &beta;    (percentage to be recalculated) parameters that adjust traditional greedy heuristics, and a case study at the Rock Canyon collection dike in Provo, UT, USA, compares the results of all eight algorithms and the uniqueness (in terms of percentage comparisons based on location/angle metadata and qualitative visual comparison) of each selected set. Though this specific study uses SfM, the principles could apply to other instruments such as multi-spectral cameras or aerial LiDAR.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to apply the novel bivariate weights-of-evidence-based SysFor (SF) for landslide susceptibility mapping, and two machine learning techniques, namely the na&iuml;ve Bayes (NB) and Radial basis function networks (RBFNetwork), as benchmark models. Firstly, by using aerial photos and geological field surveys, the 263 landslide locations in the study area were obtained. Next, the identified landslides were randomly classified according to the ratio of 70/30 to construct training data and validation models, respectively. Secondly, based on the landslide inventory map, combined with the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the study area, 14 affecting factors of the landslide were determined. The predictive ability of the selected factors was evaluated using the LSVM model. Using the WoE model, the relationship between landslides and affecting factors was analyzed by positive and negative correlation methods. The above three hybrid models were then used to map landslide susceptibility. Thirdly, the ROC curve and various statistical data (SE, 95% CI and MAE) were used to verify and compare the predictive power of the model. Compared with the other two models, the Sysfor model had a larger area under the curve (AUC) of 0.876 (training dataset) and 0.783 (validation dataset). Finally, by quantitatively comparing the susceptibility values of each pixel, the differences in spatial morphology of landslide susceptibility maps were compared, and the model was found to have limitations and effectiveness. The landslide susceptibility maps obtained by the three models are reasonable, and the landslide susceptibility maps generated by the SysFor model have the highest comprehensive performance. The results obtained in this paper can help local governments in land use planning, disaster reduction and environmental protection.

AB  - This paper exhibits a thorough review of the use of impedimetric sensors for the analysis of food quality. It helps to understand the contribution of some of the major types of impedimetric sensors that are used for this application. The deployment of impedimetric sensing prototypes has been advantageous due to their wide linear range of responses, detection of the target analyte at low concentrations, good stability, high accuracy and high reproducibility in the results. The choice of these sensors was classified on the basis of structure and the conductive material used to develop them. The first category included the use of nanomaterials such as graphene and metallic nanowires used to form the sensing devices. Different forms of graphene nanoparticles, such as nano-hybrids, nanosheets, and nano-powders, have been largely used to sense biomolecules in the micro-molar range. The use of conductive materials such as gold, copper, tungsten and tin to develop nanowire-based prototypes for the inspection of food quality has also been shown. The second category was based on conventional electromechanical circuits such as electronic noses and other smart systems. Within this sector, the standardized systems, such as electronic noses, and LC circuit -based systems have been explained. Finally, some of the challenges posed by the existing sensors have been listed out, along with an estimate of the increase in the number of sensors employed to assess food quality.

AB  - In recent years, security in urban areas has gradually assumed a central position, focusing increasing attention on citizens, institutions and political forces. Security problems have a different nature&mdash;to name a few, we can think of the problems deriving from citizens&rsquo; mobility, then move on to microcrime, and end up with the ever-present risk of terrorism. Equipping a smart city with an infrastructure of sensors capable of alerting security managers about a possible risk becomes crucial for the safety of citizens. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to manage citizens&rsquo; needs is now widespread, to highlight the possible risks to public safety. These risks were then increased using these devices to carry out terrorist attacks in various places around the world. Detecting the presence of drones is not a simple procedure given the small size and the presence of only rotating parts. This study presents the results of studies carried out on the detection of the presence of UAVs in outdoor/indoor urban sound environments. For the detection of UAVs, sensors capable of measuring the sound emitted by UAVs and algorithms based on deep neural networks capable of identifying their spectral signature that were used. The results obtained suggest the adoption of this methodology for improving the safety of smart cities.

AB  - Over the last years, existing technologies have been applied to agricultural environments, resulting in new precision agriculture systems. Some of the multiple profits of developing new agricultural technologies and applications include the cost reduction around the building and deployment of them, together with more energy-efficient consumption. Therefore, agricultural precision systems focus on developing better, easier, cheaper, and overall more efficient ways of handling agricultural monitoring and actuation. To achieve this vision, we use a set of technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks, Sensors devices, Internet of Things, or data analysis. More specifically, in this study, we proposed a combination of all these technologies to design and develop a prototype of a precision agriculture system for medium and small agriculture plantations that highlights two major advantages: efficient energy management with self-charging capabilities and a low-cost policy. For the development of the project, several prototype nodes were built and deployed within a sensor network connected to the cloud as a self-powered system. The final target of this system is, therefore, to gather environment data, analyze it, and actuate by activating the watering installation. An analysis of the exposed agriculture monitoring system, in addition to results, is exposed in the paper.

AB  - The emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) which was declared a pandemic has spread to 210 countries worldwide. It has had a significant impact on health systems and economic, educational and social facets of contemporary society. As the rate of transmission increases, various collaborative approaches among stakeholders to develop innovative means of screening, detecting and diagnosing COVID-19&rsquo;s cases among human beings at a commensurate rate have evolved. Further, the utility of computing models associated with the fourth industrial revolution technologies in achieving the desired feat has been highlighted. However, there is a gap in terms of the accuracy of detection and prediction of COVID-19 cases and tracing contacts of infected persons. This paper presents a review of computing models that can be adopted to enhance the performance of detecting and predicting the COVID-19 pandemic cases. We focus on big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that can be adopted in the current pandemic. The review suggested that artificial intelligence models have been used for the case detection of COVID-19. Similarly, big data platforms have also been applied for tracing contacts. However, the nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that have demonstrated good performance in feature selection of medical issues are yet to be explored for case detection and tracing of contacts in the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study holds salient implications for practitioners and researchers alike as it elucidates the potentials of NIC in the accurate detection of pandemic cases and optimized contact tracing.

In the current global market, characterized by a fierce competition, an optimal use of the available resources is more important than ever for guaranteeing the economical sustainability of organizations and enterprises of any size. Heuristic optimization algorithms and simulation methods have been successfully employed to analyze and enhance complex systems and processes in a myriad of ME/BE-related fields. This paper reviews recent works on the use of these methodologies in competitive markets, as well as in imperfect markets considering externalities. The paper also discusses open challenges and how state-of-the art methods combining optimization, simulation, and machine learning can contribute to properly address them.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The scope of the present paper is to promote social, cultural and environmental sustainability in cities by establishing a conceptual framework and the relationship amongst safety in urban public space (UPS), lighting and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-based surveillance. This framework uses available technologies and tools, as these can be found in urban equipment such as lighting posts, to enhance security and safety in UPS, ensuring protection against attempted criminal activity. Through detailed literary research, publications on security and safety concerning crime and lighting can be divided into two periods, the first one pre-1994, and the second one from 2004&ndash;2008. Since then, a significant reduction in the number of publications dealing with lighting and crime is observed, while at the same time, the urban nightscape has been reshaped with the immersion of light-emitting diode (LED) technologies. Especially in the last decade, where most municipalities in the EU28 (European Union of all the member states from the accession of Croatia in 2013 to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020) are refurbishing their road lighting with LED technology and the consideration of smart networks and surveillance is under development, the use of lighting to deter possible attempted felonies in UPS is not addressed. To capitalize on the potential of lighting as a deterrent, this paper proposes a framework that uses existing technology, namely, dimmable LED light sources, presence sensors, security cameras, as well as emerging techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled image recognition algorithms and big data analytics and presents a possible system that could be developed as a stand-alone product to alert possible dangerous situations, deter criminal activity and promote the perception of safety thus linking lighting and ICT-based surveillance towards safety and security in UPS.

AB  - This paper addresses the voltage control problem in medium-voltage distribution networks. The objective is to cost-efficiently maintain the voltage profile within a safe range, in presence of uncertainties in both the future working conditions, as well as the physical parameters of the system. Indeed, the voltage profile depends not only on the fluctuating renewable-based power generation and load demand, but also on the physical parameters of the system components. In reality, the characteristics of loads, lines and transformers are subject to complex and dynamic dependencies, which are difficult to model. In such a context, the quality of the control strategy depends on the accuracy of the power flow representation, which requires to capture the non-linear behavior of the power network. Relying on the detailed analytical models (which are still subject to uncertainties) introduces a high computational power that does not comply with the real-time constraint of the voltage control task. To address this issue, while avoiding arbitrary modeling approximations, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning model to ensure an autonomous grid operational control. Outcomes show that the proposed model-free approach offers a promising alternative to find a compromise between calculation time, conservativeness and economic performance.

AB  - This paper presents the application of Internet of Things (IoT) Technology and Building Energy Management System (BEMS) within the Marylebone Campus of the University of Westminster, located in central London, to improve the environmental performance of the existing building as well as enhance the learning experience on energy and sustainability. Sixty IoT sensors connected to minicomputers were planned to be deployed within three floors of the building to continuously measure the real-time environmental parameters, such as dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, illuminance level, carbon dioxide, and sound levels. Experimental workshops were also arranged with undergraduate and post-graduate students at their classrooms using IoT sensors, portable Bluetooth sensors and online questionnaires to increase awareness of the effect of environmental and behavioural changes on energy saving through real-time visualisation. Users&rsquo; subjective feedback on their workplace was also collected through Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) questionnaire surveys. The results show the effectiveness of IoT systems and BEMS in supplying the building users and management with high-resolution, low-cost data acquisition systems highlighting the existing challenges and future scopes. The study also documents the process and the improvement in students&rsquo; awareness of environmental and energy performance of their building through IoT data visualizations and POE.

AB  - The events that took place in the year 2020 have shown us that society is still fragile and that it is exposed to events that rapidly change the paradigms that govern it. This has been shown by a pandemic like Coronavirus disease 2019; this global emergency has changed the way people interact, communicate, study, or work. In short, the way in which society carries out all activities has changed. This includes education, which has bet on the use of information and communication technologies to reach students. An example of the aforementioned is the use of learning management systems, which have become ideal environments for resource management and the development of activities. This work proposes the integration of technologies, such as artificial intelligence and data analysis, with learning management systems in order to improve learning. This objective is outlined in a new normality that seeks robust educational models, where certain activities are carried out in an online mode, surrounded by technologies that allow students to have virtual assistants to guide them in their learning.

TI  - Hybridizing Deep Learning and Neuroevolution: Application to the Spanish Short-Term Electric Energy Consumption Forecasting

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The electric energy production would be much more efficient if accurate estimations of the future demand were available, since these would allow allocating only the resources needed for the production of the right amount of energy required. With this motivation in mind, we propose a strategy, based on neuroevolution, that can be used to this aim. Our proposal uses a genetic algorithm in order to find a sub-optimal set of hyper-parameters for configuring a deep neural network, which can then be used for obtaining the forecasting. Such a strategy is justified by the observation that the performances achieved by deep neural networks are strongly dependent on the right setting of the hyper-parameters, and genetic algorithms have shown excellent search capabilities in huge search spaces. Moreover, we base our proposal on a distributed computing platform, which allows its use on a large time-series. In order to assess the performances of our approach, we have applied it to a large dataset, related to the electric energy consumption registered in Spain over almost 10 years. Experimental results confirm the validity of our proposal since it outperforms all other forecasting techniques to which it has been compared.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis of Methods and Tools for Drought Monitoring and Prediction in Africa

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 16
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The African continent has a long history of rainfall fluctuations of varying duration and intensities. This has led to varying degrees of drought conditions, triggering research interest across the continent. The research presented here is a bibliometric analysis of scientific articles on drought monitoring and prediction published in Africa. Scientific data analysis was carried out based on bibliometric mapping techniques applied to 332 scientific publications (1980 to 2020) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. In addition, time series of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index for the previous 6 months (SPEI-6) over six regions in the continent was analysed giving the relative comparison of drought occurrences to the annual distribution of the scientific publications. The results revealed that agricultural and hydrological drought studies contributed about 75% of the total publications, while the remaining 25% was shared among socioeconomic and meteorological studies. Countries in the southern, western, and eastern regions of Africa led in terms of scientific publications during the period under review. The results further indicated that the continent experienced drought conditions in the years 1984, 1989, 1992, and 1997, thereby inducing an increase in the number of scientific publications on drought studies. The results show that the tools of analysis have also changed from simple statistics to the use of geospatial tools such as Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) models, and recently Machine Learning (ML). The ML, particularly, contributed about 11% of the total scientific publications, while RS and GIS models, and basic statistical analysis account for about 44%, 20%, and 25% respectively. The integration of spatial technologies and ML are pivotal to the development of robust drought monitoring and drought prediction systems, especially in Africa, which is considered as a drought-prone continent. The research gaps presented in this study can help prospective researchers to respond to the continental and regional drought research needs.

AB  - Improving sustainability is a key concern for industrial development. Industry has recently been benefiting from the rise of IoT technologies, leading to improvements in the monitoring and breakdown prevention of industrial equipment. In order to properly achieve this monitoring and prevention, visualization techniques are of paramount importance. However, the visualization of real-time IoT sensor data has always been challenging, especially when such data are originated by sensors of different natures. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a methodology that aims to help users to visually locate and understand the failures that could arise in a production process.This methodology collects, in a guided manner, user goals and the requirements of the production process, analyzes the incoming data from IoT sensors and automatically derives the most suitable visualization type for each context. This approach will help users to identify if the production process is running as well as expected; thus, it will enable them to make the most sustainable decision in each situation. Finally, in order to assess the suitability of our proposal, a case study based on gas turbines for electricity generation is presented.

AB  - The automated 3D modeling of indoor spaces is a rapidly advancing field, in which recent developments have made the modeling process more accessible to consumers by lowering the cost of instruments and offering a highly automated service for 3D model creation. We compared the performance of three low-cost sensor systems; one RGB-D camera, one low-end terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), and one panoramic camera, using a cloud-based processing service to automatically create mesh models and point clouds, evaluating the accuracy of the results against a reference point cloud from a higher-end TLS. While adequately accurate results could be obtained with all three sensor systems, the TLS performed the best both in terms of reconstructing the overall room geometry and smaller details, with the panoramic camera clearly trailing the other systems and the RGB-D offering a middle ground in terms of both cost and quality. The results demonstrate the attractiveness of fully automatic cloud-based indoor 3D modeling for low-cost sensor systems, with the latter providing better model accuracy and completeness, and with all systems offering a rapid rate of data acquisition through an easy-to-use interface.

PY  - 2020

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This work compares Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) deep neural networks for the outdoor advertisement panel detection problem by handling multiple and combined variabilities in the scenes. Publicity panel detection in images offers important advantages both in the real world as well as in the virtual one. For example, applications like Google Street View can be used for Internet publicity and when detecting these ads panels in images, it could be possible to replace the publicity appearing inside the panels by another from a funding company. In our experiments, both SSD and YOLO detectors have produced acceptable results under variable sizes of panels, illumination conditions, viewing perspectives, partial occlusion of panels, complex background and multiple panels in scenes. Due to the difficulty of finding annotated images for the considered problem, we created our own dataset for conducting the experiments. The major strength of the SSD model was the almost elimination of False Positive (FP) cases, situation that is preferable when the publicity contained inside the panel is analyzed after detecting them. On the other side, YOLO produced better panel localization results detecting a higher number of True Positive (TP) panels with a higher accuracy. Finally, a comparison of the two analyzed object detection models with different types of semantic segmentation networks and using the same evaluation metrics is also included.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 9
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The modern planning and management of urban spaces is an essential topic for smart cities and depends on up-to-date and reliable information on land use and the functional roles of the places that integrate urban areas. In the last few years, driven by the increased availability of geo-referenced data from social media, embedded sensors, and remote sensing images, various techniques have become popular for land use analysis. In this paper, we first highlight and discuss the different data types and methods usually adopted in this context, as well as their purposes. Then, based on a systematic state-of-the-art study, we focused on exploring the potential of points of interest (POIs) for land use classification, as one of the most common categories of crowdsourced data. We developed an application to automatically collect POIs for the study area, creating a dataset that was used to generate a large number of features. We used a ranking technique to select, among them, the most suitable features for classifying land use. As ground truth data, we used CORINE Land Cover (CLC), which is a solid and reliable dataset available for the whole European territory. It was used an artificial neural network (ANN) in different scenarios and our results reveal values of more than 90% for the accuracy and F-score in one experiment performed. Our analysis suggests that POI data have promising potential to characterize geographic spaces. The work described here aims to provide an alternative to the current methodologies for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, which are usually time-consuming and depend on expensive data types.

AB  - Traffic monitoring from closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras on embedded systems is the subject of the performed experiments. Solving this problem encounters difficulties related to the hardware limitations, and possible camera placement in various positions which affects the system performance. To satisfy the hardware requirements, vehicle detection is performed using a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), named SqueezeDet, while, for tracking, the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm is applied, allowing for real-time processing on an NVIDIA Jetson Tx2. To allow for adaptation of the system to the deployment environment, a procedure was implemented leading to generating labels in an unsupervised manner with the help of background modelling and the tracking algorithm. The acquired labels are further used for fine-tuning the model, resulting in a meaningful increase in the traffic estimation accuracy, and moreover, adding only minimal human effort to the process allows for further accuracy improvement. The proposed methods, and the results of experiments organised under real-world test conditions are presented in the paper.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This pilot study focuses on the design, implementation, optimization and verification of a novel solution of smart measuring of water consumption and crisis detection leading to a smart water management platform. The system implemented consists of a modular IoT platform based on a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design using the M2.COM standard, a LoraWAN modem and a LoraWAN gateway based on the Raspberry Pi platform. The prototype is modular, low-cost, low-power, low-complex and it fully reflects the requirements of strategic technological concepts of Smart City and Industry 4.0, i.e., data integration, interoperability, (I)IoT, etc. The study was produced in cooperation with M.I.S Protivanov and VODARENSKA AKCIOVA SPOLECNOST, a.s. (industry partners distributing drinking water in the Olomouc and South-Moravian regions) to depict the current situation in the Czech Republic, characterized by extreme weather fluctuations and increasingly frequent periods of drought. These drinking water distributors are also constantly placing new demands on these smart solutions. These requirements include, above all, reliability of data transmission, modularity and, last but not least, low cost. However, smart water management (water consumption, distribution, system identification, equipment maintenance, etc.) is becoming an important topic worldwide. The functionality of the system was first verified in laboratory conditions and, then, in real operation. The study also includes checking signal propagation in the municipal area of the village of Zdarna, where the radius of the proposed measuring system was tested. A laboratory test with simulation of water leakage is also part of this work. Subsequently, the system was tested in a residential unit by means of water leakage detection using the MNF method (minimum night flow); the detection success rate was 95%.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - One of the models in the literature for modeling the behavior of the brain is the Bayesian attractor model, which is a kind of machine-learning algorithm. According to this model, the brain assigns stochastic variables to possible decisions (attractors) and chooses one of them when enough evidence is collected from sensory systems to achieve a confidence level high enough to make a decision. In this paper, we introduce a software defined networking (SDN) application based on a brain-inspired Bayesian attractor model for identification of the current traffic pattern for the supervision and automation of Internet of things (IoT) networks that exhibit a limited number of traffic patterns. In a real SDN testbed, we demonstrate that our SDN application can identify the traffic patterns using a limited set of fluctuating network statistics of edge link utilization. Moreover, we show that our application can improve core link utilization and the power efficiency of IoT networks by immediately applying a pre-calculated network configuration optimized by traffic engineering with network slicing for the identified pattern.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Fire monitoring in local urban markets within East Africa (EA) has been seriously neglected for a long time. This has culminated in a severe destruction of life and property worth millions. These rampant fires are attributed to electrical short circuits, fuel spillages, etc. Previous research proposes single smoke detectors. However, they are prone to false alarm rates and are inefficient. Also, satellite systems are expensive for developing countries. This paper presents a fuzzy model for early fire detection and control as symmetry&rsquo;s core contribution to fuzzy systems design and application in computer and engineering sciences. We utilize a fuzzy logic technique to simulate the performance of the model using MATLAB, using six parameters: temperature, humidity, flame, CO, CO2 and O2 vis-&agrave;-vis the Estimated Fire Intensity Prediction (EFIP). Results show that, using fuzzy logic, a significant improvement in fire detection is observed with an overall accuracy rate of 95.83%. The paper further proposes an IoT-based fuzzy prediction model for early fire detection with a goal of minimizing extensive damage and promote intermediate fire suppression and control through true fire incidences. This solution provides for future public safety monitoring, and control of fire-related situations among the market community. Hence, fire safety monitoring is significant in providing future fire safety planning, control and management by putting in place appropriate fire safety laws, policies, bills and related fire safety practices or guidelines to be applied in public buildings, market centers and other public places.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Following the significant improvement of technology in terms of data collection and treatment during the last decades, the notion of a smart environment has widely taken an important pedestal in the science industry. Built in order to better manage assets, smart environments provide a livable environment for users or citizens through the deployment of sensors responsible for data collection. Much research has been done to provide security to the involved data, which are extremely sensitive. However, due to the small size and the memory constraint of the sensors, many of these works are difficult to implement. In this paper, a different concept for wireless sensor security in smart environments is presented. The proposed security system, which is based on the scaler distribution of a novel electronic device, the intrusion detection system (IDS), reduces the computational functions of the sensors and therefore maximizes their efficiency. The IDS also introduces the concept of the feedback signal and &ldquo;trust table&rdquo; used to trigger the detection and isolation mechanism in case of attacks. Generally, it ensures the whole network security through cooperation with other IDSs and, therefore, eliminates the problem of security holes that may occur while adopting such a security technique.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 17
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In addition to air pollution, environmental noise has become one of the major hazards for citizens, being Road Traffic Noise (RTN) as its main source in urban areas. Recently, low-cost Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASNs) have become an alternative to traditional strategic noise mapping in cities. In order to monitor RTN solely, WASN-based approaches should automatize the off-line removal of those events unrelated to regular road traffic (e.g., sirens, airplanes, trams, etc.). Within the LIFE DYNAMAP project, 15 urban Anomalous Noise Events (ANEs) were described through an expert-based recording campaign. However, that work only focused on the overall analysis of the events gathered during non-sequential diurnal periods. As a step forward to characterize the temporal and local particularities of urban ANEs in real acoustic environments, this work analyses their distribution between day (06:00&ndash;22:00) and night (22:00&ndash;06:00) in narrow (1 lane) and wide (more than 1 lane) streets. The study is developed on a manually-labelled 151-h acoustic database obtained from the 24-nodes WASN deployed across DYNAMAP&rsquo;s Milan pilot area during a weekday and a weekend day. Results confirm the unbalanced nature of the problem (RTN represents 83.5% of the data), while identifying 26 ANE subcategories mainly derived from pedestrians, animals, transports and industry. Their presence depends more significantly on the time period than on the street type, as most events have been observed in the day-time during the weekday, despite being especially present in narrow streets. Moreover, although ANEs show quite similar median durations regardless of time and location in general terms, they usually present higher median signal-to-noise ratios at night, mainly on the weekend, which becomes especially relevant for the WASN-based computation of equivalent RTN levels.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The identification of roof surfaces is characterized by a sequence of several processing steps. The boundary detection of different types of roof is realized from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) cloud points and can confirm the real boundary of the roof. In the process of processing LiDAR data, shortcomings have been found regarding the inappropriate classification of points (class 6 &ldquo;buildings&rdquo;) concerning the roofs (the points of the building facade were marked as outliers and reclassified). In cases of insufficient point density, there is a problem with not being able to capture either the roof boundary or small roof objects, along with the possible occurrence of gaps inside the roof areas. This study proposes a processing procedure in a geographic information system (GIS) environment that advocates the identification of roof surfaces based on the LiDAR point cloud. We created the contours of a roof surface boundary with a simplified regular shape. From 824 roofs in the studied area, six different types of roof were selected, which this study presents in detail. The expected result of the study is the generation of segments inside the roof boundary. The study also includes the visualization of the outcomes of the spatial analyses of the identified roof surfaces, which forms the basis for determining the potential of solar systems with respect to green roofs for the development of smart city buildings.

PY  - 2020

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - This last decade, the amount of data exchanged on the Internet increased by over a staggering factor of 100, and is expected to exceed well over the 500 exabytes by 2020. This phenomenon is mainly due to the evolution of high-speed broadband Internet and, more specifically, the popularization and wide spread use of smartphones and associated accessible data plans. Although 4G with its long-term evolution (LTE) technology is seen as a mature technology, there is continual improvement to its radio technology and architecture such as in the scope of the LTE Advanced standard, a major enhancement of LTE. However, for the long run, the next generation of telecommunication (5G) is considered and is gaining considerable momentum from both industry and researchers. In addition, with the deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, smart cities, vehicular networks, e-health systems, and Industry 4.0, a new plethora of 5G services has emerged with very diverging and technologically challenging design requirements. These include high mobile data volume per area, high number of devices connected per area, high data rates, longer battery life for low-power devices, and reduced end-to-end latency. Several technologies are being developed to meet these new requirements, and each of these technologies brings its own design issues and challenges. In this context, deep learning models could be seen as one of the main tools that can be used to process monitoring data and automate decisions. As these models are able to extract relevant features from raw data (images, texts, and other types of unstructured data), the integration between 5G and DL looks promising and one that requires exploring. As main contribution, this paper presents a systematic review about how DL is being applied to solve some 5G issues. Differently from the current literature, we examine data from the last decade and the works that address diverse 5G specific problems, such as physical medium state estimation, network traffic prediction, user device location prediction, self network management, among others. We also discuss the main research challenges when using deep learning models in 5G scenarios and identify several issues that deserve further consideration.

These IP-based surveillance systems now protect industrial facilities, railways, gas stations, and even one’s own home. Unfortunately, like other IoT systems, there are inherent security risks which can lead to significant violations of a user’s privacy. In this review, we explore the attack surface of modern surveillance systems and enumerate the various ways they can be compromised with real examples. We also identify the threat agents, their attack goals, attack vectors, and the resulting consequences of successful attacks. Finally, we present current countermeasures and best practices and discuss the threat horizon. The purpose of this review is to provide researchers and engineers with a better understanding of a modern surveillance systems’ security, to harden existing systems and develop improved security solutions.

TI  - Structural Health Monitoring: An IoT Sensor System for Structural Damage Indicator Evaluation
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 17
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the last decades, the applications of structural monitoring are moving toward the field of civil engineering and infrastructures. Nevertheless, if the structures have damages, it does not mean that they have a complete loss of functionality, but rather that the system is no longer in an optimal condition so that, if the damage increases, the structure can collapse. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), a process for the identification of damage, periodically collects data from suitable sensors that allow to characterize the damage and establishes the health status of the structure. Therefore, this monitoring will provide information on the structure condition, mostly about its integrity, in a short time, and, for infrastructures and civil structures, it is necessary to assess performance and health status. The aim of this work is to design an Internet of Things (IoT) system for Structural Health Monitoring to find possible damages and to see how the structure behaves over time. For this purpose, a customized datalogger and nodes have been designed. The datalogger is able to acquire the data coming from the nodes through RS485 communication and synchronize acquisitions. Furthermore, it has an internal memory to allow for the post-processing of the collected data. The nodes are composed of a digital triaxial accelerometer, a general-purpose microcontroller, and an external memory for storage measures. The microcontroller communicates with an accelerometer, acquires values, and then saves them in the memory. The system has been characterized and the damage indicator has been evaluated on a testing structure. Experimental results show that the estimated damage indicator increases when the structure is perturbed. In the present work, the damage indicator increased by a maximum value of 24.65 when the structure is perturbed by a 2.5 mm engraving.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Due to the recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge-Fog-Cloud Computing technologies, the Smart Public Safety (SPS) system has become a more realistic solution for seamless public safety services that are enabled by integrating machine learning (ML) into heterogeneous edge computing networks. While SPS facilitates convenient exchanges of surveillance data streams among device owners and third-party applications, the existing monolithic service-oriented architecture (SOA) is unable to provide scalable and extensible services in a large-scale heterogeneous network environment. Moreover, traditional security solutions rely on a centralized trusted third-party authority, which not only can be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure, but it also incurs privacy concerns on improperly use of private information. Inspired by blockchain and microservices technologies, this paper proposed a BLockchain-ENabled Decentralized Smart Public Safety (BlendSPS) system. Leveraging the hybrid blockchain fabric, a microservices based security mechanism is implemented to enable decentralized security architecture, and it supports immutability, auditability, and traceability for secure data sharing and operations among participants of the SPS system. An extensive experimental study verified the feasibility of the proposed BlendSPS that possesses security and privacy proprieties with limited overhead on IoT based edge networks.

AB  - With an extensive growth in user demand for high throughput, large capacity, and low latency, the ongoing deployment of Fifth-Generation (5G) systems is continuously exposing the inherent limitations of the system, as compared with its original premises. Such limitations are encouraging researchers worldwide to focus on next-generation 6G wireless systems, which are expected to address the constraints. To meet the above demands, future radio network architecture should be effectively designed to utilize its maximum radio spectrum capacity. It must simultaneously utilize various new techniques and technologies, such as Carrier Aggregation (CA), Cognitive Radio (CR), and small cell-based Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet), high-spectrum access (mmWave), and Massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (M-MIMO), to achieve the desired results. However, the concurrent operations of these techniques in current 5G cellular networks create several spectrum management issues; thus, a comprehensive overview of these emerging technologies is presented in detail in this study. Then, the problems involved in the concurrent operations of various technologies for the spectrum management of the current 5G network are highlighted. The study aims to provide a detailed review of cooperative communication among all the techniques and potential problems associated with the spectrum management that has been addressed with the possible solutions proposed by the latest researches. Future research challenges are also discussed to highlight the necessary steps that can help achieve the desired objectives for designing 6G wireless networks.

VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Many low-cost sensors (LCSs) are distributed for air monitoring without any rigorous calibrations. This work applies machine learning with PM2.5 from Taiwan monitoring stations to conduct in-field corrections on a network of 39 PM2.5 LCSs from July 2017 to December 2018. Three candidate models were evaluated: Multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). The model-corrected PM2.5 levels were compared with those of GRIMM-calibrated PM2.5. RFR was superior to MLR and SVR in its correction accuracy and computing efficiency. Compared to SVR, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of RFR were 35% and 85% lower for the training and validation sets, respectively, and the computational speed was 35 times faster. An RFR with 300 decision trees was chosen as the optimal setting considering both the correction performance and the modeling time. An RFR with a nighttime pattern was established as the optimal correction model, and the RMSEs were 5.9 &plusmn; 2.0 &mu;g/m3, reduced from 18.4 &plusmn; 6.5 &mu;g/m3 before correction. This is the first work to correct LCSs at locations without monitoring stations, validated using laboratory-calibrated data. Similar models could be established in other countries to greatly enhance the usefulness of their PM2.5 sensor networks.

SN  - 2073-4395

AB  - The development of the agricultural sector is considered the backbone of sustainable development in Egypt. While the developing countries of the world face many challenges regarding food security due to rapid population growth and limited agricultural resources, this study aimed to assess the soils of Sidi Barrani and Salloum using multivariate analysis to determine the land capability and crop suitability for potential alternative crop uses, based on using principal component analysis (PCA), agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (AHC) and the Almagra model of MicroLEIS. In total, 24 soil profiles were dug, to represent the geomorphic units of the study area, and the soil physicochemical parameters were analyzed in laboratory. The land capability assessment was classified into five significant classes (C1 to C5) based on AHC and PCA analyses. The class C1 represents the highest capable class while C5 is assigned to lowest class. The results indicated that about 7% of the total area was classified as highly capable land (C1), which is area characterized by high concentrations of macronutrients (N, P, K) and low soil salinity value. However, about 52% of the total area was assigned to moderately high class (C2), and 29% was allocated in moderate class (C3), whilst the remaining area (12%) was classified as the low (C4) and not capable (C5) classes, due to soil limitations such as shallow soil depth, high salinity, and increased erosion susceptibility. Moreover, the results of the Almagra soil suitability model for ten crops were described into four suitability classes, while about 37% of the study area was allocated in the highly suitable class (S2) for wheat, olive, alfalfa, sugar beet and fig. Furthermore, 13% of the area was categorized as highly suitable soil (S2) for citrus and peach. On the other hand, about 50% of the total area was assigned to the marginal class (S4) for most of the selected crops. Hence, the use of multivariate analysis, mapping land capability and modeling the soil suitability for diverse crops help the decision makers with regard to potential agricultural development.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of modern research related to potential threats in a vehicle cabin, which is based on situation monitoring during vehicle control and the interaction of the driver with intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In the modern world, such systems enable the detection of potentially dangerous situations on the road, reducing accident probability. However, at the same time, such systems increase vulnerabilities in vehicles and can be sources of different threats. In this paper, we consider the primary information flows between the driver, vehicle, and infrastructure in modern ITS, and identify possible threats related to these entities. We define threat classes related to vehicle control and discuss which of them can be detected by smartphone sensors. We present a case study that supports our findings and shows the main use cases for threat identification using smartphone sensors: Drowsiness, distraction, unfastened belt, eating, drinking, and smartphone use.

AB  - Real time crowd analysis represents an active area of research within the computer vision community in general and scene analysis in particular. Over the last 10 years, various methods for crowd management in real time scenario have received immense attention due to large scale applications in people counting, public events management, disaster management, safety monitoring an so on. Although many sophisticated algorithms have been developed to address the task; crowd management in real time conditions is still a challenging problem being completely solved, particularly in wild and unconstrained conditions. In the proposed paper, we present a detailed review of crowd analysis and management, focusing on state-of-the-art methods for both controlled and unconstrained conditions. The paper illustrates both the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art methods. The methods presented comprise the seminal research works on crowd management, and monitoring and then culminating state-of-the-art methods of the newly introduced deep learning methods. Comparison of the previous methods is presented, with a detailed discussion of the direction for future research work. We believe this review article will contribute to various application domains and will also augment the knowledge of the crowd analysis within the research community.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Monitoring what application or type of applications running on a computer or a cluster without violating the privacy of the users can be challenging, especially when we may not have operator access to these devices, or specialized software. Smart grids and Internet of things (IoT) devices can provide power consumption data of connected individual devices or groups. This research will attempt to provide insides on what applications are running based on the power consumption of the machines and clusters. It is therefore assumed that there is a correlation between electric power and what software application is running. Additionally, it is believed that it is possible to create power consumption profiles for various software applications and even normal and abnormal behavior (e.g., a virus). In order to achieve this, an experiment was organized for the purpose of collecting 48 h of continuous real power consumption data from two PCs that were part of a university computer lab. That included collecting data with a one-second sample period, during class as well as idle time from each machine and their cluster. During the second half of the recording period, one of the machines was infected with a custom-made virus, allowing comparison between power consumption data before and after infection. The data were analyzed using different approaches: descriptive analysis, F-Test of two samples of variance, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The results show that it is possible to detect what type of application is running and if an individual machine or its cluster are infected. Additionally, we can conclude if the lab is used or not, making this research an ideal management tool for administrators.

AB  - In recent years, increasing image data comes from various sensors, and object detection plays a vital role in image understanding. For object detection in complex scenes, more detailed information in the image should be obtained to improve the accuracy of detection task. In this paper, we propose an object detection algorithm by jointing semantic segmentation (SSOD) for images. First, we construct a feature extraction network that integrates the hourglass structure network with the attention mechanism layer to extract and fuse multi-scale features to generate high-level features with rich semantic information. Second, the semantic segmentation task is used as an auxiliary task to allow the algorithm to perform multi-task learning. Finally, multi-scale features are used to predict the location and category of the object. The experimental results show that our algorithm substantially enhances object detection performance and consistently outperforms other three comparison algorithms, and the detection speed can reach real-time, which can be used for real-time detection.

AB  - In the context of the debate on the need to place citizens at the center of the technological revolution, this paper makes a case for a natural language processing (NLP) crowdsourcing platform that ensures inclusion and diversity, thus making the research outcome relevant and applicable across issues and domains. This paper also makes the case that by enabling participation for a wide variety of stakeholders, this NLP crowdsourcing platform might ultimately prove useful in the decision- and policy-making processes at city, community, and country levels. Against the backdrop of the debates on artificial intelligence (AI) and NLP research, and considering substantial differentiation specific to the Arab language, this paper introduces and evaluates an Arab language-sensitive NLP crowdsourcing platform. The value of the platform and its accuracy are measured via the System Usability Scale (SUS), where it scores 72.5, i.e., above the accepted usability average. These findings are crucial for NLP research and the research community in general. They are equally promising in view of the practical application of the research findings.

AB  - The smart devices in Internet of Things (IoT) need more effective data storage opportunities, as well as support for Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods such as neural networks (NNs). This study presents a design of new associative memory in the form of impulsive Hopfield network based on leaky integrated-and-fire (LIF) RC oscillators with frequency control and hybrid analog&ndash;digital coding. Two variants of the network schemes have been developed, where spiking frequencies of oscillators are controlled either by supply currents or by variable resistances. The principle of operation of impulsive networks based on these schemes is presented and the recognition dynamics using simple two-dimensional images in gray gradation as an example is analyzed. A fast digital recognition method is proposed that uses the thresholds of zero crossing of output voltages of neurons. The time scale of this method is compared with the execution time of some network algorithms on IoT devices for moderate data amounts. The proposed Hopfield algorithm uses rate coding to expand the capabilities of neuromorphic engineering, including the design of new hardware circuits of IoT.

This is especially important for low-cost and low-power designs, for example Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWan)-based IoT systems, where data volume and frequency are constrained by the protocols. This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach using Laplacian scores to discover which types of sensors can be reduced, without compromising the decision-making. Here, a type of sensor is a feature. An IoT system is designed and implemented for a plant-monitoring scenario. We have collected data and carried out the Laplacian scores. The analytical results help choose the most important feature. A comparative study has shown that using fewer types of sensors, the accuracy of decision-making remains at a satisfactory level.

AB  - &lsquo;El Diario de Ju&aacute;rez&rsquo; is a local newspaper in a city of 1.5 million Spanish-speaking inhabitants that publishes texts of which citizens read them on both a website and an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) service. This research applies natural-language-processing and machine-learning algorithms to the news provided by the RSS service in order to classify them based on whether they are about a traffic incident or not, with the final intention of notifying citizens where such accidents occur. The classification process explores the bag-of-words technique with five learners (Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Na&iuml;ve Bayes, kNN, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) on a class-imbalanced benchmark; this challenging issue is dealt with via five sampling algorithms: synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), borderline SMOTE, adaptive synthetic sampling, random oversampling, and random undersampling. Consequently, our final classifier reaches a sensitivity of 0.86 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.86, which is an acceptable performance when considering the complexity of analyzing unstructured texts in Spanish.

AB  - Higher education institution campuses have been growing in size to become small cities that encompass all the infrastructures and offer many services to the university community. In order to achieve sustainable growth, it is necessary to take into account different environmental aspects, including the acoustic environment. In this paper, the application of a wireless acoustic sensor network is proposed for the long-term analysis of psychoacoustic parameters of the acoustic environment in a university campus. A network of acoustic nodes is designed and four nodes are deployed at both indoor and outdoor locations of the campus for environmental noise monitoring. A measurement campaign has been running continuously for nine months, including three months in which the state of emergency due to COVID-19 pandemic was established and the university switched to online classes. Acquired and stored data include not only the basic sound level parameters, e.g., equivalent or percentile sound pressure levels, but also psychoacoustic parameters, that are more related with noise assessment of the environment, e.g., loudness or sharpness sound levels. After analysing the acoustic environment of the campus through the complete set of nodes, results show two zones with higher noise indicators where some action plan should be developed. A detailed analysis of the temporal evolution of noise levels in these acoustically saturated zones is done, comparing values between a period of regular activity and the period of state of emergency. Different frequency distributions of sound levels are detected between day and evening periods providing a better insight into the noise sources. The results also show that binaural psychoacoustic annoyance values are correlated with loudness values in these locations, however sharpness values have minor effects.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Earth observation data is becoming more accessible and affordable thanks to the Copernicus programme and its Sentinel missions. Every location worldwide can be freely monitored approximately every 5 days using the multi-spectral images provided by Sentinel-2. The spatial resolution of these images for RGBN (RGB + Near-infrared) bands is 10 m, which is more than enough for many tasks but falls short for many others. For this reason, if their spatial resolution could be enhanced without additional costs, any posterior analyses based on these images would be benefited. Previous works have mainly focused on increasing the resolution of lower resolution bands of Sentinel-2 (20 m and 60 m) to 10 m resolution. In these cases, super-resolution is supported by bands captured at finer resolutions (RGBN at 10 m). On the contrary, this paper focuses on the problem of increasing the spatial resolution of 10 m bands to either 5 m or 2.5 m resolutions, without having additional information available. This problem is known as single-image super-resolution. For standard images, deep learning techniques have become the de facto standard to learn the mapping from lower to higher resolution images due to their learning capacity. However, super-resolution models learned for standard images do not work well with satellite images and hence, a specific model for this problem needs to be learned. The main challenge that this paper aims to solve is how to train a super-resolution model for Sentinel-2 images when no ground truth exists (Sentinel-2 images at 5 m or 2.5 m). Our proposal consists of using a reference satellite with a high similarity in terms of spectral bands with respect to Sentinel-2, but with higher spatial resolution, to create image pairs at both the source and target resolutions. This way, we can train a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network to recover details not present in the original RGBN bands. An exhaustive experimental study is carried out to validate our proposal, including a comparison with the most extended strategy for super-resolving Sentinel-2, which consists in learning a model to super-resolve from an under-sampled version at either 40 m or 20 m to the original 10 m resolution and then, applying this model to super-resolve from 10 m to 5 m or 2.5 m. Finally, we will also show that the spectral radiometry of the native bands is maintained when super-resolving images, in such a way that they can be used for any subsequent processing as if they were images acquired by Sentinel-2.

AB  - Electricity theft and fraud in energy consumption are two of the major issues for power distribution companies (PDCs) for many years. PDCs around the world are trying different methodologies for detecting electricity theft. The traditional methods for non-technical losses (NTLs) detection such as onsite inspection and reward and penalty policy have lost their place in the modern era because of their ineffective and time-consuming mechanism. With the advancement in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), newer and efficient NTL detection methods have been proposed by different researchers working in the field of data mining and AI. The AI-based NTL detection methods are superior to the conventional methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, time-consumption, precision, and labor required. The importance of such AI-based NTL detection methods can be judged by looking at the growing trend toward the increasing number of research articles on this important development. However, the authors felt the lack of a comprehensive study that can provide a one-stop source of information on these AI-based NTL methods and hence became the motivation for carrying out this comprehensive review on this significant field of science. This article systematically reviews and classifies the methods explored for NTL detection in recent literature, along with their benefits and limitations. For accomplishing the mentioned objective, the opted research articles for the review are classified based on algorithms used, features extracted, and metrics used for evaluation. Furthermore, a summary of different types of algorithms used for NTL detection is provided along with their applications in the studied field of research. Lastly, a comparison among the major NTL categories, i.e., data-based, network-based, and hybrid methods, is provided on the basis of their performance, expenses, and response time. It is expected that this comprehensive study will provide a one-stop source of information for all the new researchers and the experts working in the mentioned area of research.

AB  - This article presents several algorithms for controlling water supply system pumps. The aim of having control is the hydraulic optimisation of the network, i.e., ensuring the desired pressure in its recipient nodes, and minimising energy costs of network operation. These two tasks belong to the key issues related to the management and operation of water supply networks, apart from the reduction in water losses caused by network failures and ensuring proper water quality. The presented algorithms have been implemented in an Information and Communications Technology (ICT) system developed at the Systems Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IBS PAN) and implemented in the waterworks GPW S.A. in Katowice/Poland.

AB  - The agent paradigm and multi-agent systems are a perfect match for the design of smart cities because of some of their essential features such as decentralization, openness, and heterogeneity. However, these major advantages also come at a great cost. Since agents&rsquo; mental states are hidden when the implementation is not known and available, intelligent services of smart cities cannot leverage information from them. We contribute with a proposal for the analysis and prediction of hidden agents&rsquo; mental states in a multi-agent system using machine learning methods that learn from past agents&rsquo; interactions. The approach employs agent communication languages, which is a core property of these multi-agent systems, to infer theories and models about agents&rsquo; mental states that are not accessible in an open system. These mental state models can be used on their own or combined to build protocol models, allowing agents (and their developers) to predict future agents&rsquo; behavior for various tasks such as testing and debugging them or making communications more efficient, which is essential in an ambient intelligence environment. This paper&rsquo;s main contribution is to explore the problem of building these agents&rsquo; mental state models not from one, but from several interaction protocols, even when the protocols could have different purposes and provide distinct ambient intelligence services.

AB  - This paper discusses the integration of emergent ICTs, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), the Arrowhead Framework, and the best practices from the area of condition monitoring and maintenance. These technologies are applied, for instance, for roller element bearing fault diagnostics and analysis by simulating faults. The authors first undertook the leading industry standards for condition-based maintenance (CBM), i.e., open system architecture&ndash;condition-based maintenance (OSA&ndash;CBM) and Machinery Information Management Open System Alliance (MIMOSA), which has been working towards standardizing the integration and interchangeability between systems. In addition, this paper highlights the predictive health monitoring methods that are needed for an effective CBM approach. The monitoring of industrial machines is discussed as well as the necessary details are provided regarding a demonstrator built on a metal sheet bending machine of the Greenbender family. Lastly, the authors discuss the benefits of the integration of the developed prototypes into a service-oriented platform, namely the Arrowhead Framework, which can be instrumental for the remotization of maintenance activities, such as the analysis of various equipment that are geographically distributed, to push forward the grand vision of the servitization of predictive health monitoring methods for large-scale interoperability.

AB  - There is no definite conclusion about what the main variables that play a fundamental role in road safety are. Therefore, the identification of significant factors in road accidents has been a primary concern of the transportation safety research community for many years. Every accident is influenced by multiple variables that, in a given time interval, concur to cause a crash scenario. Information coming from crash reports is very useful in traffic safety research, and several reported crash variables can be analyzed with modern statistical methods to establish whether a classification or clustering of different crash variables is possible. Hence, this study aims to use stochastic techniques for evaluating the role of some variables in accidents with a clustering analysis. The variables that are considered in this paper are light conditions, weekday, average speed, annual average daily traffic, number of vehicles, and type of accident. For this purpose, a combination of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the genetic algorithm (GA) with the k-means algorithm was used as the machine-learning technique to cluster and evaluate road safety data. According to a multiscale approach, based on a set of data from two years of crash records collected from rural and urban roads in the province of Cosenza, 154 accident cases were accurately investigated and selected for three categories of accident places, including straight, intersection, and other, in each urban and rural network. PSO had a superior performance, with 0.87% accuracy on urban and rural roads in comparison with GA, although the results of GA had an acceptable degree of accuracy. In addition, the results show that, on urban roads, social cost and type of accident had the most and least influence for all accident places, while, on rural roads, although the social cost was the most notable factor for all accident places, the type of accident had the least effect on the straight sections and curves, and the number of vehicles had the least influence at intersections.

AB  - The principle behind sustainable city movements is represented by the idea of &ldquo;good living&rdquo;, which is the possibility of having solutions and services that allow citizens to live in an easy, simple, and enjoyable way. Policies for urban quality play a central role in the slow cities manifesto, often suggesting the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) in the development of interactive services for citizens. Among these, an interesting possibility is to offer citizens digital real estate consultancy services through the implementation of automated evaluation methods. An automated appraisal action&mdash;which is already complex in itself owing to the need to collect data in a consistent, standardized, but also differentiated way so as to require the adoption of real estate due diligence&mdash;collides on the operational level with the concrete difficulty of acquiring necessary data, much more so since the reference market is dark, atypical, and viscous. These operational difficulties are deepened by the epistemological nature of the appraisal discipline itself, which bases its methodology on the forecast postulate, recalling the need to objectify as much as possible the evaluation from the perspective of an intersubjective sharing argument. These circumstances have led, on the one hand, to the definition of internationally accepted uniform evaluation rules (IVS, 2017) and, on the other, to the testing of automated valuation methods aimed at returning computer-based appraisals (AVM). Starting from the awareness that real estate valuation refers essentially to information and georeferences, this paper aims to demonstrate how real estate appraisal analysis can be further improved through information technology (IT), directing real estate valuation towards objectivity in compliance with international valuation standards. Particularly, the paper intends to show the potential of combining geographic information systems (GISs) and building information models (BIMs) in automated valuation methods through the depreciated reproduction cost. The paper also proposes a BIM-GIS semi-automatic prototype based on the depreciated reconstruction cost through an experimentation in Rende (Italy).

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been very effective in collecting aerial images data for various Internet-of-Things (IoT)/smart cities applications such as search and rescue, surveillance, vehicle detection, counting, intelligent transportation systems, to name a few. However, the real-time processing of collected data on edge in the context of the Internet-of-Drones remains an open challenge because UAVs have limited energy capabilities, while computer vision techniquesconsume excessive energy and require abundant resources. This fact is even more critical when deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used for classification and detection. In this paper, we first propose a system architecture of computation offloading for Internet-connected drones. Then, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study to evaluate the performance in terms of energy, bandwidth, and delay of the cloud computation offloading approach versus the edge computing approach of deep learning applications in the context of UAVs. In particular, we investigate the tradeoff between the communication cost and the computation of the two candidate approaches experimentally. The main results demonstrate that the computation offloading approach allows us to provide much higher throughput (i.e., frames per second) as compared to the edge computing approach, despite the larger communication delays.

AB  - In recent years, with the growing accessibility of abundant contextual emotion information, which is benefited by the numerous georeferenced user-generated content and the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI)-based emotional computing technics, the emotion layer of human&ndash;environment relationship is proposed for enriching traditional methods of various related disciplines such as urban planning. This paper proposes the geographic information system (GIS)-based emotional computing concept, which is a novel framework for applying GIS methods to collective human emotion. The methodology presented in this paper consists of three key steps: (1) collecting georeferenced data containing emotion and environment information such as social media and official sites, (2) detecting emotions using AI-based emotional computing technics such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), and (3) visualizing and analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns with GIS tools. This methodology is a great synergy of multidisciplinary cutting-edge techniques, such as GIScience, sociology, and computer science. Moreover, it can effectively and deeply explore the connection between people and their surroundings with the help of GIS methods. Generally, the framework provides a standard workflow to calculate and analyze the new information layer for researchers, in which a measured human-centric perspective onto the environment is possible.

VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The development of fast and robust brain&ndash;computer interface (BCI) systems requires non-complex and efficient computational tools. The modern procedures adopted for this purpose are complex which limits their use in practical applications. In this study, for the first time, and to the best of our knowledge, a successive decomposition index (SDI)-based feature extraction approach is utilized for the classification of motor and mental imagery electroencephalography (EEG) tasks. First of all, the public datasets IVa, IVb, and V from BCI competition III were denoised using multiscale principal analysis (MSPCA), and then a SDI feature was calculated corresponding to each trial of the data. Finally, six benchmark machine learning and neural network classifiers were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. All the experiments were performed for motor and mental imagery datasets in binary and multiclass applications using a 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, computerized automatic detection of motor and mental imagery using SDI (CADMMI-SDI) is developed to describe the proposed approach practically. The experimental results suggest that the highest classification accuracy of 97.46% (Dataset IVa), 99.52% (Dataset IVb), and 99.33% (Dataset V) was obtained using feedforward neural network classifier. Moreover, a series of experiments, namely, statistical analysis, channels variation, classifier parameters variation, processed and unprocessed data, and computational complexity, were performed and it was concluded that SDI is robust for noise, and a non-complex and efficient biomarker for the development of fast and accurate motor and mental imagery BCI systems.

AB  - The increasing demand for more sensors inside vehicles pursues the intention of making vehicles more &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo;. In this context, the vision of fully connected and autonomous cars is becoming more tangible and will turn into a reality in the coming years. The use of these intelligent transport systems will allow the integration of efficient performance in terms of route control, fuel consumption, and traffic administration, among others. Future vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication will require a wider bandwidth as well as lower latencies than current technologies can offer, to support high-constraint safety applications and data exhaustive information exchanges. To this end, recent investigations have proposed the adoption of the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands to achieve high throughput and low latencies. However, mmWave communications come with high constraints for implementation due to higher free-space losses, poor diffraction, poor signal penetration, among other channel impairments for these high-frequency bands. In this work, a V2X communication channel in the mmWave (28 GHz) band is analyzed by a combination of an empirical study and a deterministic simulation with an in-house 3D ray-launching algorithm. Multiple mmWave V2X links has been modeled for a complex heterogeneous urban scenario in order to capture and analyze different propagation phenomena, providing full volumetric estimation of frequency/power as well as time domain parameters. Large- and small-scale propagation parameters are obtained for a combination of different situations, taking into account the obstruction between the transceivers of vehicles of distinct sizes. These results can aid in the development of modeling techniques for the implementation of mmWave frequency bands in the vehicular context, with the capability of adapting to different scenario requirements in terms of network topology, user density, or transceiver location. The proposed methodology provides accurate wireless channel estimation within the complete volume of the scenario under analysis, considering detailed topological characteristics.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Analogue-to-digital converters (ADC) using oversampling technology and the &Sigma;-∆ modulation mechanism are widely applied in digital audio systems. This paper presents an audio modulator with high accuracy and low power consumption by using a discrete second-order feedforward structure. A 5-bit successive approximation register (SAR) quantizer is integrated into the chip, which reduces the number of comparators and the power consumption of the quantizer compared with flash ADC-type quantizers. An analogue passive adder is used to sum the input signals and it is embedded in a SAR ADC composed of a capacitor array and a dynamic comparator which has no static power consumption. To validate the design concept, the designed modulator is developed in a 180 nm CMOS process. The peak signal to noise distortion ratio (SNDR) is calculated as 106 dB and the total power consumption of the chip is recorded as 3.654 mW at the chip supply voltage of 1.8 V. The input sine wave of 0 to 25 kHz is sampled at a sampling frequency of 3.2 Ms/s. Moreover, the results achieve a 16-bit effective number of bits (ENOB) when the amplitude of the input signal is varied between 0.15 and 1.65 V. By comparing with other modulators which were realized by a 180 nm CMOS process, the proposed architecture outperforms with lower power consumption.

AB  - Cloud Computing provides on-demand computing services like software, networking, storage, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (“the cloud”). But it is facing challenges because of the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the volume, variety, veracity and velocity of the data generated by these devices. There is a need for ultra-low latency, reliable service along with security and privacy. Fog Computing is a promising solution to overcome these challenges. The originality, scope and novelty of this paper is the definition and formulation of the problem of smart neighborhoods in context of smart grids. This is achieved through an extensive literature study, firstly on Fog Computing and its foundation technologies, its applications and the literature review of Fog Computing research in various application domains. Thereafter, we introduce smart grid and community MicroGrid concepts and, their challenges to give the in depth background of the problem and hence, formalize the problem. The smart grid, which ensures reliable, secure, and cost-effective power supply to the smart neighborhoods, effectively needs Fog Computing architecture to achieve its purpose. This paper also identifies, without rigorous analysis, potential solutions to address the problem of smart neighborhoods. The challenges in the integration of Fog Computing and smart grids are also discussed.

AB  - Accurately forecasting how crowds of people are distributed in urban areas during daily activities is of key importance for the smart city vision and related applications. In this work we forecast the crowd density and distribution in an urban area by analyzing an aggregated mobile phone dataset. By comparing the forecasting performance of statistical and deep learning methods on the aggregated mobile data we show that each class of methods has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the forecasting scenario. However, for our time-series forecasting problem, deep learning methods are preferable when it comes to simplicity and immediacy of use, since they do not require a time-consuming model selection for each different cell. Deep learning approaches are also appropriate when aiming to reduce the maximum forecasting error. Statistical methods instead show their superiority in providing more precise forecasting results, but they require data domain knowledge and computationally expensive techniques in order to select the best parameters.

AB  - In recent years, there is an increasing attention on air quality derived services for the final users. A dense grid of measures is needed to implement services such as conditional routing, alerting on data values for personal usage, data heatmaps for Dashboards in control room for the operators, and for web and mobile applications for the city users. Therefore, the challenge consists of providing high density data and services starting from scattered data and regardless of the number of sensors and their position to a large number of users. To this aim, this paper is focused on providing an integrated solution addressing at the same time multiple aspects: To create and optimize algorithms for data interpolation (creating regular data from scattered), making it possible to cope with the scalability and providing support for on demand services to provide air quality data in any point of the city with dense data. To this end, the accuracy of different interpolation algorithms has been evaluated comparing the results with respect to real values. In addition, the trends of heatmaps interpolation errors have been exploited to detected devices&rsquo; dysfunctions. Such anomalies may often be useful to request a maintenance action. The solution proposed has been integrated as a Micro Services providing data analytics in a data flow real time process based on Node.JS Node-RED, called in the paper IoT Applications. The specific case presented in this paper refers to the data and the solution of Snap4City for Helsinki. Snap4City, which has been developed as a part of Select4Cities PCP of the European Commission, and it is presently used in a number of cities and areas in Europe.

AB  - Air pollution has been a looming issue of the 21st century that has also significantly impacted the surrounding environment and societal health. Recently, previous studies have conducted extensive research on air pollution and air quality monitoring. Despite this, the fields of air pollution and air quality monitoring remain plagued with unsolved problems. In this study, the Pollution Weather Prediction System (PWP) is proposed to perform air pollution prediction for outdoor sites for various pollution parameters. In the presented research work, we introduced a PWP system configured with pollution-sensing units, such as SDS021, MQ07-CO, NO2-B43F, and Aeroqual Ozone (O3). These sensing units were utilized to collect and measure various pollutant levels, such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and O3, for 90 days at Symbiosis International University, Pune, Maharashtra, India. The data collection was carried out between the duration of December 2019 to February 2020 during the winter. The investigation results validate the success of the presented PWP system. In the conducted experiments, linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN)-based AQI (air quality index) predictions were performed. Furthermore, the presented study also found that the customized linear regression methodology outperformed other machine-learning methods, such as linear, ridge, Lasso, Bayes, Huber, Lars, Lasso-lars, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and ElasticNet regression methodologies, and the customized ANN regression methodology used in the conducted experiments. The overall AQI values of the air pollutants were calculated based on the summation of the AQI values of all the presented air pollutants. In the end, the web and mobile interfaces were developed to display air pollution prediction values of a variety of air pollutants.

AB  - Technological advancement is currently focused on the miniaturization of devices, and integrated circuits allow us to observe the increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Most IoT services and devices require an Internet connection, which needs to provide the minimum processing, storage and networking requirements to best serve a requested service. One of the main goals of 5G networks is to comply with the user&rsquo;s various Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in different application scenarios. Fifth-generation networks use Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) concepts to achieve these QoS requirements. However, the computational resource allocation mechanisms required by the services are considered very complex. Thus, in this paper, we propose an allocation and management resources mechanism for 5G networks that uses MEC and simple mathematical methods to reduce the model complexity. The mechanism decides to allocate the resource in MEC to meet the requirements requested by the user. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism provides a larger amount of services, leading to a reduction in the service lock number and as a reduction in the blocking ratio of services due to the accuracy of the approach and its load balancing in the process of resource allocation.

AB  - The random nature of traffic conditions on freeways can cause excessive congestion and irregularities in the traffic flow. Ramp metering is a proven effective method to maintain freeway efficiency under various traffic conditions. Creating a reliable and practical ramp metering algorithm that considers both critical traffic measures and historical data is still a challenging problem. In this study we use simple machine learning approaches to develop a novel real-time ramp metering algorithm. The proposed algorithm is computationally simple and has minimal data requirements, which makes it practical for real-world applications. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate and compare the proposed approach with an existing traffic-responsive ramp metering algorithm.

AB  - Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are widely used in critical infrastructures to support the essential services of society. Therefore, their protection against terrorist activities, natural disasters, and cyber threats is critical. Diverse cyber attack detection systems have been proposed over the years, in which each proposal has applied different steps and methods. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding methodologies to detect cyber attacks in ICS scenarios. The lack of such methodologies prevents researchers from being able to accurately compare proposals and results. In this work, we present a Methodology for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems (MADICS) to detect cyber attacks in ICS scenarios, which is intended to provide a guideline for future works in the field. MADICS is based on a semi-supervised anomaly detection paradigm and makes use of deep learning algorithms to model ICS behaviors. It consists of five main steps, focused on pre-processing the dataset to be used with the machine learning and deep learning algorithms; performing feature filtering to remove those features that do not meet the requirements; feature extraction processes to obtain higher order features; selecting, fine-tuning, and training the most appropriate model; and validating the model performance. In order to validate MADICS, we used the popular Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset, which was collected from a fully operational water treatment plant. The experiments demonstrate that, using MADICS, we can achieve a state-of-the-art precision of 0.984 (as well as a recall of 0.750 and F1-score of 0.851), which is above the average of other works, proving that the proposed methodology is suitable for use in real ICS scenarios.

AB  - In the near future, the fifth-generation wireless technology is expected to be rolled out, offering low latency, high bandwidth and multiple antennas deployed in a single access point. This ecosystem will help further enhance various location-based scenarios such as assets tracking in smart factories, precise smart management of hydroponic indoor vertical farms and indoor way-finding in smart hospitals. Such a system will also integrate existing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), WiFi and other network infrastructures. In this respect, 5G precise indoor localization using heterogeneous IoT technologies (Zigbee, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, BLE, etc.) is a challenging research area. In this work, an experimental 5G testbed has been designed integrating C-RAN and IoT networks. This testbed is used to improve both vertical and horizontal localization (3D Localization) in a 5G IoT environment. To achieve this, we propose the DEep Learning-based co-operaTive Architecture (DELTA) machine learning model implemented on a 3D multi-layered fingerprint radiomap. The DELTA begins by estimating the 2D location. Then, the output is recursively used to predict the 3D location of a mobile station. This approach is going to benefit use cases such as 3D indoor navigation in multi-floor smart factories or in large complex buildings. Finally, we have observed that the proposed model has outperformed traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

AB  - A smart home provides a facilitated environment for the detection of human activity with appropriate Deep Learning algorithms to manipulate data collected from numerous sensors attached to various smart things in a smart home environment. Human activities comprise expected and unexpected behavior events; therefore, detecting these events consisting of mutual dependent activities poses a key challenge in the activities detection paradigm. Besides, the battery-powered sensor ubiquitously and extensively monitors activities, disputes, and sensor energy depletion. Therefore, to address these challenges, we propose an Energy and Event Aware-Sensor Duty Cycling scheme. The proposed model predicts the future expected event using the Bi-Directional Long-Short Term Memory model and allocates Predictive Sensors to the predicted event. To detect the unexpected events, the proposed model localizes a Monitor Sensor within a cluster of Hibernate Sensors using the Jaccard Similarity Index. Finally, we optimize the performance of our proposed scheme by employing the Q-Learning algorithm to track the missed or undetected events. The simulation is executed against the conventional Machine Learning algorithms for the sensor duty cycle, scheduling to reduce the sensor energy consumption and improve the activity detection accuracy. The experimental evaluation of our proposed scheme shows significant improvement in activity detection accuracy from 94.12% to 96.12%. Besides, the effective rotation of the Monitor Sensor significantly improves the energy consumption of each sensor with the entire network lifetime.

TI  - Hybridised Artificial Neural Network Model with Slime Mould Algorithm: A Novel Methodology for Prediction of Urban Stochastic Water Demand

VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Urban water demand prediction based on climate change is always challenging for water utilities because of the uncertainty that results from a sudden rise in water demand due to stochastic patterns of climatic factors. For this purpose, a novel combined methodology including, firstly, data pre-processing techniques were employed to decompose the time series of water and climatic factors by using empirical mode decomposition and identifying the best model input via tolerance to avoid multi-collinearity. Second, the artificial neural network (ANN) model was optimised by an up-to-date slime mould algorithm (SMA-ANN) to predict the medium term of the stochastic signal of monthly urban water demand. Ten climatic factors over 16 years were used to simulate the stochastic signal of water demand. The results reveal that SMA outperforms a multi-verse optimiser and backtracking search algorithm based on error scale. The performance of the hybrid model SMA-ANN is better than ANN (stand-alone) based on the range of statistical criteria. Generally, this methodology yields accurate results with a coefficient of determination of 0.9 and a mean absolute relative error of 0.001. This study can assist local water managers to efficiently manage the present water system and plan extensions to accommodate the increasing water demand.

AB  - Nowadays, the intelligent transportation concept has become one of the most important research fields. All of us depend on mobility, even when we talk about people, provide services, or move goods. Researchers have tried to create and test different transportation models that can optimize traffic flow through road networks and, implicitly, reduce travel times. To validate these new models, the necessity of having a calibration process defined has emerged. Calibration is mandatory in the modeling process because it ensures the achievement of a model closer to the real system. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new multidisciplinary approach combining microscopic traffic modeling theory with intelligent control systems concepts like fuzzy inference in the traffic model calibration. The chosen Takagi&ndash;Sugeno fuzzy inference system proves its adaptive capacity for real-time systems. This concept will be applied to the specific microscopic car-following model parameters in combination with a Kalman filter. The results will demonstrate how the microscopic traffic model parameters can adapt based on real data to prove the model validity.

AB  - Several studies in environmental engineering emphasize the importance of air quality forecasting for sustainable development around the world. In this paper, we studied a new approach for air quality forecasting in Busan metropolitan city. We proposed a convolutional Bi-Directional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) autoencoder model trained using a distributed architecture to predict the concentration of the air quality particles (PM2.5 and PM10). The proposed deep learning model can automatically learn the intrinsic correlation among the pollutants in different location. Also, the meteorological and the pollution gas information at each location are fully utilized, which is beneficial for the performance of the model. We used multiple one-dimension convolutional neural network (CNN) layers to extract the local spatial features and a stacked Bi-LSTM layer to learn the spatiotemporal correlation of air quality particles. In addition, we used a stacked deep autoencoder to encode the essential transformation patterns of the pollution gas and the meteorological data, since they are very important for providing useful information that can significantly improve the prediction of the air quality particles. Finally, in order to reduce the training time and the resource consumption, we used a distributed deep leaning approach called data parallelism, which has never been used to tackle the problem of air quality forecasting. We evaluated our approach with extensive experiments based on the data collected in Busan metropolitan city. The results reveal the superiority of our framework over ten baseline models and display how the distributed deep learning model can significantly improve the training time and even the prediction accuracy.

AB  - Audio-based event detection poses a number of different challenges that are not encountered in other fields, such as image detection. Challenges such as ambient noise, low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and microphone distance are not yet fully understood. If the multimodal approaches are to become better in a range of fields of interest, audio analysis will have to play an integral part. Event recognition in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is such a field at a nascent stage that can especially leverage solely on audio or can be part of the multimodal approach. In this manuscript, an extensive analysis focused on the comparison of different magnitude representations of the raw audio is presented. The data on which the analysis is carried out is part of the publicly available MIVIA Audio Events dataset. Single channel Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), mel-scale and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) spectrogram representations are used. Furthermore, aggregation methods of the aforementioned spectrogram representations are examined; the feature concatenation compared to the stacking of features as separate channels. The effect of the SNR on recognition accuracy and the generalization of the proposed methods on datasets that were both seen and not seen during training are studied and reported.
