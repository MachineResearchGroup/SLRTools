AB  - Random forests (RF) is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which has recently started to gain prominence in water resources applications. However, existing applications are generally restricted to the implementation of Breiman&rsquo;s original algorithm for regression and classification problems, while numerous developments could be also useful in solving diverse practical problems in the water sector. Here we popularize RF and their variants for the practicing water scientist, and discuss related concepts and techniques, which have received less attention from the water science and hydrologic communities. In doing so, we review RF applications in water resources, highlight the potential of the original algorithm and its variants, and assess the degree of RF exploitation in a diverse range of applications. Relevant implementations of random forests, as well as related concepts and techniques in the R programming language, are also covered.

TI  - A Dyna-Q-Based Solution for UAV Networks Against Smart Jamming Attacks

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have a wide range of applications, such as in the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G communications, and so forth. However, the communications between UAVs and UAVs to ground control stations mainly use radio channels, and therefore these communications are vulnerable to cyberattacks. With the advent of software-defined radio (SDR), smart attacks that can flexibly select attack strategies according to the defender&rsquo;s state information are gradually attracting the attention of researchers and potential attackers of UAV networks. The smart attack can even induce the defender to take a specific defense strategy, causing even greater damage. Inspired by symmetrical thinking, a solution using a software-defined network (SDN) to combat software-defined radio was proposed. We propose a network architecture which uses dual controllers, including a UAV flight controller and SDN controller, to achieve collaborative decision-making. Built on the top of the SDN, the state information of the whole network converges quickly and is fitted to an environment model used to develop an improved Dyna-Q-based reinforcement learning algorithm. The improved algorithm integrates the power allocation and track planning of UAVs into a unified action space. The simulation data showed that the proposed communication solution can effectively avoid smart jamming attacks and has faster learning efficiency and higher convergence performance than the compared algorithms.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of serving as a data collector for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we investigate an energy-effective data gathering approach in UAV-aided WSNs, where each sensor node (SN) dynamically chooses the transmission modes, i.e., (1) waiting, (2) conventional sink node transmission, (3) uploading to UAV, to transmit sensory data within a given time. By jointly considering the SN&rsquo;s transmission policy and UAV trajectory optimization, we aim to minimize the transmission energy consumption of the SNs and ensure all sensory data completed collected within the given time. We take a two-step iterative approach and decouple the SN&rsquo;s transmission design and UAV trajectory optimization process. First, we design the optimal SNs transmission mode policy with preplanned UAV trajectory. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal transmission policy. Then, with the fixed transmission policy, we optimize the UAV&rsquo;s trajectory from the preplanned trace with recursive random search (RRS) algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant energy savings gain over the benchmark schemes.

AB  - In the last few years, there has been a growing expectation created about the analysis of large amounts of data often available in organizations, which has been both scrutinized by the academic world and successfully exploited by industry. Nowadays, two of the most common terms heard in scientific circles are Big Data and Deep Learning. In this double review, we aim to shed some light on the current state of these different, yet somehow related branches of Data Science, in order to understand the current state and future evolution within the healthcare area. We start by giving a simple description of the technical elements of Big Data technologies, as well as an overview of the elements of Deep Learning techniques, according to their usual description in scientific literature. Then, we pay attention to the application fields that can be said to have delivered relevant real-world success stories, with emphasis on examples from large technology companies and financial institutions, among others. The academic effort that has been put into bringing these technologies to the healthcare sector are then summarized and analyzed from a twofold view as follows: first, the landscape of application examples is globally scrutinized according to the varying nature of medical data, including the data forms in electronic health recordings, medical time signals, and medical images; second, a specific application field is given special attention, in particular the electrocardiographic signal analysis, where a number of works have been published in the last two years. A set of toy application examples are provided with the publicly-available MIMIC dataset, aiming to help the beginners start with some principled, basic, and structured material and available code. Critical discussion is provided for current and forthcoming challenges on the use of both sets of techniques in our future healthcare.

VL  - 11
IS  - 13
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Small-scaled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) emerge as ideal image acquisition platforms due to their high maneuverability even in complex and tightly built environments. The acquired images can be utilized to generate high-quality 3D models using current multi-view stereo approaches. However, the quality of the resulting 3D model highly depends on the preceding flight plan which still requires human expert knowledge, especially in complex urban and hazardous environments. In terms of safe flight plans, practical considerations often define prohibited and restricted airspaces to be accessed with the vehicle. We propose a 3D UAV path planning framework designed for detailed and complete small-scaled 3D reconstructions considering the semantic properties of the environment allowing for user-specified restrictions on the airspace. The generated trajectories account for the desired model resolution and the demands on a successful photogrammetric reconstruction. We exploit semantics from an initial flight to extract the target object and to define restricted and prohibited airspaces which have to be avoided during the path planning process to ensure a safe and short UAV path, while still aiming to maximize the object reconstruction quality. The path planning problem is formulated as an orienteering problem and solved via discrete optimization exploiting submodularity and photogrammetrical relevant heuristics. An evaluation of our method on a customized synthetic scene and on outdoor experiments suggests the real-world capability of our methodology by providing feasible, short and safe flight plans for the generation of detailed 3D reconstruction models.

AB  - One of the most promising approaches to address the mismatch between computation- intensive applications and computation-limited end devices is multi-access edge computing (MEC). To overcome the rapid increase in traffic volume and offload the traffic from macrocells, a massive number of small cells have been deployed, so-called heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Strongly motivated by the close integration of MEC and HetNets, in this paper, we propose an envisioned architecture of MEC-empowered HetNets, where both wireless and wired backhaul solutions are supported, flying base stations (BSs) can be equipped with MEC servers, and mobile users (MUs) need both communication and computation resources for their computationally heavy tasks. Subsequently, we provide the research progress summary of task offloading and resource allocation in the proposed MEC-empowered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted heterogeneous networks. We complete this article by spotlighting key challenges and open future directives for researches.

TI  - Estimating PM10 Concentration from Drilling Operations in Open-Pit Mines Using an Assembly of SVR and PSO
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Dust is one of the components causing heavy environmental pollution in open-pit mines, especially PM10. Some pathologies related to the lung, respiratory system, and occupational diseases have been identified due to the effects of PM10 in open-pit mines. Therefore, the prediction and control of PM10 concentration in the production process are necessary for environmental and health protection. In this study, PM10 concentration from drilling operations in the Coc Sau open-pit coal mine (Vietnam) was investigated and considered through a database including 245 datasets collected. A novel hybrid artificial intelligence model was developed based on support vector regression (SVR) and a swarm optimization algorithm (i.e., particle swarm optimization (PSO)), namely PSO-SVR, for estimating PM10 concentration from drilling operations at the mine. Polynomial (P), radial basis function (RBF), and linear (L) kernel functions were considered and applied to the development of the PSO-SVR models in the present study, abbreviated as PSO-SVR-P, PSO-SVR-RBF, and PSO-SVR-L. Also, three benchmark artificial intelligence techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and classification and regression trees (CART), were applied and developed for estimating PM10 concentration and then compared with the PSO-SVR models. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R2) were used as the statistical criteria for evaluating the performance of the developed models. The results exhibited that the PSO algorithm had an essential role in the optimization of the hyper-parameters of the SVR models. The PSO-SVR models (i.e., PSO-SVR-L, PSO-SVR-P, and PSO-SVR-RBF) had higher performance levels than the other models (i.e., RF, CART, and KNN) with an RMSE of 0.040, 0.042, and 0.043; and R2 of 0.954, 0.948, and 0.946; for the PSO-SVR-L, PSO-SVR-P, and PSO-SVR-RBF models, respectively. Of these PSO-SVR models, the PSO-SVR-L model was the most dominant model with an RMSE of 0.040 and R2 of 0.954. The remaining three benchmark models (i.e., RF, CART, and KNN) yielded a more unsatisfactory performance with an RMSE of 0.060, 0.052, and 0.067; and R2 of 0.894, 0.924, and 0.867, for the RF, CART, and KNN models, respectively. Furthermore, the findings of this study demonstrated that the density of rock mass, moisture content, and the penetration rate of the drill were essential parameters on the PM10 concentration caused by drilling operations in open-pit mines.

AB  - Feature tracking in image collections significantly affects the efficiency and accuracy of Structure from Motion (SFM). Insufficient correspondences may result in disconnected structures and incomplete components, while the redundant correspondences containing incorrect ones may yield to folded and superimposed structures. In this paper, we present a Superpixel-based feature tracking method for structure from motion. In the proposed method, we first propose to use a joint approach to detect local keypoints and compute descriptors. Second, the superpixel-based approach is used to generate labels for the input image. Third, we combine the Speed Up Robust Feature and binary test in the generated label regions to produce a set of combined descriptors for the detected keypoints. Fourth, the locality-sensitive hash (LSH)-based k nearest neighboring matching (KNN) is utilized to produce feature correspondences, and then the ratio test approach is used to remove outliers from the previous matching collection. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on several challenging benchmarking datasets including highly ambiguous and duplicated scenes. Experimental results show that the proposed method gets better performances with respect to the state of the art methods.

TI  - TIR-MS: Thermal Infrared Mean-Shift for Robust Pedestrian Head Tracking in Dynamic Target and Background Variations
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) pedestrian tracking is one of the major issues in computer vision. Mean-shift is a powerful and versatile non-parametric iterative algorithm for finding local maxima in probability distributions. In existing infrared data, and mean-shift-based tracking is generally based on the brightness feature values. Unfortunately, the brightness is distorted by the target and background variations. This paper proposes a novel pedestrian tracking algorithm, thermal infrared mean-shift (TIR-MS), by introducing radiometric temperature data in mean-shift tracking. The thermal brightness image (eight-bits) was distorted by the automatic contrast enhancement of the scene such as hot objects in the background. On the other hand, the temperature data was unaffected directly by the background change, except for variations by the seasonal effect, which is more stable than the brightness. The experimental results showed that the TIR-MS outperformed the original mean-shift-based brightness when tracking a pedestrian head with successive background variations.

AB  - Scan matching is an important task, solved in the context of many high-level problems including pose estimation, indoor localization, simultaneous localization and mapping and others. Methods that are accurate and adaptive and at the same time computationally efficient are required to enable location-based services in autonomous mobile devices. Such devices usually have a wide range of high-resolution sensors but only a limited processing power and constrained energy supply. This work introduces a novel high-level scan matching strategy that uses a combination of two advanced algorithms recently used in this field: cross-correlation and differential evolution. The cross-correlation between two laser range scans is used as an efficient measure of scan alignment and the differential evolution algorithm is used to search for the parameters of a transformation that aligns the scans. The proposed method was experimentally validated and showed good ability to match laser range scans taken shortly after each other and an excellent ability to match laser range scans taken with longer time intervals between them.

TI  - A QoE-Oriented Uplink Allocation for Multi-UAV Video Streaming
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 15
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Video streaming has become a kind of main information carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Unlike single transmission, when a cluster of UAVs execute the real-time video shooting and uploading mission, the insufficiency of wireless channel resources will lead to bandwidth competition among them and the competition will bring bad watching experience to the audience. Therefore, how to allocate uplink bandwidth reasonably in the cluster has become a crucial problem. In this paper, an intelligent and distributed allocation mechanism is designed for improving users&rsquo; video viewing satisfication. Each UAV in a cluster can independently adjust and select its video encoding rate so as to achieve flexible uplink allocation. This choice relies neither on the existence of the central node, nor on the large amount of information interaction between UAVs. Firstly, in order to distinguish video service from ordinary data, a utility function for the overall Quality of Experience (QoE) is proposed. Then, a potential game model is built around the problem. By a distributed self-learning algorithm with low complexity, all UAVs can iteratively update their own bandwidth strategy in a short time until equilibria, thus achieving the total quality optimization of all videos. Numeric simulation results indicate, after a few iterations, that the algorithm converges to a set of correlation equilibria. This mechanism not only solves the uplink allocation problem of video streaming in UAV cluster, but also guarantees the wireless resource providers in distinguishing and ensuring network service quality.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 15
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the fast development of commercial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, there are increasing research interests on UAV communications. In this work, the mobility and deployment flexibility of UAVs are exploited to form a buffer-aided relaying system assisting terrestrial communication that is blocked. Optimal UAV trajectory design of the UAV-enabled mobile relaying system with a randomly located eavesdropper is investigated from the physical-layer security perspective to improve the overall secrecy rate. Based on the mobility of the UAV relay, a wireless channel model that changes with the trajectory and is exploited for improved secrecy is established. The secrecy rate is maximized by optimizing the discretized trajectory anchor points based on the information causality and UAV mobility constraints. However, the problem is non-convex and therefore difficult to solve. To make the problem tractable, we alternatively optimize the increments of the trajectory anchor points iteratively in a two-dimensional space and decompose the problem into progressive convex approximate problems through the iterative procedure. Convergence of the proposed iterative trajectory optimization technique is proved analytically by the squeeze principle. Simulation results show that finding the optimal trajectory by iteratively updating the displacements is effective and fast converging. It is also shown by the simulation results that the distribution of the eavesdropper location influences the security performance of the system. Specifically, an eavesdropper further away from the destination is beneficial to the system&rsquo;s overall secrecy rate. Furthermore, it is observed that eavesdropper being further away from the destination also results in shorter trajectories, which implies it being energy-efficient as well.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a primary role in a plethora of technical and scientific fields owing to their wide range of applications. In particular, the provision of emergency services during the occurrence of a crisis event is a vital application domain where such aerial robots can contribute, sending out valuable assistance to both distressed humans and rescue teams. Bearing in mind that time constraints constitute a crucial parameter in search and rescue (SAR) missions, the punctual and precise detection of humans in peril is of paramount importance. The paper in hand deals with real-time human detection onboard a fully autonomous rescue UAV. Using deep learning techniques, the implemented embedded system was capable of detecting open water swimmers. This allowed the UAV to provide assistance accurately in a fully unsupervised manner, thus enhancing first responder operational capabilities. The novelty of the proposed system is the combination of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) techniques and computer vision algorithms for both precise human detection and rescue apparatus release. Details about hardware configuration as well as the system&rsquo;s performance evaluation are fully discussed.

AB  - Small unmanned aircraft vehicles (SUAVs) or drones are very useful for visual detection and tracking due to their efficiency in capturing scenes. This paper addresses the detection and tracking of moving pedestrians with an SUAV. The detection step consists of frame subtraction, followed by thresholding, morphological filter, and false alarm reduction, taking into consideration the true size of targets. The center of the detected area is input to the next tracking stage. Interacting multiple model (IMM) filtering estimates the state of vectors and covariance matrices, using multiple modes of Kalman filtering. In the experiments, a dozen people and one car are captured by a stationary drone above the road. The Kalman filter and the IMM filter with two or three modes are compared in the accuracy of the state estimation. The root-mean squared errors (RMSE) of position and velocity are obtained for each target and show the good accuracy in detecting and tracking the target position&mdash;the average detection rate is 96.5%. When the two-mode IMM filter is used, the minimum average position and velocity RMSE obtained are around 0.8 m and 0.59 m/s, respectively.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The millimeter-wave (mmWave) antenna array plays an important role in the excellent performance of wireless sensors networks (WSN) or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) clusters. However, the array elements are easily damaged in its harsh working environment but hard to be repaired or exchanged timely, resulting in a serious decline in the beamforming performance. Thus, accurate self-diagnosis of the failed elements is of great importance. In previous studies, there are still significant difficulties for large-scale arrays under extremely low SNR. In this paper, a diagnosis algorithm with low complexity and high reliability for the failed elements is proposed, which is based on a joint decision of communication signal and sensing echoes. Compared with the previous studies, the complexity of the algorithm is reduced by the construction of low-dimensional feature vectors for classification, the decoupling of the degree of arrival (DOA) estimation and the failed pattern diagnosis, with the help of the sub-array division. Simulation results show that, under an ultra-low SNR of &minus;12.5 dB for communication signals and &minus;16 dB for sensing echoes, an accurate self-diagnosis with a block error rate lower than 8% can be realized. The study in this paper will effectively promote the long-term and reliable operation of the mmWave antenna array in WSN, UAV clusters and other similar fields.

T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 17
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In this paper, a power control method is proposed for a buffer-aided relay node (RN) to enhance the energy efficiency of the RN system. By virtue of a buffer, the RN can reserve the data at the buffer when the the channel gain between an RN and a destination node (DN) is weaker than that between SN and RN. The RN then opportunistically forward the reserved data in the buffer according to channel condition between the RN and the DN. By exploiting the buffer, RN reduces transmit power when it reduces the transmit data rate and reserve the data in the buffer. Therefore, without any total throughput reduction, the power consumption of RN can be reduced, resulting in the energy efficiency (EE) improvement of the RN system. Furthermore, for the power control, we devise a simple power control method based on a two-dimensional surface fitting model of an optimal transmit power of RN. The proposed RN power control method is readily and locally implementable at the RN, and it can significantly improve EE of the RN compared to the fixed power control method and the spectral efficiency based method as verified by the rigorous numerical results.

SN  - 2504-446X

AB  - The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly growing in popularity. Initially introduced for military purposes, over the past few years, UAVs and related technologies have successfully transitioned to a whole new range of civilian applications such as delivery, logistics, surveillance, entertainment, and so forth. They have opened new possibilities such as allowing operation in otherwise difficult or hazardous areas, for instance. For all applications, one foremost concern is the selection of the paths and trajectories of UAVs, and at the same time, UAVs control comes with many challenges, as they have limited energy, limited load capacity and are vulnerable to difficult weather conditions. Generally, efficiently operating a drone can be mathematically formalized as a path optimization problem under some constraints. This shares some commonalities with similar problems that have been extensively studied in the context of urban vehicles and it is only natural that the recent literature has extended the latter to fit aerial vehicle constraints. The knowledge of such problems, their formulation, the resolution methods proposed—through the variants induced specifically by UAVs features—are of interest for practitioners for any UAV application. Hence, in this study, we propose a review of existing literature devoted to such UAV path optimization problems, focusing specifically on the sub-class of problems that consider the mobility on a macroscopic scale. These are related to the two existing general classic ones—the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. We analyze the recent literature that adapted the problems to the UAV context, provide an extensive classification and taxonomy of their problems and their formulation and also give a synthetic overview of the resolution techniques, performance metrics and obtained numerical results.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Modern Public Safety Networks (PSNs) are assisted by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide a resilient communication paradigm during catastrophic events. In this context, we propose a distributed user-centric risk-aware resource management framework in UAV-assisted PSNs supported by both a static UAV and a mobile UAV. The mobile UAV is entitled to a larger portion of the available spectrum due to its capability and flexibility to re-position itself, and therefore establish better communication channel conditions to the users, compared to the static UAV. However, the potential over-exploitation of the mobile UAV-based communication by the users may lead to the mobile UAV&rsquo;s failure to serve the users due to the increased levels of interference, consequently introducing risk in the user decisions. To capture this uncertainty, we follow the principles of Prospect Theory and design a user&rsquo;s prospect-theoretic utility function that reflects user&rsquo;s risk-aware behavior regarding its transmission power investment to the static and/or mobile UAV-based communication option. A non-cooperative game among the users is formulated, where each user determines its power investment strategy to the two available communication choices in order to maximize its expected prospect-theoretic utility. The existence and uniqueness of a Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE) is proven and the convergence of the users&rsquo; strategies to it is shown. An iterative distributed and low-complexity algorithm is introduced to determine the PNE. The performance of the proposed user-centric risk-aware resource management framework in terms of users&rsquo; achievable data rate and spectrum utilization, is achieved via modeling and simulation. Furthermore, its superiority and benefits are demonstrated, by comparing its performance against other existing approaches with regards to UAV selection and spectrum utilization.

AB  - Natural-language-based scene understanding can enable heterogeneous robots to cooperate efficiently in large and unconstructed environments. However, studies on symbolic planning rarely consider the semantic knowledge acquisition problem associated with the surrounding environments. Further, recent developments in deep learning methods show outstanding performance for semantic scene understanding using natural language. In this paper, a cooperation framework that connects deep learning techniques and a symbolic planner for heterogeneous robots is proposed. The framework is largely composed of the scene understanding engine, planning agent, and knowledge engine. We employ neural networks for natural-language-based scene understanding to share environmental information among robots. We then generate a sequence of actions for each robot using a planning domain definition language planner. JENA-TDB is used for knowledge acquisition storage. The proposed method is validated using simulation results obtained from one unmanned aerial and three ground vehicles.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Recently, model predictive control (MPC) is increasingly applied to path tracking of mobile devices, such as mobile robots. The characteristics of these MPC-based controllers are not identical due to the different approaches taken during design. According to the differences in the prediction models, we believe that the existing MPC-based path tracking controllers can be divided into four categories. We named them linear model predictive control (LMPC), linear error model predictive control (LEMPC), nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), and nonlinear error model predictive control (NEMPC). Subsequently, we built these four controllers for the same mobile robot and compared them. By comparison, we got some conclusions. The real-time performance of LMPC and LEMPC is good, but they are less robust to reference paths and positioning errors. NMPC performs well when the reference velocity is high and the radius of the reference path is small. It is also robust to positioning errors. However, the real-time performance of NMPC is slightly worse. NEMPC has many disadvantages. Like LMPC and LEMPC, it performs poorly when the reference velocity is high and the radius of the reference path is small. Its real-time performance is also not good enough.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Autonomous grasping with an aerial manipulator in the applications of aerial transportation and manipulation is still a challenging problem because of the complex kinematics/dynamics and motion constraints of the coupled rotors-manipulator system. The paper develops a novel aerial manipulation system with a lightweight manipulator, an X8 coaxial octocopter and onboard visual tracking system. To implement autonomous grasping control, we develop a novel and efficient approach that includes trajectory planning, visual trajectory tracking and kinematic compensation. Trajectory planning for aerial grasping control is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, while motion constraints and collision avoidance are considered in the optimization. A genetic method is applied to obtain the optimal solution. A kinematic compensation-based visual trajectory tracking is introduced to address the coupled affection between the manipulator and octocopter, with the advantage of discarding the complex dynamic parameter calibration. Finally, several experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In this paper, a Next Best View (NBV) approach with a profiling stage and a novel utility function for 3D reconstruction using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is proposed. The proposed approach performs an initial scan in order to build a rough model of the structure that is later used to improve coverage completeness and reduce flight time. Then, a more thorough NBV process is initiated, utilizing the rough model in order to create a dense 3D reconstruction of the structure of interest. The proposed approach exploits the reflectional symmetry feature if it exists in the initial scan of the structure. The proposed NBV approach is implemented with a novel utility function, which consists of four main components: information theory, model density, traveled distance, and predictive measures based on symmetries in the structure. This system outperforms classic information gain approaches with a higher density, entropy reduction and coverage completeness. Simulated and real experiments were conducted and the results show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Deep- and reinforcement-learning techniques have increasingly required large sets of real data to achieve stable convergence and generalization, in the context of image-recognition, object-detection or motion-control strategies. On this subject, the research community lacks robust approaches to overcome unavailable real-world extensive data by means of realistic synthetic-information and domain-adaptation techniques. In this work, synthetic-learning strategies have been used for the vision-based autonomous following of a noncooperative multirotor. The complete maneuver was learned with synthetic images and high-dimensional low-level continuous robot states, with deep- and reinforcement-learning techniques for object detection and motion control, respectively. A novel motion-control strategy for object following is introduced where the camera gimbal movement is coupled with the multirotor motion during the multirotor following. Results confirm that our present framework can be used to deploy a vision-based task in real flight using synthetic data. It was extensively validated in both simulated and real-flight scenarios, providing proper results (following a multirotor up to 1.3 m/s in simulation and 0.3 m/s in real flights).

TI  - A Novel Artificial Intelligence Technique to Estimate the Gross Calorific Value of Coal Based on Meta-Heuristic and Support Vector Regression Algorithms
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Gross calorific value (GCV) is one of the essential parameters for evaluating coal quality. Therefore, accurate GCV prediction is one of the primary ways to improve heating value as well as coal production. A novel evolutionary-based predictive system was proposed in this study for predicting GCV with high accuracy, namely the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-support vector regression (SVR) model. It was developed based on the SVR and PSO algorithms. Three different kernel functions were employed to establish the PSO-SVR models, including radial basis function, linear, and polynomial functions. Besides, three benchmark machine learning models including classification and regression trees (CART), multiple linear regression (MLR), and principle component analysis (PCA) were also developed to estimate GCV and then compared with the proposed PSO-SVR model; 2583 coal samples were used to analyze the proximate components and GCV for this study. Then, they were used to develop the mentioned models as well as check their performance in experimental results. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R2), ranking, and intensity color criteria were used and computed to evaluate the GCV predictive models developed. The results revealed that the proposed PSO-SVR model with radial basis function had better accuracy than the other models. The PSO algorithm was optimized in the SVR model with high efficiency. These should be used as a supporting tool in practical engineering to determine the heating value of coal seams in complex geological conditions.

TI  - Aircraft Target Classification for Conventional Narrow-Band Radar with Multi-Wave Gates Sparse Echo Data
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 22
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - For a conventional narrow-band radar system, the detectable information of the target is limited, and it is difficult for the radar to accurately identify the target type. In particular, the classification probability will further decrease when part of the echo data is missed. By extracting the target features in time and frequency domains from multi-wave gates sparse echo data, this paper presents a classification algorithm in conventional narrow-band radar to identify three different types of aircraft target, i.e., helicopter, propeller and jet. Firstly, the classical sparse reconstruction algorithm is utilized to reconstruct the target frequency spectrum with single-wave gate sparse echo data. Then, the micro-Doppler effect caused by rotating parts of different targets is analyzed, and the micro-Doppler based features, such as amplitude deviation coefficient, time domain waveform entropy and frequency domain waveform entropy, are extracted from reconstructed echo data to identify targets. Thirdly, the target features extracted from multi-wave gates reconstructed echo data are weighted and fused to improve the accuracy of classification. Finally, the fused feature vectors are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) model for classification. By contrast with the conventional algorithm of aircraft target classification, the proposed algorithm can effectively process sparse echo data and achieve higher classification probability via weighted features fusion of multi-wave gates echo data. The experiments on synthetic data are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - The networked unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) radar system may exploit inter-UAV cooperation for enhancing information acquisition capabilities, meanwhile its inter-UAV communications may be interfered with by external jammers. This paper is devoted to quantifying and optimizing the anti-jamming performance of networked UAV radar systems in adversarial electromagnetic environments. Firstly, instead of using the conventional metric of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), this paper explores use of the theory of radar information representation as the basis of evaluating the information acquisition capabilities of the networked UAV radar systems. Secondly, this paper proposes a modified Q-Learning method based on double greedy algorithm to optimize the anti-jamming performance of the networked UAV radar systems, through joint programming in the frequency-motion-antenna domain. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the algorithm in two different networking scenarios.

AB  - Over the last few years, several researchers have been developing protocols and applications in order to autonomously land unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, most of the proposed protocols rely on expensive equipment or do not satisfy the high precision needs of some UAV applications such as package retrieval and delivery or the compact landing of UAV swarms. Therefore, in this work, a solution for high precision landing based on the use of ArUco markers is presented. In the proposed solution, a UAV equipped with a low-cost camera is able to detect ArUco markers sized     56 &times; 56     cm from an altitude of up to 30 m. Once the marker is detected, the UAV changes its flight behavior in order to land on the exact position where the marker is located. The proposal was evaluated and validated using both the ArduSim simulation platform and real UAV flights. The results show an average offset of only 11 cm from the target position, which vastly improves the landing accuracy compared to the traditional GPS-based landing, which typically deviates from the intended target by 1 to 3 m.

PY  - 2020

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper demonstrates the use of Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), together with Raspberry Pi3 B+ (RP3) as the brain (or the decision making engine), to develop a distributed wireless network in which nodes can communicate with other nodes independently and make decision autonomously. In other words, each USRP node (i.e., sensor) is embedded with separate processing units (i.e., RP3), which has not been investigated in the literature, so that each node can make independent decisions in a distributed manner. The proposed testbed in this paper is compared with the traditional distributed testbed, which has been widely used in the literature. In the traditional distributed testbed, there is a single processing unit (i.e., a personal computer) that makes decisions in a centralized manner, and each node (i.e., USRP) is connected to the processing unit via a switch. The single processing unit exchanges control messages with nodes via the switch, while the nodes exchange data packets among themselves using a wireless medium in a distributed manner. The main disadvantage of the traditional testbed is that, despite the network being distributed in nature, decisions are made in a centralized manner. Hence, the response delay of the control message exchange is always neglected. The use of such testbed is mainly due to the limited hardware and monetary cost to acquire a separate processing unit for each node. The experiment in our testbed has shown the increase of end-to-end delay and decrease of packet delivery ratio due to software and hardware delays. The observed multihop transmission is performed using device-to-device (D2D) communication, which has been enabled in 5G. Therefore, nodes can either communicate with other nodes via: (a) a direct communication with the base station at the macrocell, which helps to improve network performance; or (b) D2D that improve spectrum efficiency, whereby traffic is offloaded from macrocell to small cells. Our testbed is the first of its kind in this scale, and it uses RP3 as the distributed decision-making engine incorporated into the USRP/GNU radio platform. This work provides an insight to the development of a 5G network.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Flying ad hoc network (FANET) is a self-organizing wireless network that enables inexpensive, flexible, and easy-to-deploy flying nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to communicate among themselves in the absence of fixed network infrastructure. FANET is one of the emerging networks that has an extensive range of next-generation applications. Hence, FANET plays a significant role in achieving application-based goals. Routing enables the flying nodes to collaborate and coordinate among themselves and to establish routes to radio access infrastructure, particularly FANET base station (BS). With a longer route lifetime, the effects of link disconnections and network partitions reduce. Routing must cater to two main characteristics of FANETs that reduce the route lifetime. Firstly, the collaboration nature requires the flying nodes to exchange messages and to coordinate among themselves, causing high energy consumption. Secondly, the mobility pattern of the flying nodes is highly dynamic in a three-dimensional space and they may be spaced far apart, causing link disconnection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the limited research work of routing schemes in FANETs. Different aspects, including objectives, challenges, routing metrics, characteristics, and performance measures, are covered. Furthermore, we present open issues.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Collaboration between multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to establish a Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) is a growing trend since future applications claim for more autonomous and rapidly deployable systems. In this context, Software-Defined Networking FANET (SDN-FANET ) separates the control and data plane and provides network programmability, which considers a centralized controller to perform all FANET control functions based on global UAV context information, such as UAV positions, movement trajectories, residual energy, and others. However, control message dissemination in an SDN-FANET with low overhead and high performance is not a trivial task due to FANET particular characteristics, i.e., high mobility, failures in UAV to UAV communication, and short communication range. With this in mind, it is essential to predict UAV information for control message dissemination as well as consider hierarchical network architecture, reducing bandwidth consumption and signaling overhead. In this article, we present a Cluster-bAsed control Plane messages management in sOftware-defined flying ad-hoc NEtwork, called CAPONE. Based on UAV contextual information, the controller can predict UAV information without control message transmission. In addition, CAPONE divides the FANET into groups by computing the number of clusters using the Gap statistics method, which is input for a Fuzzy C-means method to determine the group leader and members. In this way, CAPONE reduces the bandwidth consumption and signaling overhead, while guaranteeing the control message delivering in FANET scenarios. Extensive simulations are used to show the gains of the CAPONE in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio, overhead, and energy compared to existing SDN-FANET architectures.

AB  - In order to protect human lives and infrastructure, as well as to minimize the risk of damage, it is important to predict and respond to natural disasters in advance. However, currently, the standardized disaster response system in South Korea still needs further advancement, and the response phase systems need to be improved to ensure that they are properly equipped to cope with natural disasters. Existing studies on intelligent disaster management systems (IDSSs) in South Korea have focused only on storms, floods, and earthquakes, and they have not used past data. This research proposes a new conceptual framework of an IDSS for disaster management, with particular attention paid to wildfires and cold/heat waves. The IDSS uses big data collected from open application programming interface (API) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to help decision-makers make faster and more accurate decisions. In addition, a simple example of the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect fire in surveillance video has been developed, which can be used for automatic fire detection and provide an appropriate response. The system will also consider connecting to open source intelligence (OSINT) to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and develop more robust security policies than those currently in place to prevent cyber-attacks.

Through optimizing the Stackelberg game model and multi-attribute decision-making, the multi-master, multi-slave, multi-agent system of the Stackelberg game was designed, and the closed loop problem under the Stackelberg game is solved for dimension reduction and optimal function value. Finally, through the numerical derivation simulation and the training results of related system data, the high efficiency and strong robustness of the model were verified from multiple perspectives, and this model algorithm was proved to be true and highly efficient.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Modern elevation-determining remote sensing technologies such as light-detection and ranging (LiDAR) produce a wealth of topographic information that is increasingly being used in a wide range of disciplines, including archaeology and geomorphology. However, automated methods for mapping topographic features have remained a significant challenge. Deep learning (DL) mask regional-convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNN), which provides context-based instance mapping, offers the potential to overcome many of the difficulties of previous approaches to topographic mapping. We therefore explore the application of Mask R-CNN to extract valley fill faces (VFFs), which are a product of mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States. LiDAR-derived slopeshades are provided as the only predictor variable in the model. Model generalization is evaluated by mapping multiple study sites outside the training data region. A range of assessment methods, including precision, recall, and F1 score, all based on VFF counts, as well as area- and a fuzzy area-based user&rsquo;s and producer&rsquo;s accuracy, indicate that the model was successful in mapping VFFs in new geographic regions, using elevation data derived from different LiDAR sensors. Precision, recall, and F1-score values were above 0.85 using VFF counts while user&rsquo;s and producer&rsquo;s accuracy were above 0.75 and 0.85 when using the area- and fuzzy area-based methods, respectively, when averaged across all study areas characterized with LiDAR data. Due to the limited availability of LiDAR data until relatively recently, we also assessed how well the model generalizes to terrain data created using photogrammetric methods that characterize past terrain conditions. Unfortunately, the model was not sufficiently general to allow successful mapping of VFFs using photogrammetrically-derived slopeshades, as all assessment metrics were lower than 0.60; however, this may partially be attributed to the quality of the photogrammetric data. The overall results suggest that the combination of Mask R-CNN and LiDAR has great potential for mapping anthropogenic and natural landscape features. To realize this vision, however, research on the mapping of other topographic features is needed, as well as the development of large topographic training datasets including a variety of features for calibrating and testing new methods.

AB  - In this paper, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, and robust deep deterministic policy gradient (Robust-DDPG), is proposed for developing a controller that allows robust flying of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in dynamic uncertain environments. This technique is applicable in many fields, such as penetration and remote surveillance. The learning-based controller is constructed with an actor-critic framework, and can perform a dual-channel continuous control (roll and speed) of the UAV. To overcome the fragility and volatility of original DDPG, three critical learning tricks are introduced in Robust-DDPG: (1) Delayed-learning trick, providing stable learnings, while facing dynamic environments; (2) adversarial attack trick, improving policy&rsquo;s adaptability to uncertain environments; (3) mixed exploration trick, enabling faster convergence of the model. The training experiments show great improvement in its convergence speed, convergence effect, and stability. The exploiting experiments demonstrate high efficiency in providing the UAV a shorter and smoother path. While, the generalization experiments verify its better adaptability to complicated, dynamic and uncertain environments, comparing to Deep Q Network (DQN) and DDPG algorithms.

AB  - The autonomous landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on a marker is one of the most challenging problems in robotics. Many solutions have been proposed, with the best results achieved via customized geometric features and external sensors. This paper discusses for the first time the use of deep reinforcement learning as an end-to-end learning paradigm to find a policy for UAVs autonomous landing. Our method is based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm that splits a task into sequential sub-tasks, each one assigned to a Deep Q-Network (DQN), hence the name Sequential Deep Q-Network (SDQN). Each DQN in an SDQN is activated by an internal trigger, and it represents a component of a high-level control policy, which can navigate the UAV towards the marker. Different technical solutions have been implemented, for example combining vanilla and double DQNs, and the introduction of a partitioned buffer replay to address the problem of sample efficiency. One of the main contributions of this work consists in showing how an SDQN trained in a simulator via domain randomization, can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios of increasing complexity. The performance of SDQNs is comparable with a state-of-the-art algorithm and human pilots while being quantitatively better in noisy conditions.

AB  - A reactive three-dimensional maneuver strategy for a multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is proposed based on the collision cone approach to avoid potential collision with a single moving obstacle detected by an onboard sensor. A Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) system is assumed to be mounted on a hexacopter to obtain the obstacle information from the collected point clouds. The collision cone approach is enhanced to appropriately deal with the moving obstacle with the help of a Kalman filter. The filter estimates the position, velocity, and acceleration of the obstacle by using the LiDAR data as the associated measurement. The obstacle state estimate is utilized to predict the future trajectories of the moving obstacle. The collision detection and obstacle avoidance maneuver decisions are made considering the predicted trajectory of the obstacle. Numerical simulations, including a Monte Carlo campaign, are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed collision avoidance algorithm.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted relay mobile edge computing (MEC) network is a prominent concept, where network deployment is flexible and network coverage is wide. In scenarios such as emergency communications and low-cost coverage, optimization of offloading methods and resource utilization are important ways to improve system effectiveness due to limited terminal and UAV energy and hardware equipment. A multilevel edge computing network resource optimization model on the basis of UAV fusion that provides relay forwarding and offload services is established by considering the initial energy state of the UAV, the green energy charging function, and the reliability of computing offload. With normalized system utility function maximization as the goal, a Markov decision process algorithm meets the needs of the practical application scene and provides a flexible and effective unloading mode. This algorithm is adopted to solve the optimal offloading mode and the optimal resource utilization scheme. Simulations verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed multilevel offloading model. The proposed model can optimize system resource allocation and effectively improve the utility function and user experience of computing offloading systems.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) received an unprecedented surge of people&rsquo;s interest worldwide in recent years. This paper investigates the specific problem of cooperative mission planning for multiple UAVs on the battlefield from a hierarchical decision-making perspective. From the view of the actual mission planning issue, the two key problems to be solved in UAV collaborative mission planning are mission allocation and route planning. In this paper, both of these problems are taken into account via a hierarchical decision-making model. Firstly, we use a target clustering algorithm to divide the original targets into target subgroups, where each target subgroup contains multiple targets. Secondly, a fuzzy ant colony algorithm is used to calculate the global path between target subgroups for a single-target group. Thirdly, a fuzzy ant colony algorithm is also used to calculate the local path between multiple targets for a single-target subgroup. After three levels of decision-making, the complete path for multiple UAVs can be obtained. In order to improve the efficiency of a collaborative task between different types of UAVs, a cooperative communication strategy is developed, which can reduce the number of UAVs performing tasks. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative mission planning and cooperative communication strategy for multiple UAVs.

AB  - The optimization issues connected to a landing task of an unmanned aerial vehicle are discussed in the paper, based on a model of a mini-class drone. Three landing scenarios are considered, including minimum-time landing, landing with minimum energy consumption, and planned landing. With the use of classical dynamic programming techniques, including the minimum principle of Pontryagin, as well as the calculus of variations, the optimal altitude reference trajectories are found, to form the altitude control system in such a way as to mimic the profile of the reference trajectory by the actual altitude of the UAV. The simulation results conducted with the use of the Simulink Support Package for Parrot Minidrones verify the correctness and effectiveness of the method, and open the research directions for further analysis, especially to tune altitude controller in a way, as to track the reference profile. Up to this point, optimization tasks considered in the literature, with respect to the drones, were connected to swarm formation optimization, optimization of the take-off process or landing process limited to optimal path planning. This paper thus considers a new topic in the field.

AB  - The rapid development of industry results in large energy consumption and a negative impact on the environment. Pollution of the environment caused by conventional energy sources such as petrol leads to increased demand for propulsion systems with higher efficiency and capable of energy-saving and emission reduction. The usage of hybrid technology is expected to improve energy conversion efficiency, reduce energy consumption and environmental pollution. In this paper, the simulation platform for the hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been built by establishing the subsystem models of the UAV power system. Under the two chosen working conditions, the conventional cruise flight mission and the terrain tracking mission, the power tracking control and Q-Learning method have been used to design the energy management controller for the hybrid UAV. The fuel consumption and pollutant emissions under each working condition were calculated. The results show that the hybrid system can improve the efficiency of the UAV system, reduce the fuel consumption of the UAV, and so reduce the emissions of CO2, NOx, and other pollutants. This contributes to improving of environmental quality, energy-saving, and emission reduction, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of aviation.

Sensors and processors collect and transmit information and data from users as a result of the application of robot control systems and sensory feedback. This paper proposes that the estimation of a collaborative robot system&rsquo;s performance can be achieved by evaluating the mobility of robots. Scenarios have been determined in which an autonomous system has been used for intervention in crisis situations due to fire. The experimental model consists of three autonomous vehicles, two of which are ground vehicles and the other is an aerial vehicle. The conclusion of the research described in this paper highlights the fact that the integration of robotic systems made up of autonomous vehicles working in unstructured environments is difficult and at present there is no unitary analytical model.

AB  - A groundbreaking design of radio access networks (RANs) is needed to fulfill 5G traffic requirements. To this aim, a cost-effective and flexible strategy consists of complementing terrestrial RANs with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, several problems must be solved in order to effectively deploy such UAV-based RANs (U-RANs). Indeed, due to the high complexity and heterogeneity of these networks, model-based design approaches, often relying on restrictive assumptions and constraints, exhibit severe limitation in real-world scenarios. Moreover, design of a set of appropriate protocols for such U-RANs is a highly sophisticated task. In this context, machine learning (ML) emerges as a useful tool to obtain practical and effective solutions. In this paper, we discuss why, how, and which types of ML methods are useful for designing U-RANs, by focusing in particular on supervised and reinforcement learning strategies.

AB  - Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising mobile wireless sensor network architecture to address the challenges of ever-increasing mobile data traffic and network costs. C-RAN is a practical solution to the strict energy-constrained wireless sensor nodes, often found in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Although this architecture can provide energy efficiency and reduce cost, it is a challenging task in C-RAN to utilize the resources efficiently, considering the dynamic real-time environment. Several research works have proposed different methodologies for effective resource management in C-RAN. This study performs a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art resource management techniques that have been proposed recently for this architecture. The resource management techniques are categorized into computational resource management (CRM) and radio resource management (RRM) techniques. Then both of the techniques are further classified and analyzed based on the strategies used in the studies. Remote radio head (RRH) clustering schemes used in CRM techniques are discussed extensively. In this research work, the investigated performance metrics and their validation techniques are critically analyzed. Moreover, other important challenges and open research issues for efficient resource management in C-RAN are highlighted to provide future research direction.

AB  - Photogrammetry involves aerial photography of the Earth&rsquo;s surface and subsequently processing the images to provide a more accurate depiction of the area (Orthophotography). It is used by the Spanish Instituto Geogr&aacute;fico Nacional to update road cartography but requires a significant amount of manual labor due to the need to perform visual inspection of all tiled images. Deep learning techniques (artificial neural networks with more than one hidden layer) can perform road detection but it is still unclear how to find the optimal network architecture. Our main goal is the automatic design of deep neural network architectures with grammar-guided genetic programming. In this kind of evolutive algorithm, all the population individuals (here candidate network architectures) are constrained to rules specified by a grammar that defines valid and useful structural patterns to guide the search process. Grammar used includes well-known complex structures (e.g., Inception-like modules) combined with a custom designed mutation operator (dynamically links the mutation probability to structural diversity). Pilot results show that the system is able to design models for road detection that obtain test accuracies similar to that reached by state-of-the-art models when evaluated over a dataset from the Spanish National Aerial Orthophotography Plan.

AB  - Generating Digital Elevation Models (DEM) from satellite imagery or other data sources constitutes an essential tool for a plethora of applications and disciplines, ranging from 3D flight planning and simulation, autonomous driving and satellite navigation, such as GPS, to modeling water flow, precision farming and forestry. The task of extracting this 3D geometry from a given surface hitherto requires a combination of appropriately collected corresponding samples and/or specialized equipment, as inferring the elevation from single image data is out of reach for contemporary approaches. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have experienced unprecedented growth in recent years as they can extrapolate rules in a data-driven manner and retrieve convoluted, nonlinear one-to-one mappings, such as an approximate mapping from satellite imagery to DEMs. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end Deep Learning (DL) approach to construct this mapping and to generate an absolute or relative point cloud estimation of a DEM given a single RGB satellite (Sentinel-2 imagery in this work) or drone image. The model has been readily extended to incorporate available information from the non-visible electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike existing methods, we only exploit one image for the production of the elevation data, rendering our approach less restrictive and constrained, but suboptimal compared to them at the same time. Moreover, recent advances in software and hardware allow us to make the inference and the generation extremely fast, even on moderate hardware. We deploy Conditional Generative Adversarial networks (CGAN), which are the state-of-the-art approach to image-to-image translation. We expect our work to serve as a springboard for further development in this field and to foster the integration of such methods in the process of generating, updating and analyzing DEMs.

AB  - Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully applied in mapless navigation. An important issue in DRL is to design a reward function for evaluating actions of agents. However, designing a robust and suitable reward function greatly depends on the designer&rsquo;s experience and intuition. To address this concern, we consider employing reward shaping from trajectories on similar navigation tasks without human supervision, and propose a general reward function based on matching network (MN). The MN-based reward function is able to gain the experience by pre-training through trajectories on different navigation tasks and accelerate the training speed of DRL in new tasks. The proposed reward function keeps the optimal strategy of DRL unchanged. The simulation results on two static maps show that the DRL converge with less iterations via the learned reward function than the state-of-the-art mapless navigation methods. The proposed method performs well in dynamic maps with partially moving obstacles. Even when test maps are different from training maps, the proposed strategy is able to complete the navigation tasks without additional training.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Owing to the realization of multi-mission adaptability requires more complex mechanical structure, the candidates of future aviation propulsion are confronted with more overall reliability problems than that of the conventional gas turbine engine. This situation is challenging to a traditional aeroengine deterministic design method. To overcome this challenge, the Reliability-based Multi-Design Point Methodology is proposed for aeroengine conceptual design. The presented methodology adopted an unconventional approach of engaging the reliability prediction by artificial neural network (ANN) surrogate models rather than the time-consuming Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Based on the Adaptive Particle swarm optimization, the utilization of the pre-training technique optimizes the initial network parameters to acquire better-conditioned initial network, which is sited closer to designated optimum so that contributes to the convergence property. Moreover, a new hybrid algorithm is presented to integrate the pre-training technique into neural network training procedure in order to enhance the ANN performance. The proposed methodology is applied to the cycle design of a turbofan engine with uncertainty component performance. The testing results certify that the prediction accuracy of pre-trained ANN is improved with negligible computational cost, which only spent nearly one-millionth as much time as the MC-based probabilistic analysis (0.1267 s vs. 95,262 s, for 20 testing samples). The MC simulation results substantiate that optimal cycle parameters precisely improve the engine overall performance to simultaneously reach expected reliability (&ge;98.9%) in multiple operating conditions without unnecessary performance redundancy, which verifies the efficiency of the presented methodology. The presented efforts provide a novel approach for aeroengine cycle design, and enrich reliability design theory as well.

AB  - Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (clustering, genetic, and principal component analysis) automate Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) missions as well as the creation and refinement of iterative 3D photogrammetric models with a next best view (NBV) approach. The novel approach uses Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to achieve convergence to a specified orthomosaic resolution by identifying edges in the point cloud and planning cameras that &ldquo;view&rdquo; the holes identified by edges without requiring an initial model. This iterative UAV photogrammetric method successfully runs in various Microsoft AirSim environments. Simulated ground sampling distance (GSD) of models reaches as low as     3.4     cm per pixel, and generally, successive iterations improve resolution. Besides analogous application in simulated environments, a field study of a retired municipal water tank illustrates the practical application and advantages of automated UAV iterative inspection of infrastructure using     63 %     fewer photographs than a comparable manual flight with analogous density point clouds obtaining a GSD of less than 3 cm per pixel. Each iteration qualitatively increases resolution according to a logarithmic regression, reduces holes in models, and adds details to model edges.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, Intelligent UAV will be widely used in future autonomous aerial combat. Previous researches on autonomous aerial combat within visual range (WVR) have limitations due to simplifying assumptions, limited robustness, and ignoring sensor errors. In this paper, in order to consider the error of the aircraft sensors, we model the aerial combat WVR as a state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP), which introduce the small adversarial perturbations on state observations and these perturbations do not alter the environment directly, but can mislead the agent into making suboptimal decisions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel autonomous aerial combat maneuver strategy generation algorithm with high-performance and high-robustness based on state-adversarial deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (SA-DDPG), which add a robustness regularizers related to an upper bound on performance loss at the actor-network. At the same time, a reward shaping method based on maximum entropy (MaxEnt) inverse reinforcement learning algorithm (IRL) is proposed to improve the aerial combat strategy generation algorithm&rsquo;s efficiency. Finally, the efficiency of the aerial combat strategy generation algorithm and the performance and robustness of the resulting aerial combat strategy is verified by simulation experiments. Our main contributions are three-fold. First, to introduce the observation errors of UAV, we are modeling air combat as SA-MDP. Second, to make the strategy network of air combat maneuver more robust in the presence of observation errors, we introduce regularizers into the policy gradient. Third, to solve the problem that air combat&rsquo;s reward function is too sparse, we use MaxEnt IRL to design a shaping reward to accelerate the convergence of SA-DDPG.

AB  - Determining the distance of the line-of-sight (LOS) of a small drone is essential in both regulating drone operation and drone operator training considering public safety. A field experiment was conducted to determine the LOS distance and visual angle of a small drone. Human participants were requested to observe a drone in one of the predetermined locations in the air. They responded whether they could see and hear the drone using a five-point scale. It was found that auditory signals were insignificant in drone detection because most of the participants could not hear the drone while they could still see the drone in most of the test locations. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to predict the probability of catching the drone visually. Two models were built considering the &ldquo;definitely yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;definitely or probably yes&rdquo; criteria of visual detection. These models may be used to estimate the LOS distance and visual angle.

AB  - Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collaboration has great potential. To increase the intelligence and environmental adaptability of multi-UAV control, we study the application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms in the field of multi-UAV cooperative control. Aiming at the problem of a non-stationary environment caused by the change of learning agent strategy in reinforcement learning in a multi-agent environment, the paper presents an improved multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm&mdash;the multiagent joint proximal policy optimization (MAJPPO) algorithm with the centralized learning and decentralized execution. This algorithm uses the moving window averaging method to make each agent obtain a centralized state value function, so that the agents can achieve better collaboration. The improved algorithm enhances the collaboration and increases the sum of reward values obtained by the multiagent system. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, we use the MAJPPO algorithm to complete the task of multi-UAV formation and the crossing of multiple-obstacle environments. To simplify the control complexity of the UAV, we use the six-degree of freedom and 12-state equations of the dynamics model of the UAV with an attitude control loop. The experimental results show that the MAJPPO algorithm has better performance and better environmental adaptability.

AB  - Currently, fuzzy proportional integral derivative (PID) controller schemes, which include simplified fuzzy reasoning decision methodologies and PID parameters, are broadly and efficaciously practiced in various fields from industrial applications, military service, to rescue operations, civilian information and also horticultural observation and agricultural surveillance. A fusion particle swarm optimization (PSO)&ndash;evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm, which is an improved version of the stochastic optimization strategy PSO, was presented for designing and optimizing controller gains in this study. The mathematical calculations of this study include the reproduction of EP with PSO. By minimizing the integral of the absolute error (IAE) criterion that is used for estimating the system response as a fitness function, the obtained integrated design of the fusion PSO&ndash;EP algorithm generated and updated the new elite parameters for proposed controller schemes. This progression was used for the complicated non-linear systems of the attitude-control pilot models of a tricopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to demonstrate an improvement on the performance in terms of rapid response, precision, reliability, and stability.

AB  - The vegetation index (VI) has been successfully used to monitor the growth and to predict the yield of agricultural crops. In this paper, a long-term observation was conducted for the yield prediction of maize using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and estimations of chlorophyll contents using SPAD-502. A new vegetation index termed as modified red blue VI (MRBVI) was developed to monitor the growth and to predict the yields of maize by establishing relationships between MRBVI- and SPAD-502-based chlorophyll contents. The coefficients of determination (R2s) were 0.462 and 0.570 in chlorophyll contents&rsquo; estimations and yield predictions using MRBVI, and the results were relatively better than the results from the seven other commonly used VI approaches. All VIs during the different growth stages of maize were calculated and compared with the measured values of chlorophyll contents directly, and the relative error (RE) of MRBVI is the lowest at 0.355. Further, machine learning (ML) methods such as the backpropagation neural network model (BP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were adopted for predicting the yields of maize. All VIs calculated for each image captured during important phenological stages of maize were set as independent variables and the corresponding yields of each plot were defined as dependent variables. The ML models used the leave one out method (LOO), where the root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 2.157, 1.099, 1.146, and 1.698 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) were 1.739, 0.886, 0.925, and 1.356 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM, respectively. Thus, the SVM method performed better in predicting the yields of maize than the other ML methods. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that the MRBVI calculated from images acquired at different growth stages integrated with advanced ML methods should be used for agricultural- and ecological-related chlorophyll estimation and yield predictions.

AB  - Currently, unmanned aerial vehicles, such as drones, are becoming a part of our lives and extend to many areas of society, including the industrialized world. A common alternative for controlling the movements and actions of the drone is through unwired tactile interfaces, for which different remote control devices are used. However, control through such devices is not a natural, human-like communication interface, which sometimes is difficult to master for some users. In this research, we experimented with a domain-based speech recognition architecture to effectively control an unmanned aerial vehicle such as a drone. The drone control was performed in a more natural, human-like way to communicate the instructions. Moreover, we implemented an algorithm for command interpretation using both Spanish and English languages, as well as to control the movements of the drone in a simulated domestic environment. We conducted experiments involving participants giving voice commands to the drone in both languages in order to compare the effectiveness of each, considering the mother tongue of the participants in the experiment. Additionally, different levels of distortion were applied to the voice commands to test the proposed approach when it encountered noisy input signals. The results obtained showed that the unmanned aerial vehicle was capable of interpreting user voice instructions. Speech-to-action recognition improved for both languages with phoneme matching in comparison to only using the cloud-based algorithm without domain-based instructions. Using raw audio inputs, the cloud-based approach achieves 74.81% and 97.04% accuracy for English and Spanish instructions, respectively. However, with our phoneme matching approach the results are improved, yielding 93.33% accuracy for English and 100.00% accuracy for Spanish.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied for pesticide spraying as they have high efficiency and operational flexibility. However, the pesticide droplet drift caused by wind may decrease the pesticide spraying efficiency and pollute the environment. A precision spraying system based on an airborne meteorological monitoring platform on manned agricultural aircrafts is not adaptable for. So far, there is no better solution for controlling droplet drift outside the target area caused by wind, especially by wind gusts. In this regard, a UAV trajectory adjustment system based on Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for pesticide drift control was proposed in this research. By collecting data from ground WSN, the UAV utilizes the wind speed and wind direction as inputs to autonomously adjust its trajectory for keeping droplet deposition in the target spraying area. Two optimized algorithms, namely deep reinforcement learning and particle swarm optimization, were applied to generate the newly modified flight route. At the same time, a simplified pesticide droplet drift model that includes wind speed and wind direction as parameters was developed and adopted to simulate and compute the drift distance of pesticide droplets. Moreover, an LSTM-based wind speed prediction model and a RNN-based wind direction prediction model were established, so as to address the problem of missing the latest wind data caused by communication latency or a lack of connection with the ground nodes. Finally, experiments were carried out to test the communication latency between UAV and ground WSN, and to evaluate the proposed scheme with embedded Raspberry Pi boards in UAV for feasibility verification. Results show that the WSN-assisted UAV trajectory adjustment system is capable of providing a better performance of on-target droplet deposition for real time pesticide spraying with UAV.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous tracking and landing is playing an increasingly important role in military and civil applications. In particular, machine learning has been successfully introduced to robotics-related tasks. A novel UAV autonomous tracking and landing approach based on a deep reinforcement learning strategy is presented in this paper, with the aim of dealing with the UAV motion control problem in an unpredictable and harsh environment. Instead of building a prior model and inferring the landing actions based on heuristic rules, a model-free method based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is proposed. In the POMDP model, the UAV automatically learns the landing maneuver by an end-to-end neural network, which combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm and heuristic rules. A Modular Open Robots Simulation Engine (MORSE)-based reinforcement learning framework is designed and validated with a continuous UAV tracking and landing task on a randomly moving platform in high sensor noise and intermittent measurements. The simulation results show that when the moving platform is moving in different trajectories, the average landing success rate of the proposed algorithm is about 10% higher than that of the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) method. As an indirect result, a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning-based UAV control method is validated, where the UAV can learn the optimal strategy of a continuously autonomous landing and perform properly in a simulation environment.

AB  - 5G networks and Internet of Things (IoT) offer a powerful platform for ubiquitous environments with their ubiquitous sensing, high speeds and other benefits. The data, analytics, and other computations need to be optimally moved and placed in these environments, dynamically, such that energy-efficiency and QoS demands are best satisfied. A particular challenge in this context is to preserve privacy and security while delivering quality of service (QoS) and energy-efficiency. Many works have tried to address these challenges but without a focus on optimizing all of them and assuming fixed models of environments and security threats. This paper proposes the UbiPriSEQ framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to adaptively, dynamically, and holistically optimize QoS, energy-efficiency, security, and privacy. UbiPriSEQ is built on a three-layered model and comprises two modules. UbiPriSEQ devises policies and makes decisions related to important parameters including local processing and offloading rates for data and computations, radio channel states, transmit power, task priority, and selection of fog nodes for offloading, data migration, and so forth. UbiPriSEQ is implemented in Python over the TensorFlow platform and is evaluated using a real-life application in terms of SINR, privacy metric, latency, and utility function, manifesting great promise.

AB  - Backstepping is a control technique based on Lyapunov&rsquo;s theory that has been successfully implemented in the control of motors and robots by several nonlinear methods. However, there are no standardized methods for tuning control gains (unlike the PIDs). This paper shows the tuning gains of the backstepping controller, using Genetic Algorithms (GA), for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), quadrotor type, designed for autonomous trajectory tracking. First, a dynamic model of the vehicle is obtained through the Newton‒Euler methodology. Then, the control law is obtained, and self-tuning is performed, through which we can obtain suitable values of the gains in order to achieve the design requirements. In this work, the establishment time and maximum impulse are considered as such. The tuning and simulations of the system response were performed using the MATLAB-Simulink environment, obtaining as a result the compliance of the design parameters and the correct tracking of different trajectories. The results show that self-tuning by means of genetic algorithms satisfactorily adjusts for the gains of a backstepping controller applied to a quadrotor and allows for the implementation of a control system that responds appropriately to errors of different magnitude.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imaging systems have recently gained significant attention from researchers and practitioners as a cost-effective means for agro-environmental applications. In particular, machine learning algorithms have been applied to UAV-based remote sensing data for enhancing the UAV capabilities of various applications. This systematic review was performed on studies through a statistical meta-analysis of UAV applications along with machine learning algorithms in agro-environmental monitoring. For this purpose, a total number of 163 peer-reviewed articles published in 13 high-impact remote sensing journals over the past 20 years were reviewed focusing on several features, including study area, application, sensor type, platform type, and spatial resolution. The meta-analysis revealed that 62% and 38% of the studies applied regression and classification models, respectively. Visible sensor technology was the most frequently used sensor with the highest overall accuracy among classification articles. Regarding regression models, linear regression and random forest were the most frequently applied models in UAV remote sensing imagery processing. Finally, the results of this study confirm that applying machine learning approaches on UAV imagery produces fast and reliable results. Agriculture, forestry, and grassland mapping were found as the top three UAV applications in this review, in 42%, 22%, and 8% of the studies, respectively.

AB  - The use of monitoring sensors is increasingly present in the context of precision agriculture. Usually, these sensor nodes (SNs) alternate their states between periods of activation and hibernation to reduce battery usage. When employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from SNs distributed over a large agricultural area, we must synchronize the UAV route with the activation period of each SN. In this article, we address the problem of optimizing the UAV path through all the SNs to reduce its flight time, while also maximizing the SNs&rsquo; lifetime. Using the concept of timeslots for time base management combined with the idea of flight prohibition list, we propose an efficient algorithm for discovering and reconfiguring the activation time of the SNs. Experimental results were obtained through the development of our own simulator&mdash;UAV Simulator. These results demonstrate a considerable reduction in the distance traveled by the UAV and also in its flight time. In addition, the model provides a reduction in transmission time by SNs after reconfiguration, thus ensuring a longer lifetime for the SNs in the monitoring environment, as well as improving the freshness and continuity of the gathered data, which support the decision-making process.

AB  - With the tremendous increase of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the different service requirements of these IoT applications, machine-type communication (MTC) has attracted considerable attention from both industry and academia. Owing to the prominent advantages of supporting pervasive connectivity and wide area coverage, the cellular network is advocated as the potential wireless solution to realize IoT deployment for MTC, and this creative network paradigm is called the cellular IoT (C-IoT). In this paper, we propose the three-layer structured C-IoT architecture for MTC and review the challenges for deploying green C-IoT. Then, effective strategies for realizing green C-IoT are presented, including the energy efficient and energy harvesting schemes. We put forward several strategies to make the C-IoT run in an energy-saving manner, such as efficient random access and barring mechanisms, self-adapting machine learning predictions, scheduling optimization, resource allocation, fog computing, and group-oriented transmission. As for the energy harvesting schemes, the ambient and dedicated energy harvesting strategies are investigated. Afterwards, we give a detailed case study, which shows the effectiveness of reducing power consumption for the proposed layered C-IoT architecture. Additionally, for real-time and non-real-time applications, the power consumption of different on-off states for MTC devices is discussed.

AB  - Recently, more and more smart homes have become one of important parts of home infrastructure. However, most of the smart home applications are not interconnected and remain isolated. They use the cloud center as the control platform, which increases the risk of link congestion and data security. Thus, in the future, smart homes based on edge computing without using cloud center become an important research area. In this paper, we assume that all applications in a smart home environment are composed of edge nodes and users. In order to maximize the utility of users, we assume that all users and edge nodes are placed in a market and formulate a pricing resource allocation model with utility maximization. We apply the Lagrangian method to analyze the model, so an edge node (provider in the market) allocates its resources to a user (customer in the market) based on the prices of resources and the utility related to the preference of users. To obtain the optimal resource allocation, we propose a pricing-based resource allocation algorithm by using low-pass filtering scheme and conform that the proposed algorithm can achieve an optimum within reasonable convergence times through some numerical examples.

AB  - This paper combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with meta-learning and proposes a novel approach, named meta twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (Meta-TD3), to realize the control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), allowing a UAV to quickly track a target in an environment where the motion of a target is uncertain. This approach can be applied to a variety of scenarios, such as wildlife protection, emergency aid, and remote sensing. We consider a multi-task experience replay buffer to provide data for the multi-task learning of the DRL algorithm, and we combine meta-learning to develop a multi-task reinforcement learning update method to ensure the generalization capability of reinforcement learning. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), experimental results show that the Meta-TD3 algorithm has achieved a great improvement in terms of both convergence value and convergence rate. In a UAV target tracking problem, Meta-TD3 only requires a few steps to train to enable a UAV to adapt quickly to a new target movement mode more and maintain a better tracking effectiveness.

AB  - Currently, deploying fixed terrestrial infrastructures is not cost-effective in temporary circumstances, such as natural disasters, hotspots, and so on. Thus, we consider a system of caching-based UAV-assisted communications between multiple ground users (GUs) and a local station (LS). Specifically, a UAV is exploited to cache data from the LS and then serve GUs&rsquo; requests to handle the issue of unavailable or damaged links from the LS to the GUs. The UAV can harvest solar energy for its operation. We investigate joint cache scheduling and power allocation schemes by using the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique to maximize the long-term downlink rate. Two scenarios for the network are taken into account. In the first, the harvested energy distribution of the GUs is assumed to be known, and we propose a partially observable Markov decision process framework such that the UAV can allocate optimal transmission power for each GU based on proper content caching over each flight period. In the second scenario where the UAV does not know the environment&rsquo;s dynamics in advance, an actor-critic-based scheme is proposed to achieve a solution by learning with a dynamic environment. Afterwards, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, compared to baseline approaches.

AB  - The article presents a throughput maximization approach for UAV assisted ground networks. Throughput maximization involves minimizing delay and packet loss through UAV trajectory optimization, reinforcing the congested nodes and transmission channels. The aggressive reinforcement policy is achieved by characterizing nodes, links, and overall topology through delay, loss, throughput, and distance. A position-aware graph neural network (GNN) is used for characterization, prediction, and dynamic UAV trajectory enhancement. To establish correctness, the proposed approach is validated against optimized link state routing (OLSR) driven UAV assisted ground networks. The proposed approach considerably outperforms the classical approach by demonstrating significant gains in throughput and packet delivery ratio with notable decrements in delay and packet loss. The performance analysis of the proposed approach against software-defined UAVs (U-S) and UAVs as base stations (U-B) verifies the consistency and gains in average throughput while minimizing delay and packet loss. The scalability test of the proposed approach is performed by varying data rates and the number of UAVs.

AB  - To perform precise approach and landing concerning an aircraft in automatic mode, local airfield-based landing systems are used. For joint processing of measurements of the onboard inertial navigation systems (INS), altimeters and local landing systems, the Kalman filter is usually used. The application of the quadratic criterion in the Kalman filter entails the well-known problem of high sensitivity of the estimate to anomalous measurement errors. During the automatic approach phase, abnormal navigation errors can lead to disaster, so the data fusion algorithm must automatically identify and isolate abnormal measurements. This paper presents a recurrent filtering algorithm that is resistant to anomalous errors in measurements and considers its application in the data fusion problem for landing system measurements with onboard sensor measurements&mdash;INS and altimeters. The robustness of the estimate is achieved through the combined use of the least modulus method and the Kalman filter. To detect and isolate failures the chi-square criterion is used. It makes possible the customization of the algorithm in accordance with the requirements for false alarm probability and the alarm missing probability. Testing results of the robust filtering algorithm are given both for synthesized data and for real measurements.

SN  - 2218-6581

AB  - As systems grow more automatized, the human operator is all too often overlooked. Although human-robot interaction (HRI) can be quite demanding in terms of cognitive resources, the mental states (MS) of the operators are not yet taken into account by existing systems. As humans are no providential agents, this lack can lead to hazardous situations. The growing number of neurophysiology and machine learning tools now allows for efficient operators&rsquo; MS monitoring. Sending feedback on MS in a closed-loop solution is therefore at hand. Involving a consistent automated planning technique to handle such a process could be a significant asset. This perspective article was meant to provide the reader with a synthesis of the significant literature with a view to implementing systems that adapt to the operator&rsquo;s MS to improve human-robot operations&rsquo; safety and performance. First of all, the need for this approach is detailed regarding remote operation, an example of HRI. Then, several MS identified as crucial for this type of HRI are defined, along with relevant electrophysiological markers. A focus is made on prime degraded MS linked to time-on-task and task demands, as well as collateral MS linked to system outputs (i.e., feedback and alarms). Lastly, the principle of symbiotic HRI is detailed and one solution is proposed to include the operator state vector into the system using a mixed-initiative decisional framework to drive such an interaction.

AB  - During the last decade, the Internet of Things acted as catalyst for the big data phenomenon. As result, modern edge devices can access a huge amount of data that can be exploited to build useful services. In such a context, artificial intelligence has a key role to develop intelligent systems (e.g., intelligent cyber physical systems) that create a connecting bridge with the physical world. However, as time goes by, machine and deep learning applications are becoming more complex, requiring increasing amounts of data and training time, which makes the use of centralized approaches unsuitable. Federated learning is an emerging paradigm which enables the cooperation of edge devices to learn a shared model (while keeping private their training data), thereby abating the training time. Although federated learning is a promising technique, its implementation is difficult and brings a lot of challenges. In this paper, we present an extension of Stack4Things, a cloud platform developed in our department; leveraging its functionalities, we enabled the deployment of federated learning on edge devices without caring their heterogeneity. Experimental results show a comparison with a centralized approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of both training time and model accuracy.

The robotic hand was created using the 3D printer and has the servo bed for stand-alone finger movement. The data containing the robotic fingers&rsquo; angular position are acquired using the Leap Motion device, and a hybrid Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for object shape identification. We trained the designed robotic hand on a few monotonous convex-shaped items similar to everyday objects (ball, cylinder, and rectangular box) using supervised learning techniques. We achieve the mean accuracy of object shape recognition of 94.4%.

AB  - Forest firefighting missions encompass multiple tasks related to prevention, surveillance, and extinguishing. This work presents a complete survey of firefighters on the current problems in their work and the potential technological solutions. Additionally, it reviews the efforts performed by the academy and industry to apply different types of robots in the context of firefighting missions. Finally, all this information is used to propose a concept of operation for the comprehensive application of drone swarms in firefighting. The proposed system is a fleet of quadcopters that individually are only able to visit waypoints and use payloads, but collectively can perform tasks of surveillance, mapping, monitoring, etc. Three operator roles are defined, each one with different access to information and functions in the mission: mission commander, team leaders, and team members. These operators take advantage of virtual and augmented reality interfaces to intuitively get the information of the scenario and, in the case of the mission commander, control the drone swarm.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In this paper, solutions for precise maneuvering of an autonomous small (e.g., 350-class) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are designed and implemented from smart modifications of non expensive mass market technologies. The considered class of vehicles suffers from light load, and, therefore, only a limited amount of sensors and computing devices can be installed on-board. Then, to make the prototype capable of moving autonomously along a fixed trajectory, a &ldquo;cyber-pilot&rdquo;, able on demand to replace the human operator, has been implemented on an embedded control board. This cyber-pilot overrides the commands thanks to a custom hardware signal mixer. The drone is able to localize itself in the environment without ground assistance by using a camera possibly mounted on a 3 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) gimbal suspension. A computer vision system elaborates the video stream pointing out land markers with known absolute position and orientation. This information is fused with accelerations from a 6-DOF Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to generate a &ldquo;virtual sensor&rdquo; which provides refined estimates of the pose, the absolute position, the speed and the angular velocities of the drone. Due to the importance of this sensor, several fusion strategies have been investigated. The resulting data are, finally, fed to a control algorithm featuring a number of uncoupled digital PID controllers which work to bring to zero the displacement from the desired trajectory.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Path planning is necessary in many applications using unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). The main class of tasks is the planning of safe routes with minimal energy costs and/or minimal levels of emitted physical and information signals. Since the action planner is on board the UUV, the main focus is on methods and algorithms that allow it to build reference trajectories while minimizing the number of calculations. The study is devoted to the problem of the optimal route planning for a UUV with a non-uniform radiation pattern. The problem is stated in the form of two point variational problem for which necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are proved. Particular attention is paid to cases where optimality conditions are not met. These cases are directly related to found specific forms of a radiation pattern. Sufficient optimality conditions are extended on the class of two-link and multi-link motion paths. Software tools have been developed and computer simulations have been performed for various types of radiation patterns.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
SN  - 2226-4310

AB  - Deep reinforcement learning is a promising method for training a nonlinear attitude controller for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. Until now, proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated successful attitude control in simulation. However, detailed experimental investigations have not yet been conducted. This study applied deep reinforcement learning for one-degree-of-freedom pitch control in wind tunnel tests with the aim of gaining practical understandings of attitude control application. Three controllers with different discrete action choices, that is, elevator angles, were designed. The controllers with larger action rates exhibited better performance in terms of following angle-of-attack commands. The root mean square errors for tracking angle-of-attack commands decreased from 3.42&deg; to 1.99&deg; as the maximum action rate increased from 10&deg;/s to 50&deg;/s. The comparison between experimental and simulation results showed that the controller with a smaller action rate experienced the friction effect, and the controllers with larger action rates experienced fluctuating behaviors in elevator maneuvers owing to delay. The investigation of the effect of friction and delay on pitch control highlighted the importance of conducting experiments to understand actual control performances, specifically when the controllers were trained with a low-fidelity model.

VL  - 13
IS  - 2
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The current exponential increase of spatiotemporally explicit data streams from satellite-based Earth observation missions offers promising opportunities for global vegetation monitoring. Intelligent sampling through active learning (AL) heuristics provides a pathway for fast inference of essential vegetation variables by means of hybrid retrieval approaches, i.e., machine learning regression algorithms trained by radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations. In this study we summarize AL theory and perform a brief systematic literature survey about AL heuristics used in the context of Earth observation regression problems over terrestrial targets. Across all relevant studies it appeared that: (i) retrieval accuracy of AL-optimized training data sets outperformed models trained over large randomly sampled data sets, and (ii) Euclidean distance-based (EBD) diversity method tends to be the most efficient AL technique in terms of accuracy and computational demand. Additionally, a case study is presented based on experimental data employing both uncertainty and diversity AL criteria. Hereby, a a simulated training data base by the PROSAIL-PRO canopy RTM is used to demonstrate the benefit of AL techniques for the estimation of total leaf carotenoid content (Cxc) and leaf water content (Cw). Gaussian process regression (GPR) was incorporated to minimize and optimize the training data set with AL. Training the GPR algorithm on optimally AL-based sampled data sets led to improved variable retrievals compared to training on full data pools, which is further demonstrated on a mapping example. From these findings we can recommend the use of AL-based sub-sampling procedures to select the most informative samples out of large training data pools. This will not only optimize regression accuracy due to exclusion of redundant information, but also speed up processing time and reduce final model size of kernel-based machine learning regression algorithms, such as GPR. With this study we want to encourage further testing and implementation of AL sampling methods for hybrid retrieval workflows. AL can contribute to the solution of regression problems within the framework of operational vegetation monitoring using satellite imaging spectroscopy data, and may strongly facilitate data processing for cloud-computing platforms.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The size and location of agricultural fields that are in active use and the type of use during the growing season are among the vital information that is needed for the careful planning and forecasting of agricultural production at national and regional scales. In areas where such data are not readily available, an independent seasonal monitoring method is needed. Remote sensing is a widely used tool to map land use types, although there are some limitations that can partly be circumvented by using, among others, multiple observations, careful feature selection and appropriate analysis methods. Here, we used Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) over the land area of Norway to map three agricultural land use classes: cereal crops, fodder crops (grass) and unused areas. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and two variants of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are implemented on SITS data of four different temporal resolutions. These enabled us to compare twelve model-dataset combinations to identify the model-dataset combination that results in the most accurate predictions. The CNN is implemented in the spectral and temporal dimensions instead of the conventional spatial dimension. Rather than using existing deep learning architectures, an autotuning procedure is implemented so that the model hyperparameters are empirically optimized during the training. The results obtained on held-out test data show that up to 94% overall accuracy and 90% Cohen&rsquo;s Kappa can be obtained when the 2D CNN is applied on the SITS data with a temporal resolution of 7 days. This is closely followed by the 1D CNN on the same dataset. However, the latter performs better than the former in predicting data outside the training set. It is further observed that cereal is predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by grass. Predicting the unused areas has been found to be difficult as there is no distinct surface condition that is common for all unused areas.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel visual tracking method for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in aerial scenery. To track the UAVs robustly, we present a new object proposal method that can accurately determine the object regions that are likely to exist. The proposed object proposal method is robust to small objects and severe background clutter. For this, we vote on candidate areas of the object and increase or decrease the weight of the area accordingly. Thus, the method can accurately propose the object areas that can be used to track small-sized UAVs with the assumption that their motion is smooth over time. Experimental results verify that UAVs are accurately tracked even when they are very small and the background is complex. The proposed method qualitatively and quantitatively delivers state-of-the-art performance in comparison with conventional object proposal-based methods.

TI  - An Industrial Quadrotor UAV Control Method Based on Fuzzy Adaptive Linear Active Disturbance Rejection Control
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In this paper, a fuzzy adaptive linear active disturbance rejection control (Fuzzy-LADRC) is proposed for strong coupling and nonlinear quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). At present, UAV conveys new opportunities in the industry, such as power line inspection, petroleum conduit patrolling, and defects detection for the wind turbine, because of its advantages in flexibility, high efficiency, and economy. Usually, the scene of the UAV mission has a high risk, and there are internal sensor noise and unknown external disturbance. Thus, the attitude stability and anti-interference ability of UAV are especially essential. To solve the strong coupling problem of UAV, the dynamics model of UAV is established via the Newton-Euler method, and the coupling part of dynamics is modeled as an internal disturbance. According to the function of linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) parameters, a Fuzzy-LADRC is proposed to improve the dynamic performance of the system. The proposed control method makes full use of the adaptive ability of the fuzzy controller and the anti-interference ability of LADRC to the nonlinear and strong coupling systems. As we know, this is the first time that Fuzzy-LADRC has been used in UAV control. In the simulation, the performance indicators of four controllers, including Fuzzy-LADRC, LADRC, PID, and Fuzzy-PID are compared and analyzed. The results indicate that the average response speed of Fuzzy-LADRC is 12.65% faster than LADRC, and it is 29.25% faster than PID. The average overshoot of Fuzzy-LADRC is 17% less than LADRC and 77.75% less than PID. The proposed control method can significantly improve the response speed and anti-interference ability of UAV.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - This paper demonstrates a route selection mechanism on a testbed with heterogeneous device-to-device (D2D) wireless communication for a 5G network scenario. The source node receives information about the primary users’ (PUs’) (or licensed users’) activities and available routes from the macrocell base station (or a central controller) and makes a decision to select a multihop route to the destination node. The source node from small cells can either choose: (a) a route with direct communication with the macrocell base station to improve the route performance; or (b) a route with D2D communication among nodes in the small cells to offload traffic from the macrocell to improve spectrum efficiency. The selected D2D route has the least PUs’ activities. The route selection mechanism is investigated on our testbed that helps to improve the accuracy of network performance measurement. In traditional testbeds, each node (e.g., Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) that serves as the front-end communication block) is connected to a single processing unit (e.g., a personal computer) via a switch using cables. In our testbed, each USRP node is connected to a separate processing unit, i.e., raspberry Pi3 B+ (or RP3), which offers three main advantages: (a) control messages and data packets are exchanged via the wireless medium; (b) separate processing units make decisions in a distributed and heterogeneous manner; and (c) the nodes are placed further apart from one another. Therefore, in the investigation of our route selection scheme, the response delay of control message exchange and the packet loss caused by the operating environment (e.g., ambient noise) are implied in our end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio measurement. Our results show an increase of end-to-end delay and a decrease of packet delivery ratio due to the transmission of control messages and data packets in the wireless medium in the presence of the dynamic PUs’ activities. Furthermore, D2D communication can offload 25% to 75% traffic from macrocell base station to small cells.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Path planning is one of the most important issues in the robotics field, being applied in many domains ranging from aerospace technology and military tasks to manufacturing and agriculture. Path planning is a branch of autonomous navigation. In autonomous navigation, dynamic decisions about the path have to be taken while the robot moves towards its goal. Among the navigation area, an important class of problems is Coverage Path Planning (CPP). The CPP technique is associated with determining a collision-free path that passes through all viewpoints in a specific area. This paper presents a method to perform CPP in 3D environment for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) applications, namely 3D dynamic for CPP applications (3DD-CPP). The proposed method can be deployed in an unknown environment through a combination of linear optimization and heuristics. A model to estimate cost matrices accounting for UAV power usage is proposed and evaluated for a few different flight speeds. As linear optimization methods can be computationally demanding to be used on-board a UAV, this work also proposes a distributed execution of the algorithm through fog-edge computing. Results showed that 3DD-CPP had a good performance in both local execution and fog-edge for different simulated scenarios. The proposed heuristic is capable of re-optimization, enabling execution in environments with local knowledge of the environments.

A novel approach to generation of a reference altitude trajectory is presented, which is then tracked in a standard, though optimized, control loop. Three landing scenarios are considered, namely: minimum-time, minimum-energy, and velocity-penalized landing scenarios.

AB  - Autopilot technology in the field of aviation has developed over many years. However, it is difficult for an autopilot system to autonomously operate a civil aircraft under bad weather conditions. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using multimodal data and preprocessing data to have a civil aircraft take off autonomously under crosswind conditions. The multimodal data include the common flight status and visual information. The preprocessing is a new design that maps some flight data by nonlinear functions based on the general flight dynamics before these data are fed into the RL model. Extensive experiments under different crosswind conditions with a professional flight simulator demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively control a civil aircraft to take off under various crosswind conditions and achieve better performance than trials without visual information or preprocessing data.

AB  - The World Health Organization has reported that the number of worldwide urban residents is expected to reach 70% of the total world population by 2050. In the face of challenges brought about by the demographic transition, there is an urgent need to improve the accuracy of urban land-use mappings to more efficiently inform about urban planning processes. Decision-makers rely on accurate urban mappings to properly assess current plans and to develop new ones. This study investigates the effects of including conventional spectral signatures acquired by different sensors on the classification of airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds using multiple feature spaces. The proposed method applied three machine learning algorithms—ML (Maximum Likelihood), SVM (Support Vector Machines), and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network)—to classify LiDAR point clouds of a residential urban area after being geo-registered to aerial photos. The overall classification accuracy passed 97%, with height as the only geometric feature in the classifying space. Misclassifications occurred among different classes due to independent acquisition of aerial and LiDAR data as well as shadow and orthorectification problems from aerial images. Nevertheless, the outcomes are promising as they surpassed those achieved with large geometric feature spaces and are encouraging since the approach is computationally reasonable and integrates radiometric properties from affordable sensors.

Thirdly, real data collection and preprocessing tasks are carried out. Fourthly, the deep reinforcement learning approach is proposed as a main system development scheme for resource management. Fifthly, K-means and round-robin scheduling algorithms are applied for clustering and managing the users’ resource requests, respectively. Then, the TensorFlow (python) programming tool is used to test the overall capability of the proposed method. Finally, this paper evaluates the proposed approach with related works based on different scenarios. According to the experimental findings, our proposed scheme shows promising outcomes. Moreover, on the evaluation tasks, the outcomes show rapid convergence, suitable for heterogeneous IoT networks, and low complexity.

AB  - In this paper, a real-time deep learning-based framework for detecting and tracking Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in video streams captured by a fixed-wing UAV is proposed. The proposed framework consists of two steps, namely intra-frame multi-UAV detection and the inter-frame multi-UAV tracking. In the detection step, a new multi-scale UAV detection Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture based on a shallow version of You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3-tiny) widened by Inception blocks is designed to extract local and global features from input video streams. Here, the widened multi-UAV detection network architecture is termed as FastUAV-NET and aims to improve UAV detection accuracy while preserving computing time of one-step deep detection algorithms in the context of UAV-UAV tracking. To detect UAVs, the FastUAV-NET architecture uses five inception units and adopts a feature pyramid network to detect UAVs. To obtain a high frame rate, the proposed method is applied to every nth frame and then the detected UAVs are tracked in intermediate frames using scalable Kernel Correlation Filter algorithm. The results on the generated UAV-UAV dataset illustrate that the proposed framework obtains 0.7916 average precision with 29 FPS performance on Jetson-TX2. The results imply that the widening of CNN network is a much more effective way than increasing the depth of CNN and leading to a good trade-off between accurate detection and real-time performance. The FastUAV-NET model will be publicly available to the research community to further advance multi-UAV-UAV detection algorithms.

AB  - How to operate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) safely and efficiently in an interactive environment is challenging. A large amount of research has been devoted to improve the intelligence of a UAV while performing a mission, where finding an optimal maneuver decision-making policy of the UAV has become one of the key issues when we attempt to enable the UAV autonomy. In this paper, we propose a maneuver decision-making algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which generates efficient maneuvers for a UAV agent to execute the airdrop mission autonomously in an interactive environment. Particularly, the training set of the learning algorithm by the Prioritized Experience Replay is constructed, that can accelerate the convergence speed of decision network training in the algorithm. It is shown that a desirable and effective maneuver decision-making policy can be found by extensive experimental results.

AB  - Deploying of Fifth Generation and Beyond Fifth Generation (5G/B5G) wireless networks will require wider coverage, flexible connectivity, low latency, support for a large number of user devices, and more bandwidth. This article explores the paradigm that Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPASs) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are integrated as a communication platform with cellular networks using radio access. It is important to know the possibilities and ways of such integration for effective interaction with RPASs. This paper studies the issues of ensuring the required Quality of Service (QoS) during heavy traffic and the choice of necessary data transmission modes for this. Models of RPAS communication channels with different architectures were created. The relationships between models’ performance and traffic parameters were obtained using the NetCracker Professional 4.1 software. The dependencies of the Average Utilization (AU) on the Transaction Size (TS) were analyzed. The effects of different bandwidths and the Bit Error Rate (BER) were studied. The traffic characteristics in all models were compared.

AB  - In order to solve the problem of how to efficiently control a large-scale swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system, which performs complex tasks with limited manpower in a non-ideal environment, this paper proposes a parallel UAV swarm control method. The key technology of parallel control is to establish a one-to-one artificial UAV system corresponding to the aerial swarm UAV on the ground. This paper focuses on the computational experiments algorithm for artificial UAV system establishment, including data processing, model identification, model verification and state prediction. Furthermore, this paper performs a comprehensive flight mission with four common modes (climbing, level flighting, turning and descending) for verification. The results of the identification experiment present a good consistency between the outputs of the refined dynamics model and the real flight data. The prediction experiment results show that the prediction method in this paper can basically guarantee that the prediction states error is kept within 10% about 16 s.

AB  - Autonomous navigation and collision avoidance missions represent a significant challenge for robotics systems as they generally operate in dynamic environments that require a high level of autonomy and flexible decision-making capabilities. This challenge becomes more applicable in micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) due to their limited size and computational power. This paper presents a novel approach for enabling a micro aerial vehicle system equipped with a laser range finder to autonomously navigate among obstacles and achieve a user-specified goal location in a GPS-denied environment, without the need for mapping or path planning. The proposed system uses an actor–critic-based reinforcement learning technique to train the aerial robot in a Gazebo simulator to perform a point-goal navigation task by directly mapping the noisy MAV’s state and laser scan measurements to continuous motion control. The obtained policy can perform collision-free flight in the real world while being trained entirely on a 3D simulator. Intensive simulations and real-time experiments were conducted and compared with a nonlinear model predictive control technique to show the generalization capabilities to new unseen environments, and robustness against localization noise. The obtained results demonstrate our system’s effectiveness in flying safely and reaching the desired points by planning smooth forward linear velocity and heading rates.

AB  - Collision-free distributed path planning for the swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a stochastic and dynamic environment is an emerging and challenging subject for research in the field of a communication system. Monitoring the methods and approaches for multi-UAVs with full area surveillance is needed in both military and civilian applications, in order to protect human beings and infrastructure, as well as their social security. To perform the path planning for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles, we propose a trajectory planner based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to derive a distributed full coverage optimal path planning, and a trajectory planner is developed using a dynamic fitness function. In this paper, to obtain dynamic fitness, we implemented the PSO algorithm independently in each UAV, by maximizing the fitness function and minimizing the cost function. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed path planning algorithm generates feasible optimal trajectories and update maps for the swarm of UAVs to surveil the entire area of interest.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Most Coverage Path Planning (CPP) strategies based on the minimum width of a concave polygonal area are very likely to generate non-optimal paths with many turns. This paper introduces a CPP method based on a Region Optimal Decomposition (ROD) that overcomes this limitation when applied to the path planning of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a port environment. The principle of the approach is to first apply a ROD to a Google Earth image of a port and combining the resulting sub-regions by an improved Depth-First-Search (DFS) algorithm. Finally, a genetic algorithm determines the traversal order of all sub-regions. The simulation experiments show that the combination of ROD and improved DFS algorithm can reduce the number of turns by 4.34%, increase the coverage rate by more than 10%, and shorten the non-working distance by about 29.91%. Overall, the whole approach provides a sound solution for the CPP and operations of UAVs in port environments.

AB  - Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is one of the most important extensions to TCP that enables the use of multiple paths in data transmissions for a TCP connection. In MPTCP, the end hosts transmit data across a number of TCP subflows simultaneously on one connection. MPTCP can sufficiently utilize the bandwidth resources to improve the transmission efficiency while providing TCP fairness to other TCP connections. Meanwhile, it also offers resilience due to multipath data transfers. MPTCP attracts tremendous attention from the academic and industry field due to the explosive data growth in recent times and limited network bandwidth for each single available communication interface. The vehicular Internet-of-Things systems, such as cooperative autonomous driving, require reliable high speed data transmission and robustness. MPTCP could be a promising approach to solve these challenges. In this paper, we first conduct a brief survey of existing MPTCP studies and give a brief overview to multipath routing. Then we discuss the significance technical challenges in applying MPTCP for vehicular networks and point out future research directions.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - This paper presents a novel online learning-based fault detection designed for underwater robotic thruster health monitoring. In the fault detection algorithm, we build a mathematical model between the control variable and the propeller speed by fitting collected online work status data to the model. To improve the accuracy of online modeling, a multi-center PSO algorithm with memory ability is utilized to optimize the modeling parameters. Additionally, a model online update mechanism is designed to accommodate the model to the change of thruster work status and sea environment. During the operation, propeller speed of the underwater robot is predicted through the online learning-based model, and the model residuals are used for thruster health monitoring. To avoid false alarm, an adaptive fault detection strategy is established based on model online update mechanism. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated using different underwater robotics, through a sea trial data simulation, a pool test fault detection experiment and a sea trial fault detection experiment. Compared with fixed model-based method, speed prediction MAE of the online learning model is at least 37.9% lower than that of the fixed model. The online learning-based method show no misdiagnosis in experiments, while the fixed model-based method is misdiagnosed. Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and robustness.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) architecture, based on which a number of vehicles are served by UAVs equipped with computation resource. Each vehicle has to offload its computing tasks to the proper MEC server on the UAV due to the limited computation ability. To counter the problems above, we first model and analyze the transmission model and the security assurance model from the vehicle to the MEC server on UAV, and the task computation model of the local vehicle and the edge UAV. Then, the vehicle offloading problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem by jointly considering the task offloading, the resource allocation, and the security assurance. For tackling this hard problem, we decouple the multi-objective optimization problem as two subproblems and propose an efficient iterative algorithm to jointly make the MEC selection decision based on the criteria of load balancing and optimize the offloading ratio and the computation resource according to the Lagrangian dual decomposition. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves significant performance superiority compared with other schemes in terms of the successful task processing ratio and the task processing delay.

AB  - In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), a UAV is employed as a mobile sink to gather data from sensor nodes. Incorporating UAV helps prolong the network lifetime and avoid the energy-hole problem faced by sensor networks. In emergency applications, timely data collection from sensor nodes and transferal of the data to the base station (BS) is a prime requisite. The timely and safe path of UAV is one of the fundamental premises for effective UWSN operations. It is essential and challenging to identify a suitable path in an environment comprising various obstacles and to ensure that the path can efficiently reach the target point. This paper proposes a hybrid path planning (HPP) algorithm for efficient data collection by assuring the shortest collision-free path for UAV in emergency environments. In the proposed HPP scheme, the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm is used to design the shortest trajectory map and the optimized artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to improve different path constraints in a three-dimensional environment. Our simulation results show that the proposed HPP outperforms the PRM and conventional ABC schemes significantly in terms of flight time, energy consumption, convergence time, and flight path.

AB  - Conventional and license-free radio-controlled drone activities are limited to a line-of-sight (LoS) operational range. One of the alternatives to operate the drones beyond the visual line-of-sight (BVLoS) range is replacing the drone wireless communications system from the conventional industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio band to a licensed cellular-connected system. The Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology that has been established for the terrestrial area allows command-and-control and payload communications between drone and ground station in real-time. However, with increasing height above the ground, the radio environment changes, and utilizing terrestrial cellular networks for drone communications may face new challenges. In this regard, this paper aims to develop an LTE-based control system prototype for low altitude small drones and investigate the feasibility and performance of drone cellular connectivity at different altitudes with measuring parameters such as latency, handover, and signal strength. The measurement results have shown that by increasing flight height from ground to 170 m the received signal power and the signal quality levels were reduced by 20 dBm and 10 dB respectively, the downlink data rate decreased to 70%, and latency increased up to 94 ms. It is concluded that although the existing LTE network can provide a minimum requirement for drone cellular connectivity, further improvements are still needed to enhance aerial coverage, eliminate interference, and reduce network latency.

AB  - The new progressive smart technologies announced in the fourth industrial revolution in aviation—Aviation 4.0—represent new possibilities and big challenges in aircraft maintenance processes. The main benefit of these technologies is the possibility to monitor, transfer, store, and analyze huge datasets. Based on analysis outputs, there is a possibility to improve current preventive maintenance processes and implement predictive maintenance processes. These solutions lower the downtime, save manpower, and extend the components’ lifetime; thus, the maximum effectivity and safety is achieved. The article deals with the possible implementation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an infrared camera and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) as two of the smart hangar technologies for airframe condition monitoring. The presented implementations of smart technologies follow up the specific results of a case study focused on trainer aircraft failure monitoring and its impact on maintenance strategy changes. The case study failure indexes show the critical parts of aircraft that are subjected to damage the most. The aim of the article was to justify the need for thorough monitoring of critical parts of the aircraft and then analyze and propose a more effective and the most suitable form of technical condition monitoring of aircraft critical parts. The article describes the whole process of visual inspection performed by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an IR camera and its related processes; in addition, it covers the possible usage of RFID tags as a labeling tool supporting the visual inspection. The implementations criteria apply to the repair and overhaul small aircraft maintenance organization, and later, it can also increase operational efficiency. The final suggestions describe the possible usage of proposed solutions, their main benefits, and also the limitations of their implementations in maintenance of trainer aircraft.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The apple target recognition algorithm is one of the core technologies of the apple picking robot. However, most of the existing apple detection algorithms cannot distinguish between the apples that are occluded by tree branches and occluded by other apples. The apples, grasping end-effector and mechanical picking arm of the robot are very likely to be damaged if the algorithm is directly applied to the picking robot. Based on this practical problem, in order to automatically recognize the graspable and ungraspable apples in an apple tree image, a light-weight apple targets detection method was proposed for picking robot using improved YOLOv5s. Firstly, BottleneckCSP module was improved designed to BottleneckCSP-2 module which was used to replace the BottleneckCSP module in backbone architecture of original YOLOv5s network. Secondly, SE module, which belonged to the visual attention mechanism network, was inserted to the proposed improved backbone network. Thirdly, the bonding fusion mode of feature maps, which were inputs to the target detection layer of medium size in the original YOLOv5s network, were improved. Finally, the initial anchor box size of the original network was improved. The experimental results indicated that the graspable apples, which were unoccluded or only occluded by tree leaves, and the ungraspable apples, which were occluded by tree branches or occluded by other fruits, could be identified effectively using the proposed improved network model in this study. Specifically, the recognition recall, precision, mAP and F1 were 91.48%, 83.83%, 86.75% and 87.49%, respectively. The average recognition time was 0.015 s per image. Contrasted with original YOLOv5s, YOLOv3, YOLOv4 and EfficientDet-D0 model, the mAP of the proposed improved YOLOv5s model increased by 5.05%, 14.95%, 4.74% and 6.75% respectively, the size of the model compressed by 9.29%, 94.6%, 94.8% and 15.3% respectively. The average recognition speeds per image of the proposed improved YOLOv5s model were 2.53, 1.13 and 3.53 times of EfficientDet-D0, YOLOv4 and YOLOv3 and model, respectively. The proposed method can provide technical support for the real-time accurate detection of multiple fruit targets for the apple picking robot.

AB  - Mobile agents have the potential to offer benefits, as they are able to either independently or cooperatively move throughout networks and collect/aggregate sensory data samples. They are programmed to autonomously move and visit sensory data stations through optimal paths, which are established according to the application requirements. However, mobile agent routing protocols still suffer heavy computation/communication overheads, lack of route planning accuracy and long-delay mobile agent migrations. For this, mobile agent route planning protocols aim to find the best-fitted paths for completing missions (e.g., data collection) with minimised delay, maximised performance and minimised transmitted traffic. This article proposes a mobile agent route planning protocol for sensory data collection called MINDS. The key goal of this MINDS is to reduce network traffic, maximise data robustness and minimise delay at the same time. This protocol utilises the Hamming distance technique to partition a sensor network into a number of data-centric clusters. In turn, a named data networking approach is used to form the cluster-heads as a data-centric, tree-based communication infrastructure. The mobile agents utilise a modified version of the Depth-First Search algorithm to move through the tree infrastructure according to a hop-count-aware fashion. As the simulation results show, MINDS reduces path length, reduces network traffic and increases data robustness as compared with two conventional benchmarks (ZMA and TBID) in dense and large wireless sensor networks.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in many challenging and diversified applications. These applications belong to the civilian and the military fields. To name a few; infrastructure inspection, traffic patrolling, remote sensing, mapping, surveillance, rescuing humans and animals, environment monitoring, and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) operations. However, the use of UAVs in these applications needs a substantial level of autonomy. In other words, UAVs should have the ability to accomplish planned missions in unexpected situations without requiring human intervention. To ensure this level of autonomy, many artificial intelligence algorithms were designed. These algorithms targeted the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) of UAVs. In this paper, we described the state of the art of one subset of these algorithms: the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. We made a detailed description of them, and we deduced the current limitations in this area. We noted that most of these DRL methods were designed to ensure stable and smooth UAV navigation by training computer-simulated environments. We realized that further research efforts are needed to address the challenges that restrain their deployment in real-life scenarios.

AB  - With the rapid development of digital technology, bird images have become an important part of ornithology research data. However, due to the rapid growth of bird image data, it has become a major challenge to effectively process such a large amount of data. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown great potential and effectiveness in a variety of tasks regarding the automatic processing of bird images. However, no research has been conducted on the recognition of habitat elements in bird images, which is of great help when extracting habitat information from bird images. Here, we demonstrate the recognition of habitat elements using four DCNN models trained end-to-end directly based on images. To carry out this research, an image database called Habitat Elements of Bird Images (HEOBs-10) and composed of 10 categories of habitat elements was built, making future benchmarks and evaluations possible. Experiments showed that good results can be obtained by all the tested models. ResNet-152-based models yielded the best test accuracy rate (95.52%); the AlexNet-based model yielded the lowest test accuracy rate (89.48%). We conclude that DCNNs could be efficient and useful for automatically identifying habitat elements from bird images, and we believe that the practical application of this technology will be helpful for studying the relationships between birds and habitat elements.

TI  - Development of a Flexible and Expandable UTM Simulator Based on Open Sources and Platforms

SN  - 2226-4310

AB  - In order to study air traffic control of UAS’s (Unmanned Aerial Systems) in very low altitudes, the UTM (UAS Traffic Management) simulator has to be as flexible and expandable as other research simulators because relevant technologies and regulations are not matured enough at this stage. Available approaches using open sources and platforms are investigated to be used in the UTM simulator. The fundamental rationale for selection is availability of necessary resources to build a UTM simulator. Integration efforts to build a UTM simulator are elaborated, using Ardupilot, MavProxi, Cesium, and VWorld, which are selected from the thorough field study. Design requirements of a UTM simulator are determined by analyzing UTM services defined by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and Eurocontrol. The UTM simulator, named eUTM, is composed of three components: UOS (UTM Operating System), UTM, and multiple GCSs (Ground Control Stations). GCSs are responsible for generation of flight paths of various UASs. UTM component copies functions of a real UTM such as monitoring and controlling air spaces. UOS provides simulation of environment such as weather, and controls the whole UTM simulator system. UOS also generates operation scenarios of UTM, and resides on the same UTM computer as an independent process. Two GCS simulators are connected to the UTM simulator in the present configuration, but the UTM simulator can be expanded to include up to 10 GCS simulators in the present design. In order to demonstrate the flexibility and expandability of eUTM simulator, several operation scenarios are realized and typical deconfliction scenarios among them are tested with a deconfliction algorithm. During the study, some limits are identified with applied open sources and platforms, which have to be resolved in order to obtain a flexible and expandable UTM simulator supporting relevant studies. Most of them are related to interfacing individual sources and platforms which use different program languages and communication drivers.

AB  - The paper concerns multicast packet traffic throughput maximization in multi-hop wireless sensor networks with time division multiple access to radio channel. We assume that the modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) that are used by the (broadcasting) nodes as well as the transmission power of the nodes are adjustable. This leads to the main research question studied in this paper: to what extent traffic throughput can be increased by proper MCSs assignment and transmission power control (TPC) at the nodes? To answer this question, we introduce mixed-integer programming formulations for joint MCSs assignment and TPC optimization, together with a solution algorithm. Finally, we present a numerical study illustrating the considerations of the paper. The numerical results show a significant gain being achieved by proper MCSs assignment, which is further increased by applying TPC.

AB  - The constant growth of pathologies affecting human mobility has led to developing of different assistive devices to provide physical and cognitive assistance. Smart walkers are a particular type of these devices since they integrate navigation systems, path-following algorithms, and user interaction modules to ensure natural and intuitive interaction. Although these functionalities are often implemented in rehabilitation scenarios, there is a need to actively involve the healthcare professionals in the interaction loop while guaranteeing safety for them and patients. This work presents the validation of two visual feedback strategies for the teleoperation of a simulated robotic walker during an assisted navigation task. For this purpose, a group of 14 clinicians from the rehabilitation area formed the validation group. A simple path-following task was proposed, and the feedback strategies were assessed through the kinematic estimation error (KTE) and a usability survey. A KTE of 0.28 m was obtained for the feedback strategy on the joystick. Additionally, significant differences were found through a Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test for the perception of behavior and confidence towards the joystick according to the modes of interaction (p-values of 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). The use of visual feedback with this tool contributes to research areas such as remote management of therapies and monitoring rehabilitation of people’s mobility.

AB  - In recent years, the use of drones for surveillance tasks has been on the rise worldwide. However, in the context of anomaly detection, only normal events are available for the learning process. Therefore, the implementation of a generative learning method in an unsupervised mode to solve this problem becomes fundamental. In this context, we propose a new end-to-end architecture capable of generating optical flow images from original UAV images and extracting compact spatio-temporal characteristics for anomaly detection purposes. It is designed with a custom loss function as a sum of three terms, the reconstruction loss (Rl), the generation loss (Gl) and the compactness loss (Cl) to ensure an efficient classification of the “deep-one” class. In addition, we propose to minimize the effect of UAV motion in video processing by applying background subtraction on optical flow images. We tested our method on very complex datasets called the mini-drone video dataset, and obtained results surpassing existing techniques’ performances with an AUC of 85.3.

AB  - The need for civilian use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has drastically increased in recent years. Their potential applications for civilian use include door-to-door package delivery, law enforcement, first aid, and emergency services in urban areas, which put the UAVs into obstacle collision risk. Therefore, UAVs are required to be equipped with sensors so as to acquire Artificial Intelligence (AI) to avoid potential risks during mission execution. The AI comes with intensive training of an on-board machine that is responsible to autonomously navigate the UAV. The training enables the UAV to develop humanoid perception of the environment it is to be navigating in. During the mission, this perception detects and localizes objects in the environment. It is based on this AI that this work proposes a real-time three-dimensional (3D) path planner that maneuvers the UAV towards destination through obstacle-free path. The proposed path planner has a heuristic sense of A⋆ algorithm, but requires no frontier nodes to be stored in a memory unlike A⋆. The planner relies on relative locations of detected objects (obstacles) and determines collision-free paths. This path planner is light-weight and hence a fast guidance method for real-time purposes. Its performance efficiency is proved through rigorous Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulations in constrained-environment and preliminary real flight tests.

AB  - Plant diseases are responsible for substantial crop losses each year and affect food security and agricultural sustainability. The improvement of crop resistance to pathogens through breeding represents an environmentally sound method for managing disease and minimizing these losses. The challenge is to breed varieties with a stable and broad-spectrum resistance. Different approaches, from markers to recent genomic and ‘post-genomic era’ technologies, will be reviewed in order to contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of host–pathogen interactions and genes, including those with small phenotypic effects and mechanisms that underlie resistance. An efficient combination of these approaches is herein proposed as the basis to develop a successful breeding strategy to obtain resistant crop varieties that yield higher in increasing disease scenarios.

SN  - 2073-4395

AB  - Over the last decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have been broadly utilized in various agricultural fields, such as crop management, crop monitoring, seed sowing, and pesticide spraying. Nonetheless, autonomy is still a crucial limitation faced by the Internet of Things (IoT) UAV systems, especially when used as sprayer UAVs, where data needs to be captured and preprocessed for robust real-time obstacle detection and collision avoidance. Moreover, because of the objective and operational difference between general UAVs and sprayer UAVs, not every obstacle detection and collision avoidance method will be sufficient for sprayer UAVs. In this regard, this article seeks to review the most relevant developments on all correlated branches of the obstacle avoidance scenarios for agricultural sprayer UAVs, including a UAV sprayer’s structural details. Furthermore, the most relevant open challenges for current UAV sprayer solutions are enumerated, thus paving the way for future researchers to define a roadmap for devising new-generation, affordable autonomous sprayer UAV solutions. Agricultural UAV sprayers require data-intensive algorithms for the processing of the images acquired, and expertise in the field of autonomous flight is usually needed. The present study concludes that UAV sprayers are still facing obstacle detection challenges due to their dynamic operating and loading conditions.

AB  - After the Cold War, the defense industries found themselves at a crossroads. However, it seems that they are gaining new momentum, as new technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence are enabling the development of autonomous, highly innovative and disruptive intelligent systems. Despite this new impetus, there are still doubts about where to invest limited financial resources to boost high-tech defense industries. In order to shed some light on the topic, we decided to conduct a systematic literature review by using the PRISMA protocol and content analysis. The results indicate that autonomous intelligent systems are being developed by the defense industry and categorized into three different modes—fully autonomous operations, partially autonomous operations, and smart autonomous decision-making. In addition, it is also important to note that, at a strategic level of war, there is limited room for automation given the need for human intervention. However, at the tactical level of war, there is a high probability of growth in industrial defense, since, at this level, structured decisions and complex analytical-cognitive tasks are carried out. In the light of carrying out those decisions and tasks, robotics and artificial intelligence can make a contribution far superior to that of human beings.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - An ad hoc network is a wireless mobile communication network composed of a group of mobile nodes with wireless transceivers. It does not rely on preset infrastructure and is established temporarily. The mobile nodes of the network use their own wireless transceivers to exchange information; when the information is not within the communication range, other intermediate nodes can be used to relay to achieve communication. They can be widely used in environments that cannot be supported by wired networks or which require communication temporarily, such as military applications, sensor networks, rescue and disaster relief, and emergency response. In MANET, each node acts as a host and as a router, and the nodes are linked through wireless channels in the network. One of the scenarios of MANET is VANET; VANET is supported by several types of fixed infrastructure. Due to its limitations, this infrastructure can support some VANET services and provide fixed network access. FANET is a subset of VANET. SANET is one of the common types of ad hoc networks. This paper could serve as a guide and reference so that readers have a comprehensive and general understanding of wireless ad hoc networks and their routing protocols at a macro level with a lot of good, related papers for reference. However, this is the first paper that discusses the popular types of ad hoc networks along with comparisons and simulation tools for Ad Hoc Networks.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This study proposes a collective motion and self-organization control of a swarm of 10 UAVs, which are divided into two clusters of five agents each. A cluster is a group of UAVs in a dedicated area and multiple clusters make a swarm. This paper designs the 3D model of the whole environment by applying graph theory. To address the aforesaid issues, this paper designs a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm by merging the particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the multi-agent system (MAS). First, PSO only provides the best agents of a cluster. Afterward, MAS helps to assign the best agent as the leader of the nth cluster. Moreover, the leader can find the optimal path for each cluster. Initially, each cluster contains agents at random positions. Later, the clusters form a formation by implementing PSO with the MAS model. This helps in coordinating the agents inside the nth cluster. However, when two clusters combine and make a swarm in a dynamic environment, MAS alone is not able to fill the communication gap of n clusters. This study does it by applying the Vicsek-based MAS connectivity and synchronization model along with dynamic leader selection ability. Moreover, this research uses a B-spline curve based on simple waypoint defined graph theory to create the flying formations of each cluster and the swarm. Lastly, this article compares the designed algorithm with the NSGA-II model to show that the proposed model has better convergence and durability, both in the individual clusters and inside the greater swarm.

AB  - Anomaly detection has gained considerable attention in the past couple of years. Emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), are known to be among the most critical sources of data streams that produce massive amounts of data continuously from numerous applications. Examining these collected data to detect suspicious events can reduce functional threats and avoid unseen issues that cause downtime in the applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the data stream characteristics, many unresolved problems persist. In the existing literature, methods have been designed and developed to evaluate certain anomalous behaviors in IoT data stream sources. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that discuss all the aspects of IoT data processing. Thus, this paper attempts to fill this gap by providing a complete image of various state-of-the-art techniques on the major problems and core challenges in IoT data. The nature of data, anomaly types, learning mode, window model, datasets, and evaluation criteria are also presented. Research challenges related to data evolving, feature-evolving, windowing, ensemble approaches, nature of input data, data complexity and noise, parameters selection, data visualizations, heterogeneity of data, accuracy, and large-scale and high-dimensional data are investigated. Finally, the challenges that require substantial research efforts and future directions are summarized.

SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can greatly reduce manpower in the agricultural plant protection such as watering, sowing, and pesticide spraying. It is essential to develop a Decision-making Support System (DSS) for UAVs to help them choose the correct action in states according to the policy. In an unknown environment, the method of formulating rules for UAVs to help them choose actions is not applicable, and it is a feasible solution to obtain the optimal policy through reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that the existing reinforcement learning algorithms cannot get the optimal policy for a UAV in the agricultural plant protection environment. In this work we propose an improved Q-learning algorithm based on similar state matching, and we prove theoretically that there has a greater probability for UAV choosing the optimal action according to the policy learned by the algorithm we proposed than the classic Q-learning algorithm in the agricultural plant protection environment. This proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on datasets that are evenly distributed based on real UAV parameters and real farm information. The performance evaluation of the algorithm is discussed in detail. Experimental results show that the algorithm we proposed can efficiently learn the optimal policy for UAVs in the agricultural plant protection environment.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In Public Safety Networks (PSNs), the conservation of on-scene device energy is critical to ensure long term connectivity to first responders. Due to the limited transmit power, this connectivity can be ensured by enabling continuous cooperation among on-scene devices through multipath routing. In this paper, we present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle- (UAV) aided multipath routing scheme for PSNs. The aim is to increase network lifetime by improving the Energy Efficiency (EE) of the PSN. First, network configurations are generated by using different clustering schemes. The RL is then applied to configure the routing topology that considers both the immediate energy cost and the total distance cost of the transmission path. The performance of these schemes are analyzed in terms of throughput, energy consumption, number of dead nodes, delay, packet delivery ratio, number of cluster head changes, number of control packets, and EE. The results showed an improvement of approximately 42% in EE of the clustering scheme when compared with non-clustering schemes. Furthermore, the impact of UAV trajectory and the number of UAVs are jointly analyzed by considering various trajectory scenarios around the disaster area. The EE can be further improved by 27% using Two UAVs on Opposite Axis of the building and moving in the Opposite directions (TUOAO) when compared to a single UAV scheme. The result showed that although the number of control packets in both the single and two UAV scenarios are comparable, the total number of CH changes are significantly different.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Over the past decade, new models of hybrid electric vehicles have been released worldwide, and the fuel efficiency of said vehicles has increased by more than 5%. To further improve fuel efficiency, vehicle manufacturers have made efforts to design modules (e.g., engines, motors, transmissions, and batteries) with the highest efficiency possible. To do so, the fuel economy test process, which is conducted primarily using a chassis dynamometer, must produce reliable and accurate results. To accurately analyze the fuel efficiency improvement rate of each module, it is necessary to reduce the test deviation. When the test conducted by human drivers, the test deviation is somewhat large. When the test is conducted by a physical robot driver, the test deviation is improved; however, these robots are expensive and time-consuming to install and take up considerable amount of space in the driver’s seat. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose a simple, structured robot system that manipulates electrical signals without using mechanical link structures. The controller of this robot driver uses the widely used PI controller. Although PI controllers are simple and perform well, since the dynamics of each test vehicle is different (e.g., acceleration response), the PI controller has a disadvantage in that it cannot determine the optimal PI gain value for each vehicles. In this work, the fuzzy control theorem is applied to overcome this disadvantage. By using fuzzy control to deduce the optimal value of the PI gain, we confirmed that our proposed system is available to conduct tests on vehicles with different dynamics.

AB  - With the rise of Deep Learning approaches in computer vision applications, significant strides have been made towards vehicular autonomy. Research activity in autonomous drone navigation has increased rapidly in the past five years, and drones are moving fast towards the ultimate goal of near-complete autonomy. However, while much work in the area focuses on specific tasks in drone navigation, the contribution to the overall goal of autonomy is often not assessed, and a comprehensive overview is needed. In this work, a taxonomy of drone navigation autonomy is established by mapping the definitions of vehicular autonomy levels, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, to specific drone tasks in order to create a clear definition of autonomy when applied to drones. A top–down examination of research work in the area is conducted, focusing on drone navigation tasks, in order to understand the extent of research activity in each area. Autonomy levels are cross-checked against the drone navigation tasks addressed in each work to provide a framework for understanding the trajectory of current research. This work serves as a guide to research in drone autonomy with a particular focus on Deep Learning-based solutions, indicating key works and areas of opportunity for development of this area in the future.

AB  - In recent years, the number of objects connected to the internet have significantly increased. Increasing the number of connected devices to the internet is transforming today’s Internet of Things (IoT) into massive IoT of the future. It is predicted that, in a few years, a high communication and computation capacity will be required to meet the demands of massive IoT devices and applications requiring data sharing and processing. 5G and beyond mobile networks are expected to fulfill a part of these requirements by providing a data rate of up to terabits per second. It will be a key enabler to support massive IoT and emerging mission critical applications with strict delay constraints. On the other hand, the next generation of software-defined networking (SDN) with emerging cloudrelated technologies (e.g., fog and edge computing) can play an important role in supporting and implementing the above-mentioned applications. This paper sets out the potential opportunities and important challenges that must be addressed in considering options for using SDN in hybrid cloud-fog systems to support 5G and beyond-enabled applications.

AB  - Crop diseases constitute a serious issue in agriculture, affecting both quality and quantity of agriculture production. Disease control has been a research object in many scientific and technologic domains. Technological advances in sensors, data storage, computing resources and artificial intelligence have shown enormous potential to control diseases effectively. A growing body of literature recognizes the importance of using data from different types of sensors and machine learning approaches to build models for detection, prediction, analysis, assessment, etc. However, the increasing number and diversity of research studies requires a literature review for further developments and contributions in this area. This paper reviews state-of-the-art machine learning methods that use different data sources, applied to plant disease detection. It lists traditional and deep learning methods associated with the main data acquisition modalities, namely IoT, ground imaging, unmanned aerial vehicle imaging and satellite imaging. In addition, this study examines the role of data fusion for ongoing research in the context of disease detection. It highlights the advantage of intelligent data fusion techniques, from heterogeneous data sources, to improve plant health status prediction and presents the main challenges facing this field.

AB  - Remotely sensed data from both in situ and satellite platforms in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared (VNIR–SWIR, 400–2500 nm) regions have been widely used to characterize and model soil properties in a direct, cost-effective, and rapid manner at different scales. In this study, we assess the performance of machine-learning algorithms including random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting machines (XGBoost), and support vector machines (SVM) to model salt marsh soil bulk density using multispectral remote-sensing data from the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) platform. To our knowledge, use of remote-sensing data for estimating salt marsh soil bulk density at the vegetation rooting zone has not been investigated before. Our study reveals that blue (band 1; 450–520 nm) and NIR (band 4; 770–900 nm) bands of Landsat-7 ETM+ ranked as the most important spectral features for bulk density prediction by XGBoost and RF, respectively. According to XGBoost, band 1 and band 4 had relative importance of around 41% and 39%, respectively. We tested two soil bulk density classes in order to differentiate salt marshes in terms of their capability to support vegetation that grows in either low (0.032 to 0.752 g/cm3) or high (0.752 g/cm3 to 1.893 g/cm3) bulk density areas. XGBoost produced a higher classification accuracy (88%) compared to RF (87%) and SVM (86%), although discrepancies in accuracy between these models were small (&lt;2%). XGBoost correctly classified 178 out of 186 soil samples labeled as low bulk density and 37 out of 62 soil samples labeled as high bulk density. We conclude that remote-sensing-based machine-learning models can be a valuable tool for ecologists and engineers to map the soil bulk density in wetlands to select suitable sites for effective restoration and successful re-establishment practices.

AB  - The evolution of driving technology has recently progressed from active safety features and ADAS systems to fully sensor-guided autonomous driving. Bringing such a vehicle to market requires not only simulation and testing but formal verification to account for all possible traffic scenarios. A new verification approach, which combines the use of two well-known model checkers: model checker for multi-agent systems (MCMAS) and probabilistic model checker (PRISM), is presented for this purpose. The overall structure of our autonomous vehicle (AV) system consists of: (1) A perception system of sensors that feeds data into (2) a rational agent (RA) based on a belief–desire–intention (BDI) architecture, which uses a model of the environment and is connected to the RA for verification of decision-making, and (3) a feedback control systems for following a self-planned path. MCMAS is used to check the consistency and stability of the BDI agent logic during design-time. PRISM is used to provide the RA with the probability of success while it decides to take action during run-time operation. This allows the RA to select movements of the highest probability of success from several generated alternatives. This framework has been tested on a new AV software platform built using the robot operating system (ROS) and virtual reality (VR) Gazebo Simulator. It also includes a parking lot scenario to test the feasibility of this approach in a realistic environment. A practical implementation of the AV system was also carried out on the experimental testbed.

AB  - The district heating (DH) industry is facing an important transformation towards more efficient networks that utilise significantly lower water temperatures to distribute the heat. This change requires taking advantage of new technologies, and Machine Learning (ML) is a popular direction. In the last decade, we have witnessed an extreme growth in the number of published research papers that focus on applying ML techniques to the DH domain. However, based on our experience in the field, and an extensive review of the state-of-the-art, we perceive a mismatch between the most popular research directions, such as forecasting, and the challenges faced by the DH industry. In this work, we present our findings, explain and demonstrate the key gaps between the two communities and suggest a road-map ahead towards increasing the impact of ML research in the DH industry.

AB  - UAV path planning for remote sensing aims to find the best-fitted routes to complete a data collection mission. UAVs plan the routes and move through them to remotely collect environmental data from particular target zones by using sensory devices such as cameras. Route planning may utilize machine learning techniques to autonomously find/select cost-effective and/or best-fitted routes and achieve optimized results including: minimized data collection delay, reduced UAV power consumption, decreased flight traversed distance and maximized number of collected data samples. This paper utilizes a reinforcement learning technique (location and energy-aware Q-learning) to plan UAV routes for remote sensing in smart farms. Through this, the UAV avoids heuristically or blindly moving throughout a farm, but this takes the benefits of environment exploration–exploitation to explore the farm and find the shortest and most cost-effective paths into target locations with interesting data samples to collect. According to the simulation results, utilizing the Q-learning technique increases data collection robustness and reduces UAV resource consumption (e.g., power), traversed paths, and remote sensing latency as compared to two well-known benchmarks, IEMF and TBID, especially if the target locations are dense and crowded in a farm.

AB  - As a typical cyber-physical system, networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received much attention in recent years. Emerging communication technologies and high-performance control methods enable networked UAVs to operate as aerial sensor networks to collect more complete and consistent information with significantly improved mobility and flexibility than traditional sensing platforms. One of the main applications of networked UAVs is surveillance and monitoring, which constitute essential components of a well-functioning public safety system and many industrial applications. Although the existing literature on surveillance and monitoring UAVs is extensive, a comprehensive survey on this topic is lacking. This article classifies publications on networked UAVs for surveillance and monitoring using the targets of interest and analyzes several typical problems on this topic, including the control, navigation, and deployment optimization of UAVs. The related research gaps and future directions are also presented.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Power consumption in wireless sensor networks is high, and the lifetime of a battery has become a bottleneck, restricting network performance. Wireless power transfer with a ground mobile charger is vulnerable to interference from the terrain and other factors, and hence it is difficult to deploy in practice. Accordingly, a novel paradigm is adopted where a multi-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) with batteries can transfer power and information to SDs (sensor devices) in a large-scale sensor network. However, there are discrete events, continuous process, time delay, and decisions in such a complicated system. From the perspective of a hybrid system, a hybrid colored cyber Petri net system is proposed here to depict and analyze this problem. Furthermore, the energy utilization rate and information collection time delay are conflict with each other; therefore, UAV-aided wireless power and information transfer is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. For this reason, the MAC-NSGA II (multiple ant colony-nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II) is proposed in this work. Firstly, the optimal trajectory of multiple UAVs was obtained, and on this basis, the above two objectives were optimized simultaneously. Large-scale simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to NSGA II and MOEA/D in terms of energy efficiency and information collection delay.

AB  - Rapid advances that improve flood management have facilitated the disaster response by providing first aid services, finding safe routes, maintaining communication and developing flood maps. Different technologies such as image processing, satellite imagery, synthetic imagery and integrated approaches have been extensively analysed in the literature for disaster operations. There is a need to review cutting-edge technologies for flood management.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel metal oxide arrester (MOA) fault detection technology based on a small sample infrared image. The research is carried out from the detection process and data enhancement. A lightweight MOA identification and location algorithm is designed at the edge, which can not only reduce the amount of data uploaded, but also reduce the search space of cloud algorithm. In order to improve the accuracy and generalization ability of the defect detection model under the condition of small samples, a multi-model fusion detection algorithm is proposed. Different features of the image are extracted by multiple convolutional neural networks, and then multiple classifiers are trained. Finally, the weighted voting strategy is used for fault diagnosis. In addition, the extended model of fault samples is constructed by transfer learning and deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) to solve the problem of unbalanced training data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method can realize the accurate location of arrester under the condition of small samples, and after the data expansion, the recognition rate of arrester anomalies can be improved from 83% to 85%, showing high effectiveness and reliability.

AB  - Currently, smart farming is considered an effective solution to enhance the productivity of farms; thereby, it has recently received broad interest from service providers to offer a wide range of applications, from pest identification to asset monitoring. Although the emergence of digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), has led to significant advances in the smart farming industry, farming operations still need more efficient solutions. On the other hand, the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, is growing rapidly across many civil application domains. This paper aims to develop a farm monitoring system that incorporates UAV, LPWAN, and IoT technologies to transform the current farm management approach and aid farmers in obtaining actionable data from their farm operations. In this regard, an IoT-based water quality monitoring system was developed because water is an essential aspect in livestock development. Then, based on the Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN®) technology, a multi-channel LoRaWAN® gateway was developed and integrated into a vertical takeoff and landing drone to convey collected data from the sensors to the cloud for further analysis. In addition, to develop LoRaWAN®-based aerial communication, a series of measurements and simulations were performed under different configurations and scenarios. Finally, to enhance the efficiency of aerial-based data collection, the UAV path planning was optimized. Measurement results showed that the maximum achievable LoRa coverage when operating on-air via the drone is about 10 km, and the Longley–Rice irregular terrain model provides the most suitable path loss model for the scenario of large-scale farms, and a multi-channel gateway with a spreading factor of 12 provides the most reliable communication link at a high drone speed (up to 95 km/h). Simulation results showed that the developed system can overcome the coverage limitation of LoRaWAN® and it can establish a reliable communication link over large-scale wireless sensor networks. In addition, it was shown that by optimizing flight paths, aerial data collection could be performed in a much shorter time than industrial mission planning (up to four times in our case).

AB  - The discriminative object tracking system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is widely used in numerous applications. While an ample amount of research has been carried out in this domain, implementing a low computational cost algorithm on a UAV onboard embedded system is still challenging. To address this issue, we propose a low computational complexity discriminative object tracking system for UAVs approach using the patch color group feature (PCGF) framework in this work. The tracking object is separated into several non-overlapping local image patches then the features are extracted into the PCGFs, which consist of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The object location is calculated by the similar PCGFs comparison from the previous frame and current frame. The background PCGFs of the object are removed by four directions feature scanning and dynamic threshold comparison, which improve the performance accuracy. In the terms of speed execution, the proposed algorithm accomplished 32.5 frames per second (FPS) on the x64 CPU platform without a GPU accelerator and 17 FPS in Raspberry Pi 4. Therefore, this work could be considered as a good solution for achieving a low computational complexity PCGF algorithm on a UAV onboard embedded system to improve flight times.

We further present a method for using the information collected by the drone to generate a detailed mapping of the environment.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are abundantly becoming a part of society, which is a trend that is expected to grow even further. The quadrotor is one of the drone technologies that is applicable in many sectors and in both military and civilian activities, with some applications requiring autonomous flight. However, stability, path planning, and control remain significant challenges in autonomous quadrotor flights. Traditional control algorithms, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID), have deficiencies, especially in tuning. Recently, machine learning has received great attention in flying UAVs to desired positions autonomously. In this work, we configure the quadrotor to fly autonomously by using agents (the machine learning schemes being used to fly the quadrotor autonomously) to learn about the virtual physical environment. The quadrotor will fly from an initial to a desired position. When the agent brings the quadrotor closer to the desired position, it is rewarded; otherwise, it is punished. Two reinforcement learning models, Q-learning and SARSA, and a deep learning deep Q-network network are used as agents. The simulation is conducted by integrating the robot operating system (ROS) and Gazebo, which allowed for the implementation of the learning algorithms and the physical environment, respectively. The result has shown that the Deep Q-network network with Adadelta optimizer is the best setting to fly the quadrotor from the initial to desired position.

AB  - To ensure the safe operation of an interconnected power system, it is necessary to maintain the stability of the frequency and the tie-line exchanged power. This is one of the hottest issues in the power system field and is usually called load frequency control. To overcome the influences of load disturbances on multi-source power systems containing thermal power plants, hydropower plants, and gas turbine plants, we design a linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) based on the tie-line bias control mode. For LADRC, the parameter selection of the controller directly affects the response performance of the entire system, and it is usually not feasible to manually adjust parameters. Therefore, to obtain the optimal controller parameters, we use the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm in reinforcement learning to obtain the controller parameters in real time, and we design the reward function according to the needs of the power system. We carry out simulation experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the results of other proportional–integral–derivative control techniques using optimization algorithms and LADRC with constant parameters, the proposed method shows significant advantages in terms of overshoot, undershoot, and settling time. In addition, by adding different disturbances to different areas of the multi-source power system, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed control strategy.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) context continuously generate large amounts of data. The data must be processed and monitored to allow rapid decision making. However, the wireless connection that links such devices to remote servers can lead to data loss. Thus, new forms of a connection must be explored to ensure the system’s availability and reliability as a whole. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly empowered in terms of processing power and autonomy. UAVs can be used as a bridge between IoT devices and remote servers, such as edge or cloud computing. UAVs can collect data from mobile devices and process them, if possible. If there is no processing power in the UAV, the data are sent and processed on servers at the edge or in the cloud. Data offloading throughout UAVs is a reality today, but one with many challenges, mainly due to unavailability constraints. This work proposes stochastic Petri net (SPN) models and reliability block diagrams (RBDs) to evaluate a distributed architecture, with UAVs focusing on the system’s availability and reliability. Among the various existing methodologies, stochastic Petri nets (SPN) provide models that represent complex systems with different characteristics. UAVs are used to route data from IoT devices to the edge or the cloud through a base station. The base station receives data from UAVs and retransmits them to the cloud. The data are processed in the cloud, and the responses are returned to the IoT devices. A sensitivity analysis through Design of Experiments (DoE) showed key points of improvement for the base model, which was enhanced. A numerical analysis indicated the components with the most significant impact on availability. For example, the cloud proved to be a very relevant component for the availability of the architecture. The final results could prove the effectiveness of improving the base model. The present work can help system architects develop distributed architectures with more optimized UAVs and low evaluation costs.

SN  - 2077-1312

AB  - During the implementation of time-consuming tasks such as underwater observation or detection, AUV has to face a difficult and urgent problem that its working duration is greatly shortened by the limited energy stored in the battery device. To solve the power problem, a docking station is installed underwater for AUV charging its battery. However, to realize the automatic underwater charging of AUV via a docking station, the accurate and efficient completion of underwater homing and docking is required for AUV. Underwater automatic homing and docking system is of great significance to improve work efficiency and prolong the endurance of AUV save cost. In this paper, a unified approach that involves such as task planning, guidance and control design, thrust allocation has been proposed to provide a complete solution to the problem of homing and docking of an over-actuated AUV. The task-based hybrid target point/line planning and following strategy are proposed for AUV homing and docking. At the beginning of homing, AUV is planned to follow a straight line via the line of sight (LoS) method. Afterward, AUV starts to follow multiple predefined target points until reaching the docking station. At the final stage of docking (within 10 m), a dedicated computer vision algorithm is applied to detect a newly designed LED light array fixed on the docking station to provide accurate guidance for the AUV to dock. The sliding mode control technique is used for the motion control of the AUV allowing robustness. As the AUV configured with eight thrusters is over-actuated, the problem of the thrust allocation is very important and successfully solved using the quadratic programming (QP) optimization method. Finally, the simulations of homing and docking tasks using the AUV are accomplished to verify the proposed approach.

AB  - In the current era, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly pervasive with applications in several applicative fields effectively changing our daily life. In this scenario, machine learning (ML), a subset of AI techniques, provides machines with the ability to programmatically learn from data to model a system while adapting to new situations as they learn more by data they are ingesting (on-line training). During the last several years, many papers have been published concerning ML applications in the field of solar systems. This paper presents the state of the art ML models applied in solar energy’s forecasting field i.e., for solar irradiance and power production forecasting (both point and interval or probabilistic forecasting), electricity price forecasting and energy demand forecasting. Other applications of ML into the photovoltaic (PV) field taken into account are the modelling of PV modules, PV design parameter extraction, tracking the maximum power point (MPP), PV systems efficiency optimization, PV/Thermal (PV/T) and Concentrating PV (CPV) system design parameters’ optimization and efficiency improvement, anomaly detection and energy management of PV’s storage systems. While many review papers already exist in this regard, they are usually focused only on one specific topic, while in this paper are gathered all the most relevant applications of ML for solar systems in many different fields. The paper gives an overview of the most recent and promising applications of machine learning used in the field of photovoltaic systems.

AB  - The amount of internet traffic generated during mass public events is significantly growing in a way that requires methods to increase the overall performance of the wireless network service. Recently, legacy methods in form of mobile cell sites, frequently called cells on wheels, were used. However, modern technologies are allowing the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as a platform for network service extension instead of ground-based techniques. This results in the development of flying base stations (FBS) where the number of deployed FBSs depends on the demanded network capacity and specific user requirements. Large-scale events, such as outdoor music festivals or sporting competitions, requiring deployment of more than one FBS need a method to optimally distribute these aerial vehicles to achieve high capacity and minimize the cost. In this paper, we present a mathematical model for FBS deployment in large-scale scenarios. The model is based on a location set covering problem and the goal is to minimize the number of FBSs by finding their optimal locations. It is restricted by users’ throughput requirements and FBSs’ available throughput, also, all users that require connectivity must be served. Two meta-heuristic algorithms (cuckoo search and differential evolution) were implemented and verified on a real example of a music festival scenario. The results show that both algorithms are capable of finding a solution. The major difference is in the performance where differential evolution solves the problem six to eight times faster, thus it is more suitable for repetitive calculation. The obtained results can be used in commercial scenarios similar to the one used in this paper where providing sufficient connectivity is crucial for good user experience. The designed algorithms will serve for the network infrastructure design and for assessing the costs and feasibility of the use-case.

AB  - To enhance obstacle avoidance abilities of the plant protection UAV in unstructured farmland, this article improved the traditional A* algorithms through dynamic heuristic functions, search point optimization, and inflection point optimization based on millimeter wave radar and monocular camera data fusion. Obstacle information extraction experiments were carried out. The performance between the improved algorithm and traditional algorithm was compared. Additionally, obstacle avoidance experiments were also carried out. The results show that the maximum error in distance measurement of data fusion method was 8.2%. Additionally, the maximum error in obstacle width and height measurement were 27.3% and 18.5%, respectively. The improved algorithm is more useful in path planning, significantly reduces data processing time, search grid, and turning points. The algorithm at most increases path length by 2.0%, at least reduces data processing time by 68.4%, search grid by 74.9%, and turning points by 20.7%. The maximum trajectory offset error was proportional to the flight speed, with a maximum trajectory offset of 1.4 m. The distance between the UAV and obstacle was inversely proportional to flight speed, with a minimum distance of 1.6 m. This method can provide a new idea for obstacle avoidance of the plant protection UAV.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In the last few years, many examples of blood and medicine delivery drones have been demonstrated worldwide, which mainly rely on aeronautical experience that is not common in the medical world. Speaking about drone delivery, attention should focus on the most important thing: the transported lifesaving good. Traditional boxes that monitor temperature are not usually in real time, and are not suitable for drone transportation because they are heavy and bulky. This means that the biomedical characteristics of delivery are of primary importance. A Smart Capsule, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), is the first system ever proposed to provide a fully autonomous drone delivery service for perishable and high-value medical products, integrating real-time quality monitoring and control. It consists in a smart casing that is able to guide any autonomous aerial vehicle attached to it, specifically designed for transporting blood, organs, tissues, test samples and drugs, among others. The system monitors the conditions of the product (e.g., temperature, agitation and humidity) and adjusts them when needed by exploiting, for instance, vibrations to maintain the required agitation, ensuring that goods are ready to be used as soon as they are delivered. The Smart Capsule also leverages external temperature to reduce energy uptake from the drone, thus improving the drone’s battery life and flight range. The system replaces the need for specialized drivers and traditional road-bound transportation means, while guaranteeing compliance with all applicable safety regulations. A series of 16 experimental tests was performed to demonstrate the possibility of using the smart capsule to manage the flight and internal good delivery. Eighty-one missions were carried out for a total of 364 min of flight. The Smart Capsule greatly improves emergency response and efficiency of healthcare systems by reducing delivery times by up to 80% and costs by at least 28%. The Smart Capsule and its enabling technology based on AI for drone deliveries are discussed in this paper. The aim of this work is to show the possibility of managing drone delivery with an AI-based device.

AB  - This article presents aspects related to the protection (with a double shield made of stainless steel) of a robot for emergency situations against the effect of flames due to a fire. The ground robot is semi-autonomous/autonomous, with a wheeled propeller (6 × 6). The robot, designed and built at the TRL 2 level, is intended for fire investigation, monitoring, and intervention (and, in particular, for petrochemical plants). The role of the shield is to protect the equipment that is part of the robot including its controllers, sensors, communications, power supply, etc. The need to mount a thermal protection shield on the intervention robot was given by the fact that fires at petrochemical plants generate very large thermal fields and gradients which are responsible for creating blind spots. These blind spots do not allow intervention crews to see what is happening in that area. These blind spots are characterized by very high temperatures. The dynamics of these fires can be unpredictable. Therefore, to analyze the performance of the heat shield in this study we perform a numerical-experimental analysis.

AB  - Nonlinear flight controllers for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can potentially be developed using deep reinforcement learning. However, there is often a reality gap between the simulation models used to train these controllers and the real world. This study experimentally investigated the application of deep reinforcement learning to the pitch control of a UAV in wind tunnel tests, with a particular focus of investigating the effect of time delays on flight controller performance. Multiple neural networks were trained in simulation with different assumed time delays and then wind tunnel tested. The neural networks trained with shorter delays tended to be susceptible to delay in the real tests and produce fluctuating behaviour. The neural networks trained with longer delays behaved more conservatively and did not produce oscillations but suffered steady state errors under some conditions due to unmodeled frictional effects. These results highlight the importance of performing physical experiments to validate controller performance and how the training approach used with reinforcement learning needs to be robust to reality gaps between simulation and the real world.

AB  - The continuous evolution of modern technology has led to the creation of increasingly complex and advanced systems. This has been also reflected in the technology of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), where the growing demand for more reliable performance necessitates the development of sophisticated techniques that provide fault diagnosis and fault tolerance in a timely and accurate manner. Typically, a UAV consists of three types of subsystems: actuators, main structure and sensors. Therefore, a fault-monitoring system must be specifically designed to supervise and debug each of these subsystems, so that any faults can be addressed before they lead to disastrous consequences. In this survey article, we provide a detailed overview of recent advances and studies regarding fault diagnosis, Fault-Tolerant Control (FTC) and anomaly detection for UAVs. Concerning fault diagnosis, our interest is mainly focused on sensors and actuators, as these subsystems are mostly prone to faults, while their healthy operation usually ensures the smooth and reliable performance of the aerial vehicle.

AB  - The energy efficiency and flight endurance of small unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) can be improved through the implementation of autonomous soaring strategies. Biologically inspired flight techniques such as dynamic and thermal soaring offer significant energy savings through the exploitation of naturally occurring wind phenomena for thrustless flight. Recent interest in the application of artificial intelligence algorithms for autonomous soaring has been motivated by the pursuit of instilling generalized behavior in control systems, centered around the use of neural networks. However, the topology of such networks is usually predetermined, restricting the search space of potential solutions, while often resulting in complex neural networks that can pose implementation challenges for the limited hardware onboard small-scale autonomous vehicles. In exploring a novel method of generating neurocontrollers, this paper presents a neural network-based soaring strategy to extend flight times and advance the potential operational capability of SUAVs. In this study, the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is used to train efficient and effective neurocontrollers that can control a simulated aircraft along sustained dynamic and thermal soaring trajectories. The proposed approach evolves interpretable neural networks in a way that preserves simplicity while maximizing performance without requiring extensive training datasets. As a result, the combined trajectory planning and aircraft control strategy is suitable for real-time implementation on SUAV platforms.

SN  - 2077-1312

AB  - Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely used to perform underwater tasks. Due to the environmental disturbances, underactuated problems, system constraints, and system coupling, AUV trajectory tracking control is challenging. Thus, further investigation of dynamic characteristics and trajectory tracking control methods of the AUV motion system will be of great importance to improve underwater task performance. An AUV controller must be able to cope with various challenges with the underwater vehicle, adaptively update the reference model, and overcome unexpected deviations. In order to identify modeling strategies and the best control practices, this paper presents an overview of the main factors of control-oriented models and control strategies for AUVs. In modeling, two fields are considered: (i) models that come from simplifications of Fossen’s equations; and (ii) system identification models. For each category, a brief description of the control-oriented modeling strategies is given. In the control field, three relevant aspects are considered: (i) significance of AUV trajectory tracking control, (ii) control strategies; and (iii) control performance. For each aspect, the most important features are explained. Furthermore, in the aspect of control strategies, mathematical modeling study and physical experiment study are introduced in detail. Finally, with the aim of establishing the acceptability of the reported modeling and control techniques, as well as challenges that remain open, a discussion and a case study are presented. The literature review shows the development of new control-oriented models, the research in the estimation of unknown inputs, and the development of more innovative control strategies for AUV trajectory tracking systems are still open problems that must be addressed in the short term.

AB  - Performing autonomous maneuvering flight planning and optimization remains a challenge for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially for fixed-wing UAVs due to its high maneuverability and model complexity. A novel hybrid-driven fixed-wing UAV maneuver optimization framework, inspired by apprenticeship learning and nonlinear programing approaches, is proposed in this paper. The work consists of two main aspects: (1) Identifying the model parameters for a certain fixed-wing UAV based on the demonstrated flight data performed by human pilot. Then, the features of the maneuvers can be described by the positional/attitude/compound key-frames. Eventually, each of the maneuvers can be decomposed into several motion primitives. (2) Formulating the maneuver planning issue into a minimum-time optimization problem, a novel nonlinear programming algorithm was developed, which was unnecessary to determine the exact time for the UAV to pass by the key-frames. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in several scenarios, as both the preservation of geometric features and the minimization of maneuver times were ensured.

AB  - An intelligent reflective surface (IRS) is a novel and revolutionizing communication technology destined to enable the control of the radio environment. An IRS is a real-time controllable reflectarray with a massive number of low-cost passive elements which introduce a phase shift to the incoming signals from the sources before the propagation towards the destination. This technology introduces the notion of a smart propagation environment with the aim of improving the system performance. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive literature overview on IRS technology, including its basic concepts and reconfiguration, as well as its design aspects and applications for wireless communication systems. We also study the performance metrics and the setups considered in recent publications related to IRS and provide suggestions of future research lines based on still unexplored use cases in the state-of-the-art.

AB  - Multirobot cooperation enhancing the efficiency of numerous applications such as maintenance, rescue, inspection in cluttered unknown environments is the interesting topic recently. However, designing a formation strategy for multiple robots which enables the agents to follow the predefined master robot during navigation actions without a prebuilt map is challenging due to the uncertainties of self-localization and motion control. In this paper, we present a multirobot system to form the symmetrical patterns effectively within the unknown environment deployed randomly. To enable self-localization during group formatting, we propose the sensor fusion system leveraging sensor fusion from the ultrawideband-based positioning system, Inertial Measurement Unit orientation system, and wheel encoder to estimate robot locations precisely. Moreover, we propose a global path planning algorithm considering the kinematic of the robot’s action inside the workspace as a metric space. Experiments are conducted on a set of robots called Falcon with a conventional four-wheel skid steering schematic as a case study to validate our proposed path planning technique. The outcome of our trials shows that the proposed approach produces exact robot locations after sensor fusion with the feasible formation tracking of multiple robots system on the simulated and real-world experiments.

AB  - Computation offloading technology extends cloud computing to the edge of the access network close to users, bringing many benefits to terminal devices with limited battery and computational resources. Nevertheless, the existing computation offloading approaches are challenging to apply to specific scenarios, such as the dense distribution of end-users and the sparse distribution of network infrastructure. The technological revolution in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and chip industry has granted UAVs more computing resources and promoted the emergence of UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, which could be applied to those scenarios. However, in the MEC system with multiple users and multiple servers, making reasonable offloading decisions and allocating system resources is still a severe challenge. This paper studies the offloading decision and resource allocation problem in the UAV-assisted MEC environment with multiple users and servers. To ensure the quality of service for end-users, we set the weighted total cost of delay, energy consumption, and the size of discarded tasks as our optimization objective. We further formulate the joint optimization problem as a Markov decision process and apply the soft actor–critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the offloading policy. Numerical simulation results show that the offloading policy optimized by our proposed SAC-based dynamic computing offloading (SACDCO) algorithm effectively reduces the delay, energy consumption, and size of discarded tasks for the UAV-assisted MEC system. Compared with the fixed local-UAV scheme in the specific simulation setting, our proposed approach reduces system delay and energy consumption by approximately 50% and 200%, respectively.

A novel multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on the Gaussian distribution and the Q-Learning technique (GMOPSO-QL) is proposed and applied to determine the feasible and optimal path for UAV. In GMOPSO-QL, the Gaussian distribution based updating operator is adopted to generate new particles, and the exploration and exploitation modes are introduced to enhance population diversity and convergence speed, respectively. Moreover, the Q-Learning based mode selection logic is introduced to balance the global search with the local search in the evolution process. Simulation results indicate that our proposed GMOPSO-QL can deal with the constrained UAV path planning problem and is superior to existing optimization algorithms in terms of efficiency and robustness.

AB  - To ensure the continuity of electric power generation for photovoltaic systems, condition monitoring frameworks are subject to major enhancements. The continuous uniform delivery of electric power depends entirely on a well-designed condition maintenance program. A just-in-time task to deal with several naturally occurring faults can be correctly undertaken via the cooperation of effective detection, diagnosis, and prognostic analyses. Therefore, the present review first outlines different failure modes to which all photovoltaic systems are subjected, in addition to the essential integrated detection methods and technologies. Then, data-driven paradigms, and their contribution to solving this prediction problem, are also explored. Accordingly, this review primarily investigates the different learning architectures used (i.e., ordinary, hybrid, and ensemble) in relation to their learning frameworks (i.e., traditional and deep learning). It also discusses the extension of machine learning to knowledge-driven approaches, including generative models such as adversarial networks and transfer learning. Finally, this review provides insights into different works to highlight various operating conditions and different numbers and types of failures, and provides links to some publicly available datasets in the field. The clear organization of the abundant information on this subject may result in rigorous guidelines for the trends adopted in the future.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 20
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - This work focuses on the optimization of a last-mile delivery system with multiple transportation modes. In this scenario, parcels need to be delivered to each customer point. The major feature of the problem is the combination of a fleet of road vehicles (vans) with a drone. Each van visits a subset of demand nodes to be determined according to the route of the van. The drone serves the customers not served by vans. At the same time, considering the safety, policy and terrain as well as the need to replace the battery, the drone needs to be transported by truck to the identified station along with the parcel. From each such station, the drone serves a subset of customers according to a direct assignment pattern, i.e., every time the drone is launched, it serves one demand node and returns to the station to collect another parcel. Similarly, the truck is used to transport the drone and cargo between stations. This is somewhat different from the research of other scholars. In terms of the joint distribution of the drone and road vehicle, most scholars will choose the combination of two transportation tools, while we use three. The drone and vans are responsible for distribution services, and the trucks are responsible for transporting the goods and drone to the station. The goal is to optimize the total delivery cost which includes the transportation costs for the vans and the delivery cost for the drone. A fixed cost is also considered for each drone parking site corresponding to the cost of positioning the drone and using the drone station. A discrete optimization model is presented for the problem in addition to a two-phase heuristic algorithm. The results of a series of computational tests performed to assess the applicability of the model and the efficiency of the heuristic are reported. The results obtained show that nearly 10% of the cost can be saved by combining the traditional delivery mode with the use of a drone and drone stations.

AB  - The widespread use of mobile devices and sensors has motivated data-driven applications that can leverage the power of big data to benefit many aspects of our daily life, such as health, transportation, economy, and environment. Under the context of smart city, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), as a main building block of modern cities, and edge computing (EC), as an emerging computing service that targets addressing the limitations of cloud computing, have attracted increasing attention in the research community in recent years. It is well believed that the application of EC in ITS will have considerable benefits to transportation systems regarding efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Despite the growing trend in ITS and EC research, a big gap in the existing literature is identified: the intersection between these two promising directions has been far from well explored. In this paper, we focus on a critical part of ITS, i.e., sensing, and conducting a review on the recent advances in ITS sensing and EC applications in this field. The key challenges in ITS sensing and future directions with the integration of edge computing are discussed.

AB  - A communication system based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a viable alternative for meeting the coverage and capacity needs of future wireless networks. However, because of the limitations of UAV-enabled communications in terms of coverage, energy consumption, and flying laws, the number of studies focused on the sustainability element of UAV-assisted networking in the literature was limited thus far. We present a solution to this problem in this study; specifically, we design a Q-learning-based UAV placement strategy for long-term wireless connectivity while taking into account major constraints such as altitude regulations, nonflight zones, and transmit power. The goal is to determine the best location for the UAV base station (BS) while reducing energy consumption and increasing the number of users covered. Furthermore, a weighting method is devised, allowing energy usage and the number of users served to be prioritized based on network/battery circumstances. The suggested Q-learning-based solution is contrasted to the standard k-means clustering method, in which the UAV BS is positioned at the centroid location with the shortest cumulative distance between it and the users. The results demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms the baseline k-means clustering-based method in terms of the number of users covered while achieving the desired minimization of the energy consumption.

AB  - There is tremendous demand for marine environmental observation, which requires the development of a multi-agent cooperative observation algorithm to guide Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to observe isotherm data of the mesoscale vortex. The task include two steps: firstly, USVs search out the isotherm, navigate independently along the isotherm, and collect marine data; secondly, a UAV takes off, and in its one round trip, the UAV and USVs jointly perform the task of the UAV reading the observation data from USVs. In this paper, aiming at the first problem of the USV following the isotherm in an unknown environment, a data-driven Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) control algorithm is designed that allows USVs to navigate independently along isotherms in unknown environments. In addition, a hybrid cooperative control algorithm based on a multi-agent DDPG is adopted to solve the second problem, which enables USVs and a UAV to complete data reading tasks with the shortest flight distance of the UAV. The experimental simulation results show that the trained system can complete this tas, with good stability and accuracy.

AB  - The two-part series of papers provides a survey on recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an approach to simulate the human’s natural learning process, whose key is to let the agent learn by interacting with the stochastic environment. The fact that the agent has limited access to the information of the environment enables AI to be applied efficiently in most fields that require self-learning. It’s essential to have an organized investigation—we can make good comparisons and choose the best structures or algorithms when applying DRL in various applications. The first part of the overview introduces Markov Decision Processes (MDP) problems and Reinforcement Learning and applications of DRL for solving POMDP problems in games, robotics, and natural language processing. In part two, we continue to introduce applications in transportation, industries, communications and networking, etc. and discuss the limitations of DRL.

AB  - In recent years, the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased dramatically. UAVs can accomplish complex or dangerous tasks in a reliable and cost-effective way but are still limited by power consumption problems, which pose serious constraints on the flight duration and completion of energy-demanding tasks. The possibility of providing UAVs with advanced decision-making capabilities in an energy-effective way would be extremely beneficial. In this paper, we propose a practical solution to this problem that exploits deep learning on the edge. The developed system integrates an OpenMV microcontroller into a DJI Tello Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). The microcontroller hosts a set of machine learning-enabled inference tools that cooperate to control the navigation of the drone and complete a given mission objective. The goal of this approach is to leverage the new opportunistic features of TinyML through OpenMV including offline inference, low latency, energy efficiency, and data security. The approach is successfully validated on a practical application consisting of the onboard detection of people wearing protection masks in a crowded environment.

AB  - The fundamental issue for Beyond fifth Generation (B5G) is providing a pervasive connection to heterogeneous and various devices in smart environments. Therefore, Drones play a vital role in the B5G, allowing for wireless broadcast and high-speed communications. In addition, the drone offers several advantages compared to fixed terrestrial communications, including flexible deployment, robust Line of Sight (LoS) connections, and more design degrees of freedom due to controlled mobility. Drones can provide reliable and high data rate connectivity to users irrespective of their location. However, atmospheric disturbances impact the signal quality between drones and users and degrade the system performance. Considering practical implementation, the location of drones makes the drone–user communication susceptible to several environmental disturbances. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of drone-user connectivity during atmospheric disturbances. Further, a Machine Learning (ML)-assisted algorithm is proposed to adapt to a modulation technique that offers optimal performance during atmospheric disturbances. The results show that, with the algorithm, the system switches to a lower order modulation scheme during higher rain rate and provides reliable communication with optimized data rate and error performance.

AB  - The article discusses the UAV lateral motion stabilization system, as a MIMO multiloop multirate continuous-discrete system, specified in the form of an input–output model in the domain of discrete Laplace transform or in the form of a structural diagram. Approaches to the construction of equivalent T and NT single-rate models for MIMO multiloop multirate continuous-discrete systems are considered. Here, T is the largest common divisor of the sampling periods of the system, N is a natural number that is the smallest common multiple of the numbers characterizing the sampling periods of the system. The resulting impulse representations of the outputs of equivalent models are in the form of rational functions. The basis for the construction of these models is a matrix of sampling densities—a structural invariant of sampling chains. An example of the construction of the indicated matrix and an equivalent single-rate model are given. Obtaining equivalent single-rate models for MIMO multiloop multirate systems allows us to extend the methods of research and synthesis of MIMO continuous and continuous-discrete systems to a common theoretical base—the theory of polynomials and rational functions, which are typical elements of the description of these classes of systems.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Coverage path planning (CPP) is a field of study which objective is to find a path that covers every point of a certain area of interest. Recently, the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become more proficient in various applications such as surveillance, terrain coverage, mapping, natural disaster tracking, transport, and others. The aim of this paper is to design efficient coverage path planning collision-avoidance capable algorithms for single or multi UAV systems in cluttered urban environments. Two algorithms are developed and explored: one of them plans paths to cover a target zone delimited by a given perimeter with predefined coverage height and bandwidth, using a boustrophedon flight pattern, while the other proposed algorithm follows a set of predefined viewpoints, calculating a smooth path that ensures that the UAVs pass over the objectives. Both algorithms have been developed for a scalable number of UAVs, which fly in a triangular deformable leader-follower formation with the leader at its front. In the case of an even number of UAVs, there is no leader at the front of the formation and a virtual leader is used to plan the paths of the followers. The presented algorithms also have collision avoidance capabilities, powered by the Fast Marching Square algorithm. These algorithms are tested in various simulated urban and cluttered environments, and they prove capable of providing safe and smooth paths for the UAV formation in urban environments.

TI  - Joint UAVs’ Load Balancing and UEs’ Data Rate Fairness Optimization by Diffusion UAV Deployment Algorithm in Multi-UAV Networks

SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed as base stations (BSs) for emergency communications of user equipments (UEs) in 5G/6G networks. In multi-UAV communication networks, UAVs’ load balancing and UEs’ data rate fairness are two challenging problems and can be optimized by UAV deployment strategies. In this work, we found that these two problems are related by the same performance metric, which makes it possible to optimize the two problems simultaneously. To solve this joint optimization problem, we propose a UAV diffusion deployment algorithm based on the virtual force field method. Firstly, according to the unique performance metric, we define two new virtual forces, which are the UAV-UAV force and UE-UAV force defined by FU and FV, respectively. FV is the main contributor to load balancing and UEs’ data rate fairness, and FU contributes to fine tuning the UEs’ data rate fairness performance. Secondly, we propose a diffusion control stratedy to the update UAV-UAV force, which optimizes FV in a distributed manner. In this diffusion strategy, each UAV optimizes the local parameter by exchanging information with neighbor UAVs, which achieve global load balancing in a distributed manner. Thirdly, we adopt the successive convex optimization method to update FU, which is a non-convex problem. The resultant force of FV and FU is used to control the UAVs’ motion. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithm on UAVs’ load balancing and UEs’ data rate fairness.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Automation, including machine learning technologies, are becoming increasingly crucial in agriculture to increase productivity. Machine vision is one of the most popular parts of machine learning and has been widely used where advanced automation and control have been required. The trend has shifted from classical image processing and machine learning techniques to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) methods. Based on large training datasets and pre-trained models, DL-based methods have proven to be more accurate than previous traditional techniques. Machine vision has wide applications in agriculture, including the detection of weeds and pests in crops. Variation in lighting conditions, failures to transfer learning, and object occlusion constitute key challenges in this domain. Recently, DL has gained much attention due to its advantages in object detection, classification, and feature extraction. DL algorithms can automatically extract information from large amounts of data used to model complex problems and is, therefore, suitable for detecting and classifying weeds and crops. We present a systematic review of AI-based systems to detect weeds, emphasizing recent trends in DL. Various DL methods are discussed to clarify their overall potential, usefulness, and performance. This study indicates that several limitations obstruct the widespread adoption of AI/DL in commercial applications. Recommendations for overcoming these challenges are summarized.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate tags in anti-collision applications of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The integration of RFID technology in UAV-aided VANETs can provide reliable traffic-related services for vehicles. However, multiple tags’ simultaneous responses to a reader mounted on a UAV, denoted as tag collision, gravely affect the correct tag detection on each vehicle. Therefore, in order to decrease the collision probability and improve the throughput, we propose a multi-frequency tag identification method. In the proposed scheme, we devise a tag grouping method based on adaptive power control to make the reader dynamically match the optimal frame length. Based on the above matching results, we introduce a tag estimation method using the optimal weight to improve the accuracy of tag estimation. We theoretically analyze the closed-form expression of the security outage probability expression. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed tag anti-collision scheme achieved significant performance superiority in terms of the throughput and identification time slots.

TI  - Hierarchical Active Tracking Control for UAVs via Deep Reinforcement Learning

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Active tracking control is essential for UAVs to perform autonomous operations in GPS-denied environments. In the active tracking task, UAVs take high-dimensional raw images as input and execute motor actions to actively follow the dynamic target. Most research focuses on three-stage methods, which entail perception first, followed by high-level decision-making based on extracted spatial information of the dynamic target, and then UAV movement control, using a low-level dynamic controller. Perception methods based on deep neural networks are powerful but require considerable effort for manual ground truth labeling. Instead, we unify the perception and decision-making stages using a high-level controller and then leverage deep reinforcement learning to learn the mapping from raw images to the high-level action commands in the V-REP-based environment, where simulation data are infinite and inexpensive. This end-to-end method also has the advantages of a small parameter size and reduced effort requirements for parameter turning in the decision-making stage. The high-level controller, which has a novel architecture, explicitly encodes the spatial and temporal features of the dynamic target. Auxiliary segmentation and motion-in-depth losses are introduced to generate denser training signals for the high-level controller’s fast and stable training. The high-level controller and a conventional low-level PID controller constitute our hierarchical active tracking control framework for the UAVs’ active tracking task. Simulation experiments show that our controller trained with several augmentation techniques sufficiently generalizes dynamic targets with random appearances and velocities, and achieves significantly better performance, compared with three-stage methods.

AB  - In view of the demand of location awareness in a special complex environment, for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multi base-station semi-passive positioning system, the hybrid positioning solutions and optimized site layout in the positioning system can effectively improve the positioning accuracy for a specific region. In this paper, the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) formula of a time difference of arrival (TDOA) and angles of arrival (AOA) hybrid location algorithm is deduced. Mayfly optimization algorithm (MOA) which is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm is introduced, and a method to find the optimal station of the UAV airborne multiple base station’s semi-passive positioning system using MOA is proposed. The simulation and analysis of the optimization of the different number of base stations, compared with other station layout methods, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. MOA is less likely to fall into local optimum, and the error of regional target positioning is reduced. By simulating the deployment of four base stations and five base stations in various situations, MOA can achieve a better deployment effect. The dynamic station configuration capability of the multi-station semi-passive positioning system has been improved with the UAV.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Recent advancements in the field of machine learning (ML) provide opportunity to conduct research on autonomous devices for a variety of applications. Intelligent decision-making is a critical task for self-driving systems. An attempt is made in this study to use a deep learning (DL) approach for the early detection of road cracks, potholes, and the yellow lane. The accuracy is not sufficient after training with the default model. To enhance accuracy, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 13 convolutional layers, a softmax layer as an output layer, and two fully connected layers (FCN) are constructed. In order to achieve the deeper propagation and to prevent saturation in the training phase, mish activation is employed in the first 12 layers with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. The upgraded CNN model performs better than the default CNN model in terms of accuracy. For the varied situation, a revised and enriched dataset for road cracks, potholes, and the yellow lane is created. The yellow lane is detected and tracked in order to move the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomously by following yellow lane. After identifying a yellow lane, the UAV performs autonomous navigation while concurrently detecting road cracks and potholes using the robot operating system within the UAV. The performance model is benchmarked using performance measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, F1-score, F2-score, and dice-coefficient, which demonstrate that the suggested technique produces better outcomes.

Moreover, the number of new startups with the denomination of service robots nowadays constitutes 29% of the total amount of robotic companies recorded in the United States. Those data, among other similar figures, remark the need for formal development in the service robots area, including knowledge transfer and literature reviews. Furthermore, the COVID-19 spread accelerated business units and some research groups to invest time and effort into the field of service robotics. Therefore, this research work intends to contribute to the formalization of service robots as an area of robotics, presenting a systematic review of scientific literature.

AB  - In this study, an effective local minima detection and definition algorithm is introduced for a mobile robot navigating through unknown static environments. Furthermore, five approaches are presented and compared with the popular approach wall-following to pull the robot out of the local minima enclosure namely; Random Virtual Target, Reflected Virtual Target, Global Path Backtracking, Half Path Backtracking, and Local Path Backtracking. The proposed approaches mainly depend on changing the target location temporarily to avoid the original target&rsquo;s attraction force effect on the robot. Moreover, to avoid getting trapped in the same location, a virtual obstacle is placed to cover the local minima enclosure. To include the most common shapes of deadlock situations, the proposed approaches were evaluated in four different environments; V-shaped, double U-shaped, C-shaped, and cluttered environments. The results reveal that the robot, using any of the proposed approaches, requires fewer steps to reach the destination, ranging from 59 to 73 m on average, as opposed to the wall-following strategy, which requires an average of 732 m. On average, the robot with a constant speed and reflected virtual target approach takes 103 s, whereas the identical robot with a wall-following approach takes 907 s to complete the tasks. Using a fuzzy-speed robot, the duration for the wall-following approach is greatly reduced to 507 s, while the reflected virtual target may only need up to 20% of that time. More results and detailed comparisons are embedded in the subsequent sections.

AB  - Traffic density around the globe is increasing on a day-to-day basis, resulting in more accidents, congestion, and pollution. The dynamic vehicular environment induces challenges in designing an efficient and reliable protocol for communication. Timely delivery of safety and non-safety messages is necessary for traffic congestion control and for avoiding road mishaps. For efficient resource sharing and optimized channel utilization, the media access control (MAC) protocol plays a vital role. An efficient MAC protocol design can provide fair channel access and can delay constraint safety message dissemination, improving road safety. This paper reviews the applications, characteristics, and challenges faced in the design of MAC protocols. A classification of the MAC protocol is presented based on contention mechanisms and channel access. The classification based on contention is oriented as contention-based, contention-free, and hybrid, whereas the classification based on channel access is categorized as distributed, centralized, cluster-based, cooperative, token-based, and random access. These are further sub-classified as single-channel and multi-channel, based on the type of channel resources they utilize. This paper gives an analysis of the objectives, mechanisms, advantages/disadvantages, and simulators used in specified protocols. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on the future scope and open challenges for improving the MAC protocol design.

SN  - 2571-5577

AB  - Recently, the lack of expansion joint gaps on highway bridges in Korea has been increasing. In particular, with the increase in the number of days during the summer heatwave, the narrowing of the expansion joint gap causes symptoms such as expansion joint damage and pavement blow-up, which threaten traffic safety and structural safety. Therefore, in this study, we developed a machine vision (M/V)-technique-based inspection system that can monitor the expansion joint gap through image analysis while driving at high speed (100 km/h), replacing the current manual method that uses an inspector to inspect the expansion joint gap. To fix the error factors of image analysis that happened during the trial application, a machine learning method was used to improve the accuracy of measuring the gap between the expansion joint device. As a result, the expansion gap identification accuracy was improved by 27.5%, from 67.5% to 95.0%, and the use of the system reduces the survey time by more than 95%, from an average of approximately 1 h/bridge (existing manual inspection method) to approximately 3 min/bridge. We assume, in the future, maintenance practitioners can contribute to preventive maintenance that prepares countermeasures before problems occur.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The rice-crayfish field (i.e., RCF), a newly emerging rice cultivation pattern, has greatly expanded in China in the last decade due to its significant ecological and economic benefits. The spatial distribution of RCFs is an important dataset for crop planting pattern adjustment, water resource management and yield estimation. Here, an object- and topology-based analysis (OTBA) method, which considers spectral-spatial features and the topological relationship between paddy fields and their enclosed ditches, was proposed to identify RCFs. First, we employed an object-based method to extract crayfish breeding ditches using very high-resolution images. Subsequently, the paddy fields that provide fodder for crayfish were identified according to the topological relationship between the paddy field and circumjacent crayfish ditch. The extracted ditch objects together with those paddy fields were merged to derive the final RCFs. The performance of the OTBA method was carefully evaluated using the RCF and non-RCF samples. Moreover, the effects of different spatial resolutions, spectral bands and temporal information on RCF identification were comprehensively investigated. Our results suggest the OTBA method performed well in extracting RCFs, with an overall accuracy of 91.77%. Although the mapping accuracies decreased as the image spatial resolution decreased, satisfactory RCF mapping results (&gt;80%) can be achieved at spatial resolutions greater than 2 m. Additionally, we demonstrated that the mapping accuracy can be improved by more than 10% when near-infrared (NIR) band information was involved, indicating the necessity of the NIR band when selecting images to derive reliable RCF maps. Furthermore, the images acquired in the rice growth phase are recommended to maximize the differences of spectral characteristics between paddy fields and ditches. These promising findings suggest that the OTBA approach performs well for mapping RCFs in areas with fragmented agricultural landscapes, which provides fundamental information for further agricultural land use and water resources management.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can play a key role in meeting certain demands of cellular networks. UAVs can be used not only as user equipment (UE) in cellular networks but also as mobile base stations (BSs) wherein they can either augment conventional BSs by adapting their position to serve the changing traffic and connectivity demands or temporarily replace BSs that are damaged due to natural disasters. The flexibility of UAVs allows them to provide coverage to UEs in hot-spots, at cell-edges, in coverage holes, or regions with scarce cellular infrastructure. In this work, we study how UAV locations and other cellular parameters may be optimized in such scenarios to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) of the network. We compare the performance of machine learning (ML) techniques with conventional optimization approaches. We found that, on an average, a double deep Q learning approach can achieve 93.46% of the optimal median SE and 95.83% of the optimal mean SE. A simple greedy approach, which tunes the parameters of each BS and UAV independently, performed very well in all the cases that we tested. These computationally efficient approaches can be utilized to enhance the network performance in existing cellular networks.

AB  - Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have gained widespread interest in civilian and military applications, which has led to the development of novel UAVs that can perform various operations. UAVs are aircraft that can fly without the need of a human pilot onboard, meaning they can fly either autonomously or be remotely piloted. They can be equipped with multiple sensors, including cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), LiDAR, and GPS, to collect and transmit data in real time. Due to the demand for UAVs in various applications such as precision agriculture, search and rescue, wireless communications, and surveillance, several types of UAVs have been invented with different specifications for their size, weight, range and endurance, engine type, and configuration. Because of this variety, the design process and analysis are based on the type of UAV, with the availability of several control techniques that could be used to improve the flight of the UAV in order to avoid obstacles and potential collisions, as well as find the shortest path to save the battery life with the support of optimization techniques. However, UAVs face several challenges in order to fly smoothly, including collision avoidance, battery life, and intruders. This review paper presents UAVs&rsquo; classification, control applications, and future directions in industry and research interest. For the design process, fabrication, and analysis, various control approaches are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the challenges for UAVs, including battery charging, collision avoidance, and security, are also presented and discussed.

AB  - Several cities have recently moved towards becoming smart cities for better services and quality of life for residents and visitors, with: optimized resource utilization; increased environmental protection; enhanced infrastructure operations and maintenance; and strong safety and security measures. Smart cities depend on deploying current and new technologies and different optimization methods to enhance services and performance in their different sectors. Some of the technologies assisting smart city applications are the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing, and cloud computing. Integrating these three to serve one system (we will refer to it as integrated IoT-fog-cloud system (iIFC)) creates an advanced platform to develop and operate various types of smart city applications. This platform will allow applications to use the best features from the IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud services to deliver best capabilities and performance. Utilizing this powerful platform will provide many opportunities for enhancing and optimizing applications in energy, transportation, healthcare, and other areas. In this paper we survey various applications of iIFCs for smart cities. We identify different common issues associated with utilizing iIFCs for smart city applications. These issues arise due to the characteristics of iIFCs on the one side and the requirements of different smart city applications on the other. In addition, we outline the main requirements to effectively utilize iIFCs for smart city applications. These requirements are related to optimization, networking, and security.

AB  - The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as base station (BS) is gaining popularity. In this paper, we consider maximization of the overall data rate by intelligent deployment of UAV BS in the downlink of a cellular system. We investigate a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided approach to optimize the position of flying BSs mounted on board UAVs to support a macro BS (MBS). We propose an algorithm to avoid collision between multiple UAVs undergoing exploratory movements and to restrict UAV BSs movement within a predefined area. Q-learning technique is used to optimize UAV BS position, where the reward is equal to sum of user equipment (UE) data rates. We consider a framework where the UAV BSs carry out exploratory movements in the beginning and exploitary movements in later stages to maximize the overall data rate. Our results show that a cellular system with three UAV BSs and one MBS serving 72 UE reaches 69.2% of the best possible data rate, which is identified by brute force search. Finally, the RL algorithm is compared with a K-means algorithm to study the need of accurate UE locations. Our results show that the RL algorithm outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm when the measure of imperfection is higher. The proposed algorithm can be made use of by a practical MBS&ndash;UAV BSs&ndash;UEs system to provide protection to UAV BSs while maximizing data rate.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays a more and more important role in Internet of Things (IoT) for remote sensing and device interconnecting. Due to the limitation of computing capacity and energy, the UAV cannot handle complex tasks. Recently, computation offloading provides a promising way for the UAV to handle complex tasks by deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods. However, existing DRL-based computation offloading methods merely protect usage pattern privacy and location privacy. In this paper, we consider a new privacy issue in UAV-assisted IoT, namely computation offloading preference leakage, which lacks through study. To cope with this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserving online computation offloading method for UAV-assisted IoT. Our method integrates the differential privacy mechanism into deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which can protect UAV&rsquo;s offloading preference. We provide the formal analysis on security and utility loss of our method. Extensive real-world experiments are conducted. Results demonstrate that, compared with baseline methods, our method can learn cost-efficient computation offloading policy without preference leakage and a priori knowledge of the wireless channel model.

AB  - Object counting is an active research area that gained more attention in the past few years. In smart cities, vehicle counting plays a crucial role in urban planning and management of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to address this problem. However, the resulting detection accuracy is still not adequate. This paper proposes an efficient approach that uses deep learning concepts and correlation filters for multi-object counting and tracking. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using a dataset consisting of 16 videos with different features to examine the impact of object density, image quality, angle of view, and speed of motion towards system accuracy. Performance evaluation exhibits promising results in normal traffic scenarios and adverse weather conditions. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms the performance of two recent approaches from the literature.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The problem of velocity tracking is considered essential in the consensus of multi-wheeled mobile robot systems to minimise the total operating time and enhance the system&rsquo;s energy efficiency. This study presents a novel switched-system approach, consisting of bang-bang control and consensus formation algorithms, to address the problem of time-optimal velocity tracking of multiple wheeled mobile robots with nonholonomic constraints. This effort aims to achieve the desired velocity formation in the least time for any initial velocity conditions in a multiple mobile robot system. The main findings of this study are as follows: (i) by deriving the equation of motion along the specified path, the motor&rsquo;s extremal conditions for a time-optimal trajectory are introduced; (ii) utilising a general consensus formation algorithm, the desired velocity formation is achieved; (iii) applying the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, the new switching formation matrix of weights is obtained. Using this new switching matrix of weights guarantees that at least one of the system&rsquo;s motors, of either the followers or the leader, reaches its maximum or minimum value by using extremals, which enables the multi-robot system to reach the velocity formation in the least time. The proposed approach is verified in a theoretical analysis along with the numerical simulation process. The simulation results demonstrated that using the proposed switched system, the time-optimal consensus algorithm behaved very well in the networks with different numbers of robots and different topology conditions. The required time for the consensus formation is dramatically reduced, which is very promising. The findings of this work could be extended to and beneficial for any multi-wheeled mobile robot system.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Developing efficient communication between vehicles and everything (V2X) is a challenging task, mainly due to the characteristics of vehicular networks, which include rapid topology changes, large-scale sizes, and frequent link disconnections. This article proposes a deep learning model to enhance V2X communication. Various channel conditions such as interference, channel noise, and path loss affect the communication between a vehicle (V) and everything (X). Thus, the proposed model aims to determine the required optimum interference power to enhance connectivity, comply with the quality of service (QoS) constraints, and improve the communication link reliability. The proposed model fulfills the best QoS in terms of four metrics, namely, achievable data rate (Rb), packet delivery ratio (PDR), packet loss rate (PLR), and average end-to-end delay (E2E). The factors to be considered are the distribution and density of vehicles, average length, and minimum safety distance between vehicles. A mathematical formulation of the optimum required interference power is presented to achieve the given objectives as a constrained optimization problem, and accordingly, the proposed deep learning model is trained. The obtained results show the ability of the proposed model to enhance the connectivity between V2X for improving road traffic information efficiency and increasing road traffic safety.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Tree Characterization in Urban Areas: A Review
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 23
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services (ES), including temperature regulation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. Interest in ES has increased amongst policymakers, scientists, and citizens given the extent and growth of urbanized areas globally. However, the methods and techniques used to properly assess biodiversity and ES provided by vegetation in urban environments, at large scales, are insufficient. Individual tree identification and characterization are some of the most critical issues used to evaluate urban biodiversity and ES, given the complex spatial distribution of vegetation in urban areas and the scarcity or complete lack of systematized urban tree inventories at large scales, e.g., at the regional or national levels. This often limits our knowledge on their contributions toward shaping biodiversity and ES in urban areas worldwide. This paper provides an analysis of the state-of-the-art studies and was carried out based on a systematic review of 48 scientific papers published during the last five years (2016&ndash;2020), related to urban tree and greenery characterization, remote sensing techniques for tree identification, processing methods, and data analysis to classify and segment trees. In particular, we focused on urban tree and forest characterization using remotely sensed data and identified frontiers in scientific knowledge that may be expanded with new developments in the near future. We found advantages and limitations associated with both data sources and processing methods, from which we drew recommendations for further development of tree inventory and characterization in urban forestry science. Finally, a critical discussion on the current state of the methods, as well as on the challenges and directions for future research, is presented.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 24
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - As a data-driven approach, deep learning requires a large amount of annotated data for training to obtain a sufficiently accurate and generalized model, especially in the field of computer vision. However, when compared with generic object recognition datasets, aerial image datasets are more challenging to acquire and more expensive to label. Obtaining a large amount of high-quality aerial image data for object recognition and image understanding is an urgent problem. Existing studies show that synthetic data can effectively reduce the amount of training data required. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first synthetic aerial image dataset for ship recognition, called UnityShip. This dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic images and 194,054 ship instances, including 79 different ship models in ten categories and six different large virtual scenes with different time periods, weather environments, and altitudes. The annotations include environmental information, instance-level horizontal bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and the type and ID of each ship. This provides the basis for object detection, oriented object detection, fine-grained recognition, and scene recognition. To investigate the applications of UnityShip, the synthetic data were validated for model pre-training and data augmentation using three different object detection algorithms and six existing real-world ship detection datasets. Our experimental results show that for small-sized and medium-sized real-world datasets, the synthetic data achieve an improvement in model pre-training and data augmentation, showing the value and potential of synthetic data in aerial image recognition and understanding tasks.

AB  - Modern cities require a tighter integration with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for bringing new services to the citizens. The Smart City is the revolutionary paradigm aiming at integrating the ICT with the citizen life; among several urban services, transports are one of the most important in modern cities, introducing several challenges to the Smart City paradigm. In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of new vehicular applications and services, Edge Computing (EC) is one of the most promising technologies when integrated into the Vehicular Networks (VNs). EC-enabled VNs can facilitate new latency-critical and data-intensive applications and services. However, ground-based EC platforms (i.e., Road Side Units&mdash;RSUs, 5G Base Stations&mdash;5G BS) can only serve a reduced number of Vehicular Users (VUs), due to short coverage ranges and resource shortage. In the recent past, several new aerial platforms with integrated EC facilities have been deployed for achieving global connectivity. Such air-based EC platforms can complement the ground-based EC facilities for creating a futuristic VN able to deploy several new applications and services. The goal of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a novel joint air-ground EC platform within a VN architecture for helping VUs with new intelligent applications and services. By exploiting most modern technologies, with particular attention towards network softwarization, vehicular edge computing, and machine learning, we propose here three possible layered air-ground EC-enabled VN scenarios. For each of the discussed scenarios, a list of the possible challenges is considered, as well possible solutions allowing to overcome all or some of the considered challenges. A proper comparison is also done, through the use of tables, where all the proposed scenarios, and the proposed solutions, are discussed.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming integrated into a wide range of modern IoT applications. The growing number of networked IoT devices generates a large amount of data. However, processing and memorizing this massive volume of data at local nodes have been deemed critical challenges, especially when using artificial intelligence (AI) systems to extract and exploit valuable information. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a way to bring cloud computing (CC) processes within reach of users, to address computation-intensive offloading and latency issues. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the most relevant research works related to UAV technology applications in terms of enabled or assisted MEC architectures. It details the utility of UAV-enabled MEC architecture regarding emerging IoT applications and the role of both deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in meeting various limitations related to latency, task offloading, energy demand, and security. Furthermore, throughout this article, the reader gains an insight into the future of UAV-enabled MEC, the advantages and the critical challenges to be tackled when using AI.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) clusters usually face problems such as complex environments, heterogeneous combat subjects, and realistic interference factors in the course of mission assignment. In order to reduce resource consumption and improve the task execution rate, it is very important to develop a reasonable allocation plan for the tasks. Therefore, this paper constructs a heterogeneous UAV multitask assignment model based on several realistic constraints and proposes an improved half-random Q-learning (HR Q-learning) algorithm. The algorithm is based on the Q-learning algorithm under reinforcement learning, and by changing the way the Q-learning algorithm selects the next action in the process of random exploration, the probability of obtaining an invalid action in the random case is reduced, and the exploration efficiency is improved, thus increasing the possibility of obtaining a better assignment scheme, this also ensures symmetry and synergy in the distribution process of the drones. Simulation experiments show that compared with Q-learning algorithm and other heuristic algorithms, HR Q-learning algorithm can improve the performance of task execution, including the ability to improve the rationality of task assignment, increasing the value of gains by 12.12%, this is equivalent to an average of one drone per mission saved, and higher success rate of task execution. This improvement provides a meaningful attempt for UAV task assignment.

AB  - It is imperative to find new places other than Earth for the survival of human beings. Mars could be the alternative to Earth in the future for us to live. In this context, many missions have been performed to examine the planet Mars. For such missions, planetary precision landing is a major challenge for the precise landing on Mars. Mars landing consists of different phases (hypersonic entry, parachute descent, terminal descent comprising gravity turn, and powered descent). However, the focus of this work is the powered descent phase of landing. Firstly, the main objective of this study is to minimize the landing error during the powered descend landing phase. The second objective involves constrained optimization in a predictive control framework for landing at non-cooperative sites. Different control algorithms like PID and LQR have been developed for the stated problem; however, the predictive control algorithm with constraint handling&rsquo;s ability has not been explored much. This research discusses the Model Predictive Control algorithm for the powered descent phase of landing. Model Predictive Control (MPC) considers input/output constraints in the calculation of the control law and thus it is very useful for the stated problem as shown in the results. The main novelty of this work is the implementation of Explicit MPC, which gives comparatively less computational time than MPC. A comparison is done among MPC variants in terms of feasibility, constraints handling, and computational time. Moreover, other conventional control algorithms like PID and LQR are compared with the proposed predictive algorithm. These control algorithms are implemented on quadrotor UAV (which emulates the dynamics of a planetary lander) to verify the feasibility through simulations in MATLAB.

AB  - Air-ground coordination systems are usually composed of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGV). In such a system, UAVs can utilize their much more perceptive information to plan the path for UGVs. However, the correctness and accuracy of the planned route are often not guaranteed, and the communication and computation burdens increase with more sophisticated algorithms. This paper proposes a new type of air-ground coordination framework to enable UAVs intervention into UGVs tasks. An event-triggered mechanism in the null space behavior control (NSBC) framework is proposed to decide if an intervention is necessary and the timing of the intervention. Then, the problem of whether to accept the intervention is formulated as an integer programming problem and is solved using model predictive control (MPC). Simulation results show that the UAV can intervene in UGVs accurately and on time, and the UGVs can effectively decide whether to accept the intervention to get rid of troubles, thereby improving the intelligence of the air-ground coordination system.

SN  - 2077-1312

AB  - A novel collision avoidance (CA) algorithm was proposed based on the modified artificial potential field (APF) method, to construct a practical ship automatic CA system. Considering the constraints of both the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) and the motion characteristics of the ship, the multi-ship CA algorithm was realized by modifying the repulsive force model in the APF method. Furthermore, the distance from the closest point of approach-time to the closest point of approach (DCPA-TCPA) criterion was selected as the unique adjustable parameter from the perspective of navigation practice. Collaborative CA experiments were designed and conducted to validate the proposed algorithm. The results of the experiments revealed that the actual DCPA and TCPA agree well with the parameter setup that keeps the ship at a safe distance from other ships in complex encountering situations. Consequently, the algorithm proposed in this study can achieve efficient automatic CA with minimal parameter settings. Moreover, the navigators can easily accept and comprehend the adjustable parameters, enabling the algorithm to satisfy the demand of the engineering applications.

SN  - 2075-1702

AB  - One of the main challenges of maneuvering an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to keep a stabilized flight is dealing with its fast and highly coupled nonlinear dynamics. There are several solutions in the literature, but most of them require fine-tuning of the parameters. In order to avoid the exhaustive tuning procedures, this work employs a Fuzzy Logic strategy for online tuning of the PID gains of the UAV motion controller. A Cascaded-PID scheme is proposed, in which velocity commands are calculated and sent to the flight control unit from a given target desired position (waypoint). Therefore, the flight control unit is responsible for the lower control loop. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it can be applied to any UAV without the need of its formal mathematical model. Robot Operating System (ROS) is used to integrate the proposed system and the flight control unit. The solution was evaluated through flight tests and simulations, which were conducted using Unreal Engine 4 with the Microsoft AirSim plugin. In the simulations, the proposed method is compared with the traditional Ziegler-Nichols tuning method, another Fuzzy Logic approach, and the ArduPilot built-in PID controller. The simulation results show that the proposed method, compared to the ArduPilot controller, drives the UAV to reach the desired setpoint faster. When compared to Ziegler-Nichols and another different Fuzzy Logic approach, the proposed method demonstrates to provide a faster accommodation and yield smaller errors amplitudes.

AB  - In the event of a maritime accident, surveying the maximum area efficiently in the least amount of time is crucial for rescuing survivors. Increasingly, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being used in search and rescue operations. This study proposes a method to generate a search path that covers all generated nodes in the shortest amount of time with multiple heterogeneous UAVs. The proposed model, which is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model based on a hexagonal grid-based decomposition method, was verified through a simulation analysis based on the performance of an actual UAV. This study presents both the optimization technique&rsquo;s calculation time as a function of the search area size and the various UAV routes derived as the search area grows. The results of this study can have wide-ranging applications for emergency search and rescue operations.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted cellular networks over the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band can meet the requirements of a high data rate and flexible coverage in next-generation communication networks. However, higher propagation loss and the use of a large number of antennas in mmWave networks give rise to high energy consumption and UAVs are constrained by their low-capacity onboard battery. Energy harvesting (EH) is a viable solution to reduce the energy cost of UAV-enabled mmWave networks. However, the random nature of renewable energy makes it challenging to maintain robust connectivity in UAV-assisted terrestrial cellular networks. Energy cooperation allows UAVs to send their excessive energy to other UAVs with reduced energy. In this paper, we propose a power allocation algorithm based on energy harvesting and energy cooperation to maximize the throughput of a UAV-assisted mmWave cellular network. Since there is channel-state uncertainty and the amount of harvested energy can be treated as a stochastic process, we propose an optimal multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DRL) named Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) to solve the renewable energy resource allocation problem for throughput maximization. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the Random Power (RP), Maximal Power (MP) and value-based Deep Q-Learning (DQL) algorithms in terms of network throughput.

AB  - Video object and human action detection are applied in many fields, such as video surveillance, face recognition, etc. Video object detection includes object classification and object location within the frame. Human action recognition is the detection of human actions. Usually, video detection is more challenging than image detection, since video frames are often more blurry than images. Moreover, video detection often has other difficulties, such as video defocus, motion blur, part occlusion, etc. Nowadays, the video detection technology is able to implement real-time detection, or high-accurate detection of blurry video frames. In this paper, various video object and human action detection approaches are reviewed and discussed, many of them have performed state-of-the-art results. We mainly review and discuss the classic video detection methods with supervised learning. In addition, the frequently-used video object detection and human action recognition datasets are reviewed. Finally, a summarization of the video detection is represented, e.g., the video object and human action detection methods could be classified into frame-by-frame (frame-based) detection, extracting-key-frame detection and using-temporal-information detection; the methods of utilizing temporal information of adjacent video frames are mainly the optical flow method, Long Short-Term Memory and convolution among adjacent frames.

AB  - The road surface area extraction task is generally carried out via semantic segmentation over remotely-sensed imagery. However, this supervised learning task is often costly as it requires remote sensing images labelled at the pixel level, and the results are not always satisfactory (presence of discontinuities, overlooked connection points, or isolated road segments). On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require labelled data and can be employed for post-processing the geometries of geospatial objects extracted via semantic segmentation. In this work, we implement a conditional Generative Adversarial Network to reconstruct road geometries via deep inpainting procedures on a new dataset containing unlabelled road samples from challenging areas present in official cartographic support from Spain. The goal is to improve the initial road representations obtained with semantic segmentation models via generative learning. The performance of the model was evaluated on unseen data by conducting a metrical comparison where a maximum Intersection over Union (IoU) score improvement of 1.3% was observed when compared to the initial semantic segmentation result. Next, we evaluated the appropriateness of applying unsupervised generative learning using a qualitative perceptual validation to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method in very complex scenarios and gain a better intuition of the model&rsquo;s behaviour when performing large-scale post-processing with generative learning and deep inpainting procedures and observed important improvements in the generated data.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) propulsion technology is significantly related to the flight performance of UAVs, which has become one of the most important development directions of aviation. It should be noted that UAVs have three types of propulsion systems, namely the fuel, hybrid fuel-electric, and pure electric, respectively. This paper presents and discusses the classification, working principles, characteristics, and critical technologies of these three types of propulsion systems. It is helpful to establish the development framework of the UAV propulsion system and provide the essential information on electric propulsion UAVs. Additionally, future technologies and development, including the high-power density motors, converters, power supplies, are discussed for the electric propulsion UAVs. In the near future, the electric propulsion system would be widely used in UAVs. The high-power density system would become the development trend of electric UAVs. Thus, this review article provides comprehensive views and multiple comparisons of propulsion systems for UAVs.

AB  - In this work, a real-time collision avoidance algorithm was presented for autonomous navigation in the presence of fixed and moving obstacles in building environments. The current implementation is designed for autonomous navigation between waypoints of a predefined flight trajectory that would be performed by an UAV during tasks such as inspections or construction progress monitoring. It uses a simplified geometry generated from a point cloud of the scenario. In addition, it also employs information from 3D sensors to detect and position obstacles such as people or other UAVs, which are not registered in the original cloud. If an obstacle is detected, the algorithm estimates its motion and computes an evasion path considering the geometry of the environment. The method has been successfully tested in different scenarios, offering robust results in all avoidance maneuvers. Execution times were measured, demonstrating that the algorithm is computationally feasible to be implemented onboard an UAV.

AB  - The airfoil is the prime component of flying vehicles. For low-speed flights, low Reynolds number airfoils are used. The characteristic of low Reynolds number airfoils is a laminar separation bubble and an associated drag rise. This paper presents a framework for the design of a low Reynolds number airfoil. The contributions of the proposed research are twofold. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed for the aerodynamic coefficient prediction of low Reynolds number airfoils. Data generation is discussed in detail and XFOIL is selected to obtain aerodynamic coefficients. The performance of the CNN is evaluated using different learning rate schedulers and adaptive learning rate optimizers. The trained model can predict the aerodynamic coefficients with high accuracy. Second, the trained model is used with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for multi-objective optimization of the low Reynolds number airfoil at a specific angle of attack. A similar optimization is performed using NSGA-II directly calling XFOIL, to obtain the aerodynamic coefficients. The Pareto fronts of both optimizations are compared, and it is concluded that the proposed CNN can replicate the actual Pareto in considerably less time.

AB  - Recently, interest in mission autonomy related to Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles(UCAVs) for performing highly dangerous Air-to-Surface Missions(ASMs) has been increasing. Regarding autonomous mission planners, studies currently being conducted in this field have been mainly focused on creating a path from a macroscopic 2D environment to a dense target area or proposing a route for intercepting a target. For further improvement, this paper treats a mission planning algorithm on an ASM which can plan the path to the target dense area in consideration of threats spread in a 3D terrain environment while planning the shortest path to intercept multiple targets. To do so, ASMs are considered three sequential mission elements: ingress, intercept, and egress. The ingress and egress elements require a terrain flight path to penetrate deep into the enemy territory. Thus, the proposed terrain flight path planner generates a nap-of-the-earth path to avoid detection by enemy radar while avoiding enemy air defense threats. In the intercept element, the shortest intercept path planner based on the Dubins path concept combined with nonlinear programming is developed to minimize exposure time for survivability. Finally, the integrated ASM planner is applied to several mission scenarios and validated by simulations using a rotorcraft model.

AB  - Voltage regulation in distribution networks encounters a challenge of handling uncertainties caused by the high penetration of photovoltaics (PV). This research proposes an active exploration (AE) method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to respond to the uncertainties by regulating the voltage of a distribution network with battery energy storage systems (BESS). The proposed method integrates engineering knowledge to accelerate the training process of RL. The engineering knowledge is the chance-constrained optimization. We formulate the problem in a chance-constrained optimization with a linear load flow approximation. The optimization results are used to guide the action selection of the exploration for improving training efficiency and reducing the conserveness characteristic. The comparison of methods focuses on how BESSs are used, training efficiency, and robustness under varying uncertainties and BESS sizes. We implement the proposed algorithm, a chance-constrained optimization, and a traditional Q-learning in the IEEE 13 Node Test Feeder. Our evaluation shows that the proposed AE method has a better response to the training efficiency compared to traditional Q-learning. Meanwhile, the proposed method has advantages in BESS usage in conserveness compared to the chance-constrained optimization.

AB  - To control unmanned aerial systems, we rarely have a perfect system model. Safe and aggressive planning is also challenging for nonlinear and under-actuated systems. Expert pilots, however, demonstrate maneuvers that are deemed at the edge of plane envelope. Inspired by biological systems, in this paper, we introduce a framework that leverages methods in the field of control theory and reinforcement learning to generate feasible, possibly aggressive, trajectories. For the control policies, Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) imitate pilot-induced primitives, and DMPs are combined in parallel to generate trajectories to reach original or different goal points. The stability properties of DMPs and their overall systems are analyzed using contraction theory. For reinforcement learning, Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) was used for the maneuvers. The results in this paper show that PI2 updated policies are a feasible and parallel combination of different updated primitives transfer the learning in the contraction regions. Our proposed methodology can be used to imitate, reshape, and improve feasible, possibly aggressive, maneuvers. In addition, we can exploit trajectories generated by optimization methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), and a library of maneuvers can be instantly generated. For application, 3-DOF (degrees of freedom) Helicopter and 2D-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) models are utilized to demonstrate the main results.
