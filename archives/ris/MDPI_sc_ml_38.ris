AB  - The urban energy transition towards more sustainable energy production and consumption systems is at the top of the European Union political agenda. Several demonstration projects are dealing with the deep-energy retrofit of real-estate assets to show how technological and societal innovation can provide new investment opportunities while enhancing citizens&rsquo; quality of life by delivering multiple benefits. In this framework, the EU smart city project SINFONIA has developed and tested a new comprehensive framework to define, identify, and evaluate the main multiple benefits expected from similar initiatives. The present contribution reviews the three assessment exercises carried out in the lighthouse city of Bolzano during the project execution, consisting of an investigation of the users&rsquo; stated preferences, an evaluation of consumers&lsquo; revealed preferences and a multicriteria analysis of homeowners&rsquo; priorities. It offers an overview of the main achievements and sheds light on further investigatory paths applicable to Positive Energy Districts assessment.

AB  - The sustainable development of mankind is a matter of concern to the whole world. Environmental pollution and haze diffusion have greatly affected the sustainable development of mankind. According to previous research, vehicle exhaust emissions are an important source of environmental pollution and haze diffusion. The sharp increase in the number of cars has also made the supply of energy increasingly tight. In this paper, we have explored the use of intelligent navigation technology based on data analysis to reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on road networks. We have implemented a traffic flow prediction method using a genetic algorithm and particle-swarm-optimization-enhanced support vector regression, constructed a model for predicting vehicle exhaust emissions based on predicted road conditions and vehicle fuel consumption, and built our low-carbon-emission-oriented navigation algorithm based on a spatially optimized dynamic path planning algorithm. The results show that our method could help to significantly reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on the road network, which means that our method could contribute to the construction of low-carbon-emission intelligent transportation systems and smart cities.

AB  - Acoustic pollution has been associated with adverse effects on the health and life expectancy of people, especially when noise exposure happens during the nighttime. With over half of the world population living in urban areas, acoustic pollution is an important concern for city administrators, especially those focused on transportation and leisure noise. Advances in sensor and network technologies made the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) possible in cities, which, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), can enable smart services for their citizens. However, the creation of such services often requires structured environmental audio databases to train AI algorithms. This paper reports on an environmental audio dataset of 363 min and 53 s created in a lively area of the Barcelona city center, which targeted traffic and leisure events. This dataset, which is free and publicly available, can provide researchers with real-world acoustic data to help the development and testing of sound monitoring solutions for urban environments.

TI  - Big Data Analytics for Short and Medium-Term Electricity Load Forecasting Using an AI Techniques Ensembler
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 19
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Electrical load forecasting provides knowledge about future consumption and generation of electricity. There is a high level of fluctuation behavior between energy generation and consumption. Sometimes, the energy demand of the consumer becomes higher than the energy already generated, and vice versa. Electricity load forecasting provides a monitoring framework for future energy generation, consumption, and making a balance between them. In this paper, we propose a framework, in which deep learning and supervised machine learning techniques are implemented for electricity-load forecasting. A three-step model is proposed, which includes: feature selection, extraction, and classification. The hybrid of Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) is used to calculate features&rsquo; importance. The average feature importance of hybrid techniques selects the most relevant and high importance features in the feature selection method. The Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method is used to eliminate the irrelevant features in the feature extraction method. The load forecasting is performed with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a hybrid of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The meta-heuristic algorithms, i.e., Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Earth Worm Optimization (EWO) are applied to tune the hyper-parameters of SVM and CNN-GRU, respectively. The accuracy of our enhanced techniques CNN-GRU-EWO and SVM-GWO is 96.33% and 90.67%, respectively. Our proposed techniques CNN-GRU-EWO and SVM-GWO perform 7% and 3% better than the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA). In the end, a comparison with SOTA techniques is performed to show the improvement of the proposed techniques. This comparison showed that the proposed technique performs well and results in the lowest performance error rates and highest accuracy rates as compared to other techniques.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Nowadays, the need for wireless sensing applications is increasing. Along with the increased illegal cutting of logs in the forest, however, it requires the integration application to tackle the illegal logging and forest preservation. The wireless sensor network is a suitable network architecture for remotely monitoring or tracking applications in the environment. This paper proposed an integrated system that can identify and track the position of a moving cutting log. An Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi 3 B+, sound sensor, accelerometer sensor, LoRa GPS HAT Shield, and Outdoor LoRa Gateway OLG01 performed the hardware monitoring and tracking of the proposed system. The network of STAR topology configuration between master and slaves is represented by the LoRa Network embedded with the sensors, as an architecture of the wireless sensor network. The system was examined the performance of the network and the tracking process. The result determined that the LoRa can detect and identify the occurrence of the illegal cutting of logs in real-time. Meanwhile, in terms of the tracking performance, a duration of 5&ndash;46 s was required to track the new position of the moving cutting log.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the development of the next generation of information technology, an increasing amount of attention is being paid to smart residential spaces, including smart cities, smart buildings, and smart homes. Building indoor safety intelligence is an important research topic. However, current indoor safety management methods cannot comprehensively analyse safety data, owing to a poor combination of safety management and building information. Additionally, the judgement of danger depends significantly on the experience of the safety management staff. In this study, digital twins (DTs) are introduced to building indoor safety management. A framework for an indoor safety management system based on DT is proposed which exploits the Internet of Things (IoT), building information modelling (BIM), the Internet, and support vector machines (SVMs) to improve the level of intelligence for building indoor safety management. A DT model (DTM) is developed using BIM integrated with operation information collected by IoT sensors. The trained SVM model is used to automatically obtain the types and levels of danger by processing the data in the DTM. The Internet is a medium for interactions between people and systems. A building in the bobsleigh and sled stadium for the Beijing Winter Olympics is considered as an example; the proposed system realises the functions of the scene display of the operation status, danger warning and positioning, danger classification and level assessment, and danger handling suggestions.

SN  - 2227-9709

AB  - The concept of edge caching provision in emerging 5G and beyond mobile networks is a promising method to deal both with the traffic congestion problem in the core network, as well as reducing latency to access popular content. In that respect, end user demand for popular content can be satisfied by proactively caching it at the network edge, i.e., at close proximity to the users. In addition to model-based caching schemes, learning-based edge caching optimizations have recently attracted significant attention, and the aim hereafter is to capture these recent advances for both model-based and data-driven techniques in the area of proactive caching. This paper summarizes the utilization of deep learning for data caching in edge network. We first outline the typical research topics in content caching and formulate a taxonomy based on network hierarchical structure. Then, many key types of deep learning algorithms are presented, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning. Furthermore, a comparison of state-of-the-art literature is provided from the aspects of caching topics and deep learning methods. Finally, we discuss research challenges and future directions of applying deep learning for caching.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - 5G networks and Internet of Things (IoT) offer a powerful platform for ubiquitous environments with their ubiquitous sensing, high speeds and other benefits. The data, analytics, and other computations need to be optimally moved and placed in these environments, dynamically, such that energy-efficiency and QoS demands are best satisfied. A particular challenge in this context is to preserve privacy and security while delivering quality of service (QoS) and energy-efficiency. Many works have tried to address these challenges but without a focus on optimizing all of them and assuming fixed models of environments and security threats. This paper proposes the UbiPriSEQ framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to adaptively, dynamically, and holistically optimize QoS, energy-efficiency, security, and privacy. UbiPriSEQ is built on a three-layered model and comprises two modules. UbiPriSEQ devises policies and makes decisions related to important parameters including local processing and offloading rates for data and computations, radio channel states, transmit power, task priority, and selection of fog nodes for offloading, data migration, and so forth. UbiPriSEQ is implemented in Python over the TensorFlow platform and is evaluated using a real-life application in terms of SINR, privacy metric, latency, and utility function, manifesting great promise.

TI  - Trusted Decision-Making: Data Governance for Creating Trust in Data Science Decision Outcomes
T2  - Administrative Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
SN  - 2076-3387

AB  - Organizations are increasingly introducing data science initiatives to support decision-making. However, the decision outcomes of data science initiatives are not always used or adopted by decision-makers, often due to uncertainty about the quality of data input. It is, therefore, not surprising that organizations are increasingly turning to data governance as a means to improve the acceptance of data science decision outcomes. In this paper, propositions will be developed to understand the role of data governance in creating trust in data science decision outcomes. Two explanatory case studies in the asset management domain are analyzed to derive boundary conditions. The first case study is a data science project designed to improve the efficiency of road management through predictive maintenance, and the second case study is a data science project designed to detect fraudulent usage of electricity in medium and low voltage electrical grids without infringing privacy regulations. The duality of technology is used as our theoretical lens to understand the interactions between the organization, decision-makers, and technology. The results show that data science decision outcomes are more likely to be accepted if the organization has an established data governance capability. Data governance is also needed to ensure that organizational conditions of data science are met, and that incurred organizational changes are managed efficiently. These results imply that a mature data governance capability is required before sufficient trust can be placed in data science decision outcomes for decision-making.

PY  - 2020

IS  - 10
SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Predicting dam inflow is necessary for effective water management. This study created machine learning algorithms to predict the amount of inflow into the Soyang River Dam in South Korea, using weather and dam inflow data for 40 years. A total of six algorithms were used, as follows: decision tree (DT), multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), recurrent neural network&ndash;long short-term memory (RNN&ndash;LSTM), and convolutional neural network&ndash;LSTM (CNN&ndash;LSTM). Among these models, the multilayer perceptron model showed the best results in predicting dam inflow, with the Nash&ndash;Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) value of 0.812, root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 77.218 m3/s, mean absolute error (MAE) of 29.034 m3/s, correlation coefficient (R) of 0.924, and determination coefficient (R2) of 0.817. However, when the amount of dam inflow is below 100 m3/s, the ensemble models (random forest and gradient boosting models) performed better than MLP for the prediction of dam inflow. Therefore, two combined machine learning (CombML) models (RF_MLP and GB_MLP) were developed for the prediction of the dam inflow using the ensemble methods (RF and GB) at precipitation below 16 mm, and the MLP at precipitation above 16 mm. The precipitation of 16 mm is the average daily precipitation at the inflow of 100 m3/s or more. The results show the accuracy verification results of NSE 0.857, RMSE 68.417 m3/s, MAE 18.063 m3/s, R 0.927, and R2 0.859 in RF_MLP, and NSE 0.829, RMSE 73.918 m3/s, MAE 18.093 m3/s, R 0.912, and R2 0.831 in GB_MLP, which infers that the combination of the models predicts the dam inflow the most accurately. CombML algorithms showed that it is possible to predict inflow through inflow learning, considering flow characteristics such as flow regimes, by combining several machine learning algorithms.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - According to the United Nations, 70% of the world&rsquo;s population will live in cities by 2050. This growth will be reflected in the demand for better services that should be adjusted to the collective and individual needs of the population. Governments and organizations are working on defining and implementing strategies that will enable them to respond to these challenges. The main challenges are related to transport and its management, considering transportation as a core issue in the economy, sustainability, and development of the regions. In this way, the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) play a key role in the response to these scenarios, being that they are the framework where the new hardware and software tools are integrated, allowing an efficient development of transportation systems management, attending to aspects such as: traffic management, communications between vehicles and infrastructures, and security, among others. Nevertheless, the concept of ITS evolves rapidly so it is necessary to understand its evolution. To do that, the current research develops a thematic analysis of ITS in literature, evaluating the intellectual structure and its evolution using SciMAT, quantifying the main bibliometric performance indicators, and identifying the main research areas, authors, journals, and countries. To this purpose, the publications related to ITS from 1993 to 2019 available in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection were retrieved (7649 publications) and analyzed. Finally, one of the main results is the latest research themes map of ITS, considering its intellectual structure, evolution, and relationship. It assists in the definition and implementation of strategies, the identification of the scientific, academic, and business opportunities, and future research lines to consolidate the role of ITS in the new city models.

AB  - Real-time automatic identification of audio distress signals in urban areas is a task that in a smart city can improve response times in emergency alert systems. The main challenge in this problem lies in finding a model that is able to accurately recognize these type of signals in the presence of background noise and allows for real-time processing. In this paper, we present the design of a portable and low-cost device for accurate audio distress signal recognition in real urban scenarios based on deep learning models. As real audio distress recordings in urban areas have not been collected and made publicly available so far, we first constructed a database where audios were recorded in urban areas using a low-cost microphone. Using this database, we trained a deep multi-headed 2D convolutional neural network that processed temporal and frequency features to accurately recognize audio distress signals in noisy environments with a significant performance improvement to other methods from the literature. Then, we deployed and assessed the trained convolutional neural network model on a Raspberry Pi that, along with the low-cost microphone, constituted a device for accurate real-time audio recognition. Source code and database are publicly available.

AB  - This publication describes an innovative approach to voice control of operational and technical functions in a real Smart Home (SH) environment, where, for voice control within SH, it is necessary to provide robust technological systems for building automation and for technology visualization, software for recognition of individual voice commands, and a robust system for additive noise canceling. The KNX technology for building automation is used and described in the article. The LabVIEW SW tool is used for visualization, data connectivity to the speech recognizer, connection to the sound card, and the actual mathematical calculations within additive noise canceling. For the actual recognition of commands, the SW tool for recognition within the Microsoft Windows OS is used. In the article, the least mean squares algorithm (LMS) and independent component analysis (ICA) are used for additive noise canceling from the speech signal measured in a real SH environment. Within the proposed experiments, the success rate of voice command recognition for different types of additive interference (television, vacuum cleaner, washing machine, dishwasher, and fan) in the real SH environment was compared. The recognition success rate was greater than 95% for the selected experiments.

SN  - 2624-831X

AB  - In a context of increased environmental awareness, the Internet of Things has allowed individuals or entities to build their own connected devices to share data about the environment. These data are often obtained from widely available low-cost sensors. Some companies are also selling low-cost sensing kits for in-house or outdoor use. The work described in this paper evaluated, in the short term, the performance of a set of low-cost sensors for temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and carbon dioxide, commonly used in these platforms. The research challenge addressed with this work was assessing how trustable the raw data obtained from these sensors are. The experiments made use of 18 climatic sensors from six different models, and they were evaluated in a controlled climatic chamber that reproduced controlled situations for temperature and humidity. Four CO2 sensors from two different models were analysed through exposure to different gas concentrations in an indoor environment. Our results revealed temperature sensors with a very high positive coefficient of determination (r2 &ge; 0.99), as well as the presence of bias and almost zero random error; the humidity sensors demonstrated a very high positive correlation (r2 &ge; 0.98), significant bias and small-yet-relevant random error; the atmospheric pressure sensors presented good reproducibility, but further studies are required to evaluate their accuracy and precision. For carbon dioxide, the non-dispersive infra-red sensors demonstrated very satisfactory results (r2 &ge; 0.97, with a minimum root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 26 ppm); the metal oxide sensors, despite their moderate results (minimum RMSE equal to 40 ppm and r2 of 0.8&ndash;0.96), presented hysteresis, environmental dependence and even positioning interference. The results suggest that most of the evaluated low-cost sensors can provide a good sense of reality at a very good cost&ndash;benefit ratio in certain situations.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 1
IS  - 2
SN  - 2673-3951

AB  - Current and future smart cities are moving towards the zero-net energy use concept. To this end, the built environment should also be designed for efficient energy use and play a significant role in the production of such energy. At present, this is achieved by focusing on energy demand in buildings and to the renewable trade-off related to smart power grids. However, urban water distribution systems constantly carry an excess of hydraulic energy that can potentially be recovered to produce electricity. This paper presents a comprehensive review of current strategies for energy production by reviewing the state-of-the-art of smart water systems. New technologies (such as cyber-physical systems, digital twins, blockchain) and new methodologies (network dynamics, geometric deep learning) associated with digital water are also discussed. The paper then focuses on modelling the installation of both micro-turbines and pumps as turbines, instead of/together with pressure reduction valves, to further demonstrate the energy-recovery methods which will enable water network partitioning into district metered areas. The associated benefits on leakage control, as a source of energy, and for contributing to overall network resilience are also highlighted. The paper concludes by presenting future research directions. Notably, digital water is proposed as the main research and operational direction for current and future Water Distribution Systems (WDS) and as a holistic, data-centred framework for the operation and management of water networks.

AB  - This study proposes a Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based Human Machine Interface (HMI) framework for intuitive space-based energy management. The BIM-based HMI supports building managers with a method of linking data between BIM and Building Energy Management System (BEMS), which are heterogeneous systems, and provides space-based real-time energy monitoring. This study also proposes a BIM and BEMS data linking framework for systematic BIM-based HMI development. Towards this end, the BIM-based HMI framework was defined after deriving the considerations and requirements necessary for linking the energy control point and BIM through a questionnaire designed by practitioners. Through case analysis, the authors implemented BIM-based HMI and analyzed its effects. The results of the analysis confirmed the positive effects (3.9/5.0) on the connectivity of BIM-based HMI, the benefits (4.3/5.0) for real-time data monitoring, the system function expandability, and the BIM-based spatial intuitiveness.

AB  - In the recent era of the Internet of Things, the dominant role of sensors and the Internet provides a solution to a wide variety of real-life problems. Such applications include smart city, smart healthcare systems, smart building, smart transport and smart environment. However, the real-time IoT sensor data include several challenges, such as a deluge of unclean sensor data and a high resource-consumption cost. As such, this paper addresses how to process IoT sensor data, fusion with other data sources, and analyses to produce knowledgeable insight into hidden data patterns for rapid decision-making. This paper addresses the data processing techniques such as data denoising, data outlier detection, missing data imputation and data aggregation. Further, it elaborates on the necessity of data fusion and various data fusion methods such as direct fusion, associated feature extraction, and identity declaration data fusion. This paper also aims to address data analysis integration with emerging technologies, such as cloud computing, fog computing and edge computing, towards various challenges in IoT sensor network and sensor data analysis. In summary, this paper is the first of its kind to present a complete overview of IoT sensor data processing, fusion and analysis techniques.

AB  - The role of agriculture in environmental degradation and climate change has been at the center of a long-lasting and controversial debate. This situation combined with the expected growth in crop demand and the increasing prices of fertilizers and pesticides has made the need for a more resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable agriculture more evident than ever. Precision agriculture (PA), as a relatively new farming management concept, aims to improve crop performance as well as to reduce the environmental footprint by utilizing information about the temporal and the spatial variability of crops. Information and communication technology (ICT) systems have influenced and shaped every part of modern life, and PA is no exception. The current paper conducts a literature review of prominent ICT solutions, focusing on their role in supporting different phases of the lifecycle of PA-related data. In addition to this, a data lifecycle model was developed as part of a novel categorization approach for the analyzed solutions.

TI  - CNN-Based Fall Detection Strategy with Edge Computing Scheduling in Smart Cities

AB  - The livelihood problem, especially the medical wisdom, has played an important role during the process of the building of smart cities. For the medical wisdom, the fall detection has attracted the considerable attention from the global researchers and medical institutions. It is very difficult for the traditional fall detection strategies to realize the intelligent detection with the following three reasons: (i) the data collection cannot reach the real-time level; (ii) the adopted detection methods cannot satisfy the enough stability; and (iii) the computation overhead of collection device is very high, which causes the barely satisfactory detection effect. Therefore, this paper proposes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fall detection strategy with edge computing consideration, where the global network view ability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is used to collect the generated data from smartphone. Meanwhile, on one hand, the edge computing is exploited to put some computation tasks at the edge server by the scheduling technique. On the other hand, CNN is equipped with both edge server and smartphone, and it is leveraged to train the related data and further give the guidance of fall detection. The experimental results show that the novel fall detection strategy has a more accurate rate, transmission delay, and stability than two cutting-edge strategies.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - Human errors are probably the main cause of car accidents, and this type of vehicle is one of the most dangerous forms of transport for people. The danger comes from the fact that on public roads there are simultaneously different types of actors (drivers, pedestrians or cyclists) and many objects that change their position over time, making difficult to predict their immediate movements. The intelligent transport system (ITS-G5) standard specifies the European communication technologies and protocols to assist public road users, providing them with relevant information. The scientific community is developing ITS-G5 applications for various purposes, among which is the increasing of pedestrian safety. This paper describes the developed work to implement an ITS-G5 prototype that aims at the increasing of pedestrian and driver safety in the vicinity of a pedestrian crosswalk by sending ITS-G5 decentralized environmental notification messages (DENM) to the vehicles. These messages are analyzed, and if they are relevant, they are presented to the driver through a car&rsquo;s onboard infotainment system. This alert allows the driver to take safety precautions to prevent accidents. The implemented prototype was tested in a controlled environment pedestrian crosswalk. The results showed the capacity of the prototype for detecting pedestrians, suitable message sending, the reception and processing on a vehicle onboard unit (OBU) module and its presentation on the car onboard infotainment system.

AB  - Climate change, the deterioration of the environment and exceeding Earth&rsquo;s carrying capacity are major threats in operating environment which require new actions in industrialized and digitalized society. In parallel with the global deployment of 5th generation (5G) mobile communication networks, the telecommunication community has already started to envision 6G networks that target the year 2030. This paper discusses the unprecedented opportunities in the future 6G ecosystem specifically from the business perspective and applies a futures-oriented scenario planning method utilized in two strategy workshops in 2020. The paper portrays four scenario themes and a total of 16 alternative future scenarios for the business of 6G. Through the identification of key trends, their interactions, and related uncertainties, the scenario development process generates alternative futures where 6G business strategies are then developed and assessed through the business model perspective. Scenarios were created under four themes: user experience, business, sustainability, and geopolitics and they are discussed in terms of economical, societal, and environmental perspectives. The findings of the paper highlight the achievement of a preferred sustainable future that calls for attention to the privacy and security aspects considering business and regulatory needs: public/governmental, corporate, community, and human perspectives and aims of governance; ecosystem configuration related to users, decentralized business models, and platforms; user empowerment; and the role of service location-specificity. The findings indicate that it is vital to bring together relevant stakeholders to solve sustainability problems within the ecosystem and pay special attention to open ecosystem-focused value configuration and decentralized poly-nodal power configuration, while responding to the diversified demands of various users across the different verticals.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 21
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The Passive House standard has become the standard for many countries in the construction of the Zero Energy Building (ZEB). Korea also adopted the standard and has achieved great success in building energy savings. However, some issues remain with ZEBs in Korea. Among them, this study aims to discuss overheating issues. Field measurements were carried out to analyze the overheating risk for a library built as a ZEB. A data-driven overheating risk prediction model was developed to analyze the overheating risk, requiring only a small amount of data and extending the analysis throughout the year. The main factors causing overheating during both the cooling season and the intermediate seasons are also analyzed in detail. The overheating frequency exceeded 60% of days in July and August, the midsummer season in Korea. Overheating also occurred during the intermediate seasons when air conditioners were off, such as in May and October in Korea. Overheating during the cooling season was caused mainly by unexpected increases in occupancy rate, while overheating in the mid-term was mainly due to an increase in solar irradiation. This is because domestic ZEB standards define the reinforcement of insulation and airtight performance, but there are no standards for solar insolation through windows or for internal heat generation. The results of this study suggest that a fixed performance standard for ZEBs that does not reflect the climate or cultural characteristics of the region in which a ZEB is built may not result in energy savings at the operational stage and may not guarantee the thermal comfort of occupants.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 11
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Smart lighting systems based on the Digital Addressable Lighting Interface (DALI) protocol are the most suitable for street lighting systems, allowing digital lighting control operations. Unfortunately, the microcontrollers, which are commonly used in the Wireless Sensor Network nodes to control the lamps, do not implement this protocol. The DALI protocol implemented by software in the microcontroller consumes hardware resources (timers), processing time and requires a precise temporal analysis of the application, due to the strict bit times and the Manchester coding that it uses. In this work, the design of a bridge is proposed to free the microcontroller from the implementation of the DALI protocol. The novelty of this work is the implementation of the DALI Bridge in a low-cost Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with low power consumption. The bridge has been described in the hardware description language following the 1076-93 and 1076.3-97 standards, to guarantee its portability. The results of the synthesis show that a minimum amount of logical and routing resources is used, that the power consumption is in the order of tens of mW, that it has a very small latency time and that it supports a high operating frequency, which allows adding new functions. Its operation is verified by implementing a wireless sensor node using an FPGA of the Lattice Semiconductor iCE40 family.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have contributed to advances in Occupational Health and Safety, improving the security of workers. The use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) based on ICTs reduces the risk of accidents in the workplace, thanks to the capacity of the equipment to make decisions on the basis of environmental factors. Paradigms such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) make it possible to generate PPE models feasibly and create devices with more advanced characteristics such as monitoring, sensing the environment and risk detection between others. The working environment is monitored continuously by these models and they notify the employees and their supervisors of any anomalies and threats. This paper presents a smart helmet prototype that monitors the conditions in the workers’ environment and performs a near real-time evaluation of risks. The data collected by sensors is sent to an AI-driven platform for analysis. The training dataset consisted of 11,755 samples and 12 different scenarios. As part of this research, a comparative study of the state-of-the-art models of supervised learning is carried out. Moreover, the use of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is proposed for the detection of possible occupational risks. The data are processed to make them suitable for the CNN and the results are compared against a Static Neural Network (NN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), where the CNN had an accuracy of 92.05% in cross-validation.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Recently, for public safety and traffic management, traffic flow prediction is a crucial task. The citywide traffic flow problem is still a big challenge in big cities because of many complex factors. However, to handle some complex factors, e.g., spatial-temporal and some external factors in the intelligent traffic flow forecasting problem, spatial-temporal data for urban applications (i.e., travel time estimation, trajectory planning, taxi demand, traffic congestion, and the regional rainfall) is inherently stochastic and unpredictable. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based novel model called &ldquo;multi-branching spatial-temporal attention-based long-short term memory residual unit (MBSTALRU)&rdquo; for the citywide traffic flow from lower-level layers to high-level layers, simultaneously. In our work, initially, we have modeled the traffic flow with spatial correlations multiple 3D volume layers and propose the novel multi-branching scheme to control the spatial-temporal features. Our approach is useful for exploring temporal dependencies through the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) multiple branches, which aim to merge the spatial-temporal characteristics of historical data with three-time intervals, namely closeness, daily, and weekly, and we have embedded features by attention-based long-short term memory (LSTM). Then, we capture the correlation between traffic inflow and outflow with residual layers units. In the end, we merge the external factors dynamically to predict citywide traffic flow simultaneously. The simulation results have been performed on two real-world datasets, BJTaxi and NYCBike, which show better performance and effectiveness of the proposed method than previous state-of-the-art models.

AB  - This article shows the numerical results and the analysis of households&rsquo; degree of knowledge about the urban water cycle, needs, and values regarding water in an intermediary city with low water stress, such as Huelva (Andalusia, Spain). Results are also presented regarding how households maintain the acceptance of reclaimed water and new technologies to achieve more efficient and sustainable consumption. Surveys were sent to households, and different statistical analysis techniques were applied. The use of clustering as a mathematical tool has served to obtain three clusters of households with similar characteristics with respect to the previous factors. The first cluster corresponded to households with high knowledge of the integral water cycle and positive attitude to smart devices at home. The second cluster showed low knowledge of the integral water cycle and high sensitivity to price. The third one had average knowledge and predisposition to have a closer relationship with the water company. This classification allows implementing different water demand management strategies tailored to each cluster. Applying a Design Thinking methodology, a web-based prototype has been designed as an ICT tool concerning households. The goal is to achieve greater engagement of households concerning water and align citizens with their city&rsquo;s sustainability.

AB  - Efforts toward a low-emission economy constitute a common challenge for Polish cities. Solutions are being sought to support Polish, medium-sized cities, that is, cities with about 140,000 inhabitants, to implement and develop low-carbon energy in their public transport systems. This paper proposes and explores a sustainable urban development card for a Polish city, namely, Zielona G&oacute;ra, the use of which will enable the effects of a public transport system using low-carbon energy to be monitored. This research was based on the two main areas of analysis of a system of low-carbon energy and public transport and were formulated as: (1) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and (2) Indicators of the Satisfaction Rate of Public Transport Passengers (SPTP). This paper used literature studies to determine SDGs as well a questionnaire-cum-survey, which was conducted on a sample of 1022 public transport passengers in Zielona G&oacute;ra, Poland, to determine SPTP. The results were verified by a real case study of a Polish city, which, in 2019, had the largest fleet of electric buses in Poland; a statistical analysis was also conducted using correlation coefficients. It was determined that the proposed approach allows for low carbon energy public transport to be constantly monitored and analyzed. In the long run, this could be a good benchmark as to how cities might improve their level of sustainability.

AB  - Mental health is the foundation of health and happiness as well as the basis for an individual&rsquo;s meaningful life. The environmental and social health of a city can measure the mental state of people living in a certain areas, and exploring urban dwellers&rsquo; mental states is an important factor in understanding and better managing cities. New dynamic and granular urban data provide us with a way to determine the environmental factors that affect the mental states of urban dwellers. The characteristics of the maximal information coefficient can identify the linear and nonlinear relationships so that we can fully identify the physical and social environmental factors that affect urban dwellers&rsquo; mental states and further test these relationships through linear and nonlinear modeling. Taking the Greater London as an example, we used data from the London Datastore to discover the environmental factors that had the highest correlation with urban mental health from 2015 to 2017 and to prove that they had a high nonlinear correlation through neural network modeling. This paper aimed to use a data-driven approach to find environmental factors that had not yet received enough attention and to provide a starting point for research by establishing hypotheses for further exploration of the impact of environmental factors on mental health.

AB  - The main principles of the smart city concept rely on modern, environmentally friendly technologies. One manifestation of the smart city concept is investments in renewable energy sources (RES), which are currently a popular direction in urban transformation. It makes sense, therefore, to analyse how Polish cities are coping with this challenge and whether they are including the implementation of RES facilities in their development strategies. The aim of the article is to analyze and assess the level at which renewable energy facilities are being implemented or developed in the urban space of cities in Poland as a pillar of the implementation of the smart city concept. This goal is realized on two levels: the theoretical (analysis of strategic documents) and the practical (analysis of the capacity of RES installations, questionnaire studies). The study shows that renewable energy installations are an important part of the development strategies of Polish cities, and especially of those that aspire to be termed &ldquo;smart cities&rdquo;. Moreover, it is shown that the predominant RES facilities are those based on solar energy.

AB  - With the arrival of the big data era, mobile phone data have attracted increasing attention due to their rich information and high sampling rate. Currently, researchers have conducted various studies using mobile phone data. However, most existing studies have focused on macroscopic analysis, such as urban hot spot detection and crowd behavior analysis over a short period. With the development of the smart city, personal service and management have become very important, so microscopic portraiture research and mobility pattern of an individual based on big data is necessary. Therefore, this paper first proposes a method to depict the individual mobility pattern, and based on the long-term mobile phone data (from 2007 to 2012) of volunteers from Beijing as part of project Geolife conducted by Microsoft Research Asia, more detailed individual portrait depiction analysis is performed. The conclusions are as follows: (1) Based on high-density cluster identification, the behavior trajectories of volunteers are generalized into three types, and among them, the two-point-one-line trajectory and evenly distributed behavior trajectory were more prevalent in Beijing. (2) By integrating with Google Maps data, five volunteers&rsquo; behavior trajectories and the activity patterns of individuals were analyzed in detail, and a portrait depiction method for individual characteristics comprehensively considering their attributes, such as occupation and hobbies, is proposed. (3) Based on analysis of the individual characteristics of some volunteers, it is discovered that two-point-one-line individuals are generally white-collar workers working in enterprises or institutions, and the situation of a single cluster mainly exists among college students and home freelancer. The findings of this study are important for individual classification and prediction in the big data era and can also provide useful guidance for targeted services and individualized management of smart cities.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) coupled with big data analytics is emerging as the core of smart and sustainable systems which bolsters economic, environmental and social sustainability. Cloud-based data centers provide high performance computing power to analyze voluminous IoT data to provide invaluable insights to support decision making. However, multifarious servers in data centers appear to be the black hole of superfluous energy consumption that contributes to 23% of the global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in ICT (Information and Communication Technology) industry. IoT-related energy research focuses on low-power sensors and enhanced machine-to-machine communication performance. To date, cloud-based data centers still face energy&ndash;related challenges which are detrimental to the environment. Virtual machine (VM) consolidation is a well-known approach to affect energy-efficient cloud infrastructures. Although several research works demonstrate positive results for VM consolidation in simulated environments, there is a gap for investigations on real, physical cloud infrastructure for big data workloads. This research work addresses the gap of conducting real physical cloud infrastructure-based experiments. The primary goal of setting up a real physical cloud infrastructure is for the evaluation of dynamic VM consolidation approaches which include integrated algorithms from existing relevant research. An open source VM consolidation framework, Openstack NEAT is adopted and experiments are conducted on a Multi-node Openstack Cloud with Apache Spark as the big data platform. Open sourced Openstack has been deployed because it enables rapid innovation, and boosts scalability as well as resource utilization. Additionally, this research work investigates the performance based on service level agreement (SLA) metrics and energy usage of compute hosts.

AB  - Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) face challenges related to the reliability of the data exchanged and the unstability of the communication links. These shortcomings have hampered the development of the long-awaited applications that would turn roads into a smart environment. We present a framework to deploy such services, in which a virtualization layer ensures means to efficiently deliver messages between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) and, on top of that, blockchain technology is used to enable features of data integrity, traceability, and reliability that cannot be furnished by existing consensus and reputation mechanisms. A simulation experiment is included to determine the optimal number of RSUs to be installed as supporting infrastructure in a city.

AB  - Understanding how, where, and when a city is expanding can inform better ways to make our cities more resilient, sustainable, and equitable. This paper explores urban volumetry using the Building 3D Density Index (B3DI) in 2001, 2010, 2019, and quantifies changes in the volume of buildings and urban expansion in Luxembourg City over the last two decades. For this purpose, we use airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud (2019) and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) of aerial orthophotos (2001, 2010) to extract 3D models, footprints of buildings and calculate the volume of individual buildings and B3DI in the frame of a 100 &times; 100 m grid, at the level of parcels, districts, and city scale. Findings indicate that the B3DI has notably increased in the past 20 years from 0.77 m3/m2 (2001) to 0.9 m3/m2 (2010) to 1.09 m3/m2 (2019). Further, the increase in the volume of buildings between 2001&ndash;2019 was +16 million m3. The general trend of changes in the cubic capacity of buildings per resident shows a decrease from 522 m3/resident in 2001, to 460 m3/resident in 2019, which, with the simultaneous appearance of new buildings and fast population growth, represents the dynamic development of the city.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Automated vulnerability detection is one of the critical issues in the realm of software security. Existing solutions to this problem are mostly based on features that are defined by human experts and directly lead to missed potential vulnerability. Deep learning is an effective method for automating the extraction of vulnerability characteristics. Our paper proposes intelligent and automated vulnerability detection while using deep representation learning and heterogeneous ensemble learning. Firstly, we transform sample data from source code by removing segments that are unrelated to the vulnerability in order to reduce code analysis and improve detection efficiency in our experiments. Secondly, we represent the sample data as real vectors by pre-training on the corpus and maintaining its semantic information. Thirdly, the vectors are fed to a deep learning model to obtain the features of vulnerability. Lastly, we train a heterogeneous ensemble classifier. We analyze the effectiveness and resource consumption of different network models, pre-training methods, classifiers, and vulnerabilities separately in order to evaluate the detection method. We also compare our approach with some well-known vulnerability detection commercial tools and academic methods. The experimental results show that our proposed method provides improvements in false positive rate, false negative rate, precision, recall, and F1 score.

AB  - The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications and their interference with our daily life tasks have led to a large number of IoT devices and enormous sizes of IoT-generated data. The resources of IoT devices are limited; therefore, the processing and storing IoT data in these devices are inefficient. Traditional cloud-computing resources are used to partially handle some of the IoT resource-limitation issues; however, using the resources in cloud centers leads to other issues, such as latency in time-critical IoT applications. Therefore, edge-cloud-computing technology has recently evolved. This technology allows for data processing and storage at the edge of the network. This paper studies, in-depth, edge-computing architectures for IoT (ECAs-IoT), and then classifies them according to different factors such as data placement, orchestration services, security, and big data. Besides, the paper studies each architecture in depth and compares them according to various features. Additionally, ECAs-IoT is mapped according to two existing IoT layered models, which helps in identifying the capabilities, features, and gaps of every architecture. Moreover, the paper presents the most important limitations of existing ECAs-IoT and recommends solutions to them. Furthermore, this survey details the IoT applications in the edge-computing domain. Lastly, the paper recommends four different scenarios for using ECAs-IoT by IoT applications.

IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In many developed countries with a long history of urbanization, there is an increasing need for automated computer vision (CV)-based inspection to replace conventional labor-intensive visual inspection. This paper proposes a technique for the automated detection of multiple concrete damage based on a state-of-the-art deep learning framework, Mask R-CNN, developed for instance segmentation. The structure of Mask R-CNN, which consists of three stages (region proposal, classification, and segmentation) is optimized for multiple concrete damage detection. The optimized Mask R-CNN is trained with 765 concrete images including cracks, efflorescence, rebar exposure, and spalling. The performance of the trained Mask R-CNN is evaluated with 25 actual test images containing damage as well as environmental objects. Two types of metrics are proposed to measure localization and segmentation performance. On average, 90.41% precision and 90.81% recall are achieved for localization and 87.24% precision and 87.58% recall for segmentation, which indicates the excellent field applicability of the trained Mask R-CNN. This paper also qualitatively discusses the test results by explaining that the architecture of Mask R-CNN that is optimized for general object detection purposes, can be modified to detect long and slender shapes of cracks, rebar exposure, and efflorescence in further research.

AB  - The agriculture sector has held a major role in human societies across the planet throughout history. The rapid evolution in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) strongly affects the structure and the procedures of modern agriculture. Despite the advantages gained from this evolution, there are several existing as well as emerging security threats that can severely impact the agricultural domain. The present paper provides an overview of the main existing and potential threats for agriculture. Initially, the paper presents an overview of the evolution of ICT solutions and how these may be utilized and affect the agriculture sector. It then conducts an extensive literature review on the use of ICT in agriculture, as well as on the associated emerging threats and vulnerabilities. The authors highlight the main ICT innovations, techniques, benefits, threats and mitigation measures by studying the literature on them and by providing a concise discussion on the possible impacts these could have on the agri-sector.

AB  - Seoul Metropolitan City&rsquo;s buses cater to more than 50% of the average daily public transportation use, and they are the most important transportation mode in Korea, together with the subway. Since 2004, all public transportation records of passengers have been stored in Seoul, using smart transportation cards. This study explores the environmental and psychological factors in implementing a smart transportation system. We analyze the switching behavior of traffic users according to traffic congestion time and number of transfers based on public transportation data and show that bus-use behavior differs according to the traffic information of users and the degree of traffic congestion. Information-based switching behavior of people living near bus stops induces people to change routes during traffic congestion. However, in non-congested situations, the original routes are used. These results can guide the formulation of policy measures on bus routes. We made it possible to continuously change the routes for certain buses, which were temporarily implemented due to traffic congestion. Moreover, we added a service that posts the estimated arrival time to major stops while reflecting real-time traffic conditions in addition to the bus location and arrival time information through the global positioning system.

AB  - In order to improve the traffic in large cities and to avoid congestion, advanced methods of detecting and predicting vehicle behaviour are needed. Such methods require complex information regarding the number of vehicles on the roads, their positions, directions, etc. One way to obtain this information is by analyzing overhead images collected by satellites or drones, and extracting information from them through intelligent machine learning models. Thus, in this paper we propose and present a one-stage object detection model for finding vehicles in satellite images using the RetinaNet architecture and the Cars Overhead With Context dataset. By analyzing the results obtained by the proposed model, we show that it has a very good vehicle detection accuracy and a very low detection time, which shows that it can be employed to successfully extract data from real-time satellite or drone data.

AB  - The number of wireless sensors in use&mdash;for example, the global positioning system (GPS) intelligent sensor&mdash;has increased in recent years. These intelligent sensors generate a vast amount of spatiotemporal data, which can assist in finding patterns of movements. These movement patterns can be used to predict the future location of moving objects; for example, the movement of an emergency vehicle can be predicted for health care decision-making. Although there is a body of research work regarding motion trajectory prediction, there are no guidelines for choosing algorithms best suited for individual needs in uncertain and complex situations and as per the application domains. In this paper, we surveyed existing trajectory prediction algorithms. These algorithms are further ranked scientifically in terms of accuracy (performance), ease of use, and best fit as per the available datasets. Our results show three top algorithms, namely NextPlace, the Markov model, and the hidden Markov model. This study can be beneficial for multicriteria decision-making for various disciplines, including health care.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies used in developing smart cities solutions, Machine Learning (ML) and recently Deep Learning (DL), rely more on utilising best representative training datasets and features engineering and less on the available domain expertise. We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of &lsquo;explainable deep learning&rsquo; as a subset of the &lsquo;explainable AI&rsquo; problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project. Monitoring of gullies and drainage in crucial geographical areas susceptible to flooding issues is an important aspect of any flood monitoring solution. Typical solutions for this problem involve the use of cameras to capture images showing the affected areas in real-time with different objects such as leaves, plastic bottles etc., and building a DL-based classifier to detect such objects and classify blockages based on the presence and coverage of these objects in the images. In this work, we uniquely propose an Explainable AI solution using DL and Semantic Web technologies to build a hybrid classifier. In this hybrid classifier, the DL component detects object presence and coverage level and semantic rules designed with close consultation with experts carry out the classification. By using the expert knowledge in the flooding context, our hybrid classifier provides the flexibility on categorising the image using objects and their coverage relationships. The experimental results demonstrated with a real-world use case showed that this hybrid approach of image classification has on average 11% improvement (F-Measure) in image classification performance compared to DL-only classifier. It also has the distinct advantage of integrating experts&rsquo; knowledge on defining the decision-making rules to represent the complex circumstances and using such knowledge to explain the results.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - With the urbanization and expansion of cities, which have taken place over recent decades, new demands and problems are emerging, among which is the problem of inadequate transport infrastructure. The number of motor vehicles is growing, while transport infrastructure is not following that growth fast enough. One of the problems that arises is the insufficient number of garages and parking lots, causing an increase in illegal parking on sidewalks, which impedes and endangers pedestrian traffic. This paper proposes a new decision support concept (DSC) for the management of illegally parked cars in urban centers, which offers a method that can contribute to solving this problem and improving the flow of pedestrians on city roads. Due to its complexity, the problem addressed in this research is recognized as a multicriteria one and therefore the proposed model is based on the use of multicriteria analysis methods&mdash;more precisely, the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation&mdash;PROMETHEE, and the analytic hierarchy process&mdash;AHP. The proposed DSC is validated in the city of Split (Croatia), more precisely in the neighborhood of Sućidar, which shows that this methodology is applicable and effective for finding not a temporary but a permanent solution to the problem described.

TI  - Economic Granularity Interval in Decision Tree Algorithm Standardization from an Open Innovation Perspective: Towards a Platform for Sustainable Matching

SN  - 2199-8531

AB  - In the context of the application of artificial intelligence in an intellectual property trading platform, the number of demanders and suppliers that exchange scarce resources is growing continuously. Improvement of computational power promotes matching efficiency significantly. It is necessary to greatly reduce energy consumption in order to realize the machine learning process in terminals and microprocessors in edge computing (smart phones, wearable devices, automobiles, IoT devices, etc.) and reduce the resource burden of data centers. Machine learning algorithms generated in an open community lack standardization in practice, and hence require open innovation participation to reduce computing cost, shorten algorithm running time, and improve human-machine collaborative competitiveness. The purpose of this study was to find an economic range of the granularity in a decision tree, a popular machine learning algorithm. This work addresses the research questions of what the economic tree depth interval is and what the corresponding time cost is with increasing granularity given the number of matches. This study also aimed to balance the efficiency and cost via simulation. Results show that the benefit of decreasing the tree search depth brought by the increased evaluation granularity is not linear, which means that, in a given number of candidate matches, the granularity has a definite and relatively economical range. The selection of specific evaluation granularity in this range can obtain a smaller tree depth and avoid the occurrence of low efficiency, which is the excessive increase in the time cost. Hence, the standardization of an AI algorithm is applicable to edge computing scenarios, such as an intellectual property trading platform. The economic granularity interval can not only save computing resource costs but also save AI decision-making time and avoid human decision-maker time cost.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The highly competitive and rapidly advancing autonomous vehicle race has been on for several years now, and it has made the driver-assistance systems a shadow of their former self. Nevertheless, automated vehicles have many obstacles on the way, and until we have them on the roads, promising solutions that can be achievable in the near future should be sought-after. Driving-support technologies have proven themselves to be effective in the battle against car crashes, and with Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) supporting them, their efficiency is expected to rise steeply. In this work, we propose and implement a driving-support system which, on the one hand, could immensely benefit from major advancement of VANETs, but on the other hand can effectively be implemented as a stand-alone system. The proposed system consists of a non-intrusive integrated fuzzy-based system able to detect a risky situation in real time and alert the driver about the danger. It makes use of the information acquired from various in-car sensors as well as from communications with other vehicles and infrastructure to evaluate the condition of the considered parameters. The parameters include factors that affect the driver&rsquo;s ability to drive, such as his/her current health condition and the inside environment in which he/she is driving, the vehicle speed, and factors related to the outside environment such as the weather and road condition. We show the effect of these parameters on the determination of the driving risk level through simulations and experiments and explain how these risk levels are translated into actions that can help the driver to manage certain risky situations, thus improving the driving safety.

TI  - An Energy Saving Road Sweeper Using Deep Vision for Garbage Detection
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Road sweepers are ubiquitous machines that help preserve our cities cleanliness and health by collecting road garbage and sweeping out dirt from our streets and sidewalks. They are often very mechanical instruments, needing to operate in harsh conditions dealing with all sorts of abandoned trash and natural garbage. They are usually composed of rotating brushes, collector belts and bins, and sometimes water or air streams. All of these mechanical tools are usually high in power demand and strongly subject to wear and tear. Moreover, due to the simple working logic often implied by these cleaning machines, these tools work in an &ldquo;always on&rdquo;/&ldquo;max power&rdquo; state, and any further regulation is left to the pilot. Therefore, adding artificial intelligence able to correctly operate these tools in a semi-automatic way would be greatly beneficial. In this paper, we propose an automatic road garbage detection system, able to locate with great precision most types of road waste, and to correctly instruct a road sweeper in order to handle them. With this simple addition to an existing sweeper, we will be able to save more than 80% electrical power currently absorbed by the cleaning systems and reduce by the same amount brush weariness (prolonging their lifetime). This is done by choosing when to use the brushes and when not to, with how much strength, and where. The only hardware components needed by the system will be a camera and a PC board able to read the camera output (and communicate via CanBus). The software of the system will be mainly composed of a deep neural network for semantic segmentation of images, and a real-time software program to control the sweeper actuators with the appropriate timings. To prove the claimed results, we run extensive tests onboard of such a truck, as well as benchmark tests for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and inference speed of the system.

PY  - 2020

IS  - 22
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The integration of medical signal processing capabilities and advanced sensors into Internet of Things (IoT) devices plays a key role in providing comfort and convenience to human lives. As the number of patients is increasing gradually, providing healthcare facilities to each patient, particularly to the patients located in remote regions, not only has become challenging but also results in several issues, such as: (i) increase in workload on paramedics, (ii) wastage of time, and (iii) accommodation of patients. Therefore, the design of smart healthcare systems has become an important area of research to overcome these above-mentioned issues. Several healthcare applications have been designed using wireless sensor networks (WSNs), cloud computing, and fog computing. Most of the e-healthcare applications are designed using the cloud computing paradigm. Cloud-based architecture introduces high latency while processing huge amounts of data, thus restricting the large-scale implementation of latency-sensitive e-healthcare applications. Fog computing architecture offers processing and storage resources near to the edge of the network, thus, designing e-healthcare applications using the fog computing paradigm is of interest to meet the low latency requirement of such applications. Patients that are minors or are in intensive care units (ICUs) are unable to self-report their pain conditions. The remote healthcare monitoring applications deploy IoT devices with bio-sensors capable of sensing surface electromyogram (sEMG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to monitor the pain condition of such patients. In this article, fog computing architecture is proposed for deploying a remote pain monitoring system. The key motivation for adopting the fog paradigm in our proposed approach is to reduce latency and network consumption. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in minimizing delay and network utilization, simulations were carried out in iFogSim and the results were compared with the cloud-based systems. The results of the simulations carried out in this research indicate that a reduction in both latency and network consumption can be achieved by adopting the proposed approach for implementing a remote pain monitoring system.

AB  - IoT networks are increasingly popular nowadays to monitor critical environments of different nature, significantly increasing the amount of data exchanged. Due to the huge number of connected IoT devices, security of such networks and devices is therefore a critical issue. Detection systems assume a crucial role in the cyber-security field: based on innovative algorithms such as machine learning, they are able to identify or predict cyber-attacks, hence to protect the underlying system. Nevertheless, specific datasets are required to train detection models. In this work we present MQTTset, a dataset focused on the MQTT protocol, widely adopted in IoT networks. We present the creation of the dataset, also validating it through the definition of a hypothetical detection system, by combining the legitimate dataset with cyber-attacks against the MQTT network. Obtained results demonstrate how MQTTset can be used to train machine learning models to implement detection systems able to protect IoT contexts.

AB  - The understanding of occupancy patterns has been identified as a key contributor to achieve improvements in energy efficiency in buildings since occupancy information can benefit different systems, such as HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioners), lighting, security, and emergency. This has meant that in the past decade, researchers have focused on improving the precision of occupancy estimation in enclosed spaces. Although several works have been done, one of the less addressed issues, regarding occupancy research, has been the availability of data for contrasting experimental results. Therefore, the main contributions of this work are: (1) the generation of two robust datasets gathered in enclosed spaces (a fitness gym and a living room) labeled with occupancy levels, and (2) the evaluation of three Machine Learning algorithms using different temporal resolutions. The results show that the prediction of 3&ndash;4 occupancy levels using the temperature, humidity, and pressure values provides an accuracy of at least 97%.

AB  - The rapid development and spread of communication technologies is now becoming a global information revolution. Customers have a need for communication services, which could be flexibly configured in accordance with their Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements. Realizing the close connection between customer experience and profitability, the service provider has been placing more and more attention on customer experience and QoE. The traditional quality of service management method based on SLA (Service Level Agreement) is not sufficient as a means to provide QoE-related contracts between service providers and customers. The current SLA method is mostly limited and focused on technical aspects of QoS (Quality of Service). Furthermore, they do not follow on the network the principles and semantic approach to the QoS specification for a communication service using QoE parameters. In this paper, we propose a customer-oriented quality of service management method for future IBN (Intent-Based Networking). It is based on a new QoE metric on a scale from 1 to 5, which allows one to take into account the commercial value of e-services for customers. Based on this approach, the network configuration and functionality of network equipment automatically changes depending on customer requirements. To implement the new method of service quality management, an algorithm for routing data packets in the network was developed, taking into account the current load of the forecast path. The algorithm of billing system functioning in conditions of customer-oriented quality management in telecommunication networks has been created. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method of service quality management with the traditional SLA method, we developed a simulation network model with the implementation of two approaches. By conducting a simulation, it was determined that the proposed method gives an average gain of 2&ndash;5 times for the criterion of the number of customers who require high quality of experience of the service.

AB  - The pandemic declared by the World Health Organization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) awakened us to a reality that most of us were previously unaware of&mdash;isolation, confinement and the massive use of information and communication technologies, as well as increased knowledge of the difficulties and limitations of their use. This article focuses on the rapid implementation of low-cost technologies, which allow us to answer a fundamental question: how can near real-time monitoring and follow-up of the elderly and their health conditions, as well as their homes, especially for those living in isolated and remote areas, be provided within their care and protect them from risky events? The system proposed here as a proof of concept uses low-cost devices for communication and data processing, supported by Long-Range (LoRa) technology and connection to The Things Network, incorporating various sensors, both personal and in the residence, allowing family members, neighbors and authorized entities, including security forces, to have access to the health condition of system users and the habitability of their homes, as well as their urgent needs, thus evidencing that it is possible, using low-cost systems, to implement sensor networks for monitoring the elderly using the LoRa gateway and other support infrastructures.

SN  - 2077-1312

AB  - In the underwater environment, in order to preserve rare and endangered objects or to eliminate the exotic invasive species that can destroy the ecosystems, it is essential to classify objects and estimate their number. It is very difficult to classify objects and estimate their number. While YOLO shows excellent performance in object recognition, it recognizes objects by processing the images of each frame independently of each other. By accumulating the object classification results from the past frames to the current frame, we propose a method to accurately classify objects, and count their number in sequential video images. This has a high classification probability of 93.94% and 97.06% in the test videos of Bluegill and Largemouth bass, respectively. The proposed method shows very good classification performance in video images taken of the underwater environment.

AB  - An efficient and credible approach to road traffic management and prediction is a crucial aspect in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It can strongly influence the development of road structures and projects. It is also essential for route planning and traffic regulations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that combines extreme learning machine (ELM) and ensemble-based techniques to predict the future hourly traffic of a road section in Tangier, a city in the north of Morocco. The model was applied to a real-world historical data set extracted from fixed sensors over a 5-years period. Our approach is based on a type of Single hidden Layer Feed-forward Neural Network (SLFN) known for being a high-speed machine learning algorithm. The model was, then, compared to other well-known algorithms in the prediction literature. Experimental results demonstrated that, according to the most commonly used criteria of error measurements (RMSE, MAE, and MAPE), our model is performing better in terms of prediction accuracy. The use of Akaike&rsquo;s Information Criterion technique (AIC) has also shown that the proposed model has a higher performance.

TI  - Multi-Modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks for Visual Question Answering
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 23
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Visual question answering (VQA) is a multi-modal task involving natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), which requires models to understand of both visual information and textual information simultaneously to predict the correct answer for the input visual image and textual question, and has been widely used in smart and intelligent transport systems, smart city, and other fields. Today, advanced VQA approaches model dense interactions between image regions and question words by designing co-attention mechanisms to achieve better accuracy. However, modeling interactions between each image region and each question word will force the model to calculate irrelevant information, thus causing the model&rsquo;s attention to be distracted. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a novel model called Multi-modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks (MESAN), which concentrates the model&rsquo;s attention by explicitly selecting the parts of the input features that are the most relevant to answering the input question. We consider that this method based on top-k selection can reduce the interference caused by irrelevant information and ultimately help the model to achieve better performance. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset VQA v2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our best single model delivers 70.71% and 71.08% overall accuracy on the test-dev and test-std sets, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can obtain better attended features than other advanced models through attention visualization. Our work proves that the models with sparse attention mechanisms can also achieve competitive results on VQA datasets. We hope that it can promote the development of VQA models and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology related to VQA in various aspects.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the advent of the Internet of Everything, more and more devices are connected to the Internet every year. In major cities, in order to maintain normal social order, the demand for deployed cameras is also increasing. In terms of public safety, person Re-Identification (ReID) can play a big role. However, the current methods of ReID are to transfer the collected pedestrian images to the cloud for processing, which will bring huge communication costs. In order to solve this problem, we combine the recently emerging edge computing and use the edge to combine the end devices and the cloud to implement our proposed binarized segmented ResNet. Our method is mainly to divide a complete ResNet into three parts, corresponding to the end devices, the edge, and the cloud. After joint training, the corresponding segmented sub-network is deployed to the corresponding side, and inference is performed to realize ReID. In our experiments, we compared some traditional ReID methods in terms of accuracy and communication overhead. It can be found that our method can greatly reduce the communication cost on the basis of basically not reducing the recognition accuracy of ReID. In general, the communication cost can be reduced by four to eight times.

AB  - Planning is a crucial component of short- and long-term municipal waste management. Establishing the relationships between the factors that determine the amount of waste generated by municipalities and forecasting the waste management needs plays a fundamental role in the development of effective planning strategies and implementation of sustainable development. Artificial Neural Network employed for verifying the forecasts pertaining to the amount of rainfall in Poland were presented in the studies. The proposed models included selected explanatory indices in order to reflect the impact of social, demographic and economic factors on the amount of generated waste. Mean squared error (MSE) and regression value (R) are used as indices of efficiency of the developed models. The ANN models exhibited high accuracy of forecasts at high R values (R = 0.914, R = 0.989) and low MSE values. Derived from the socioeconomic data for 2003&ndash;2019, the model predicts that the future waste generation in 2024 will increase by 2%. The results indicate that the employed ANN models are effective in predicting the amount of waste and can be considered a cost-effective approach to planning integrated waste management systems.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 23
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Air pollution is one of the world&rsquo;s most significant challenges. Predicting air pollution is critical for air quality research, as it affects public health. The Air Pollution Index (API) is a convenient tool to describe air quality. Air pollution predictions can provide accurate information on the future pollution situation, effectively controlling air pollution. Governments have expressed growing concern about air pollution due to its global effect on human health and sustainable growth. This paper proposes a novel forecasting model using One-Dimensional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and Exponential Adaptive Gradients (EAG) optimization to predict API for a selected location, Klang, a city in Malaysia. The proposed 1D-CNN&ndash;EAG exponentially accumulates past model gradients to adaptively tune the learning rate and converge in both convex and non-convex areas. We use hourly air pollution data over three years (January 2012 to December 2014) for training. Parameter optimization and model evaluation was accomplished by a grid-search with k-folds cross-validation. Results have confirmed that the proposed approach achieves better prediction accuracy than the benchmark models in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Correlation Coefficient (R-Squared) with values of 2.036, 2.354, 4.214 and 0.966, respectively, and time complexity.

AB  - As we stand at the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, the Internet of Things, Big Data, Blockchain, Robotics, 3D technologies, and many more have become the means and solutions to many of the world&rsquo;s problems. Most recently, these technologies have assisted in the global fight of the COVID-19 pandemic and other societal problems. Together with these innovative techniques, the concept of circular economy and its relevant tools such as life cycle costing, life cycle impact assessment, materials passports, and circularity measurements have been implemented in a number of sectors in different countries for the transition from a linear &ldquo;take, make, and dispose&rdquo; model towards a more circular model, which has shown positive results for the environment and economy. In this article, with the help of implementation, prototyping, and case studies, we explore how these technological advancements and innovative techniques are used in different sectors such as information and communications technology, the built environment, mining and manufacturing, education, healthcare, the public sectors, and others to provide an opportunity to understand and resolve the agreed upon framework in 2015 by 193 countries, that is, the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 24
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - In recent years, there has been a big data revolution in smart cities dues to multiple disciplines such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, and smart community. However, most services in these areas of smart cities have become data-driven, thus generating big data that require sharing, storing, processing, and analysis, which ultimately consumes massive amounts of energy. The accumulation process of these data from different areas of a smart city is a challenging issue. Therefore, researchers have started aiming at the Internet of vehicles (IoV), in which smart vehicles are equipped with computing and storage capabilities to communicate with surrounding infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a subcategory of IoV as the Internet of buses (IoB), where public buses enable a service as a data carrier in a smart city by introducing a neural network-based sustainable data dissemination system (NESUDA), where opportunistic sensing comprises delay-tolerant data collection, processing and disseminating from one place to another place around the city. The objective was to use public transport to carry data from one place to another and to reduce the traffic from traditional networks and energy consumption. An advanced neural network (NN) algorithm was applied to locate the realistic arrival time of public buses for data allocation. We used the Auckland transport (AT) buses data set from the transport agency to validate our model for the level of accuracy in predicted bus arrival time and scheduled arrival time to disseminate data using bus services. Data were uploaded onto buses as per their dwelling time at each stop and terminals within the coverage area of deployed RSU. The offloading capacity of our proposed data dissemination system showed that it could be utilized to effectively complement traditional data networks. Moreover, the maximum offloading capacity at each parent stop could reach up to 360 GB with a huge saving of energy consumption.

AB  - Experimental and numerical modeling of a heat pipe included with a phase change heat transfer was developed to assess the effects of three parameters of nanofluid, heat pipe inclination angles, and input heating power. Distilled water (DW) and 1-pyrene carboxylic-acid (PCA)-functionalized graphene nanofluid (with concentrations of 0.06 wt%) were used as working fluids in the heat pipe. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was developed for evaluation of the heat transfer and two-phase flow through the steady-state process of the heat pipe. It was found that inclination significantly affects the heat transfer of the heat pipe. Maximum increment of thermal performance in the heat pipe reached 49.4% by using 0.06 wt% of PCA-functionalized graphene as working fluids. The result associated with this comparison indicates that the highest deviation is less than 6%, consequently confirming that the CFD model was successful in reproducing the heat and mass transfer processes in the DW and nanofluids charged heat pipe. The results of CFD simulation have good agreement between predicted temperature profiles and experimental data.

AB  - Continuous exposure to urban noise has been found to be one of the major threats to citizens&rsquo; health. In this regard, several organizations are devoting huge efforts to designing new in-field systems to identify the acoustic sources of these threats to protect those citizens at risk. Typically, these prototype systems are composed of expensive components that limit their large-scale deployment and thus reduce the scope of their measurements. This paper aims to present a highly scalable low-cost distributed infrastructure that features a ubiquitous acoustic sensor network to monitor urban sounds. It takes advantage of (1) low-cost microphones deployed in a redundant topology to improve their individual performance when identifying the sound source, (2) a deep-learning algorithm for sound recognition, (3) a distributed data-processing middleware to reach consensus on the sound identification, and (4) a custom planar antenna with an almost isotropic radiation pattern for the proper node communication. This enables practitioners to acoustically populate urban spaces and provide a reliable view of noises occurring in real time. The city of Barcelona (Spain) and the UrbanSound8K dataset have been selected to analytically validate the proposed approach. Results obtained in laboratory tests endorse the feasibility of this proposal.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with an increasing popularity and applications in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. Although many of these areas closely relate to the urban context, there is limited understanding of the trending AI technologies and their application areas&mdash;or concepts&mdash;in the urban planning and development fields. Similarly, there is a knowledge gap in how the public perceives AI technologies, their application areas, and the AI-related policies and practices of our cities. This study aims to advance our understanding of the relationship between the key AI technologies (n = 15) and their key application areas (n = 16) in urban planning and development. To this end, this study examines public perceptions of how AI technologies and their application areas in urban planning and development are perceived and utilized in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories. The methodological approach of this study employs the social media analytics method, and conducts sentiment and content analyses of location-based Twitter messages (n = 11,236) from Australia. The results disclose that: (a) digital transformation, innovation, and sustainability are the most popular AI application areas in urban planning and development; (b) drones, automation, robotics, and big data are the most popular AI technologies utilized in urban planning and development, and; (c) achieving the digital transformation and sustainability of cities through the use of AI technologies&mdash;such as big data, automation and robotics&mdash;is the central community discussion topic.

AB  - With the unprecedented growing demand for communication between Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the upcoming 5G and 6G technologies will pave the path to a widespread use of ultra-reliable low-latency applications in such networks. However, with most of the sensitive data being transmitted over wireless links, security, privacy and trust management are emerging as big challenges to handle. IoT applications vary, from self-driving vehicles, drone deliveries, online shopping, IoT smart cities, e-healthcare and robotic assisted surgery, with many applications focused on Voice over IP (VoIP) and require securing data from potential eavesdroppers and attackers. One well-known technique is a hidden exchange of secret data between the devices for which security can be achieved with audio steganography. Audio steganography is an efficient, reliable and low-latency mechanism used for securely communicating sensitive data over wireless links. MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3&rsquo;s (MP3&rsquo;s) bit rate falls within the acceptable sound quality required for audio. Its low level of noise distortion does not affect its sound quality, which makes it a good carrier medium for steganography and watermarking. The strength of any embedding technique lies with its undetectability measure. Although there are many detection techniques available for both steganography and watermarking, the detection accuracy of secret data has been proven erroneous. It has yet to be confirmed whether different bit rates or a constant sampling rate for embedding eases detection. The accuracy of detecting hidden information in MP3 files drops with the influence of the compression rate or increases. This drop or increase is caused by either the increase in file track size, the sampling rate or the bit rate. This paper presents an experimental study that evaluates the detection accuracy of the secret data embedded in MP3. Training data were used for the embedding and detection of text messages in MP3 files. Several iterations were evaluated. The experimental results show that the used approach was effective in detecting the embedded data in MP3 files. An accuracy rate of 97.92% was recorded when detecting secret data in MP3 files under 128-kbps compression. This result outperformed the previous research work.

AB  - The large-scale deployment of pervasive sensors and decentralized computing in modern smart grids is expected to exponentially increase the volume of data exchanged by power system applications. In this context, the research for scalable and flexible methodologies aimed at supporting rapid decisions in a data rich, but information limited environment represents a relevant issue to address. To this aim, this paper investigates the role of Knowledge Discovery from massive Datasets in smart grid computing, exploring its various application fields by considering the power system stakeholder available data and knowledge extraction needs. In particular, the aim of this paper is dual. In the first part, the authors summarize the most recent activities developed in this field by the Task Force on &ldquo;Enabling Paradigms for High-Performance Computing in Wide Area Monitoring Protective and Control Systems&rdquo; of the IEEE PSOPE Technologies and Innovation Subcommittee. Differently, in the second part, the authors propose the development of a data-driven forecasting methodology, which is modeled by considering the fundamental principles of Knowledge Discovery Process data workflow. Furthermore, the described methodology is applied to solve the load forecasting problem for a complex user case, in order to emphasize the potential role of knowledge discovery in supporting post processing analysis in data-rich environments, as feedback for the improvement of the forecasting performances.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Human activities embedded in crowdsourced data, such as social media trajectory, represent individual daily styles and patterns, which are valuable in many applications. However, the accurate identification of human activity types (HATs) from social media is challenging, possibly because interactions between posts and users at different time are overlooked. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model that introduces the interactions hidden in social media and synthesizes Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying HAT. The model first characterizes interactions among words, posts, dates, and users, and then derives a Time Gated Human Activity Graph Convolutional Network (TG-HAGCN) to predict the HATs of social media trajectory. To examine the proposed model performance, we built a new dataset including interactions between post content, post time, and users from the open Yelp dataset. Experimental results show that exploiting interactions hidden in social media to recognize HATs achieves state-of-the-art performance with high accuracy. The study indicates that interactions among social media promotes ability of machine learning on social media data mining and intelligent applications, and offers a reference solution for how to fuse multi-type heterogeneous data in social media.

AB  - Wireless and mobile health applications promote the development of smart healthcare. Effective diagnosis and feedbacks of remote health data pose significant challenges due to streaming data, high noise, network latency and user privacy. Therefore, we explore efficient edge and cloud design to maintain electrocardiogram classification performance while reducing the communication cost. These contributions include: (1) We introduce a hybrid smart medical architecture named edge convolutional neural networks (EdgeCNN) that balances the capability of edge and cloud computing to address the issue for agile learning of healthcare data from IoT devices. (2) We present an effective deep learning model for electrocardiogram (ECG) inference, which can be deployed to run on edge smart devices for low-latency diagnosis. (3) We design a data enhancement method for ECG based on deep convolutional generative adversarial network to expand ECG data volume. (4) We carried out experiments on two representative datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the deep learning model of ECG classification based on EdgeCNN. EdgeCNN shows superior to traditional cloud medical systems in terms of network Input/Output (I/O) pressure, architecture cost and system high availability. The deep learning model not only ensures high diagnostic accuracy, but also has advantages in aspect of inference time, storage, running memory and power consumption.

AB  - Urban systems involve a multitude of closely intertwined components, which are more measurable than before due to new sensors, data collection, and spatio-temporal analysis methods. Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the &lsquo;forest&rsquo; of data, and to miss the &lsquo;trees&rsquo; of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole &lsquo;forest&rsquo; of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Home Automation Systems (HAS) attracted much attention during the last decade due to the developments in new wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth 4.0, 5G, WiFi 6, etc. In order to enable automation as a service in smart homes, a number of challenges must be addressed, such as fulfilling the electrical energy demands, scheduling the operational time of appliances, applying machine learning models in real-time, optimal human appliances interaction, etc. In order to address the aforementioned challenges and control the wastage of energy due to the lifestyle of the home users, we propose a system for automatically controlling the energy consumption by employing machine and deep learning techniques to smart home networks. The proposed system works in three phases, (1) feature extraction and classification based on 1-dimensional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (1D-DCNN) which extract important energy patterns from the historic energy data, (2) a load forecasting system based on Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to forecast the load based on the extracted features in phase 1 and (3) a scheduling algorithm based on the forecasted data obtained from phase 2 is designed to schedule the operational time of smart home appliances. The proposed scheme efficiently automates the smart home appliances to consume less energy while adapting to the lifestyle of smart home users. The validation of the proposed scheme is tested with a number of simulation scenarios incorporating datasets from authentic data sources. The simulation results show that the proposed smart home automation system can be a game-changer in fulfilling the energy demands of the home users without installing renewable and other energy sources in the future.

AB  - Activity recognition can provide useful information about an older individual&rsquo;s activity level and encourage older people to become more active to live longer in good health. This study aimed to develop an activity recognition algorithm for smartphone accelerometry data of older people. Deep learning algorithms, including convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), were evaluated in this study. Smartphone accelerometry data of free-living activities, performed by 53 older people (83.8 &plusmn; 3.8 years; 38 male) under standardized circumstances, were classified into lying, sitting, standing, transition, walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. A 1D CNN, a multichannel CNN, a CNN-LSTM, and a multichannel CNN-LSTM model were tested. The models were compared on accuracy and computational efficiency. Results show that the multichannel CNN-LSTM model achieved the best classification results, with an 81.1% accuracy and an acceptable model and time complexity. Specifically, the accuracy was 67.0% for lying, 70.7% for sitting, 88.4% for standing, 78.2% for transitions, 88.7% for walking, 65.7% for walking downstairs, and 68.7% for walking upstairs. The findings indicated that the multichannel CNN-LSTM model was feasible for smartphone-based activity recognition in older people.

AB  - Recently, developing countries have steadily been pushing for the construction of stream-oriented smart cities, breaking away from the existing old-town-centered development in the past. Due to the accelerating effects of climate change along with such urbanization, it is imperative for urban rivers to establish a flood warning system that can predict the amount of high flow rates of accuracy in engineering, compared to using the existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models for disaster prevention. In this study, in the case of streams where missing data existed or only small observations were obtained, the variation in flow rates could be predicted with only the appropriate deep learning models, using only limited time series flow data. In addition, the selected deep learning model allowed the minimum number of input learning data to be determined. In this study, the time series flow rates were predicted by applying the deep learning models to the Han River, which is a highly urbanized stream that flows through the capital of Korea, Seoul and has a large seasonal variation in the flow rate. The deep learning models used are Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Sequence lengths for time series runoff data were determined first to assess the accuracy and applicability of the deep learning models. By analyzing the forecast results of the outflow data of the Han River, sequence length for 14 days was appropriate in terms of the predicted accuracy of the model. In addition, the GRU model is effective for deep learning models that use time series data of the region with large fluctuations in flow rates, such as the Han River. Furthermore, through this study, it was possible to propose the minimum number of training data that could provide flood warning system with an effective flood forecasting system although the number of input data such as flow rates secured in new towns developed around rivers was insufficient.

SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - Advancement of accurate models for predicting real estate price is of utmost importance for urban development and several critical economic functions. Due to the significant uncertainties and dynamic variables, modeling real estate has been studied as complex systems. In this study, a novel machine learning method is proposed to tackle real estate modeling complexity. Call detail records (CDR) provides excellent opportunities for in-depth investigation of the mobility characterization. This study explores the CDR potential for predicting the real estate price with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). Several essential mobility entropy factors, including dweller entropy, dweller gyration, workers’ entropy, worker gyration, dwellers’ work distance, and workers’ home distance, are used as input variables. The prediction model is developed using the machine learning method of multi-layered perceptron (MLP) trained with the evolutionary algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO). Model performance is evaluated using mean square error (MSE), sustainability index (SI), and Willmott’s index (WI). The proposed model showed promising results revealing that the workers’ entropy and the dwellers’ work distances directly influence the real estate price. However, the dweller gyration, dweller entropy, workers’ gyration, and the workers’ home had a minimum effect on the price. Furthermore, it is shown that the flow of activities and entropy of mobility are often associated with the regions with lower real estate prices.

SN  - 2227-7390

AB  - Monitoring the distribution of vehicles across the city is of great importance for urban traffic control. In particular, information on the number of vehicles entering and leaving a city, or moving between urban areas, gives a valuable estimate on potential bottlenecks and congestions. The possibility of predicting such flows in advance is even more beneficial, allowing for timely traffic management strategies and targeted congestion warnings. Our work is inserted in the context of short-term forecasting, aiming to predict rapid changes and sudden variations in the traffic volume, beyond the general trend. Moreover, it concurrently targets multiple locations in the city, providing an instant prediction outcome comprising the future distribution of vehicles across several urban locations. Specifically, we propose a multi-target deep learning regressor for simultaneous predictions of traffic volumes, in multiple entry and exit points among city neighborhoods. The experiment focuses on an hourly forecasting of the amount of vehicles accessing and moving between New York City neighborhoods through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) bridges and tunnels. By leveraging a single training process for all location points, and an instant one-step volume inference for every location at each time update, our sequential modeling approach is able to grasp rapid variations in the time series and process the collective information of all entry and exit points, whose distinct predicted values are outputted at once. The multi-target model, based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network layers, was tested on a real-world dataset, achieving an average prediction error of 7% and demonstrating its feasibility for short-term spatially-distributed urban traffic forecasting.

AB  - In the last few years, with the exponential diffusion of smartphones, services for turn-by-turn navigation have seen a surge in popularity. Current solutions available in the market allow the user to select via an interface the desired transportation mode, for which an optimal route is then computed. Automatically recognizing the transportation system that the user is travelling by allows to dynamically control, and consequently update, the route proposed to the user. Such a dynamic approach is an enabling technology for multi-modal transportation planners, in which the optimal path and its associated transportation solutions are updated in real-time based on data coming from (i) distributed sensors (e.g., smart traffic lights, road congestion sensors, etc.); (ii) service providers (e.g., car-sharing availability, bus waiting time, etc.); and (iii) the user&rsquo;s own device, in compliance with the development of smart cities envisaged by the 5G architecture. In this paper, we present a series of Machine Learning approaches for real-time Transportation Mode Recognition and we report their performance difference in our field tests. Several Machine Learning-based classifiers, including Deep Neural Networks, built on both statistical feature extraction and raw data analysis are presented and compared in this paper; the result analysis also highlights which features are proven to be the most informative ones for the classification.

AB  - This article presents a system for detecting pedestrian movement patterns in urban environments, by applying computational intelligence methods for image processing and pattern detection. The proposed system is capable of processing multiple images and video sources in real-time. Furthermore, it has a flexible design, as it is based on a pipes and filters architecture that makes it easy to evaluate different computational intelligence techniques to address the subproblems involved in each stage of the process. Two main stages are implemented in the proposed system: the first stage is in charge of extracting relevant features of the processed images, by applying image processing and object tracking, and the second stage is responsible for the patterns detection. The experimental analysis of the proposed system was performed over more than 1450 problem instances, using PETS09-S2L1 videos, and the results were compared with part of the Multiple Object Tracking Challenge benchmark results. Experiments covered the two main stages of the system. Results indicate that the proposed system is competitive yet simpler than other similar software methods. Overall, this article provides the theoretical frame and a proof of concept needed for the implementation of a real-time system that takes as input a group of image sequences, extracts relevant features, and detects a set of predefined patterns. The proposed implementation is a reliable proof of the viability of building pedestrian movement pattern detection systems.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Building extraction from high spatial resolution remote sensing images is a hot spot in the field of remote sensing applications and computer vision. This paper presents a semantic segmentation model, which is a supervised method, named Pyramid Self-Attention Network (PISANet). Its structure is simple, because it contains only two parts: one is the backbone of the network, which is used to learn the local features (short distance context information around the pixel) of buildings from the image; the other part is the pyramid self-attention module, which is used to obtain the global features (long distance context information with other pixels in the image) and the comprehensive features (includes color, texture, geometric and high-level semantic feature) of the building. The network is an end-to-end approach. In the training stage, the input is the remote sensing image and corresponding label, and the output is probability map (the probability that each pixel is or is not building). In the prediction stage, the input is the remote sensing image, and the output is the extraction result of the building. The complexity of the network structure was reduced so that it is easy to implement. The proposed PISANet was tested on two datasets. The result shows that the overall accuracy reached 94.50 and 96.15%, the intersection-over-union reached 77.45 and 87.97%, and F1 index reached 87.27 and 93.55%, respectively. In experiments on different datasets, PISANet obtained high overall accuracy, low error rate and improved integrity of individual buildings.

AB  - In this work, an exhaustive revision is given of the literature associated with advanced information and communication technologies in agriculture within a window of 25 years using bibliometric tools enabled to detect of the main actors, structure, and dynamics in the scientific papers. The main findings are a trend of growth in the dynamics of publications associated with advanced information and communication technologies in agriculture productivity. Another assertion is that countries, like the USA, China, and Brazil, stand out in many publications due to allocating more resources to research, development, and agricultural productivity. In addition, the collaboration networks between countries are frequently in regions with closer cultural and idiomatic ties; additionally, terms&rsquo; occurrence are obtained with Louvain algorithm predominating four clusters: precision agriculture, smart agriculture, remote sensing, and climate smart agriculture. Finally, the thematic-map characterization with Callon&rsquo;s density and centrality is applied in three periods. The first period of thematic analysis shows a transition in detecting the variability of a nutrient, such as nitrogen, through the help of immature georeferenced techniques, towards greater remote sensing involvement. In the transition from the second to the third stage, the maturation of technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, wireless sensor networks, and the machine learning area, is observed.

AB  - Air pollution is becoming a rising and serious environmental problem, especially in urban areas affected by an increasing migration rate. The large availability of sensor data enables the adoption of analytical tools to provide decision support capabilities. Employing sensors facilitates air pollution monitoring, but the lack of predictive capability limits such systems&rsquo; potential in practical scenarios. On the other hand, forecasting methods offer the opportunity to predict the future pollution in specific areas, potentially suggesting useful preventive measures. To date, many works tackled the problem of air pollution forecasting, most of which are based on sequence models. These models are trained with raw pollution data and are subsequently utilized to make predictions. This paper proposes a novel approach evaluating four different architectures that utilize camera images to estimate the air pollution in those areas. These images are further enhanced with weather data to boost the classification accuracy. The proposed approach exploits generative adversarial networks combined with data augmentation techniques to mitigate the class imbalance problem. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves robust accuracy of up to 0.88, which is comparable to sequence models and conventional models that utilize air pollution data. This is a remarkable result considering that the historic air pollution data is directly related to the output&mdash;future air pollution data, whereas the proposed architecture uses camera images to recognize the air pollution&mdash;which is an inherently much more difficult problem.

AB  - With the Industry 4.0 paradigm comes the convergence of the Internet Technologies and Operational Technologies, and concepts, such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), cloud manufacturing, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and so on. These concepts bring industries into the big data era and allow for them to have access to potentially useful information in order to optimise the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE); however, most European industries still rely on the Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) model, where the production systems run as independent systems (i.e., without any communication with the upper levels). Those production systems are controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller, in which a static and rigid program is implemented. This program is static and rigid in a sense that the programmed routines cannot evolve over the time unless a human modifies it. However, to go further in terms of flexibility, we are convinced that it requires moving away from the aforementioned old-fashioned and rigid automation to a ML-based automation, i.e., where the control itself is based on the decisions that were taken by ML algorithms. In order to verify this, we applied a time series classification method on a scale model of a factory using real industrial controllers, and widened the variety of parts the production line has to treat. This study shows that satisfactory results can be obtained only at the expense of the human expertise (i.e., in the industrial process and in the ML process).

AB  - The significant advances in wireless networks in the past decade have made a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) use cases possible, greatly facilitating many operations in our daily lives. IoT is only expected to grow with 5G and beyond networks, which will primarily rely on software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization for achieving the promised quality of service. The prevalence of IoT and the large attack surface that it has created calls for SDN-based intelligent security solutions that achieve real-time, automated intrusion detection and mitigation. In this paper, we propose a real-time intrusion detection and mitigation solution for SDN, which aims to provide autonomous security in the high-traffic IoT networks of the 5G and beyond era, while achieving a high degree of interpretability by human experts. The proposed approach is built upon automated flow feature extraction and classification of flows while using random forest classifiers at the SDN application layer. We present an SDN-specific dataset that we generated for IoT and provide results on the accuracy of intrusion detection in addition to performance results in the presence and absence of our proposed security mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed security approach is promising for achieving real-time, highly accurate detection and mitigation of attacks in SDN-managed IoT networks.

AB  - The semantic segmentation of a brain tumor is of paramount importance for its treatment and prevention. Recently, researches have proposed various neural network-based architectures to improve the performance of segmentation of brain tumor sub-regions. Brain tumor segmentation, being a challenging area of research, requires improvement in its performance. This paper proposes a 2D image segmentation method, BU-Net, to contribute to brain tumor segmentation research. Residual extended skip (RES) and wide context (WC) are used along with the customized loss function in the baseline U-Net architecture. The modifications contribute by finding more diverse features, by increasing the valid receptive field. The contextual information is extracted with the aggregating features to get better segmentation performance. The proposed BU-Net was evaluated on the high-grade glioma (HGG) datasets of the BraTS2017 Challenge&mdash;the test datasets of the BraTS 2017 and 2018 Challenge datasets. Three major labels to segmented were tumor core (TC), whole tumor (WT), and enhancing core (EC). To compare the performance quantitatively, the dice score was utilized. The proposed BU-Net outperformed the existing state-of-the-art techniques. The high performing BU-Net can have a great contribution to researchers from the field of bioinformatics and medicine.

AB  - Enhancement of Cultural Heritage such as historical images is very crucial to safeguard the diversity of cultures. Automated colorization of black and white images has been subject to extensive research through computer vision and machine learning techniques. Our research addresses the problem of generating a plausible colored photograph of ancient, historically black, and white images of Nepal using deep learning techniques without direct human intervention. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques in image processing, a feed-forward, deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in combination with Inception- ResnetV2 is being trained by sets of sample images using back-propagation to recognize the pattern in RGB and grayscale values. The trained neural network is then used to predict two a* and b* chroma channels given grayscale, L channel of test images. CNN vividly colorizes images with the help of the fusion layer accounting for local features as well as global features. Two objective functions, namely, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), are employed for objective quality assessment between the estimated color image and its ground truth. The model is trained on the dataset created by ourselves with 1.2 K historical images comprised of old and ancient photographs of Nepal, each having 256 &times; 256 resolution. The loss i.e., MSE, PSNR, and accuracy of the model are found to be 6.08%, 34.65 dB, and 75.23%, respectively. Other than presenting the training results, the public acceptance or subjective validation of the generated images is assessed by means of a user study where the model shows 41.71% of naturalness while evaluating colorization results.

TI  - Sensing Occupancy through Software: Smart Parking Proof of Concept

VL  - 9

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In order to detect the vehicle presence in parking slots, different approaches have been utilized, which range from image recognition to sensing via detection nodes. The last one is usually based on getting the presence data from one or more sensors (commonly magnetic or IR-based), controlled and processed by a micro-controller that sends the data through radio interface. Consequently, given nodes have multiple components, adequate software is required for its control and state-machine to communicate its status to the receiver. This paper presents an alternative, cost-effective beacon-based mechanism for sensing the vehicle presence. It is based on the well-known effect that, once the metallic obstacle (i.e., vehicle) is on top of the sensing node, the signal strength will be attenuated, while the same shall be recognized at the receiver side. Therefore, the signal strength change conveys the information regarding the presence. Algorithms processing signal strength change at the receiver side to estimate the presence are required due to the stochastic nature of signal strength parameters. In order to prove the concept, experimental setup based on LoRa-based parking sensors was used to gather occupancy/signal strength data. In order to extract the information of presence, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was employed with accuracy of up to 96%, while the Neural Network (NN) approach reaches an accuracy of up to 97%. The given approach reduces the costs of the sensor production by at least 50%.

TI  - Hybrid Deep Learning Model Based Indoor Positioning Using Wi-Fi RSSI Heat Maps for Autonomous Applications
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Positioning using Wi-Fi received signal strength indication (RSSI) signals is an effective method for identifying the user positions in an indoor scenario. Wi-Fi RSSI signals in an autonomous system can be easily used for vehicle tracking in underground parking. In Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning, the positioning system estimates the signal strength of the access points (APs) to the receiver and identifies the user&rsquo;s indoor positions. The existing Wi-Fi RSSI based positioning systems use raw RSSI signals obtained from APs and estimate the user positions. These raw RSSI signals can easily fluctuate and be interfered with by the indoor channel conditions. This signal interference in the indoor channel condition reduces localization performance of these existing Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning systems. To enhance their performance and reduce the positioning error, we propose a hybrid deep learning model (HDLM) based indoor positioning system. The proposed HDLM based positioning system uses RSSI heat maps instead of raw RSSI signals from APs. This results in better localization performance for Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning systems. When compared to the existing Wi-Fi RSSI based positioning technologies such as fingerprint, trilateration, and Wi-Fi fusion approaches, the proposed approach achieves reasonably better positioning results for indoor localization. The experiment results show that a combination of convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM) used in the proposed HDLM outperforms other deep learning models and gives a smaller localization error than conventional Wi-Fi RSSI signal based localization approaches. From the experiment result analysis, the proposed system can be easily implemented for autonomous applications.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - This paper uses a neural network approach transformer of taxi driver behavior to predict the next destination with geographical factors. The problem of predicting the next destination is a well-studied application of human mobility, for reducing traffic congestion and optimizing the electronic dispatching system&rsquo;s performance. According to the Intelligent Transport System (ITS), this kind of task is usually modeled as a multi-class problem. We propose the novel model Deep Wide Spatial-Temporal-Based Transformer Networks (DWSTTNs). In our approach, the encoder and decoder are the transformer&rsquo;s primary units; with the help of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN), we encode the geographical information based on visited semantic locations. In particular, we trained our model for the exact longitude and latitude coordinates to predict the next destination. The benefit in the real world of this kind of research is to reduce the customer waiting time for a ride and driver waiting time to pick up a customer. Taxi companies can also optimize their management to improve their company&rsquo;s service, while urban transport planner can use this information to better plan the urban traffic. We conducted extensive experiments on two real-word datasets, Porto and Manhattan, and the performance was improved compared to the previous models.

AB  - During the past few decades, the need to intervene in underwater scenarios has grown due to the increasing necessity to perform tasks like underwater infrastructure inspection and maintenance or archaeology and geology exploration. In the last few years, the usage of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) has eased the workload and risks of such interventions. To automate these tasks, the AUVs have to gather the information of their surroundings, interpret it and make decisions based on it. The two main perception modalities used at close range are laser and video. In this paper, we propose the usage of a deep neural network to recognise pipes and valves in multiple underwater scenarios, using 3D RGB point cloud information provided by a stereo camera. We generate a diverse and rich dataset for the network training and testing, assessing the effect of a broad selection of hyperparameters and values. Results show F1-scores of up to 97.2% for a test set containing images with similar characteristics to the training set and up to 89.3% for a secondary test set containing images taken at different environments and with distinct characteristics from the training set. This work demonstrates the validity and robust training of the PointNet neural in underwater scenarios and its applicability for AUV intervention tasks.

AB  - Interpersonal trust mediates multiple socio-technical systems and has implications for personal and societal well-being. Consequently, it is crucial to devise novel machine learning methods to infer interpersonal trust automatically using mobile sensor-based behavioral data. Considering that social relationships are often affected by neighboring relationships within the same network, this work proposes using a novel neighbor-aware deep learning architecture (NADAL) to enhance the inference of interpersonal trust scores. Based on analysis of call, SMS, and Bluetooth interaction data from a one-year field study involving 130 participants, we report that: (1) adding information about neighboring relationships improves trust score prediction in both shallow and deep learning approaches; and (2) a custom-designed neighbor-aware deep learning architecture outperforms a baseline feature concatenation based deep learning approach. The results obtained at interpersonal trust prediction are promising and have multiple implications for trust-aware applications in the emerging social internet of things.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - To safely protect workplaces and the workforce during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, a scalable integrated sensing solution is required in order to offer real-time situational awareness and early warnings for decision-makers. However, an information-based solution for industry reopening is ineffective when the necessary operational information is locked up in disparate real-time data silos. There is a lot of ongoing effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic using different combinations of low-cost, location-based contact tracing, and sensing technologies. These ad hoc Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for COVID-19 were developed using different data models and protocols without an interoperable way to interconnect these heterogeneous systems and exchange data on people and place interactions. This research aims to design and develop an interoperable Internet of COVID-19 Things (IoCT) architecture that is able to exchange, aggregate, and reuse disparate IoT sensor data sources in order for informed decisions to be made after understanding the real-time risks in workplaces based on person-to-place interactions. The IoCT architecture is based on the Sensor Web paradigm that connects various Things, Sensors, and Datastreams with an indoor geospatial data model. This paper presents a study of what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first real-world integrated implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) and IndoorGML standards to calculate the risk of COVID-19 online using a workplace reopening case study. The proposed IoCT offers a new open standard-based information model, architecture, methodologies, and software tools that enable the interoperability of disparate COVID-19 monitoring systems with finer spatial-temporal granularity. A workplace cleaning use case was developed in order to demonstrate the capabilities of this proposed IoCT architecture. The implemented IoCT architecture included proximity-based contact tracing, people density sensors, a COVID-19 risky behavior monitoring system, and the contextual building geospatial data.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The accurate forecasting of the hourly month-ahead electricity consumption represents a very important aspect for non-household electricity consumers and system operators, and at the same time represents a key factor in what regards energy efficiency and achieving sustainable economic, business, and management operations. In this context, we have devised, developed, and validated within the paper an hourly month ahead electricity consumption forecasting method. This method is based on a bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) artificial neural network (ANN) enhanced with a multiple simultaneously decreasing delays approach coupled with function fitting neural networks (FITNETs). The developed method targets the hourly month-ahead total electricity consumption at the level of a commercial center-type consumer and for the hourly month ahead consumption of its refrigerator storage room. The developed approach offers excellent forecasting results, highlighted by the validation stage&rsquo;s results along with the registered performance metrics, namely 0.0495 for the root mean square error (RMSE) performance metric for the total hourly month-ahead electricity consumption and 0.0284 for the refrigerator storage room. We aimed for and managed to attain an hourly month-ahead consumed electricity prediction without experiencing a significant drop in the forecasting accuracy that usually tends to occur after the first two weeks, therefore achieving a reliable method that satisfies the contractor&rsquo;s needs, being able to enhance his/her activity from the economic, business, and management perspectives. Even if the devised, developed, and validated forecasting solution for the hourly consumption targets a commercial center-type consumer, based on its accuracy, this solution can also represent a useful tool for other non-household electricity consumers due to its generalization capability.

AB  - Ensuring the confidentiality of private data stored in our technological devices is a fundamental aspect for protecting our personal and professional information. Authentication procedures are among the main methods used to achieve this protection and, typically, are implemented only when accessing the device. Nevertheless, in many occasions it is necessary to carry out user authentication in a continuous manner to guarantee an allowed use of the device while protecting authentication data. In this work, we first review the state of the art of Continuous Authentication (CA), User Profiling (UP), and related biometric databases. Secondly, we summarize the privacy-preserving methods employed to protect the security of sensor-based data used to conduct user authentication, and some practical examples of their utilization. The analysis of the literature of these topics reveals the importance of sensor-based data to protect personal and professional information, as well as the need for exploring a combination of more biometric features with privacy-preserving approaches.

TI  - SIoT: A New Strategy to Improve the Network Lifetime with an Efficient Search Process
T2  - Future Internet

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) means that every node can use a set of nodes that are considered as friends to search for a specific service. However, this is a slow process because each node is required to manage a high number of friends. Thus, the SIoT issue consists of how to select the right friends that improve the network navigability. The enhancement of the network navigability boosts the search for a service to be rapid but not guaranteed. Furthermore, sending requests from the shortest paths involves the rapid search, but the network lifetime can be reduced due to the number of requests that can be transmitted and processed by the nodes that have low power energy. This paper proposes a new approach that improves the network navigability, speeds up the search process, and increases the network lifetime. This approach aims at creating groups dynamically by nodes where each group has a master node, second, using a consensus algorithm between master nodes to agree with a specific capability, finally adopting a friendship selection method to create a social network. Thus, the friends will be sorted periodically for the objective of creating simultaneously a balance between the energy consumption and the rapid search process. Simulation results on the Brightkite location-based online social network dataset demonstrate that our proposal outperforms baseline methods in terms of some parameters of network navigability, path length to reach the providers, and network lifetime.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Because of extensive variations in occupancy patterns around office space environments and their use of electrical equipment, accurate occupants&rsquo; behaviour detection is valuable for reducing the building energy demand and carbon emissions. Using the collected occupancy information, building energy management system can automatically adjust the operation of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to meet the actual demands in different conditioned spaces in real-time. Existing and commonly used &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; schedules for HVAC systems are not sufficient and cannot adjust based on the dynamic changes in building environments. This study proposes a vision-based occupancy and equipment usage detection method based on deep learning for demand-driven control systems. A model based on region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) was developed, trained and deployed to a camera for real-time detection of occupancy activities and equipment usage. Experiments tests within a case study office room suggested an overall accuracy of 97.32% and 80.80%. In order to predict the energy savings that can be attained using the proposed approach, the case study building was simulated. The simulation results revealed that the heat gains could be over or under predicted when using static or fixed profiles. Based on the set conditions, the equipment and occupancy gains were 65.75% and 32.74% lower when using the deep learning approach. Overall, the study showed the capabilities of the proposed approach in detecting and recognising multiple occupants&rsquo; activities and equipment usage and providing an alternative to estimate the internal heat emissions.

AB  - The demand for electricity is increased due to the development of the industry, the electrification of transport, the rise of household demand, and the increase in demand for digitally connected devices and air conditioning systems. For that, solutions and actions should be developed for greater consumers of electricity. For instance, MG (Micro-grid) buildings are one of the main consumers of electricity, and if they are correctly constructed, controlled, and operated, a significant energy saving can be attained. As a solution, hybrid RES (renewable energy source) systems are proposed, offering the possibility for simple consumers to be producers of electricity. This hybrid system contains different renewable generators connected to energy storage systems, making it possible to locally produce a part of energy in order to minimize the consumption from the utility grid. This work gives a concise state-of-the-art overview of the main control approaches for energy management in MG systems. Principally, this study is carried out in order to define the suitable control approach for MGs for energy management in buildings. A classification of approaches is also given in order to shed more light on the need for predictive control for energy management in MGs.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Detection of weeds and crops is the key step for precision spraying using the spraying herbicide robot and precise fertilization for the agriculture machine in the field. On the basis of k-mean clustering image segmentation using color information and connected region analysis, a method combining multi feature fusion and support vector machine (SVM) was proposed to identify and detect the position of corn seedlings and weeds, to reduce the harm of weeds on corn growth, and to achieve accurate fertilization, thereby realizing precise weeding or fertilizing. First, the image dataset for weed and corn seedling classification in the corn seedling stage was established. Second, many different features of corn seedlings and weeds were extracted, and dimensionality was reduced by principal component analysis, including the histogram of oriented gradient feature, rotation invariant local binary pattern (LBP) feature, Hu invariant moment feature, Gabor feature, gray level co-occurrence matrix, and gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix. Then, the classifier training based on SVM was conducted to obtain the recognition model for corn seedlings and weeds. The comprehensive recognition performance of single feature or different fusion strategies for six features is compared and analyzed, and the optimal feature fusion strategy is obtained. Finally, by utilizing the actual corn seedling field images, the proposed weed and corn seedling detection method effect was tested. LAB color space and K-means clustering were used to achieve image segmentation. Connected component analysis was adopted to remove small objects. The previously trained recognition model was utilized to identify and label each connected region to identify and detect weeds and corn seedlings. The experimental results showed that the fusion feature combination of rotation invariant LBP feature and gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix based on SVM classifier obtained the highest classification accuracy and accurately detected all kinds of weeds and corn seedlings. It provided information on weed and crop positions to the spraying herbicide robot for accurate spraying or to the precise fertilization machine for accurate fertilizing.

AB  - In smart city scenarios, the huge proliferation of monitoring cameras scattered in public spaces has posed many challenges to network and processing infrastructure. A few dozen cameras are enough to saturate the city&rsquo;s backbone. In addition, most smart city applications require a real-time response from the system in charge of processing such large-scale video streams. Finding a missing person using facial recognition technology is one of these applications that require immediate action on the place where that person is. In this paper, we tackle these challenges presenting a distributed system for video analytics designed to leverage edge computing capabilities. Our approach encompasses architecture, methods, and algorithms for: (i) dividing the burdensome processing of large-scale video streams into various machine learning tasks; and (ii) deploying these tasks as a workflow of data processing in edge devices equipped with hardware accelerators for neural networks. We also propose the reuse of nodes running tasks shared by multiple applications, e.g., facial recognition, thus improving the system&rsquo;s processing throughput. Simulations showed that, with our algorithm to distribute the workload, the time to process a workflow is about 33% faster than a naive approach.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Cloud computing use is exponentially increasing with the advent of industrial revolution 4.0 technologies such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and digital transformations. These technologies require cloud data centers to process massive volumes of workloads. As a result, the data centers consume gigantic amounts of electrical energy, and a large portion of data center electrical energy comes from fossil fuels. It causes greenhouse gas emissions and thus ensuing in global warming. An adaptive resource utilization mechanism of cloud data center resources is vital to get by with this huge problem. The adaptive system will estimate the resource utilization and then adjust the resources accordingly. Cloud resource utilization estimation is a two-fold challenging task. First, the cloud workloads are sundry, and second, clients&rsquo; requests are uneven. In the literature, several machine learning models have estimated cloud resources, of which artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown better performance. Conventional ANNs have a fixed topology and allow only to train their weights either by back-propagation or neuroevolution such as a genetic algorithm. In this paper, we propose Cartesian genetic programming (CGP) neural network (CGPNN). The CGPNN enhances the performance of conventional ANN by allowing training of both its parameters and topology, and it uses a built-in sliding window. We have trained CGPNN with parallel neuroevolution that searches for global optimum through numerous directions. The resource utilization traces of the Bitbrains data center is used for validation of the proposed CGPNN and compared results with machine learning models from the literature on the same data set. The proposed method has outstripped the machine learning models from the literature and resulted in 97% prediction accuracy.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper compares the operation of a decentralized Nash bargaining traffic signal controller (DNB) to the operation of state-of-the-art adaptive and gating traffic signal control. Perimeter control (gating), based on the network fundamental diagram (NFD), was applied on the borders of a protected urban network (PN) to prevent and/or disperse traffic congestion. The operation of gating control and local adaptive controllers was compared to the operation of the developed DNB traffic signal controller. The controllers were implemented and their performance assessed on a grid network in the INTEGRATION microscopic simulation software. The results show that the DNB controller, although not designed to solve perimeter control problems, successfully prevents congestion from building inside the PN and improves the performance of the entire network. Specifically, the DNB controller outperforms both gating and non-gating controllers, with reductions in the average travel time ranging between 21% and 41%, total delay ranging between 40% and 55%, and emission levels/fuel consumption ranging between 12% and 20%. The results demonstrate statistically significant benefits of using the developed DNB controller over other state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized gating/adaptive traffic signal controllers.

AB  - Predictive maintenance is a field of research that has emerged from the need to improve the systems in place. This research focuses on controlling the degradation of photovoltaic (PV) modules in outdoor solar panels, which are exposed to a variety of climatic loads. Improved reliability, operation, and performance can be achieved through monitoring. In this study, a system capable of predicting the output power of a solar module was implemented. It monitors different parameters and uses automatic learning techniques for prediction. Its use improved reliability, operation, and performance. On the other hand, automatic learning algorithms were evaluated with different metrics in order to optimize and find the best configuration that provides an optimal solution to the problem. With the aim of increasing the share of renewable energy penetration, an architectural proposal based on Edge Computing was included to implement the proposed model into a system. The proposed model is designated for outdoor predictions and offers many advantages, such as monitoring of individual panels, optimization of system response, and speed of communication with the Cloud. The final objective of the work was to contribute to the smart Energy system concept, providing solutions for planning the entire energy system together with the identification of suitable energy infrastructure designs and operational strategies.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - While low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies have been studied extensively for a broad spectrum of smart city applications, their potential for water distribution system monitoring in high temporal resolution has not been studied in detail. However, due to their low power demand, these technologies offer new possibilities for operating pressure-monitoring devices for near real-time leak detection in water distribution systems (WDS). By combining long-distance wireless communication with low power consumption, LPWAN technologies promise long periods of maintenance-free device operation without having to rely on an external power source. This is of particular importance for pressure-based leak detection where optimal sensor positions are often located in the periphery of WDS without a suitable power source. To assess the potential of these technologies for replacing widely-used wireless communication technologies for leak detection, GPRS is compared with the LPWAN standards Narrowband IoT, long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) and Sigfox. Based on sampling and transmission rates commonly applied in leak detection, the ability of these three technologies to replace GPRS is analyzed based on a self-developed low-power pressure-monitoring device and a simplified, linear energy-consumption model. The results indicate that even though some of the analyzed LPWAN technologies may suffer from contractual and technical limitations, all of them offer viable alternatives, meeting the requirements of leak detection in WDS. In accordance with existing research on data transmission with these technologies, the findings of this work show that even while retaining a compact design, which entails a limited battery capacity, pressure-monitoring devices can exceed runtimes of 5 years, as required for installation at water meters in Austria. Thus, LPWAN technologies have the potential to advance the wide application of near real-time, pressure-based leak detection in WDS, while simultaneously reducing the cost of device operation significantly.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Currently, it is becoming increasingly common to find numerous electronic devices installed in office and residential spaces as part of building automation solutions. These devices provide a rich set of data related to the inside and outside environment, such as indoor and outdoor temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. However, commercial of-the-shelf climatic control systems continue to rely on simple controllers like proportional-integral-derivative or even on-off, which do not take into account such variables. This work evaluates the potential performance gains of adopting more advanced controllers, in this case based on pole-placement, enhanced with additional variables, namely solar radiation and external temperature, obtained with dedicated low-cost sensors. This approach is evaluated both in simulated and real-world environments. The obtained results show that pole-placement controllers clearly outperform on-off controllers and that the use of the additional variables in pole-placement controllers allows relevant performance gains in key parameters such as error signal MSE (17%) and control signal variance (40%), when compared with simple PP controllers. The observed energy consumption savings obtained by using the additional variables are marginal (&asymp;1%, but the reduction of the error signal MSE and control signal variance have a significant impact on energy consumption peaks and on equipment lifetime, thus largely compensating the increase in the system complexity.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, there has been a massive increase in the amount of Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as the data generated by such devices. The participating devices in IoT networks can be problematic due to their resource-constrained nature, and integrating security on these devices is often overlooked. This has resulted in attackers having an increased incentive to target IoT devices. As the number of attacks possible on a network increases, it becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to cope with these attacks efficiently. In this paper, we highlight several machine learning (ML) methods such as k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and logistic regression (LR) that can be used in IDS. In this work, ML algorithms are compared for both binary and multi-class classification on Bot-IoT dataset. Based on several parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss, we experimentally compared the aforementioned ML algorithms. In the case of HTTP distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the accuracy of RF is 99%. Furthermore, other simulation results-based precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss metric reveal that RF outperforms on all types of attacks in binary classification. However, in multi-class classification, KNN outperforms other ML algorithms with an accuracy of 99%, which is 4% higher than RF.

AB  - The modern control infrastructure that manages and monitors the communication between the smart machines represents the most effective way to increase the efficiency of the industrial environment, such as smart grids. The cyber-physical systems utilize the embedded software and internet to connect and control the smart machines that are addressed by the internet of things (IoT). These cyber-physical systems are the basis of the fourth industrial revolution which is indexed by industry 4.0. In particular, industry 4.0 relies heavily on the IoT and smart sensors such as smart energy meters. The reliability and security represent the main challenges that face the industry 4.0 implementation. This paper introduces a new infrastructure based on machine learning to analyze and monitor the output data of the smart meters to investigate if this data is real data or fake. The fake data are due to the hacking and the inefficient meters. The industrial environment affects the efficiency of the meters by temperature, humidity, and noise signals. Furthermore, the proposed infrastructure validates the amount of data loss via communication channels and the internet connection. The decision tree is utilized as an effective machine learning algorithm to carry out both regression and classification for the meters&rsquo; data. The data monitoring is carried based on the industrial digital twins&rsquo; platform. The proposed infrastructure results provide a reliable and effective industrial decision that enhances the investments in industry 4.0.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Improving road safety through artificial intelligence is now crucial to achieving more secure smart cities. With this objective, a mobile app based on the integration of the smartphone sensors and a fuzzy logic strategy to determine the pedestrian&rsquo;s crossing intention around crosswalks is presented. The app developed also allows the calculation, tracing and guidance of safe routes thanks to an optimization algorithm that includes pedestrian areas on the paths generated over the whole city through a cloud database (i.e., zebra crossings, pedestrian streets and walkways). The experimentation carried out consisted in testing the fuzzy logic strategy with a total of 31 volunteers crossing and walking around a crosswalk. For that, the fuzzy logic approach was subjected to a total of 3120 samples generated by the volunteers. It has been proven that a smartphone can be successfully used as a crossing intention detector system with an accuracy of 98.63%, obtaining a true positive rate of 98.27% and a specificity of 99.39% according to a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Finally, a total of 30 routes were calculated by the proposed algorithm and compared with Google Maps considering the values of time, distance and safety along the routes. As a result, the routes generated by the proposed algorithm were safer than the routes obtained with Google Maps, achieving an increase in the use of safe pedestrian areas of at least 183%.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Assuring the safety of automated vehicles is essential for their timely introduction and acceptance by policymakers and the public. To assess their safe design and robust decision making in response to all possible scenarios, new methods that use a scenario-based testing approach are needed, as testing on public roads in normal traffic would require driving millions of kilometres. We make use of the scenario-based testing approach and propose a method to model simulated scenarios using Gaussian Process based models to predict untested scenario outcomes. This enables us to efficiently determine the performance boundary, where the safe and unsafe scenarios can be evidently distinguished from each other. We present an iterative method that optimises the parameter space of a logical scenario towards the most critical scenarios on this performance boundary. Additionally, we conduct a novel probabilistic sensitivity analysis by efficiently computing several variance-based sensitivity indices using the Gaussian Process models and evaluate the relative importance of the scenario input parameters on the scenario outcome. We critically evaluate and investigate the usefulness of the proposed Gaussian Process based approach as a very efficient surrogate model, which can model the logical scenarios effectively in the presence of uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied on an exemplary logical scenario and shows viability in finding concrete critical scenarios. The reported results, derived from the proposed approach, could pave the way to more efficient testing of automated vehicles and instruct further physical tests on the determined critical scenarios.

PY  - 2021

IS  - 2
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Herein, we proposed a multi-scale multi-band dilated time-frequency densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) with long short-term memory (LSTM) for audio source separation. Because the spectrogram of the acoustic signal can be thought of as images as well as time series data, it is suitable for convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture. We improved the audio source separation performance by applying the dilated block with a dilated convolution to CRNN architecture. The dilated block has the role of effectively increasing the receptive field in the spectrogram. In addition, it was designed in consideration of the acoustic characteristics that the frequency axis and the time axis in the spectrogram are changed by independent influences such as speech rate and pitch. In speech enhancement experiments, we estimated the speech signal using various deep learning architectures from a signal in which the music, noise, and speech were mixed. We conducted the subjective evaluation on the estimated speech signal. In addition, speech quality, intelligibility, separation, and speech recognition performance were also measured. In music signal separation, we estimated the music signal using several deep learning architectures from the mixture of the music and speech signal. After that, the separation performance and music identification accuracy were measured using the estimated music signal. Overall, the proposed architecture shows the best performance compared to other deep learning architectures not only in speech experiments but also in music experiments.

AB  - The rapid growth of new computing models that exploit the cloud continuum has a big impact on the adoption of microservices, especially in dynamic environments where the amount of workload varies over time or when Internet of Things (IoT) devices dynamically change their geographic location. In order to exploit the true potential of cloud continuum computing applications, it is essential to use a comprehensive set of various intricate technologies together. This complex blend of technologies currently raises data interoperability problems in such modern computing frameworks. Therefore, a semantic model is required to unambiguously specify notions of various concepts employed in cloud applications. The goal of the present paper is therefore twofold: (i) offering a new model, which allows an easier understanding of microservices within adaptive fog computing frameworks, and (ii) presenting the latest open standards and tools which are now widely used to implement each class defined in our proposed model.

TI  - Integrating Speculation Detection and Deep Learning to Extract Lung Cancer Diagnosis from Clinical Notes
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Despite efforts to develop models for extracting medical concepts from clinical notes, there are still some challenges in particular to be able to relate concepts to dates. The high number of clinical notes written for each single patient, the use of negation, speculation, and different date formats cause ambiguity that has to be solved to reconstruct the patient&rsquo;s natural history. In this paper, we concentrate on extracting from clinical narratives the cancer diagnosis and relating it to the diagnosis date. To address this challenge, a hybrid approach that combines deep learning-based and rule-based methods is proposed. The approach integrates three steps: (i) lung cancer named entity recognition, (ii) negation and speculation detection, and (iii) relating the cancer diagnosis to a valid date. In particular, we apply the proposed approach to extract the lung cancer diagnosis and its diagnosis date from clinical narratives written in Spanish. Results obtained show an F-score of 90% in the named entity recognition task, and a 89% F-score in the task of relating the cancer diagnosis to the diagnosis date. Our findings suggest that speculation detection is together with negation detection a key component to properly extract cancer diagnosis from clinical notes.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Security in IoT networks is currently mandatory, due to the high amount of data that has to be handled. These systems are vulnerable to several cybersecurity attacks, which are increasing in number and sophistication. Due to this reason, new intrusion detection techniques have to be developed, being as accurate as possible for these scenarios. Intrusion detection systems based on machine learning algorithms have already shown a high performance in terms of accuracy. This research proposes the study and evaluation of several preprocessing techniques based on traffic categorization for a machine learning neural network algorithm. This research uses for its evaluation two benchmark datasets, namely UGR16 and the UNSW-NB15, and one of the most used datasets, KDD99. The preprocessing techniques were evaluated in accordance with scalar and normalization functions. All of these preprocessing models were applied through different sets of characteristics based on a categorization composed by four groups of features: basic connection features, content characteristics, statistical characteristics and finally, a group which is composed by traffic-based features and connection direction-based traffic characteristics. The objective of this research is to evaluate this categorization by using various data preprocessing techniques to obtain the most accurate model. Our proposal shows that, by applying the categorization of network traffic and several preprocessing techniques, the accuracy can be enhanced by up to 45%. The preprocessing of a specific group of characteristics allows for greater accuracy, allowing the machine learning algorithm to correctly classify these parameters related to possible attacks.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The number of global road traffic accidents is rising every year and remains undesirably high. One of the main reasons for this trend is that, in many countries, road users violate road safety regulations and traffic laws. Despite improvements in road safety legislation, enforcement is still a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries. Information technology solutions have emerged for automated traffic enforcement systems in the last decade. They have been tested on a small scale, but until now, the cost of deployment of these systems is generally too high for nation-wide adoption in low- and middle-income countries that need them the most. We present the architectural design of a traffic violation enforcement system that can optimize the cost of deployment and resource utilization. Based on the proposed architecture, we describe the implementation and deployment of the system, and perform a comparison of two different versions of the video-based enforcement system, one using classical computer vision methods and another using deep learning techniques. Finally, we analyze the impact of the system deployed in Phuket, Thailand from 2017 to the present in terms of local road users&rsquo; compliance and the road safety situation. We conclude that the system has had a positive impact on road safety in Phuket at a moderate cost.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In December 2016, the wastewater treatment plant of Baarle-Nassau, Netherlands, failed. The failure was caused by the illegal disposal of high volumes of acidic waste into the sewer network. Repairs cost between 80,000 and 100,000 EUR. A continuous monitoring system of a utility network such as this one would help to determine the causes of such pollution and could mitigate or reduce the impact of these kinds of events in the future. We have designed and tested a data fusion system that transforms the time-series of sensor measurements into an array of source-localized discharge events. The data fusion system performs this transformation as follows. First, the time-series of sensor measurements are resampled and converted to sensor observations in a unified discrete time domain. Second, sensor observations are mapped to pollutant detections that indicate the amount of specific pollutants according to a priori knowledge. Third, pollutant detections are used for inferring the propagation of the discharged pollutant downstream of the sewage network to account for missing sensor observations. Fourth, pollutant detections and inferred sensor observations are clustered to form tracks. Finally, tracks are processed and propagated upstream to form the final list of probable events. A set of experiments was performed using a modified variant of the EPANET Example Network 2. Results of our experiments show that the proposed system can narrow down the source of pollution to seven or fewer nodes, depending on the number of sensors, while processing approximately 100 sensor observations per second. Having considered the results, such a system could provide meaningful information about pollution events in utility networks.

AB  - Technological advances have enabled new sources of geoinformation, such as geosocial media, and have supported the propagation of the concept of smart cities. This paper argues that a city cannot be smart without citizens in the loop, and that a geosocial sensor might be one component to achieve that. First, we need to better understand which facets of urban life could be detected by a geosocial sensor, and how to calibrate it. This requires replicable studies that foster longitudinal and comparative research. Consequently, this paper examines the relationship between geosocial media content and socio-demographic census data for a global city, London, at two administrative levels. It aims for a transparent study design to encourage replication, using Term Frequency&mdash;Inverse Document Frequency of keywords, rule-based and word-embedding sentiment analysis, and local cluster analysis. The findings of limited links between geosocial media content and socio-demographic characteristics support earlier critiques on the utility of geosocial media for smart city planning purposes. The paper concludes that passive listening to publicly available geosocial media, in contrast to pro-active engagement with citizens, seems of limited use to understand and improve urban quality of life.

AB  - With the advances in sensor technology, big data, and artificial intelligence, unobtrusive in-home health monitoring has been a research focus for decades. Following up our research on smart vehicles, within the framework of unobtrusive health monitoring in private spaces, this work attempts to provide a guide to current sensor technology for unobtrusive in-home monitoring by a literature review of the state of the art and to answer, in particular, the questions: (1) What types of sensors can be used for unobtrusive in-home health data acquisition? (2) Where should the sensors be placed? (3) What data can be monitored in a smart home? (4) How can the obtained data support the monitoring functions? We conducted a retrospective literature review and summarized the state-of-the-art research on leveraging sensor technology for unobtrusive in-home health monitoring. For structured analysis, we developed a four-category terminology (location, unobtrusive sensor, data, and monitoring functions). We acquired 912 unique articles from four relevant databases (ACM Digital Lib, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Scopus) and screened them for relevance, resulting in n=55 papers analyzed in a structured manner using the terminology. The results delivered 25 types of sensors (motion sensor, contact sensor, pressure sensor, electrical current sensor, etc.) that can be deployed within rooms, static facilities, or electric appliances in an ambient way. While behavioral data (e.g., presence (n=38), time spent on activities (n=18)) can be acquired effortlessly, physiological parameters (e.g., heart rate, respiratory rate) are measurable on a limited scale (n=5). Behavioral data contribute to functional monitoring. Emergency monitoring can be built up on behavioral and environmental data. Acquired physiological parameters allow reasonable monitoring of physiological functions to a limited extent. Environmental data and behavioral data also detect safety and security abnormalities. Social interaction monitoring relies mainly on direct monitoring of tools of communication (smartphone; computer). In summary, convincing proof of a clear effect of these monitoring functions on clinical outcome with a large sample size and long-term monitoring is still lacking.

AB  - Spatiotemporal prediction of crime is crucial for public safety and smart cities operation. As crime incidents are distributed sparsely across space and time, existing deep-learning methods constrained by coarse spatial scale offer only limited values in prediction of crime density. This paper proposes the use of deep inception-residual networks (DIRNet) to conduct fine-grained, theft-related crime prediction based on non-emergency service request data (311 events). Specifically, it outlines the employment of inception units comprising asymmetrical convolution layers to draw low-level spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in crime events and complaint records in the 311 dataset. Afterward, this paper details how residual units can be applied to capture high-level spatiotemporal features from low-level spatiotemporal dependencies for the final prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed DIRNet is evaluated based on theft-related crime data and 311 data in New York City from 2010 to 2015. The results confirm that the DIRNet obtains an average F1 of 71%, which is better than other prediction models.

AB  - With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), many different smart home technologies are commercially available. However, the adoption of such technologies is slow as many of them are not cost-effective and focus on specific functions such as energy efficiency. Recently, IoT devices and sensors have been designed to enhance the quality of personal life by having the capability to generate continuous data streams that can be used to monitor and make inferences by the user. While smart home devices connect to the home Wi-Fi network, there are still compatibility issues between devices from different manufacturers. Smart devices get even smarter when they can communicate with and control each other. The information collected by one device can be shared with others for achieving an enhanced automation of their operations. This paper proposes a non-intrusive approach of integrating and collecting data from open standard IoT devices for personalised smart home automation using big data analytics and machine learning. We demonstrate the implementation of our proposed novel technology instantiation approach for achieving non-intrusive IoT based big data analytics with a use case of a smart home environment. We employ open-source frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache NiFi and FB-Prophet along with popular vendor tech-stacks such as Azure and DataBricks.

TI  - Transfer Learning by Similarity Centred Architecture Evolution for Multiple Residential Load Forecasting

PY  - 2021

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - The development from traditional low voltage grids to smart systems has become extensive and adopted worldwide. Expanding the demand response program to cover the residential sector raises a wide range of challenges. Short term load forecasting for residential consumers in a neighbourhood could lead to a better understanding of low voltage consumption behaviour. Nevertheless, users with similar characteristics can present diversity in consumption patterns. Consequently, transfer learning methods have become a useful tool to tackle differences among residential time series. This paper proposes a method combining evolutionary algorithms for neural architecture search with transfer learning to perform short term load forecasting in a neighbourhood with multiple household load consumption. The approach centres its efforts on neural architecture search using evolutionary algorithms. The neural architecture evolution process retains the patterns of the centre-most house, and later the architecture weights are adjusted for each house in a multihouse set from a neighbourhood. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure model performance. Experimental results on a large dataset containing hourly load consumption for ten houses in London, Ontario showed that the performance of the proposed approach performs better than the compared techniques. Moreover, the proposed method presents the average accuracy performance of 3.17 points higher than the state-of-the-art LSTM one shot method.

AB  - The need for effective freight and human transportation systems has consistently increased during the last decades, mainly due to factors such as globalization, e-commerce activities, and mobility requirements. Traditionally, transportation systems have been designed with the main goal of reducing their monetary cost while offering a specified quality of service. During the last decade, however, sustainability concepts are also being considered as a critical component of transportation systems, i.e., the environmental and social impact of transportation activities have to be taken into account when managers and policy makers design and operate modern transportation systems, whether these refer to long-distance carriers or to metropolitan areas. This paper reviews the existing work on different scientific methodologies that are being used to promote Sustainable Transportation Systems (STS), including simulation, optimization, machine learning, and fuzzy sets. This paper discusses how each of these methodologies have been employed to design and efficiently operate STS. In addition, the paper also provides a classification of common challenges, best practices, future trends, and open research lines that might be useful for both researchers and practitioners.

AB  - Cities are moving towards new mobility strategies to tackle smart cities’ challenges such as carbon emission reduction, urban transport multimodality and mitigation of pandemic hazards, emphasising on the implementation of shared modes, such as bike-sharing systems. This paper poses a research question and introduces a corresponding systematic literature review, focusing on machine learning techniques’ contributions applied to bike-sharing systems to improve cities’ mobility. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method was adopted to identify specific factors that influence bike-sharing systems, resulting in an analysis of 35 papers published between 2015 and 2019, creating an outline for future research. By means of systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis, machine learning algorithms were identified in two groups: classification and prediction.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Forecasting energy demand within a distribution network is essential for developing strategies to manage and optimize available energy resources and the associated infrastructure. In this study, we consider remote communities in the Arctic located at the end of the radial distribution network without alternative energy supply. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an accurate forecasting model to manage and optimize the limited energy resources available. We first compare the accuracy of several models that perform short-and medium-term load forecasts in rural areas, where a single industrial customer dominates the electricity consumption. We consider both statistical methods and machine learning models to predict energy demand. Then, we evaluate the transferability of each method to a geographical rural area different from the one considered for training. Our results indicate that statistical models achieve higher accuracy on longer forecast horizons relative to neural networks, while the machine-learning approaches perform better in predicting load at shorter time intervals. The machine learning models also exhibit good transferability, as they manage to predict well the load at new locations that were not accounted for during training. Our work will serve as a guide for selecting the appropriate prediction model and apply it to perform energy load forecasting in rural areas and in locations where historical consumption data may be limited or even not available.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Accurate air quality monitoring requires processing of multi-dimensional, multi-location sensor data, which has previously been considered in centralised machine learning models. These are often unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this article, we address this challenge by: (1) designing a novel hybrid deep learning model for hourly PM2.5 pollutant prediction; (2) optimising the obtained model for edge devices; and (3) examining model performance running on the edge devices in terms of both accuracy and latency. The hybrid deep learning model in this work comprises a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict hourly PM2.5 concentration. The results show that our proposed model outperforms other deep learning models, evaluated by calculating RMSE and MAE errors. The proposed model was optimised for edge devices, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (RPi3B+) and Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (RPi4B). This optimised model reduced file size to a quarter of the original, with further size reduction achieved by implementing different post-training quantisation. In total, 8272 hourly samples were continuously fed to the edge device, with the RPi4B executing the model twice as fast as the RPi3B+ in all quantisation modes. Full-integer quantisation produced the lowest execution time, with latencies of 2.19 s and 4.73 s for RPi4B and RPi3B+, respectively.

AB  - In recent years, Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) have been widely applied to different acoustic fields in outdoor and indoor environments. Most of these applications are oriented to locate or identify sources and measure specific features of the environment involved. In this paper, we study the application of a WASN for room acoustic measurements. To evaluate the acoustic characteristics, a set of Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi) has been used. One is used to play different acoustic signals and four are used to record at different points in the room simultaneously. The signals are sent wirelessly to a computer connected to a server, where using MATLAB we calculate both the impulse response (IR), and different acoustic parameters, such as the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII). In this way, the evaluation of room acoustic parameters with asynchronous IR measurements two different applications has been explored. Finally, the network features have been evaluated to assess the effectiveness of this system.

AB  - IoT plays an important role in daily life; commands and data transfer rapidly between the servers and objects to provide services. However, cyber threats have become a critical factor, especially for IoT servers. There should be a vigorous way to protect the network infrastructures from various attacks. IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is the invisible guardian for IoT servers. Many machine learning methods have been applied in IDS. However, there is a need to improve the IDS system for both accuracy and performance. Deep learning is a promising technique that has been used in many areas, including pattern recognition, natural language processing, etc. The deep learning reveals more potential than traditional machine learning methods. In this paper, sequential model is the key point, and new methods are proposed by the features of the model. The model can collect features from the network layer via tcpdump packets and application layer via system routines. Text-CNN and GRU methods are chosen because the can treat sequential data as a language model. The advantage compared with the traditional methods is that they can extract more features from the data and the experiments show that the deep learning methods have higher F1-score. We conclude that the sequential model-based intrusion detection system using deep learning method can contribute to the security of the IoT servers.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 4
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Visual object tracking is a significant technology for camera-based sensor networks applications. Multilayer convolutional features comprehensively used in correlation filter (CF)-based tracking algorithms have achieved excellent performance. However, there are tracking failures in some challenging situations because ordinary features are not able to well represent the object appearance variations and the correlation filters are updated irrationally. In this paper, we propose a local–global multiple correlation filters (LGCF) tracking algorithm for edge computing systems capturing moving targets, such as vehicles and pedestrians. First, we construct a global correlation filter model with deep convolutional features, and choose horizontal or vertical division according to the aspect ratio to build two local filters with hand-crafted features. Then, we propose a local–global collaborative strategy to exchange information between local and global correlation filters. This strategy can avoid the wrong learning of the object appearance model. Finally, we propose a time-space peak to sidelobe ratio (TSPSR) to evaluate the stability of the current CF. When the estimated results of the current CF are not reliable, the Kalman filter redetection (KFR) model would be enabled to recapture the object. The experimental results show that our presented algorithm achieves better performances on OTB-2013 and OTB-2015 compared with the other latest 12 tracking algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm handles various challenges in object tracking well.

These smart farms are designed to be run by interconnected devices and vehicles. Some enormous potentials can be achieved by the integration of different IoT technologies to achieve automated operations with minimum supervision.

The connectivity limitations of smart agriculture and it’s solutions are analysed with two case studies. In case study-1, we propose and evaluate meshed Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) gateways to address connectivity limitations of Smart Farming. While in case study-2, we explore satellite communication systems to provide connectivity to smart farms in remote areas of Australia. Finally, we conclude the paper by identifying future research challenges on this topic and outlining directions to address those challenges.

AB  - Air pollution is a global problem, especially in urban areas where the population density is very high due to the diverse pollutant sources such as vehicles, industrial plants, buildings, and waste. North Macedonia, as a developing country, has a serious problem with air pollution. The problem is highly present in its capital city, Skopje, where air pollution places it consistently within the top 10 cities in the world during the winter months. In this work, we propose using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models with long short-term memory units to predict the level of PM10 particles at 6, 12, and 24 h in the future. We employ historical air quality measurement data from sensors placed at multiple locations in Skopje and meteorological conditions such as temperature and humidity. We compare different deep learning models’ performance to an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The obtained results show that the proposed models consistently outperform the baseline model and can be successfully employed for air pollution prediction. Ultimately, we demonstrate that these models can help decision-makers and local authorities better manage the air pollution consequences by taking proactive measures.

AB  - An integrated smart home system (ISHS) is an effective way to improve the quality of life of the elderly. The elderly’s willingness is essential to adopt an ISHS; to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the elderly’s perception of ISHS. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the elderly’s perception of the ISHS by comprehensively evaluating its possible benefits and negative responses. A set of sensors required for an ISHS was determined, and interviews were designed based on four factors: perceived comfort, perceived usability, perceived privacy, and perceived benefit. Subsequently, technological trials of the sensor-set followed by two focus group interviews were conducted on nine independently living elderly participants at a senior welfare center in South Korea. Consistent with previous studies, the results of this investigation indicate that elderly participants elicited negative responses regarding usability complexity, and discomfort to daily activities. Despite such negative responses, after acquiring enough awareness about the ISHS’s benefits, the elderly acknowledged its necessity and showed a high level of willingness. Furthermore, these results indicate that for a better adoption of an ISHS, sufficient awareness regarding its benefits and development of elderly-friendly smart home sensors that minimize negative responses are required.

SN  - 2227-7080

AB  - Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new paradigm that revolutionizes the idea of a software-driven network through the separation of control and data planes. It addresses the problems of traditional network architecture. Nevertheless, this brilliant architecture is exposed to several security threats, e.g., the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which is hard to contain in such software-based networks. The concept of a centralized controller in SDN makes it a single point of attack as well as a single point of failure. In this paper, deep learning-based models, long-short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), are investigated. It illustrates their possibility and efficiency in being used in detecting and mitigating DDoS attack. The paper focuses on TCP, UDP, and ICMP flood attacks that target the controller. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the accuracy, recall, and true negative rate. We compared the performance of the deep learning models with classical machine learning models. We further provide details on the time taken to detect and mitigate the attack. Our results show that RNN LSTM is a viable deep learning algorithm that can be applied in the detection and mitigation of DDoS in the SDN controller. Our proposed model produced an accuracy of 89.63%, which outperformed linear-based models such as SVM (86.85%) and Naive Bayes (82.61%). Although KNN, which is a linear-based model, outperformed our proposed model (achieving an accuracy of 99.4%), our proposed model provides a good trade-off between precision and recall, which makes it suitable for DDoS classification. In addition, it was realized that the split ratio of the training and testing datasets can give different results in the performance of a deep learning algorithm used in a specific work. The model achieved the best performance when a split of 70/30 was used in comparison to 80/20 and 60/40 split ratios.

AB  - Air quality (AQ) in urban areas is deteriorating, thus having negative effects on people’s everyday lives. Official air quality monitoring stations provide the most reliable information, but do not always depict air pollution levels at scales reflecting human activities. They also have a high cost and therefore are limited in number. This issue can be addressed by deploying low cost AQ monitoring devices (LCAQMD), though their measurements are of far lower quality. In this paper we study the correlation of air pollution levels reported by such a device and by a reference station for particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide in Thessaloniki, Greece. On this basis, a corrective factor is modeled via seven machine learning algorithms in order to improve the quality of measurements for the LCAQMD against reference stations, thus leading to its on-field computational improvement. We show that our computational intelligence approach can improve the performance of such a device for PM10 under operational conditions.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Applications related to smart cities require virtual cities in the experimental development stage. To build a virtual city that are close to a real city, a large number of various types of human models need to be created. To reduce the cost of acquiring models, this paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D human meshes from single images captured using a normal camera. It presents a method for reconstructing the complete mesh of the human body from a single RGB image and a generative adversarial network consisting of a newly designed shape–pose-based generator (based on deep convolutional neural networks) and an enhanced multi-source discriminator. Using a machine learning approach, the reliance on multiple sensors is reduced and 3D human meshes can be recovered using a single camera, thereby reducing the cost of building smart cities. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.1% in body shape recovery; it can also process 34 images per second. The method proposed in this paper approach significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches. Given a single view image of various humans, our results can be used to generate various 3D human models, which can facilitate 3D human modeling work to simulate virtual cities. Since our method can also restore the poses of the humans in the image, it is possible to create various human poses by given corresponding images with specific human poses.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Nowcasting is an important technique for weather forecasting because sudden weather changes significantly affect human life. The encoding-forecasting model, which is a state-of-the-art architecture in the field of data-driven radar extrapolation, does not particularly focus on the latest data when forecasting natural phenomena. This paper proposes a weighted broadcasting method that emphasizes the latest data of the time step to improve the nowcasting performance. This weighted broadcasting method allows the most recent rainfall patterns to have a greater impact on the forecasting network by extending the architecture of the existing encoding-forecasting model. Experimental results show that the proposed model is 1.74% and 2.20% better than the existing encoding-forecasting model in terms of mean absolute error and critical success index, respectively. In the case of heavy rainfall with an intensity of 30 mm/h or higher, the proposed model was more than 30% superior to the existing encoding-forecasting model. Therefore, applying the weighted broadcasting method, which explicitly places a high emphasis on the latest information, to the encoding-forecasting model is considered as an improvement that is applicable to the state-of-the-art implementation of data-driven radar-based precipitation nowcasting.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The utilization of energy is on the rise in current trends due to increasing consumptions by households. Smart buildings, on the other hand, aim to optimize energy, and hence, the aim of the study is to forecast the cost of energy consumption in smart buildings by effectively addressing the minimal energy consumption. However, smart buildings are restricted, with limited power access and capacity associated with Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units. It further suffers from low communication capability due to device limitations. In this paper, a balanced deep learning architecture is used to offer solutions to address these constraints. The deep learning algorithm considers three constraints, such as a multi-objective optimization problem and a fitness function, to resolve the price management problem and high-level energy consumption in HVAC systems. The study analyzes and optimizes the consumption of power in smart buildings by the HVAC systems in terms of power loss, price management and reactive power. Experiments are conducted over various scenarios to check the integrity of the system over various smart buildings and in high-rise buildings. The results are compared in terms of various HVAC devices on various metrics and communication protocols, where the proposed system is considered more effective than other methods. The results of the Li-Fi communication protocols show improved results compared to the other communication protocols.

AB  - Obtaining key and rich visual information under sophisticated road conditions is one of the key requirements for advanced driving assistance. In this paper, a newfangled end-to-end model is proposed for advanced driving assistance based on the fusion of infrared and visible images, termed as FusionADA. In our model, we are committed to extracting and fusing the optimal texture details and salient thermal targets from the source images. To achieve this goal, our model constitutes an adversarial framework between the generator and the discriminator. Specifically, the generator aims to generate a fused image with basic intensity information together with the optimal texture details from source images, while the discriminator aims to force the fused image to restore the salient thermal targets from the source infrared image. In addition, our FusionADA is a fully end-to-end model, solving the issues of manually designing complicated activity level measurements and fusion rules existing in traditional methods.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - As one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, it is sensible to analysis historical urban land use characteristics and project the potentials of urban sustainable development for a smart city. The cellular automaton (CA) model is the widely applied in simulating urban growth, but the optimum parameters of variables driving urban growth in the model remains to be continued to improve. We propose a novel model integrating an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) and CA for optimizing parameters of variables in the urban growth model and make a comparison between AFSA-CA and other five models, which is used to study a 40-year urban land growth of Wuhan. We found that the urban growth types from 1995 to 2015 appeared relatively consistent, mainly including infilling, edge-expansion and distant-leap types in Wuhan, which a certain range of urban land growth on the periphery of the central area. Additionally, although the genetic algorithms (GA)-CA model and the AFSA-CA model among the six models due to the distance variables, the parameter value of the GA-CA model is −15.5409 according to the fact that the population (POP) variable should be positively. As a result, the AFSA-CA model regardless of the initial parameter setting is superior to the GA-CA model and the GA-CA model is superior to all the other models. Finally, it is projected that the potentials of urban growth in Wuhan for 2025 and 2035 under three scenarios (natural urban land growth without any restrictions (NULG), sustainable urban land growth with cropland protection and ecological security (SULG), and economic urban land growth with sustainable development and economic development in the core area (EULG)) focus mainly on existing urban land and some new town centers based on AFSA-CA urban growth simulation model. An increasingly precise simulation can determine the potential increase area and quantity of urban land, providing a basis to judge the layout of urban land use for urban planners.

TI  - Towards Mountain Fire Safety Using Fire Spread Predictive Analytics and Mountain Fire Containment in IoT Environment

VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Mountains are popular tourist destinations due to their climate, fresh atmosphere, breathtaking sceneries, and varied topography. However, they are at times exposed to accidents, such as fire caused due to natural hazards and human activities. Such unforeseen fire accidents have a social, economic, and environmental impact on mountain towns worldwide. Protecting mountains from such fire accidents is also very challenging in terms of the high cost of fire containment resources, tracking fire spread, and evacuating the people at risk. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a three-fold methodology for fire safety in the mountains. The first part of the methodology is an optimization model for effective fire containment resource utilization. The second part of the methodology is a novel ensemble model based on machine learning, the heuristic approach, and principal component regression for predictive analytics of fire spread data. The final part of the methodology consists of an Internet of Things-based task orchestration approach to notify fire safety information to safety authorities. The proposed three-fold fire safety approach provides in-time information to safety authorities for making on-time decisions to minimize the damage caused by mountain fire with minimum containment cost. The performance of optimization models is evaluated in terms of execution time and cost. The particle swarm optimization-based model performs better in terms of cost, whereas the bat algorithm performs better in terms of execution time. The prediction models’ performance is evaluated in terms of root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error. The proposed ensemble-based prediction model accuracy for fire spread and burned area prediction is higher than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. It is evident from the results that the proposed fire safety mechanism is a step towards efficient mountain fire safety management.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Recent improvements in the performance of the human face recognition model have led to the development of relevant products and services. However, research in the similar field of animal face identification has remained relatively limited due to the greater diversity and complexity in shape and the lack of relevant data for animal faces such as dogs. In the face identification model using triplet loss, the length of the embedding vector is normalized by adding an L2-normalization (L2-norm) layer for using cosine-similarity-based learning. As a result, object identification depends only on the angle, and the distribution of the embedding vector is limited to the surface of a sphere with a radius of 1. This study proposes training the model from which the L2-norm layer is removed by using the triplet loss to utilize a wide vector space beyond the surface of a sphere with a radius of 1, for which a novel loss function and its two-stage learning method. The proposed method classifies the embedding vector within a space rather than on the surface, and the model’s performance is also increased. The accuracy, one-shot identification performance, and distribution of the embedding vectors are compared between the existing learning method and the proposed learning method for verification. The verification was conducted using an open-set. The resulting accuracy of 97.33% for the proposed learning method is approximately 4% greater than that of the existing learning method.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 5
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Oblique photogrammetry-based three-dimensional (3D) urban models are widely used for smart cities. In 3D urban models, road signs are small but provide valuable information for navigation. However, due to the problems of sliced shape features, blurred texture and high incline angles, road signs cannot be fully reconstructed in oblique photogrammetry, even with state-of-the-art algorithms. The poor reconstruction of road signs commonly leads to less informative guidance and unsatisfactory visual appearance. In this paper, we present a pipeline for embedding road sign models based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). First, we present an end-to-end balanced-learning framework for small object detection that takes advantage of the region-based CNN and a data synthesis strategy. Second, under the geometric constraints placed by the bounding boxes, we use the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) to extract the corresponding points on the road signs. Third, we obtain the coarse location of a single road sign by triangulating the corresponding points and refine the location via outlier removal. Least-squares fitting is then applied to the refined point cloud to fit a plane for orientation prediction. Finally, we replace the road signs with computer-aided design models in the 3D urban scene with the predicted location and orientation. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a high mAP in road sign detection and produces visually plausible embedded results, which demonstrates its effectiveness for road sign modeling in oblique photogrammetry-based 3D scene reconstruction.

AB  - Due to the emergence of the coronavirus disease (COVID 19), education systems in most countries have adapted and quickly changed their teaching strategy to online teaching. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel Internet of Things (IoT) device, called MEIoT weather station, which incorporates an exogenous disturbance input, within the National Digital Observatory of Smart Environments (OBNiSE) architecture. The exogenous disturbance input involves a wind blower based on a DC brushless motor. It can be controlled, via Node-RED platform, manually through a sliding bar, or automatically via different predefined profile functions, modifying the wind speed and the wind vane sensor variables. An application to Engineering Education is presented with a case study that includes the instructional design for the least-squares regression topic for linear, quadratic, and cubic approximations within the Educational Mechatronics Conceptual Framework (EMCF) to show the relevance of this proposal. This work’s main contribution to the state-of-the-art is to turn a weather monitoring system into a hybrid hands-on learning approach thanks to the integrated exogenous disturbance input.

To predict air quality with maximum accuracy, along with the implemented models and the quantity of the data, it is crucial also to consider the dataset types. This study selected a set of research works in the field of air quality prediction and is concentrated on the exploration of the datasets utilised in them. The most significant findings of this research work are: (1) meteorological datasets were used in 94.6% of the papers leaving behind the rest of the datasets with a big difference, which is complemented with others, such as temporal data, spatial data, and so on; (2) the usage of various datasets combinations has been commenced since 2009; and (3) the utilisation of open data have been started since 2012, 32.3% of the studies used open data, and 63.4% of the studies did not provide the data.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - A reliable prediction of sustainable energy consumption is key for designing environmentally friendly buildings. In this study, three novel hybrid intelligent methods, namely the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), wind-driven optimization (WDO), and biogeography-based optimization (BBO), are employed to optimize the multitarget prediction of heating loads (HLs) and cooling loads (CLs) in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Concerning the optimization of the applied algorithms, a series of swarm-based iterations are performed, and the best structure is proposed for each model. The GOA, WDO, and BBO algorithms are mixed with a class of feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs), which is called a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict the HL and CL. According to the sensitivity analysis, the WDO with swarm size = 500 proposes the most-fitted ANN. The proposed WDO-ANN provided an accurate prediction in terms of heating load (training (R2 correlation = 0.977 and RMSE error = 0.183) and testing (R2 correlation = 0.973 and RMSE error = 0.190)) and yielded the best-fitted prediction in terms of cooling load (training (R2 correlation = 0.99 and RMSE error = 0.147) and testing (R2 correlation = 0.99 and RMSE error = 0.148)).

From a practical point of view, it is a key point to determine to what degree the cyber resilience of power systems can be improved using cost-effective resilience enhancement methods. Numerous attempts have been made to the vital resilience of the smart grid against cyber-attacks. The recently proposed cybersecurity methods are considered in this paper, and their accuracies, computational time, and robustness against external factors in detecting and identifying False Data Injection (FDI) attacks are evaluated. There is no all-inclusive solution to fit all power systems requirements. Therefore, the recently proposed cyber-attack detection and identification methods are quantitatively compared and discussed.

AB  - Rapid developments in urbanization and smart city environments have accelerated the need to deliver safe, sustainable, and effective resource utilization and service provision and have thereby enhanced the need for intelligent, real-time video surveillance. Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have the capability to detect and localize salient objects in surveillance video streams; however, several practical issues remain unaddressed, such as diverse weather conditions, recording conditions, and motion blur. In this context, image de-raining is an important issue that has been investigated extensively in recent years to provide accurate and quality surveillance in the smart city domain. Existing deep convolutional neural networks have obtained great success in image translation and other computer vision tasks; however, image de-raining is ill posed and has not been addressed in real-time, intelligent video surveillance systems. In this work, we propose to utilize the generative capabilities of recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) as an image de-raining approach. We utilize the adversarial loss in GANs that provides an additional component to the loss function, which in turn regulates the final output and helps to yield better results. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that the proposed method outperforms most of the existing state-of-the-art models in terms of quantitative evaluations and visual appearance.

AB  - This study aims to produce accurate predictions of the NO2 concentrations at a specific station of a monitoring network located in the Bay of Algeciras (Spain). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and sequence-to-sequence long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) were used to create the forecasting models. Additionally, a new prediction method was proposed combining LSTMs using a rolling window scheme with a cross-validation procedure for time series (LSTM-CVT). Two different strategies were followed regarding the input variables: using NO2 from the station or employing NO2 and other pollutants data from any station of the network plus meteorological variables. The ANN and LSTM-CVT exogenous models used lagged datasets of different window sizes. Several feature ranking methods were used to select the top lagged variables and include them in the final exogenous datasets. Prediction horizons of t + 1, t + 4 and t + 8 were employed. The exogenous variables inclusion enhanced the model’s performance, especially for t + 4 (ρ ≈ 0.68 to ρ ≈ 0.74) and t + 8 (ρ ≈ 0.59 to ρ ≈ 0.66). The proposed LSTM-CVT method delivered promising results as the best performing models per prediction horizon employed this new methodology. Additionally, per each parameter combination, it obtained lower error values than ANNs in 85% of the cases.

AB  - The escalated growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has started to reform and reshape our lives. The deployment of a large number of objects adhered to the internet has unlocked the vision of the smart world around us, thereby paving a road towards automation and humongous data generation and collection. This automation and continuous explosion of personal and professional information to the digital world provides a potent ground to the adversaries to perform numerous cyber-attacks, thus making security in IoT a sizeable concern. Hence, timely detection and prevention of such threats are pre-requisites to prevent serious consequences.

AB  - Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) displays high-quality connectivity underpinned by fifth-generation (5G) networks to cover a wide array of IoT applications. The devices’ development and integration into different smart systems require permanent control, supervision, and the study of power consumption models to determine the performance of the network topology and allow for the measurement of the efficiency of the network topology’s application. This paper reports on an architecture and open-sourced simulation that was developed to study NB-IoT in Device-to-Device (D2D) mode, which includes the Physical (PHY), network, and application layers, as well as a queuing model, the model for uplink and downlink delays, the throughput, the overall NB-IoT D2D network performance, and the energy consumption based on the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol. Our results prove that the suggested framework contributes to a reduction in power consumption, a minimization of queuing delays, a decrease in communication cost, a reduction in inter-cluster collisions, and the prevention of attacks from malicious nodes. Consequently, the framework manages the battery’s State of Charge (SOC), improves the battery’s State of Health (SOH), and maximizes the whole network lifetime. The proposed framework, the code of which has been open-sourced, can be effectively used for scientific research and development purposes to evaluate different parameters and improve the planning of NB-IoT networks.

AB  - In today’s Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment, where different systems interact with the physical world, the state proposed by the Industry 4.0 standards can lead to escalating vulnerabilities, especially when these systems receive data streams from multiple intermediaries, requiring multilevel security approaches, in addition to link encryption. At the same time taking into account the heterogeneity of the systems included in the IIoT ecosystem and the non-institutionalized interoperability in terms of hardware and software, serious issues arise as to how to secure these systems. In this framework, given that the protection of industrial equipment is a requirement inextricably linked to technological developments and the use of the IoT, it is important to identify the major vulnerabilities and the associated risks and threats and to suggest the most appropriate countermeasures. In this context, this study provides a description of the attacks against IIoT systems, as well as a thorough analysis of the solutions for these attacks, as they have been proposed in the most recent literature.

AB  - This work makes multiple scientific contributions to the field of Indoor Localization for Ambient Assisted Living in Smart Homes. First, it presents a Big-Data driven methodology that studies the multimodal components of user interactions and analyzes the data from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and BLE scanners to detect a user’s indoor location in a specific ‘activity-based zone’ during Activities of Daily Living. Second, it introduces a context independent approach that can interpret the accelerometer and gyroscope data from diverse behavioral patterns to detect the ‘zone-based’ indoor location of a user in any Internet of Things (IoT)-based environment. These two approaches achieved performance accuracies of 81.36% and 81.13%, respectively, when tested on a dataset. Third, it presents a methodology to detect the spatial coordinates of a user’s indoor position that outperforms all similar works in this field, as per the associated root mean squared error—one of the performance evaluation metrics in ISO/IEC18305:2016—an international standard for testing Localization and Tracking Systems. Finally, it presents a comprehensive comparative study that includes Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, k-NN, Gradient Boosted Trees, Deep Learning, and Linear Regression, to address the challenge of identifying the optimal machine learning approach for Indoor Localization.

AB  - As energy distribution systems evolve from a traditional hierarchical load structure towards distributed smart grids, flexibility is increasingly investigated as both a key measure and core challenge of grid balancing. This paper contributes to the theoretical framework for quantifying network flexibility potential by introducing a machine learning based node characterization. In particular, artificial neural networks are considered for classification of historic demand data from several network substations. Performance of the resulting classifiers is evaluated with respect to clustering analysis and parameter space of the models considered, while the bootstrapping based statistical evaluation is reported in terms of mean confusion matrices. The resulting meta-models of individual nodes can be further utilized on a network level to mitigate the difficulties associated with identifying, implementing and actuating many small sources of energy flexibility, compared to the few large ones traditionally acknowledged.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Diverse computer-aided diagnosis systems based on convolutional neural networks were applied to automate the detection of myocardial infarction (MI) found in electrocardiogram (ECG) for early diagnosis and prevention. However, issues, particularly overfitting and underfitting, were not being taken into account. In other words, it is unclear whether the network structure is too simple or complex. Toward this end, the proposed models were developed by starting with the simplest structure: a multi-lead features-concatenate narrow network (N-Net) in which only two convolutional layers were included in each lead branch. Additionally, multi-scale features-concatenate networks (MSN-Net) were also implemented where larger features were being extracted through pooling the signals. The best structure was obtained via tuning both the number of filters in the convolutional layers and the number of inputting signal scales. As a result, the N-Net reached a 95.76% accuracy in the MI detection task, whereas the MSN-Net reached an accuracy of 61.82% in the MI locating task. Both networks give a higher average accuracy and a significant difference of p &lt; 0.001 evaluated by the U test compared with the state-of-the-art. The models are also smaller in size thus are suitable to fit in wearable devices for offline monitoring. In conclusion, testing throughout the simple and complex network structure is indispensable. However, the way of dealing with the class imbalance problem and the quality of the extracted features are yet to be discussed.

AB  - This paper presents a novel incentive-based load shedding management scheme within a microgrid environment equipped with the required IoT infrastructure. The proposed mechanism works on the principles of reverse combinatorial auction. We consider a region of multiple consumers who are willing to curtail their load in the peak hours in order to gain some incentives later. Using the properties of combinatorial auctions, the participants can bid in packages or combinations in order to maximize their and overall social welfare of the system. The winner determination problem of the proposed combinatorial auction, determined using particle swarm optimization algorithm and hybrid genetic algorithm, is also presented in this paper. The performance evaluation and stability test of the proposed scheme are simulated using MATLAB and presented in this paper. The results indicate that combinatorial auctions are an excellent choice for load shedding management where a maximum of 50 users participate.

AB  - Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) or IEEE 802.11p/OCB (Out of the Context of a Base-station) is widely considered to be a primary technology for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, and it is aimed toward increasing the safety of users on the road by sharing information between one another. The requirements of DSRC are to maintain real-time communication with low latency and high reliability. In this paper, we investigate how communication can be used to improve stopping distance performance based on fieldwork results. In addition, we assess the impacts of reduced reliability, in terms of distance independent, distance dependent and density-based consecutive packet losses. A model is developed based on empirical measurements results depending on distance, data rate, and traveling speed. With this model, it is shown that cooperative V2V communications can effectively reduce reaction time and increase safety stop distance, and highlight the importance of high reliability. The obtained results can be further used for the design of cooperative V2V-based driving and safety applications.

AB  - One of the most important challenges of volunteered geographic information (VGI) is the quality assessment. Existing methods of VGI quality assessment, either assess the quality by comparing a reference map with the VGI map or deriving the quality from the metadata. The first approach does not work for a real-time scenario and the latter delivers approximate values of the quality. Internet of Things (IoT) networks provide real-time observations for environment monitoring. Moreover, they publish more precise information than VGI. This paper introduces a method to assess the quality of VGI in real-time using IoT observations. The proposed method filters sensor observation outliers in the first step. Then it matches sensors and volunteers’ relationships in terms of location, time, and measurement type similarity using a hypergraph model. Then the quality of matched data is assessed by calculating positional and attribute accuracy. To evaluate the method, VGI data of the water level and quality in Tarashk–Bakhtegan–Maharlou water basin is studied. A VGI quality map of the data is assessed by a referenced authoritative map. The output of this step is a VGI quality map, which was used as a reference to check the proposed method quality. Then this reference VGI quality map and the proposed method VGI quality map are compared to assess positional and attribute accuracy. Results demonstrated that 76% of the method results have less than 20 m positional error (i.e., difference with the reference VGI quality map). Additionally, more than 92% of the proposed method VGI data have higher than 90% attribute accuracy in terms of similarity with the reference VGI quality map. These findings support the notion that the proposed method can be used to assess VGI quality in real-time.

AB  - In this paper, we address the application of the flying Drone Base Stations (DBS) in order to improve the network performance. Given the high degrees of freedom of a DBS, it can change its position and adapt its trajectory according to the users movements and the target environment. A two-hop communication model, between an end-user and a macrocell through a DBS, is studied in this work. We propose Q-learning and Deep Q-learning based solutions to optimize the drone’s trajectory. Simulation results show that, by employing our proposed models, the drone can autonomously fly and adapts its mobility according to the users’ movements. Additionally, the Deep Q-learning model outperforms the Q-learning model and can be applied in more complex environments.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Cybersecurity in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has become critical as smart cities are becoming increasingly linked to industrial control systems (ICSs) used in critical infrastructure. Consequently, data-driven security systems for analyzing massive amounts of data generated by smart cities have become essential. A representative method for analyzing large-scale data is the game bot detection approach used in massively multiplayer online role-playing games. We reviewed the literature on bot detection methods to extend the anomaly detection approaches used in bot detection schemes to IIoT fields. Finally, we proposed a process wherein the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model was applied to identify features for efficiently detecting anomalous behavior in smart cities. Experimental results using random forest show that our extracted features based on a game bot can achieve an average F1-score of 0.99903 using 10-fold validation. We confirmed the applicability of the analyzed game-industry methodology to other fields and trained a random forest on the high-efficiency features identified by applying a DEA, obtaining an F1-score of 0.997 using the validation set approach. In this study, an anomaly detection method for analyzing massive smart city data based on a game industry methodology was presented and applied to the ICS dataset.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Indoor navigation has attracted commercial developers and researchers in the last few decades. The development of localization tools, methods and frameworks enables current communication services and applications to be optimized by incorporating location data. For clinical applications such as workflow analysis, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons have been employed to map the positions of individuals in indoor environments. To map locations, certain existing methods use the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Devices need to be configured to allow for dynamic interference patterns when using the RSSI sensors to monitor indoor positions. In this paper, our objective is to explore an alternative method for monitoring a moving user’s indoor position using BLE sensors in complex indoor building environments. We developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based positioning model based on the 2D image composed of the received number of signals indicator from both x and y-axes. In this way, like a pixel, we interact with each 10 × 10 matrix holding the spatial information of coordinates and suggest the possible shift of a sensor, adding a sensor and removing a sensor. To develop CNN we adopted a neuro-evolution approach to optimize and create several layers in the network dynamically, through enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). For the optimization of CNN, the global best solution obtained by PSO is directly given to the weights of each layer of CNN. In addition, we employed dynamic inertia weights in the PSO, instead of a constant inertia weight, to maintain the CNN layers’ length corresponding to the RSSI signals from BLE sensors. Experiments were conducted in a building environment where thirteen beacon devices had been installed in different locations to record coordinates. For evaluation comparison, we further adopted machine learning and deep learning algorithms for predicting a user’s location in an indoor environment. The experimental results indicate that the proposed optimized CNN-based method shows high accuracy (97.92% with 2.8% error) for tracking a moving user’s locations in a complex building without complex calibration as compared to other recent methods.

AB  - The Industry 4.0 Revolution that is taking place nowadays means that organizations face not only new opportunities, but also challenges related to the identification of their role in creating a modern smart world. The economies of many countries are under the significant and growing influence of various types of organizations, not only strong international business corporations, but also, more and more often, smaller but intelligent ones called smart organizations IR 4.0. Due to their unique characteristics, intelligent organizations are better able than others to cope with technological breakthroughs, social, and cultural problems as well as to compete effectively and develop in an environmentally sustainable way. With their growing potential, they are strengthening the economies of their countries of origin and daily operation. Their growing role is also visible in the processes of shaping competitiveness and achieving the sustainable development objectives of the European Union (EU). The countries that are able to organize an environment on their territory that is conducive to the smart organization’s development are clear examples not only of a high market competitiveness, but also of a dynamically growing commitment to the effective implementation of the challenges associated with the 17 objectives of sustainable development of the contemporary EU, according to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This allows for a conclusion that the identification of the key factors for a smart organization’s development makes it possible to monitor and provide targeted support for the development not only of these organizations, but also for the competitiveness and sustainability of individual countries, both from the EU and other regions of the world. In light of the above, the aim of this article is therefore to propose an effective tool to monitor the use of power of smart organizations in the processes of building the competitiveness and sustainable development of countries, with particular reference to the EU. To achieve this objective, we constructed a synthetic power of smart organizations index (PSOI) based on previously collected data from EUROSTAT. This tool allows for the integration of micro (organization level) and macro (country level) economic aspects into a single construct. Based on the analysis of its results, countries wishing to actively engage in the development of their own and the EU’s smartness and sustainability can be offered several more or less intense navigation paths to market success, based on the development of smart organizations.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Service quality and efficiency of urban systems have been dramatically boosted by various high technologies for real-time monitoring and remote control, and have also gained privileged space in water distribution. Monitored hydraulic and quality parameters are crucial data for developing planning, operation and security analyses in water networks, which makes them increasingly reliable. However, devices for monitoring and remote control also increase the possibilities for failure and cyber-attacks in the systems, which can severely impair the system operation and, in extreme cases, collapse the service. This paper proposes an automatic two-step methodology for cyber-attack detection in water distribution systems. The first step is based on signal-processing theory, and applies a fast Independent Component Analysis (fastICA) algorithm to hydraulic time series (e.g., pressure, flow, and tank level), which separates them into independent components. These components are then processed by a statistical control algorithm for automatic detection of abrupt changes, from which attacks may be disclosed. The methodology is applied to the case study provided by the Battle of Attack Detection Algorithms (BATADAL) and the results are compared with seven other approaches, showing excellent results, which makes this methodology a reliable early-warning cyber-attack detection approach.

AB  - Real-world data streams pose a unique challenge to the implementation of machine learning (ML) models and data analysis. A notable problem that has been introduced by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments across the smart city ecosystem is that the statistical properties of data streams can change over time, resulting in poor prediction performance and ineffective decisions. While concept drift detection methods aim to patch this problem, emerging communication and sensing technologies are generating a massive amount of data, requiring distributed environments to perform computation tasks across smart city administrative domains. In this article, we implement and test a number of state-of-the-art active concept drift detection algorithms for time series analysis within a distributed environment. We use real-world data streams and provide critical analysis of results retrieved. The challenges of implementing concept drift adaptation algorithms, along with their applications in smart cities, are also discussed.

AB  - The integration of multi-source transportation data is complex and insufficient in most of the big cities, which made it difficult for researchers to conduct in-depth data mining to improve the policy or the management. In order to solve this problem, a top-down approach is used to construct a knowledge graph of urban traffic system in this paper. First, the model layer of the knowledge graph was used to realize the reuse and sharing of knowledge. Furthermore, the model layer then was stored in the graph database Neo4j. Second, the representation learning based knowledge reasoning model was adopted to implement knowledge completion and improve the knowledge graph. Finally, the proposed method was validated with an urban traffic data set and the results showed that the model could be used to mine the implicit relationship between traffic entities and discover traffic knowledge effectively.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - With the drastically increasing traffic in the last decades, crucial environmental problems have been caused, such as greenhouse gas emission and traffic noise pollution. These problems have adversely affected our life quality and health conditions. In this paper, modelling of traffic noise employing deep learning is investigated. The goal is to identify the best machine-learning model for predicting traffic noise from real-life traffic data with multivariate traffic features as input. An extensive study on recurrent neural network (RNN) is performed in this work for modelling time series traffic data, which was collected through an experimental campaign at an inner city roundabout, including both video traffic data and audio data. The preprocessing of the data, namely how to generate the appropriate input and output for deep learning model, is detailed in this paper. A selection of different architectures of RNN, such as many-to-one, many-to-many, encoder–decoder architectures, was investigated. Moreover, gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were further discussed. The results revealed that a multivariate bi-directional GRU model with many-to-many architecture achieved the best performance with both high accuracy and computation efficiency. The trained model could be promising for a future smart city concept; with the proposed model, real-time traffic noise predictions can be potentially feasible using only traffic data collected by different sensors in the city, thanks to the generated big data by smart cities. The forecast of excessive noise exposure can help the regulation and policy makers to make early decisions, in order to mitigate the noise level.

IS  - 6
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Edge computing is a product of the evolution of IoT and the development of cloud computing technology, providing computing, storage, network, and other infrastructure close to users. Compared with the centralized deployment model of traditional cloud computing, edge computing solves the problems of extended communication time and high convergence traffic, providing better support for low latency and high bandwidth services. With the increasing amount of data generated by users and devices in IoT, security and privacy issues in the edge computing environment have become concerns. Blockchain, a security technology developed rapidly in recent years, has been adopted by many industries, such as finance and insurance. With the edge computing capability, deploying blockchain platforms/applications on edge computing platforms can provide security services for network edge environments. Although there are already solutions for integrating edge computing with blockchain in many IoT application scenarios, they slightly lack scalability, portability, and heterogeneous data processing. In this paper, we propose a trusted edge platform to integrate the edge computing framework and blockchain network for building an edge security environment. The proposed platform aims to preserve the data privacy of the edge computing client. The design based on the microservice architecture makes the platform lighter. To improve the portability of the platform, we introduce the Edgex Foundry framework and design an edge application module on the platform to improve the business capability of Edgex. Simultaneously, we designed a series of well-defined security authentication microservices. These microservices use the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network to build a reliable security mechanism in the edge environment. Finally, we build an edge computing network using different hardware devices and deploy the trusted edge platform on multiple network nodes. The usability of the proposed platform is demonstrated by testing the round-trip time (RTT) of several important workflows. The experimental results demonstrate that the platform can meet the availability requirements in real-world usage scenarios.

AB  - The increasing population across the globe makes it essential to link smart and sustainable city planning with the logistics of transporting people and goods, which will significantly contribute to how societies will face mobility in the coming years. The concept of smart mobility emerged with the popularity of smart cities and is aligned with the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations. A reduction in traffic congestion and new route optimizations with reduced ecological footprint are some of the essential factors of smart mobility; however, other aspects must also be taken into account, such as the promotion of active mobility and inclusive mobility, encouraging the use of other types of environmentally friendly fuels and engagement with citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Big Data technology will serve as the main entry points and fundamental pillars to promote the rise of new innovative solutions that will change the current paradigm for cities and their citizens. Mobility-as-a-service, traffic flow optimization, the optimization of logistics and autonomous vehicles are some of the services and applications that will encompass several changes in the coming years with the transition of existing cities into smart cities. This paper provides an extensive review of the current trends and solutions presented in the scope of smart mobility and enabling technologies that support it. An overview of how smart mobility fits into smart cities is provided by characterizing its main attributes and the key benefits of using smart mobility in a smart city ecosystem. Further, this paper highlights other various opportunities and challenges related to smart mobility. Lastly, the major services and applications that are expected to arise in the coming years within smart mobility are explored with the prospective future trends and scope.

AB  - This paper summarises a literature review on the applications of Internet of Things (IoT) with the aim of enhancing building energy use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). A detailed assessment of contemporary practical reviews and works was conducted to understand how different IoT systems and technologies are being developed to increase energy efficiencies in both residential and commercial buildings. Most of the reviewed works were invariably related to the dilemma of efficient heating systems in buildings. Several features of the central components of IoT, namely, the hardware and software needed for building controls, are analysed. Common design factors across the many IoT systems comprise the selection of sensors and actuators and their powering techniques, control strategies for collecting information and activating appliances, monitoring of actual data to forecast prospect energy consumption and communication methods amongst IoT components. Some building energy applications using IoT are provided. It was found that each application presented has the potential for significant energy reduction and user comfort improvement. This is confirmed in two case studies summarised, which report the energy savings resulting from implementing IoT systems. Results revealed that a few elements are user-specific that need to be considered in the decision processes. Last, based on the studies reviewed, a few aspects of prospective research were recommended.

VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are expected to create enormous benefits to society, but there are safety concerns in recognizing faults at the vehicle’s control component. Prior studies proposed various fault detection approaches leveraging heuristics-based rules and supervised learning-based models, but there were several drawbacks. The rule-based approaches required an engineer to update the rules on every type of fault, and the supervised learning-based approaches necessitated the acquisition of a finely-labeled training dataset. Moreover, both prior approaches commonly include a limit that the detection model can identify the trained type of faults only, but fail to recognize the unseen type of faults. In pursuit of resolving the aforementioned drawbacks, we proposed a fault detection model utilizing a stacked autoencoder that lies under unsupervised learning. The autoencoder was trained with data from safe UAV states, and its reconstruction loss was examined to distinguish the safe states and faulty states. The key contributions of our study are, as follows. First, we presented a series of analyses to extract essential features from raw UAV flight logs. Second, we designed a fault detection model consisting of the stacked autoencoder and the classifier. Lastly, we validated our approach’s fault detection performance with two datasets consisting of different types of UAV faults.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 6
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Authentication methods using personal identification number (PIN) and unlock patterns are widely used in smartphone user authentication. However, these authentication methods are vulnerable to shoulder-surfing attacks, and PIN authentication, in particular, is poor in terms of security because PINs are short in length with just four to six digits. A wide range of research is currently underway to examine various biometric authentication methods, for example, using the user’s face, fingerprint, or iris information. However, such authentication methods provide PIN-based authentication as a type of backup authentication to prepare for when the maximum set number of authentication failures is exceeded during the authentication process such that the security of biometric authentication equates to the security of PIN-based authentication. In order to overcome this limitation, research has been conducted on keystroke dynamics-based authentication, where users are classified by analyzing their typing patterns while they are entering their PIN. As a result, a wide range of methods for improving the ability to distinguish the normal user from abnormal ones have been proposed, using the typing patterns captured during the user’s PIN input. In this paper, we propose unique keypads that are assigned to and used by only normal users of smartphones to improve the user classification performance capabilities of existing keypads. The proposed keypads are formed by randomly generated numbers based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm. In an attempt to demonstrate the superior classification performance of the proposed unique keypad compared to existing keypads, all tests except for the keypad type were conducted under the same conditions in earlier work, including collection-related features and feature selection methods. Our experimental results show that when the filtering rates are 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%, the corresponding equal error rates (EERs) for the proposed keypads are improved by 4.15%, 3.11%, 2.77%, 3.37% and 3.53% on average compared to the classification performance outcomes in earlier work.

AB  - The development of robotic systems to operate in forest environments is of great relevance for the public and private sectors. In this sense, this article reviews several scientific papers, research projects and commercial products related to robotic applications for environmental preservation, monitoring, wildfire firefighting, inventory operations, planting, pruning and harvesting. After conducting critical analysis, the main characteristics observed were: (a) the locomotion system is directly affected by the type of environmental monitoring to be performed; (b) different reasons for pruning result in different locomotion and cutting systems; (c) each type of forest, in each season and each type of soil can directly interfere with the navigation technique used; and (d) the integration of the concept of swarm of robots with robots of different types of locomotion systems (land, air or sea) can compensate for the time of executing tasks in unstructured environments. Two major areas are proposed for future research works: Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart forest and navigation systems. It is expected that, with the various characteristics exposed in this paper, the current robotic forest systems will be improved, so that forest exploitation becomes more efficient and sustainable.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles are increasingly becoming a necessary trend towards building the smart cities of the future. Numerous proposals have been presented in recent years to tackle particular aspects of the working pipeline towards creating a functional end-to-end system, such as object detection, tracking, path planning, sentiment or intent detection, amongst others. Nevertheless, few efforts have been made to systematically compile all of these systems into a single proposal that also considers the real challenges these systems will have on the road, such as real-time computation, hardware capabilities, etc. This paper reviews the latest techniques towards creating our own end-to-end autonomous vehicle system, considering the state-of-the-art methods on object detection, and the possible incorporation of distributed systems and parallelization to deploy these methods. Our findings show that while techniques such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory can effectively handle the initial detection and path planning tasks, more efforts are required to implement cloud computing to reduce the computational time that these methods demand. Additionally, we have mapped different strategies to handle the parallelization task, both within and between the networks.

AB  - Mobile location-based services (MLBS) are attracting attention for their potential public and personal use for a variety of applications such as location-based advertisement, smart shopping, smart cities, health applications, emergency response, and even gaming. Many of these applications rely on Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) due to the degraded GNSS services indoors. INS-based MLBS using smartphones is hindered by the quality of the MEMS sensors provided in smartphones which suffer from high noise and errors resulting in high drift in the navigation solution rapidly. Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is an INS-based navigation technique that exploits human motion to reduce navigation solution errors, but the errors cannot be eliminated without aid from other techniques. The purpose of this study is to enhance and extend the short-term reliability of PDR systems for smartphones as a standalone system through an enhanced step detection algorithm, a periodic attitude correction technique, and a novel PCA-based motion direction estimation technique. Testing shows that the developed system (S-PDR) provides a reliable short-term navigation solution with a final positioning error that is up to 6 m after 3 min runtime. These results were compared to a PDR solution using an Xsens IMU which is known to be a high grade MEMS IMU and was found to be worse than S-PDR. The findings show that S-PDR can be used to aid GNSS in challenging environments and can be a viable option for short-term indoor navigation until aiding is provided by alternative means. Furthermore, the extended reliable solution of S-PDR can help reduce the operational complexity of aiding navigation systems such as RF-based indoor navigation and magnetic map matching as it reduces the frequency by which these aiding techniques are required and applied.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Smart Parking is essential for any future smart cities due to the tremendous growth of the car fleet. Such infrastructures require a certain amount of equipment. Indeed, smart parking integrates a lot of actors, to manage the parking its equipment must be managed accordingly. Here, is proposed a distributed architecture to manage them by collecting efficiently their data. Two types of data relating to the parking must be collected: those coming from the deployed equipment in the parking and those coming from the internet due to remote users. Thus, a system of two main servers based on the multi-agent concept is proposed. This system manages the parking platform. The first server is dedicated to the parking equipment data collection (Processing Server–PS). The second server (Processing Web Server–PWS) collects the users’ online data such as reservation, and it is responsible for pricing policies, and receive post-processed data from the Processing Server. The parking equipment integrates a lot of commercial solutions, an intelligent multi-platform application based on this two server philosophy is developed and can be used for parking operation by users and parking managers. The flowcharts of the agents from the two mains servers are presented. These flowcharts are currently used in our demonstrator and still under improvements. Here, we present the architecture (hardware and software) of our smart parking demonstrator developed by our department and suitable for the experimentation of our future work related to this hot topic.

AB  - In this paper, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with Bat Algorithms (BA) offer a dynamic form of traffic control in Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs). The former is used to route vehicles across highly congested paths to enhance efficiency, with a lower average latency. The latter is combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) and it moves across the VANETs to analyze the traffic congestion status between the network nodes. The experimental analysis tests the effectiveness of DNN-IoT-BA in various machine or deep learning algorithms in VANETs. DNN-IoT-BA is validated through various network metrics, like packet delivery ratio, latency and packet error rate. The simulation results show that the proposed method provides lower energy consumption and latency than conventional methods to support real-time traffic conditions.

AB  - COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has a case-fatality rate of 2–3%, with higher rates among elderly patients and patients with comorbidities. Radiologically, COVID-19 is characterised by multifocal ground-glass opacities, even for patients with mild disease. Clinically, patients with COVID-19 present respiratory symptoms, which are very similar to other respiratory virus infections. Our knowledge regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still very limited. These facts make it vitally important to establish mechanisms that allow to model and predict the evolution of the virus and to analyze the spread of cases under different circumstances. The objective of this article is to present a model developed for the evolution of COVID in the city of Manizales, capital of the Department of Caldas, Colombia, focusing on the methodology used to allow its application to other cases, as well as on the monitoring tools developed for this purpose. This methodology is based on a hybrid model which combines the population dynamics of the SIR model of differential equations with extrapolations based on recurrent neural networks. This combination provides self-explanatory results in terms of a coefficient that fluctuates with the restraint measures, which may be further refined by expert rules that capture the expected changes in such measures.

AB  - Urban mobility plays an important role in addressing urban livability. The complexification and dispersion of travel due to the improvement of transport and the multiplication of our daily living places underline the relevance of multilevel territorial planning, recognizing that the knowledge of local differences is essential for more effective urban policies. This paper aims (1) to comprehend conceptually how urban mobility contributes to the urban livability from the local to metropolitan level and (2) to assess the previous relation toward a livable metropolis based on the readily available statistics for the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. Hence, a triangulation between conceptual, political/operative, and quantitative/monitoring approaches is required. The methodology follows four steps: (1) literature review focusing on the quantification of urban mobility within the urban livability approach; (2) data collection from the Portuguese statistics system; (3) data analysis and results, using principal component analysis (PCA) followed by cluster analysis (CA); (4) discussion and conclusions. In Portugal, although it is implicit, consistency is evident between the premises of recent urban mobility policies and respective planning instruments, such as the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP), and the premises of urban livability as an urban movement. Focusing on the national statistics system, the available indicators that meet our quality criteria are scarce and represent a reduced number of domains. Even so, they allow identifying intra-metropolitan differences in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA) that could support multilevel planning instruments. The results identified five principal components related to commuting at the local and intermunicipal level, including car use as well as social and environmental externalities, and they reorganized the 18 LMA municipalities into eight groups, clearly isolating Lisbon, the capital, from the others. The identification of sensitive territories and respective problems based on urban livability principles is fundamental for an effective urban planning from livable communities to livable metropolis.

AB  - Chronic diseases are becoming more widespread. Treatment and monitoring of these diseases require going to hospitals frequently, which increases the burdens of hospitals and patients. Presently, advancements in wearable sensors and communication protocol contribute to enriching the healthcare system in a way that will reshape healthcare services shortly. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is the foremost of these advancements. RPM systems are based on the collection of patient vital signs extracted using invasive and noninvasive techniques, then sending them in real-time to physicians. These data may help physicians in taking the right decision at the right time. The main objective of this paper is to outline research directions on remote patient monitoring, explain the role of AI in building RPM systems, make an overview of the state of the art of RPM, its advantages, its challenges, and its probable future directions. For studying the literature, five databases have been chosen (i.e., science direct, IEEE-Explore, Springer, PubMed, and science.gov). We followed the (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) PRISMA, which is a standard methodology for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A total of 56 articles are reviewed based on the combination of a set of selected search terms including RPM, data mining, clinical decision support system, electronic health record, cloud computing, internet of things, and wireless body area network. The result of this study approved the effectiveness of RPM in improving healthcare delivery, increase diagnosis speed, and reduce costs. To this end, we also present the chronic disease monitoring system as a case study to provide enhanced solutions for RPMs.

AB  - Movement analytics and mobility insights play a crucial role in urban planning and transportation management. The plethora of mobility data sources, such as GPS trajectories, poses new challenges and opportunities for understanding and predicting movement patterns. In this study, we predict highway speed using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network. Based on statistical models, previous approaches suffer from the inherited features of traffic data, such as nonlinear problems. The proposed method predicts highway speed based on the GRU method after training on digital tachograph data (DTG). The DTG data were recorded in one month, giving approximately 300 million records. These data included the velocity and locations of vehicles on the highway. Experimental results demonstrate that the GRU-based deep learning approach outperformed the state-of-the-art alternatives, the autoregressive integrated moving average model, and the long short-term neural network (LSTM) model, in terms of prediction accuracy. Further, the computational cost of the GRU model was lower than that of the LSTM. The proposed method can be applied to traffic prediction and intelligent transportation systems.

AB  - Digitisation of the built environment is seen as a significant factor for innovation in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation sector. However, lack of data and information in as-built digital models considerably limits the potential of Building Information Modelling in Facility Management. Therefore, optimisation of data collection and management is needed, all the more so now that Industry 4.0 has widened the use of sensors into buildings and infrastructures. A literature review on the two main pillars of digitalisation in construction, Building Information Modelling and Internet of Things, is presented, along with a bibliographic analysis of two citations and abstracts databases focusing on the operations stage. The bibliographic research has been carried out using Web of Science and Scopus databases. The article is aimed at providing a detailed analysis of BIM–IoT integration for Facility Management (FM) process improvements. Issues, opportunities and areas where further research efforts are required are outlined. Finally, four key areas of further research development in FM management have been proposed, focusing on optimising data collection and management.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications are becoming popular among many users nowadays, as it makes their life easier. Because of its popularity, attacks that target these devices have increased dramatically, which might cause the entire system to be unavailable. Some of these attacks are denial of service attack, sybil attack, man in the middle attack, and replay attack. Therefore, as the attacks have increased, the detection solutions to detect malware in the IoT have also increased. Most of the current solutions often have very serious limitations, and malware is becoming more apt in taking advantage of them. Therefore, it is important to develop a tool to overcome the existing limitations of current detection systems. This paper presents CoLL-IoT, a CoLLaborative intruder detection system that detects malicious activities in IoT devices. CoLL-IoT consists of the following four main layers: IoT layer, network layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. All of the layers work collaboratively by monitoring and analyzing all of the network traffic generated and received by IoT devices. CoLL-IoT brings the detection system close to the IoT devices by taking the advantage of edge computing and fog computing paradigms. The proposed system was evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset that has more than 175,000 records and achieved an accuracy of up to 98% with low type II error rate of 0.01. The evaluation results showed that CoLL-IoT outperformed the other existing tools, such as Dendron, which was also evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 7
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In unmanned aerial vehicle based urban observation and monitoring, the performance of computer vision algorithms is inevitably limited by the low illumination and light pollution caused degradation, therefore, the application image enhancement is a considerable prerequisite for the performance of subsequent image processing algorithms. Therefore, we proposed a deep learning and generative adversarial network based model for UAV low illumination image enhancement, named LighterGAN. The design of LighterGAN refers to the CycleGAN model with two improvements—attention mechanism and semantic consistency loss—having been proposed to the original structure. Additionally, an unpaired dataset that was captured by urban UAV aerial photography has been used to train this unsupervised learning model. Furthermore, in order to explore the advantages of the improvements, both the performance in the illumination enhancement task and the generalization ability improvement of LighterGAN were proven in the comparative experiments combining subjective and objective evaluations. In the experiments with five cutting edge image enhancement algorithms, in the test set, LighterGAN achieved the best results in both visual perception and PIQE (perception based image quality evaluator, a MATLAB build-in function, the lower the score, the higher the image quality) score of enhanced images, scores were 4.91 and 11.75 respectively, better than EnlightenGAN the state-of-the-art. In the enhancement of low illumination sub-dataset Y (containing 2000 images), LighterGAN also achieved the lowest PIQE score of 12.37, 2.85 points lower than second place. Moreover, compared with the CycleGAN, the improvement of generalization ability was also demonstrated. In the test set generated images, LighterGAN was 6.66 percent higher than CycleGAN in subjective authenticity assessment and 3.84 lower in PIQE score, meanwhile, in the whole dataset generated images, the PIQE score of LighterGAN is 11.67, 4.86 lower than CycleGAN.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Deep learning models have improved cutting-edge technologies in many research areas, but their black-box structure makes it difficult to understand their inner workings and the rationale behind their predictions. This may lead to unintended effects, such as being susceptible to adversarial attacks or the reinforcement of biases. There is still a lack of research in the audio domain, despite the increasing interest in developing deep learning models that provide explanations of their decisions. To reduce this gap, we propose a novel interpretable deep learning model for automatic sound classification, which explains its predictions based on the similarity of the input to a set of learned prototypes in a latent space. We leverage domain knowledge by designing a frequency-dependent similarity measure and by considering different time-frequency resolutions in the feature space. The proposed model achieves results that are comparable to that of the state-of-the-art methods in three different sound classification tasks involving speech, music, and environmental audio. In addition, we present two automatic methods to prune the proposed model that exploit its interpretability. Our system is open source and it is accompanied by a web application for the manual editing of the model, which allows for a human-in-the-loop debugging approach.

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - The evolution of low-cost sensors (LCSs) has made the spatio-temporal mapping of indoor air quality (IAQ) possible in real-time but the availability of a diverse set of LCSs make their selection challenging. Converting individual sensors into a sensing network requires the knowledge of diverse research disciplines, which we aim to bring together by making IAQ an advanced feature of smart homes. The aim of this review is to discuss the advanced home automation technologies for the monitoring and control of IAQ through networked air pollution LCSs. The key steps that can allow transforming conventional homes into smart homes are sensor selection, deployment strategies, data processing, and development of predictive models. A detailed synthesis of air pollution LCSs allowed us to summarise their advantages and drawbacks for spatio-temporal mapping of IAQ. We concluded that the performance evaluation of LCSs under controlled laboratory conditions prior to deployment is recommended for quality assurance/control (QA/QC), however, routine calibration or implementing statistical techniques during operational times, especially during long-term monitoring, is required for a network of sensors. The deployment height of sensors could vary purposefully as per location and exposure height of the occupants inside home environments for a spatio-temporal mapping. Appropriate data processing tools are needed to handle a huge amount of multivariate data to automate pre-/post-processing tasks, leading to more scalable, reliable and adaptable solutions. The review also showed the potential of using machine learning technique for predicting spatio-temporal IAQ in LCS networked-systems.

AB  - The article is devoted to cybersecurity risk assessment of the dynamic device-to-device networks of a smart city. Analysis of the modern security threats at the IoT/IIoT, VANET, and WSN inter-device infrastructures demonstrates that the main concern is a set of network security threats targeted at the functional sustainability of smart urban infrastructure, the most common use case of smart networks. As a result of our study, systematization of the existing cybersecurity risk assessment methods has been provided. Expert-based risk assessment and active human participation cannot be provided for the huge, complex, and permanently changing digital environment of the smart city. The methods of scenario analysis and functional analysis are specific to industrial risk management and are hardly adaptable to solving cybersecurity tasks. The statistical risk evaluation methods force us to collect statistical data for the calculation of the security indicators for the self-organizing networks, and the accuracy of this method depends on the number of calculating iterations. In our work, we have proposed a new approach for cybersecurity risk management based on object typing, data mining, and quantitative risk assessment for the smart city infrastructure. The experimental study has shown us that the artificial neural network allows us to automatically, unambiguously, and reasonably assess the cyber risk for various object types in the dynamic digital infrastructures of the smart city.

AB  - This paper presents a low-cost and high-quality, hardware-oriented, two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (2-D DCT) signal analyzer for image and video encoders. In order to reduce memory requirement and improve image quality, a novel Loeffler DCT based on a coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) technique is proposed. In addition, the proposed algorithm is realized by a recursive CORDIC architecture instead of an unfolded CORDIC architecture with approximated scale factors. In the proposed design, a fully pipelined architecture is developed to efficiently increase operating frequency and throughput, and scale factors are implemented by using four hardware-sharing machines for complexity reduction. Thus, the computational complexity can be decreased significantly with only 0.01 dB loss deviated from the optimal image quality of the Loeffler DCT. Experimental results show that the proposed 2-D DCT spectral analyzer not only achieved a superior average peak signal–noise ratio (PSNR) compared to the previous CORDIC-DCT algorithms but also designed cost-efficient architecture for very large scale integration (VLSI) implementation. The proposed design was realized using a UMC 0.18-μm CMOS process with a synthesized gate count of 8.04 k and core area of 75,100 μm2. Its operating frequency was 100 MHz and power consumption was 4.17 mW. Moreover, this work had at least a 64.1% gate count reduction and saved at least 22.5% in power consumption compared to previous designs.

T2  - Mathematics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 9
IS  - 7
SN  - 2227-7390

AB  - We used a large sample of 188,652 properties, which represented 4.88% of the total housing stock in Catalonia from 1994 to 2013, to make a comparison between different real estate valuation methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), quantile regressions (QRs) and semi-log regressions (SLRs). A literature gap in regard to the comparison between ANN and QR modelling of hedonic prices in housing was identified, with this article being the first paper to include this comparison. Therefore, this study aimed to answer (1) whether QR valuation modelling of hedonic prices in the housing market is an alternative to ANNs, (2) whether it is confirmed that ANNs produce better results than SLRs when assessing housing in Catalonia, and (3) which of the three mass appraisal models should be used by Spanish banks to assess real estate. The results suggested that the ANNs and SLRs obtained similar and better performances than the QRs and that the SLRs performed better when the datasets were smaller. Therefore, (1) QRs were not found to be an alternative to ANNs, (2) it could not be confirmed whether ANNs performed better than SLRs when assessing properties in Catalonia and (3) whereas small and medium banks should use SLRs, large banks should use either SLRs or ANNs in real estate mass appraisal.

TI  - Medium-Term Regional Electricity Load Forecasting through Machine Learning and Deep Learning
T2  - Designs

PY  - 2021
VL  - 5
IS  - 2
SN  - 2411-9660

AB  - Due to severe climate change impact on electricity consumption, as well as new trends in smart grids (such as the use of renewable resources and the advent of prosumers and energy commons), medium-term and long-term electricity load forecasting has become a crucial need. Such forecasts are necessary to support the plans and decisions related to the capacity evaluation of centralized and decentralized power generation systems, demand response strategies, and controlling the operation. To address this problem, the main objective of this study is to develop and compare precise district level models for predicting the electrical load demand based on machine learning techniques including support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), and deep learning methods such as non-linear auto-regressive exogenous (NARX) neural network and recurrent neural networks (Long Short-Term Memory—LSTM). A dataset including nine years of historical load demand for Bruce County, Ontario, Canada, fused with the climatic information (temperature and wind speed) are used to train the models after completing the preprocessing and cleaning stages. The results show that by employing deep learning, the model could predict the load demand more accurately than SVM and RF, with an R-Squared of about 0.93–0.96 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of about 4–10%. The model can be used not only by the municipalities as well as utility companies and power distributors in the management and expansion of electricity grids; but also by the households to make decisions on the adoption of home- and district-scale renewable energy technologies.

TI  - A Model-Driven-to-Sample-Driven Method for Rural Road Extraction
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 8
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Road extraction in rural areas is one of the most fundamental tasks in the practical application of remote sensing. In recent years, sample-driven methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in road extraction tasks. However, sample-driven methods are prohibitively expensive and laborious, especially when dealing with rural roads with irregular curvature changes, narrow widths, and diverse materials. The template matching method can overcome these difficulties to some extent and achieve impressive road extraction results. This method also has the advantage of the vectorization of road extraction results, but the automation is limited. Straight line sequences can be substituted for curves, and the use of the color space can increase the recognition of roads and nonroads. A model-driven-to-sample-driven road extraction method for rural areas with a much higher degree of automation than existing template matching methods is proposed in this study. Without prior samples, on the basis of the geometric characteristics of narrow and long roads and using the advantages of straight lines instead of curved lines, the road center point extraction model is established through length constraints and gray mean contrast constraints of line sequences, and the extraction of some rural roads is completed through topological connection analysis. In addition, we take the extracted road center point and manual input data as local samples, use the improved line segment histogram to determine the local road direction, and use the panchromatic and hue, saturation, value (HSV) space interactive matching model as the matching measure to complete the road tracking extraction. Experimental results show that, for different types of data and scenarios on the premise, the accuracy and recall rate of the evaluation indicators reach more than 98%, and, compared with other methods, the automation of this algorithm has increased by more than 40%.

TI  - Monitoring Real Time Security Attacks for IoT Systems Using DevSecOps: A Systematic Literature Review
T2  - Information

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - In many enterprises and the private sector, the Internet of Things (IoT) has spread globally. The growing number of different devices connected to the IoT and their various protocols have contributed to the increasing number of attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) and remote-to-local (R2L) ones. There are several approaches and techniques that can be used to construct attack detection models, such as machine learning, data mining, and statistical analysis. Nowadays, this technique is commonly used because it can provide precise analysis and results. Therefore, we decided to study the previous literature on the detection of IoT attacks and machine learning in order to understand the process of creating detection models. We also evaluated various datasets used for the models, IoT attack types, independent variables used for the models, evaluation metrics for assessment of models, and monitoring infrastructure using DevSecOps pipelines. We found 49 primary studies, and the detection models were developed using seven different types of machine learning techniques. Most primary studies used IoT device testbed datasets, and others used public datasets such as NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. When it comes to measuring the efficiency of models, both numerical and graphical measures are commonly used. Most IoT attacks occur at the network layer according to the literature. If the detection models applied DevSecOps pipelines in development processes for IoT devices, they were more secure. From the results of this paper, we found that machine learning techniques can detect IoT attacks, but there are a few issues in the design of detection models. We also recommend the continued use of hybrid frameworks for the improved detection of IoT attacks, advanced monitoring infrastructure configurations using methods based on software pipelines, and the use of machine learning techniques for advanced supervision and monitoring.

T2  - Symmetry

VL  - 13

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - In real estate, there are various variables for the forecasting of future land prices, in addition to the macro and micro perspectives used in the current research. Examples of such variables are the economic growth rate, unemployment rate, regional development and important locations, and transportation. Therefore, in this paper, data on real estate and national price fluctuation rates were used to predict the ways in which future land prices will fluctuate, and macro and micro perspective variables were actively utilized in order to conduct land analysis based on Big Data analysis. We sought to understand what kinds of variables directly affect the fluctuation of the land, and to use this for future land price analysis. In addition to the two variables mentioned above, the factor of the landscape was also confirmed to be closely related to the real estate market. Therefore, in order to check the correlation between the landscape and the real estate market, we will examine the factors which change the land price in the landscape district, and then discuss how the landscape and real estate can interact. As a result, re-explaining the previous contents, the future land price is predicted by actively utilizing macro and micro variables in real estate land price prediction. Through this method, we want to increase the accuracy of the real estate market, which is difficult to predict, and we hope that it will be useful in the real estate market in the future.

AB  - In recent years, rapid development has been made to the Internet of Things communication technologies, infrastructure, and physical resources management. These developments and research trends address challenges such as heterogeneous communication, quality of service requirements, unpredictable network conditions, and a massive influx of data. One major contribution to the research world is in the form of software-defined networking applications, which aim to deploy rule-based management to control and add intelligence to the network using high-level policies to have integral control of the network without knowing issues related to low-level configurations. Machine learning techniques coupled with software-defined networking can make the networking decision more intelligent and robust. The Internet of Things application has recently adopted virtualization of resources and network control with software-defined networking policies to make the traffic more controlled and maintainable. However, the requirements of software-defined networking and the Internet of Things must be aligned to make the adaptations possible. This paper aims to discuss the possible ways to make software-defined networking enabled Internet of Things application and discusses the challenges solved using the Internet of Things leveraging the software-defined network. We provide a topical survey of the application and impact of software-defined networking on the Internet of things networks. We also study the impact of machine learning techniques applied to software-defined networking and its application perspective. The study is carried out from the different perspectives of software-based Internet of Things networks, including wide-area networks, edge networks, and access networks. Machine learning techniques are presented from the perspective of network resources management, security, classification of traffic, quality of experience, and quality of service prediction. Finally, we discuss challenges and issues in adopting machine learning and software-defined networking for the Internet of Things applications.

TI  - Snake-Based Model for Automatic Roof Boundary Extraction in the Object Space Integrating a High-Resolution Aerial Images Stereo Pair and 3D Roof Models

AB  - The accelerated urban development over the last decades has made it necessary to update spatial information rapidly and constantly. Therefore, cities’ three-dimensional models have been widely used as a study base for various urban problems. However, although many efforts have been made to develop new building extraction methods, reliable and automatic extraction is still a major challenge for the remote sensing and computer vision communities, mainly due to the complexity and variability of urban scenes. This paper presents a method to extract building roof boundaries in the object space by integrating a high-resolution aerial images stereo pair, three-dimensional roof models reconstructed from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and contextual information of the scenes involved. The proposed method focuses on overcoming three types of common problems that can disturb the automatic roof extraction in the urban environment: perspective occlusions caused by high buildings, occlusions caused by vegetation covering the roof, and shadows that are adjacent to the roofs, which can be misinterpreted as roof edges. For this, an improved Snake-based mathematical model is developed considering the radiometric and geometric properties of roofs to represent the roof boundary in the image space. A new approach for calculating the corner response and a shadow compensation factor was added to the model. The created model is then adapted to represent the boundaries in the object space considering a stereo pair of aerial images. Finally, the optimal polyline, representing a selected roof boundary, is obtained by optimizing the proposed Snake-based model using a dynamic programming (DP) approach considering the contextual information of the scene. The results showed that the proposed method works properly in boundary extraction of roofs with occlusion and shadows areas, presenting completeness and correctness average values above 90%, RMSE average values below 0.5 m for E and N components, and below 1 m for H component.

AB  - Modern vehicles are no longer simply mechanical devices. Connectivity between the vehicular network and the outside world has widened the security holes that hackers can use to exploit a vehicular network. Controller Area Network (CAN), FlexRay, and automotive Ethernet are popular protocols for in-vehicle networks (IVNs) and will stay in the industry for many more years. However, these protocols were not designed with security in mind. They have several vulnerabilities, such as lack of message authentication, lack of message encryption, and an ID-based arbitration mechanism for contention resolution. Adversaries can use these vulnerabilities to launch sophisticated attacks that may lead to loss of life and damage to property. Thus, the security of the vehicles should be handled carefully. In this paper, we investigate the security vulnerabilities with in-vehicle network protocols such as CAN, automotive Ethernet, and FlexRay. A comprehensive survey on security attacks launched against in-vehicle networks is presented along with countermeasures adopted by various researchers. Various algorithms have been proposed in the past for intrusion detection in IVNs. However, those approaches have several limitations that need special attention from the research community. Blockchain is a good approach to solving the existing security issues in IVNs, and we suggest a way to improve IVN security based on a hybrid blockchain.

T2  - Energies

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The proliferation of distributed renewable energy resources (RESs) poses major challenges to the operation of microgrids due to uncertainty. Traditional online scheduling approaches relying on accurate forecasts become difficult to implement due to the increase of uncertain RESs. Although several data-driven methods have been proposed recently to overcome the challenge, they generally suffer from a scalability issue due to the limited ability to optimize high-dimensional continuous control variables. To address these issues, we propose a data-driven online scheduling method for microgrid energy optimization based on continuous-control deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We formulate the online scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). The objective is to minimize the operating cost of the microgrid considering the uncertainty of RESs generation, load demand, and electricity prices. To learn the optimal scheduling strategy, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based network is designed to extract temporal features of uncertainty and generate the optimal scheduling decisions in an end-to-end manner. To optimize the policy with high-dimensional and continuous actions, proximal policy optimization (PPO) is employed to train the neural network-based policy in a data-driven fashion. The proposed method does not require any forecasting information on the uncertainty or a prior knowledge of the physical model of the microgrid. Simulation results using realistic power system data of California Independent System Operator (CAISO) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Worldwide increasing awareness of energy sustainability issues has been the main driver in developing the concepts of (Nearly) Zero Energy Buildings, where the reduced energy consumptions are (nearly) fully covered by power locally generated by renewable sources. At the same time, recent advances in Internet of Things technologies are among the main enablers of Smart Homes and Buildings. The transition of conventional buildings into active environments that process, elaborate and react to online measured environmental quantities is being accelerated by the aspects related to COVID-19, most notably in terms of air exchange and the monitoring of the density of occupants. In this paper, we address the problem of maximizing the energy efficiency and comfort perceived by occupants, defined in terms of thermal comfort, visual comfort and air quality. The case study of the University of Pisa is considered as a practical example to show preliminary results of the aggregation of environmental data.

SN  - 1660-4601

AB  - Experts have predicted that COVID-19 may prevail for many months or even years before it can be completely eliminated. A major problem in its cure is its early screening and detection, which will decide on its treatment. Due to the fast contactless spreading of the virus, its screening is unusually difficult. Moreover, the results of COVID-19 tests may take up to 48 h. That is enough time for the virus to worsen the health of the affected person. The health community needs effective means for identification of the virus in the shortest possible time. In this study, we invent a medical device utilized consisting of composable sensors to monitor remotely and in real-time the health status of those who have symptoms of the coronavirus or those infected with it. The device comprises wearable medical sensors integrated using the Arduino hardware interfacing and a smartphone application. An IoT framework is deployed at the backend through which various devices can communicate in real-time. The medical device is applied to determine the patient’s critical status of the effects of the coronavirus or its symptoms using heartbeat, cough, temperature and Oxygen concentration (SpO2) that are evaluated using our custom algorithm. Until now, it has been found that many coronavirus patients remain asymptomatic, but in case of known symptoms, a person can be quickly identified with our device. It also allows doctors to examine their patients without the need for physical direct contact with them to reduce the possibility of infection. Our solution uses rule-based decision-making based on the physiological data of a person obtained through sensors. These rules allow to classify a person as healthy or having a possibility of infection by the coronavirus. The advantage of using rules for patient’s classification is that the rules can be updated as new findings emerge from time to time. In this article, we explain the details of the sensors, the smartphone application, and the associated IoT framework for real-time, remote screening of COVID-19.
