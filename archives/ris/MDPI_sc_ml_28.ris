AB  - Fog computing extends the cloud computing paradigm by placing resources close to the edges of the network to deal with the upcoming growth of connected devices. Smart city applications, such as health monitoring and predictive maintenance, will introduce a new set of stringent requirements, such as low latency, since resources can be requested on-demand simultaneously by multiple devices at different locations. It is then necessary to adapt existing network technologies to future needs and design new architectural concepts to help meet these strict requirements. This article proposes a fog computing framework enabling autonomous management and orchestration functionalities in 5G-enabled smart cities. Our approach follows the guidelines of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) NFV MANO architecture extending it with additional software components. The contribution of our work is its fully-integrated fog node management system alongside the foreseen application layer Peer-to-Peer (P2P) fog protocol based on the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol for the exchange of application service provisioning information between fog nodes. Evaluations of an anomaly detection use case based on an air monitoring application are presented. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves a substantial reduction in network bandwidth usage and in latency when compared to centralized cloud solutions.

TI  - How to Evaluate Smart Cities’ Construction? A Comparison of Chinese Smart City Evaluation Methods Based on PSF

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - With the rapid development of smart cities in the world, research relating to smart city evaluation has become a new research hotspot in academia. However, there are general problems of cognitive deprivation, lack of planning experience, and low level of coordination in smart cities construction. It is necessary for us to develop a set of scientific, reasonable, and effective evaluation index systems and evaluation models to analyze the development degree of urban wisdom. Based on the theory of the urban system, we established a comprehensive evaluation index system for urban intelligent development based on the people-oriented, city-system, and resources-flow (PSF) evaluation model. According to the characteristics of the comprehensive evaluation index system of urban intelligent development, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) combined with the experts’ opinions determine the index weight of this system. We adopted the neural network model to construct the corresponding comprehensive evaluation model to characterize the non-linear characteristics of the comprehensive evaluation indexes system, thus to quantitatively quantify the comprehensive evaluation indexes of urban intelligent development. Finally, we used the AHP, AHP-BP (Back Propagation), and AHP-ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) models to evaluate the intelligent development level of 151 cities in China, and compared them from the perspective of model accuracy and time cost. The final simulation results show that the AHP-ELM model is the best evaluation model.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Vehicular nodes are equipped with more and more sensing units, and a large amount of sensing data is generated. Recently, more and more research considers cooperative urban sensing as the heart of intelligent and green city traffic management. The key components of the platform will be a combination of a pervasive vehicular sensing system, as well as a central control and analysis system, where data-gathering is a fundamental component. However, the data-gathering and monitoring are also challenging issues in vehicular sensor networks because of the large amount of data and the dynamic nature of the network. In this paper, we propose an efficient continuous event-monitoring and data-gathering framework based on fog nodes in vehicular sensor networks. A fog-based two-level threshold strategy is adopted to suppress unnecessary data upload and transmissions. In the monitoring phase, nodes sense the environment in low cost sensing mode and generate sensed data. When the probability of the event is high and exceeds some threshold, nodes transfer to the event-checking phase, and some nodes would be selected to transfer to the deep sensing mode to generate more accurate data of the environment. Furthermore, it adaptively adjusts the threshold to upload a suitable amount of data for decision making, while at the same time suppressing unnecessary message transmissions. Simulation results showed that the proposed scheme could reduce more than 84 percent of the data transmissions compared with other existing algorithms, while it detects the events and gathers the event data.

AB  - Transportation planning and solutions have an enormous impact on city life. To minimize the transport duration, urban planners should understand and elaborate the mobility of a city. Thus, researchers look toward monitoring people’s daily activities including transportation types and duration by taking advantage of individual’s smartphones. This paper introduces a novel segment-based transport mode detection architecture in order to improve the results of traditional classification algorithms in the literature. The proposed post-processing algorithm, namely the Healing algorithm, aims to correct the misclassification results of machine learning-based solutions. Our real-life test results show that the Healing algorithm could achieve up to 40% improvement of the classification results. As a result, the implemented mobile application could predict eight classes including stationary, walking, car, bus, tram, train, metro and ferry with a success rate of 95% thanks to the proposed multi-tier architecture and Healing algorithm.

VL  - 18
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Duty-cycled sensor networks provide a new perspective for improvement of energy efficiency and reliability assurance of multi-hop cooperative sensor networks. In this paper, we consider the energy-efficient cooperative node sleeping and clustering problems in cooperative sensor networks where clusters of relay nodes jointly transmit sensory data to the next hop. Our key idea for guaranteeing reliability is to exploit the on-demand number of cooperative nodes, facilitating the prediction of personalized end-to-end (ETE) reliability. Namely, a novel reliability-aware cooperative routing (RCR) scheme is proposed to select k-cooperative nodes at every hop (RCR-selection). After selecting k cooperative nodes at every hop, all of the non-cooperative nodes will go into sleep status. In order to solve the cooperative node clustering problem, we propose the RCR-based optimal relay assignment and cooperative data delivery (RCR-delivery) scheme to provide a low-communication-overhead data transmission and an optimal duty cycle for a given number of cooperative nodes when the network is dynamic, which enables part of cooperative nodes to switch into idle status for further energy saving. Through the extensive OPNET-based simulations, we show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing geographic routing schemes and beaconless geographic routings in wireless sensor networks with a highly dynamic wireless channel and controls energy consumption, while ETE reliability is effectively guaranteed.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the concept of a smart city based on information and communication technology (ICT), analyze the objectives of smart city development in Taiwan, and explain the supporting technologies that make such development possible. Subsequently, we propose a hierarchical structure framework of smart city systems with levels of complexity ranging from low to high and interconnections and interactive relationships in five dimensions: the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data, Mobile Network, and smart business. We integrate each key resource of the core operation systems of cities to promote the innovative operation of cities and further optimize city development. We then propose a Big Data platform data flow framework that uses information from ubiquitous sensor networks and information equipment to analyze the Big Data application process of smart cities and determine the resulting advantages and challenges. Additionally, we analyze the current state of development of smart cities in Taiwan. Finally, we discuss a new philosophy of smart city development and provide a practical blueprint for the formation, operation, and development of the smart cities with the aim of creating a bright future for the smart cities of Taiwan.

SN  - 2410-387X

AB  - Today, digitalization decisively penetrates all the sides of the modern society. One of the key enablers to maintain this process secure is authentication. It covers many different areas of a hyper-connected world, including online payments, communications, access right management, etc. This work sheds light on the evolution of authentication systems towards Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) starting from Single-Factor Authentication (SFA) and through Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Particularly, MFA is expected to be utilized for human-to-everything interactions by enabling fast, user-friendly, and reliable authentication when accessing a service. This paper surveys the already available and emerging sensors (factor providers) that allow for authenticating a user with the system directly or by involving the cloud. The corresponding challenges from the user as well as the service provider perspective are also reviewed. The MFA system based on reversed Lagrange polynomial within Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) scheme is further proposed to enable more flexible authentication. This solution covers the cases of authenticating the user even if some of the factors are mismatched or absent. Our framework allows for qualifying the missing factors by authenticating the user without disclosing sensitive biometric data to the verification entity. Finally, a vision of the future trends in MFA is discussed.

AB  - According to UNESCO, education is a fundamental human right and every nation’s citizens should be granted universal access with equal quality to it. Because this goal is yet to be achieved in most countries, in particular in the developing and underdeveloped countries, it is extremely important to find more effective ways to improve education. This paper presents a model based on the application of computational intelligence (data mining and data science) that leads to the development of the student’s knowledge profile and that can help educators in their decision making for best orienting their students. This model also tries to establish key performance indicators to monitor objectives’ achievement within individual strategic planning assembled for each student. The model uses random forest for classification and prediction, graph description for data structure visualization and recommendation systems to present relevant information to stakeholders. The results presented were built based on the real dataset obtained from a Brazilian private k-9 (elementary school). The obtained results include correlations among key data, a model to predict student performance and recommendations that were generated for the stakeholders.

AB  - With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), more and more sensors, actuators and mobile devices have been deployed into our daily lives. The result is that tremendous data are produced and it is urgent to dig out hidden information behind these volumous data. However, IoT data generated by multi-modal sensors or devices show great differences in formats, domains and types, which poses challenges for machines to process and understand. Therefore, adding semantics to Internet of Things becomes an overwhelming tendency. This paper provides a systematic review of data semantization in IoT, including its backgrounds, processing flows, prevalent techniques, applications, existing challenges and open issues. It surveys development status of adding semantics to IoT data, mainly referring to sensor data and points out current issues and challenges that are worth further study.

PY  - 2018

SN  - 2413-8851

AB  - Slums are a global urban challenge, with less developed countries being particularly impacted. To adequately detect and map them, data is needed on their location, spatial extent and evolution. High- and very high-resolution remote sensing imagery has emerged as an important source of data in this regard. The purpose of this paper is to critically review studies that have used such data to detect and map slums. Our analysis shows that while such studies have been increasing over time, they tend to be concentrated to a few geographical areas and often focus on the use of a single approach (e.g., image texture and object-based image analysis), thus limiting generalizability to understand slums, their population, and evolution within the global context. We argue that to develop a more comprehensive framework that can be used to detect and map slums, other emerging sourcing of geospatial data should be considered (e.g., volunteer geographic information) in conjunction with growing trends and advancements in technology (e.g., geosensor networks). Through such data integration and analysis we can then create a benchmark for determining the most suitable methods for mapping slums in a given locality, thus fostering the creation of new approaches to address this challenge.

VL  - 18
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) environment, reusing objects instead of creating new one has become important in academics and industries. The situation becomes complex due to the availability of a huge number of connected IoT objects, and each individual service creates a new object instead of reusing the existing one to fulfill a requirement. A well-standard mechanism not only improves the reusability of objects but also improves service modularity and extensibility, and reduces cost. Web Objects enabled IoT environment applies the principle of reusability of objects in multiple IoT application domains through central objects repository and microservices. To reuse objects with microservices and to maintain a relationship with them, this study presents an architecture of Web of Objects platform. In the case of a similar request for an object, the already instantiated object that exists in the same or from other domain can be reused. Reuse of objects through microservices avoids duplications, and reduces time to search and instantiate them from their registries. Further, this article presents an algorithm for microservices and related objects discovery that considers the reusability of objects through the central objects repository. To support the reusability of objects, the necessary algorithm for objects matching is also presented. To realize the reusability of objects in Web Objects enabled IoT environment, a prototype has been designed and implemented based on a use case scenario. Finally, the results of the prototype have been analyzed and discussed to validate the proposed approach.

SN  - 2227-7080

AB  - Wind induced noise is one of the major concerns of outdoor acoustic signal acquisition. It affects many field measurement and audio recording scenarios. Filtering such noise is known to be difficult due to its broadband and time varying nature. In this paper, a new method to mitigate wind induced noise in microphone signals is developed. Instead of applying filtering techniques, wind induced noise is statistically separated from wanted signals in a singular spectral subspace. The paper is presented in the context of handling microphone signals acquired outdoor for acoustic sensing and environmental noise monitoring or soundscapes sampling. The method includes two complementary stages, namely decomposition and reconstruction. The first stage decomposes mixed signals in eigen-subspaces, selects and groups the principal components according to their contributions to wind noise and wanted signals in the singular spectrum domain. The second stage reconstructs the signals in the time domain, resulting in the separation of wind noise and wanted signals. Results show that microphone wind noise is separable in the singular spectrum domain evidenced by the weighted correlation. The new method might be generalized to other outdoor sound acquisition applications.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Sensor networks and the Internet of Things have driven the evolution of traditional electric power distribution networks towards a new paradigm referred to as Smart Grid. However, the different elements that compose the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) layer of a Smart Grid are usually conceived as isolated systems that typically result in rigid hardware architectures which are hard to interoperate, manage, and to adapt to new situations. If the Smart Grid paradigm has to be presented as a solution to the demand for distributed and intelligent energy management system, it is necessary to deploy innovative IT infrastructures to support these smart functions. One of the main issues of Smart Grids is the heterogeneity of communication protocols used by the smart sensor devices that integrate them. The use of the concept of the Web of Things is proposed in this work to tackle this problem. More specifically, the implementation of a Smart Grid’s Web of Things, coined as the Web of Energy is introduced. The purpose of this paper is to propose the usage of Web of Energy by means of the Actor Model paradigm to address the latent deployment and management limitations of Smart Grids. Smart Grid designers can use the Actor Model as a design model for an infrastructure that supports the intelligent functions demanded and is capable of grouping and converting the heterogeneity of traditional infrastructures into the homogeneity feature of the Web of Things. Conducted experimentations endorse the feasibility of this solution and encourage practitioners to point their efforts in this direction.

PY  - 2018

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Among the current challenges of the Smart City, traffic management and maintenance are of utmost importance. Road surface monitoring is currently performed by humans, but the road surface condition is one of the main indicators of road quality, and it may drastically affect fuel consumption and the safety of both drivers and pedestrians. Abnormalities in the road, such as manholes and potholes, can cause accidents when not identified by the drivers. Furthermore, human-induced abnormalities, such as speed bumps, could also cause accidents. In addition, while said obstacles ought to be signalized according to specific road regulation, they are not always correctly labeled. Therefore, we developed a novel method for the detection of road abnormalities (i.e., speed bumps). This method makes use of a gyro, an accelerometer, and a GPS sensor mounted in a car. After having the vehicle cruise through several streets, data is retrieved from the sensors. Then, using a cross-validation strategy, a genetic algorithm is used to find a logistic model that accurately detects road abnormalities. The proposed model had an accuracy of 0.9714 in a blind evaluation, with a false positive rate smaller than 0.018, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9784. This methodology has the potential to detect speed bumps in quasi real-time conditions, and can be used to construct a real-time surface monitoring system.

AB  - As the era of big data approaches, big data has attracted increasing amounts of attention from researchers. Various types of studies have been conducted and these studies have focused particularly on the management, organization, and correlation of data and calculations using data. Most studies involving big data address applications in scientific, commercial, and ecological fields. However, the application of big data to government management is also needed. This paper examines the application of multi-source government data to urban construction and supervision in Tianjin, China. The analytic hierarchy process and a new approach called the correlation degree algorithm are introduced to calculate the degree of correlation between different approval items in one construction project and between different construction projects. The results show that more than 75% of the construction projects and their approval items are highly correlated. The results of this study suggest that most of the examined construction projects are well supervised, have relatively high probabilities of satisfying the relevant legal requirements, and observe their initial planning schemes.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Bike-sharing services are flourishing in Smart Cities worldwide. They provide a low-cost and environment-friendly transportation alternative and help reduce traffic congestion. However, these new services are still under development, and several challenges need to be solved. A major problem is the management of rebalancing trucks in order to ensure that bikes and stalls in the docking stations are always available when needed, despite the fluctuations in the service demand. In this work, we propose a dynamic rebalancing strategy that exploits historical data to predict the network conditions and promptly act in case of necessity. We use Birth-Death Processes to model the stations’ occupancy and decide when to redistribute bikes, and graph theory to select the rebalancing path and the stations involved. We validate the proposed framework on the data provided by New York City’s bike-sharing system. The numerical simulations show that a dynamic strategy able to adapt to the fluctuating nature of the network outperforms rebalancing schemes based on a static schedule.

TI  - An Efficient Framework Model for Optimizing Routing Performance in VANETs

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) is a bit complicated because of the nature of the high dynamic mobility. The efficiency of routing protocol is influenced by a number of factors such as network density, bandwidth constraints, traffic load, and mobility patterns resulting in frequency changes in network topology. Therefore, Quality of Service (QoS) is strongly needed to enhance the capability of the routing protocol and improve the overall network performance. In this paper, we introduce a statistical framework model to address the problem of optimizing routing configuration parameters in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. Our framework solution is based on the utilization of the network resources to further reflect the current state of the network and to balance the trade-off between frequent changes in network topology and the QoS requirements. It consists of three stages: simulation network stage used to execute different urban scenarios, the function stage used as a competitive approach to aggregate the weighted cost of the factors in a single value, and optimization stage used to evaluate the communication cost and to obtain the optimal configuration based on the competitive cost. The simulation results show significant performance improvement in terms of the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Normalized Routing Load (NRL), Packet loss (PL), and End-to-End Delay (E2ED).

The City4Age H2020 project is working on the early detection of the risks related to mild cognitive impairment and frailty and on providing meaningful interventions that prevent these risks. As part of the risk detection process, we have developed a multilevel conceptual model that describes the user behaviour using actions, activities, and intra- and inter-activity behaviour. Using this conceptual model, we have created a deep learning architecture based on long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) that models the inter-activity behaviour. The presented architecture offers a probabilistic model that allows us to predict the user’s next actions and to identify anomalous user behaviours.

AB  - Diverse and varied cyber-attacks challenge the operation of the smart-world system that is supported by Internet-of-Things (IoT) (smart cities, smart grid, smart transportation, etc.) and must be carefully and thoughtfully addressed before widespread adoption of the smart-world system can be fully realized. Although a number of research efforts have been devoted to defending against these threats, a majority of existing schemes focus on the development of a specific defensive strategy to deal with specific, often singular threats. In this paper, we address the issue of coalitional attacks, which can be launched by multiple adversaries cooperatively against the smart-world system such as smart cities. Particularly, we propose a game-theory based model to capture the interaction among multiple adversaries, and quantify the capacity of the defender based on the extended Iterated Public Goods Game (IPGG) model. In the formalized game model, in each round of the attack, a participant can either cooperate by participating in the coalitional attack, or defect by standing aside. In our work, we consider the generic defensive strategy that has a probability to detect the coalitional attack. When the coalitional attack is detected, all participating adversaries are penalized. The expected payoff of each participant is derived through the equalizer strategy that provides participants with competitive benefits. The multiple adversaries with the collusive strategy are also considered. Via a combination of theoretical analysis and experimentation, our results show that no matter which strategies the adversaries choose (random strategy, win-stay-lose-shift strategy, or even the adaptive equalizer strategy), our formalized game model is capable of enabling the defender to greatly reduce the maximum value of the expected average payoff to the adversaries via provisioning sufficient defensive resources, which is reflected by setting a proper penalty factor against the adversaries. In addition, we extend our game model and analyze the extortion strategy, which can enable one participant to obtain more payoff by extorting his/her opponents. The evaluation results show that the defender can combat this strategy by encouraging competition among the adversaries, and significantly suppress the total payoff of the adversaries via setting the proper penalty factor.

AB  - Sound pleasantness or annoyance perceived in urban soundscapes is a major concern in environmental acoustics. Binaural psychoacoustic parameters are helpful to describe generic acoustic environments, as it is stated within the ISO 12913 framework. In this paper, the application of a Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network (WASN) to evaluate the spatial distribution and the evolution of urban acoustic environments is described. Two experiments are presented using an indoor and an outdoor deployment of a WASN with several nodes using an Internet of Things (IoT) environment to collect audio data and calculate meaningful parameters such as the sound pressure level, binaural loudness and binaural sharpness. A chunk of audio is recorded in each node periodically with a microphone array and the binaural rendering is conducted by exploiting the estimated directional characteristics of the incoming sound by means of DOA estimation. Each node computes the parameters in a different location and sends the values to a cloud-based broker structure that allows spatial statistical analysis through Kriging techniques. A cross-validation analysis is also performed to confirm the usefulness of the proposed system.

AB  - Context-aware monitoring systems designed for e-Health solutions and ambient assisted living (AAL) play an important role in today’s personalized health-care services. The majority of these systems are intended for the monitoring of patients’ vital signs by means of bio-sensors. At present, there are very few systems that monitor environmental conditions and air quality in the homes of users. A home’s environmental conditions can have a significant influence on the state of the health of its residents. Monitoring the environment is the key to preventing possible diseases caused by conditions that do not favor health. This paper presents a context-aware system that monitors air quality to prevent a specific health problem at home. The aim of this system is to reduce the incidence of the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, which is triggered mainly by environmental factors. In the conducted case study, the system monitored the state of the neonate and the quality of air while it was asleep. The designed proposal is characterized by its low cost and non-intrusive nature. The results are promising.

AB  - Mobility is a significant robotic task. It is the most important function when robotics is applied to domains such as autonomous cars, home service robots, and autonomous underwater vehicles. Despite extensive research on this topic, robots still suffer from difficulties when moving in complex environments, especially in practical applications. Therefore, the ability to have enough intelligence while moving is a key issue for the success of robots. Researchers have proposed a variety of methods and algorithms, including navigation and tracking. To help readers swiftly understand the recent advances in methodology and algorithms for robot movement, we present this survey, which provides a detailed review of the existing methods of navigation and tracking. In particular, this survey features a relation-based architecture that enables readers to easily grasp the key points of mobile intelligence. We first outline the key problems in robot systems and point out the relationship among robotics, navigation, and tracking. We then illustrate navigation using different sensors and the fusion methods and detail the state estimation and tracking models for target maneuvering. Finally, we address several issues of deep learning as well as the mobile intelligence of robots as suggested future research topics. The contributions of this survey are threefold. First, we review the literature of navigation according to the applied sensors and fusion method. Second, we detail the models for target maneuvering and the existing tracking based on estimation, such as the Kalman filter and its series developed form, according to their model-construction mechanisms: linear, nonlinear, and non-Gaussian white noise. Third, we illustrate the artificial intelligence approach—especially deep learning methods—and discuss its combination with the estimation method.

AB  - This study aims to highlight the contribution made by different international institutions in the field of urban generation of renewable energy, as a key element to achieve sustainability. This has been possible through the use of the Scopus Elsevier database, and the application of bibliometric techniques through which the articles content published from 1977 to 2017 has been analysed. The results shown by Scopus (e.g., journal articles and conferences proceedings) have been taken into account for further analysis by using the following search pattern (TITLE-ABS-KEY ({Renewable energy} AND ({urban} OR ({cit*})). In order to carry out this study, key features of the publications have been taken into consideration, such as type of document, language, thematic area, type of publication, and keywords. As far as keywords are concerned, renewable energy, sustainability, sustainable development, urban areas, city, and energy efficiency, have been the most frequently used. The results found have been broken down both geographically and by institution, showing that China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and India are the main research countries and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Education China and Tsinghua University the major contributing institutes. With regard to the categories, Energy, Environmental Sciences, and Engineering are positioned as the most active categories. The scientific community agrees that the study of the renewable energy generation in cities is of vital importance to achieve more sustainable cities, and for the welfare of a growing urban population. Moreover, this is in line with the energy policies adopted by most of developed countries in order to mitigate climate change effects.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The size of phytoplankton not only influences its physiology, metabolic rates and marine food web, but also serves as an indicator of phytoplankton functional roles in ecological and biogeochemical processes. Therefore, some algorithms have been developed to infer the synoptic distribution of phytoplankton cell size, denoted as phytoplankton size classes (PSCs), in surface ocean waters, by the means of remotely sensed variables. This study, using the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) database, and satellite match-ups, aimed to compare the effectiveness of modeling techniques, including partial least square (PLS), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RF), and feature selection techniques, including genetic algorithm (GA), successive projection algorithm (SPA) and recursive feature elimination based on support vector machine (SVM-RFE), for inferring PSCs from remote sensing data. Results showed that: (1) SVM-RFE worked better in selecting sensitive features; (2) RF performed better than PLS, ANN and SVM in calibrating PSCs retrieval models; (3) machine learning techniques produced better performance than the chlorophyll-a based three-component method; (4) sea surface temperature, wind stress, and spectral curvature derived from the remote sensing reflectance at 490, 510, and 555 nm were among the most sensitive features to PSCs; and (5) the combination of SVM-RFE feature selection techniques and random forests regression was recommended for inferring PSCs. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in selecting sensitive features and calibrating models for PSCs estimations with remote sensing.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm focusing on the connection of devices, objects, or “things” to each other, to the Internet, and to users. IoT technology is anticipated to become an essential requirement in the development of smart homes, as it offers convenience and efficiency to home residents so that they can achieve better quality of life. Application of the IoT model to smart homes, by connecting objects to the Internet, poses new security and privacy challenges in terms of the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the data sensed, collected, and exchanged by the IoT objects. These challenges make smart homes extremely vulnerable to different types of security attacks, resulting in IoT-based smart homes being insecure. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the possible security risks to develop a complete picture of the security status of smart homes. This article applies the operationally critical threat, asset, and vulnerability evaluation (OCTAVE) methodology, known as OCTAVE Allegro, to assess the security risks of smart homes. The OCTAVE Allegro method focuses on information assets and considers different information containers such as databases, physical papers, and humans. The key goals of this study are to highlight the various security vulnerabilities of IoT-based smart homes, to present the risks on home inhabitants, and to propose approaches to mitigating the identified risks. The research findings can be used as a foundation for improving the security requirements of IoT-based smart homes.

AB  - Nowadays, Physical Web together with the increase in the use of mobile devices, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Social Networking Sites (SNS) have caused users to share enriched information on the Web such as their tourist experiences. Therefore, an area that has been significantly improved by using the contextual information provided by these technologies is tourism. In this way, the main goals of this work are to propose and develop an algorithm focused on the recommendation of Smart Point of Interaction (Smart POI) for a specific user according to his/her preferences and the Smart POIs’ context. Hence, a novel Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm (HyRA) is presented by incorporating an aggregation operator into the user-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithm as well as including the Smart POIs’ categories and geographical information. For the experimental phase, two real-world datasets have been collected and preprocessed. In addition, one Smart POIs’ categories dataset was built. As a result, a dataset composed of 16 Smart POIs, another constituted by the explicit preferences of 200 respondents, and the last dataset integrated by 13 Smart POIs’ categories are provided. The experimental results show that the recommendations suggested by HyRA are promising.

AB  - New technologies such as sensor networks have been incorporated into the management of buildings for organizations and cities. Sensor networks have led to an exponential increase in the volume of data available in recent years, which can be used to extract consumption patterns for the purposes of energy and monetary savings. For this reason, new approaches and strategies are needed to analyze information in big data environments. This paper proposes a methodology to extract electric energy consumption patterns in big data time series, so that very valuable conclusions can be made for managers and governments. The methodology is based on the study of four clustering validity indices in their parallelized versions along with the application of a clustering technique. In particular, this work uses a voting system to choose an optimal number of clusters from the results of the indices, as well as the application of the distributed version of the k-means algorithm included in Apache Spark’s Machine Learning Library. The results, using electricity consumption for the years 2011–2017 for eight buildings of a public university, are presented and discussed. In addition, the performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using synthetic big data, which cab represent thousands of buildings in a smart city. Finally, policies derived from the patterns discovered are proposed to optimize energy usage across the university campus.

AB  - The rise in the number and intensity of natural disasters is a serious problem that affects the whole world. The consequences of these disasters are significantly worse when they occur in urban districts because of the casualties and extent of the damage to goods and property that is caused. Until now feasible methods of dealing with this have included the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for data collection and machine-learning (ML) techniques for forecasting natural disasters. However, there have recently been some promising new innovations in technology which have supplemented the task of monitoring the environment and carrying out the forecasting. One of these schemes involves adopting IP-based (Internet Protocol) sensor networks, by using emerging patterns for IoT. In light of this, in this study, an attempt has been made to set out and describe the results achieved by SENDI (System for dEtecting and forecasting Natural Disasters based on IoT). SENDI is a fault-tolerant system based on IoT, ML and WSN for the detection and forecasting of natural disasters and the issuing of alerts. The system was modeled by means of ns-3 and data collected by a real-world WSN installed in the town of São Carlos - Brazil, which carries out the data collection from rivers in the region. The fault-tolerance is embedded in the system by anticipating the risk of communication breakdowns and the destruction of the nodes during disasters. It operates by adding intelligence to the nodes to carry out the data distribution and forecasting, even in extreme situations. A case study is also included for flash flood forecasting and this makes use of the ns-3 SENDI model and data collected by WSN.

AB  - In this paper, we see the Data Centers (DCs) as producers of waste heat integrated with smart energy infrastructures, heat which can be re-used for nearby neighborhoods. We provide a model of the thermo-electric processes within DCs equipped with heat reuse technology, allowing them to adapt their thermal response profile to meet various levels of hot water demand. On top of the model, we have implemented computational fluid dynamics-based simulations to determine the cooling system operational parameters settings, which allow the heat to build up without endangering the servers’ safety operation as well as the distribution of the workload on the servers to avoid hot spots. This will allow for setting higher temperature set points for short periods of time and using pre-cooling and post-cooling as flexibility mechanisms for DC thermal profile adaptation. To reduce the computational time complexity, we have used neural networks, which are trained using the simulation results. Experiments have been conducted considering a small operational DC featuring a server room of 24 square meters and 60 servers organized in four racks. The results show the DCs’ potential to meet different levels of thermal energy demand by re-using their waste heat in nearby neighborhoods.

AB  - The present research proposes a novel emotion recognition framework for the computer prediction of human emotions using common wearable biosensors. Emotional perception promotes specific patterns of biological responses in the human body, and this can be sensed and used to predict emotions using only biomedical measurements. Based on theoretical and empirical psychophysiological research, the foundation of autonomic specificity facilitates the establishment of a strong background for recognising human emotions using machine learning on physiological patterning. However, a systematic way of choosing the physiological data covering the elicited emotional responses for recognising the target emotions is not obvious. The current study demonstrates through experimental measurements the coverage of emotion recognition using common off-the-shelf wearable biosensors based on the synchronisation between audiovisual stimuli and the corresponding physiological responses. The work forms the basis of validating the hypothesis for emotional state recognition in the literature and presents coverage of the use of common wearable biosensors coupled with a novel preprocessing algorithm to demonstrate the practical prediction of the emotional states of wearers.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - In future years, the Internet of Things is expected to interconnect billions of highly heterogeneous devices, denoted as “smart objects”, enabling the development of innovative distributed applications. Smart objects are constrained sensor/actuator-equipped devices, in terms of computational power and available memory. In order to cope with the diverse physical connectivity technologies of smart objects, the Internet Protocol is foreseen as the common “language” for full interoperability and as a unifying factor for integration with the Internet. Large-scale platforms for interconnected devices are required to effectively manage resources provided by smart objects. In this work, we present a novel architecture for the management of large numbers of resources in a scalable, seamless, and secure way. The proposed architecture is based on a network element, denoted as IoT Hub, placed at the border of the constrained network, which implements the following functions: service discovery; border router; HTTP/Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and CoAP/CoAP proxy; cache; and resource directory. In order to protect smart objects (which cannot, because of their constrained nature, serve a large number of concurrent requests) and the IoT Hub (which serves as a gateway to the constrained network), we introduce the concept of virtual IoT Hub replica: a Cloud-based “entity” replicating all the functions of a physical IoT Hub, which external clients will query to access resources. IoT Hub replicas are constantly synchronized with the physical IoT Hub through a low-overhead protocol based on Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT). An experimental evaluation, proving the feasibility and advantages of the proposed architecture, is presented.

AB  - General variable neighborhood search (GVNS) is a well known and widely used metaheuristic for efficiently solving many NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. We propose a novel extension of the conventional GVNS. Our approach incorporates ideas and techniques from the field of quantum computation during the shaking phase. The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a well known NP-hard problem which has broadly been used for modelling many real life routing cases. As a consequence, TSP can be used as a basis for modelling and finding routes via the Global Positioning System (GPS). In this paper, we examine the potential use of this method for the GPS system of garbage trucks. Specifically, we provide a thorough presentation of our method accompanied with extensive computational results. The experimental data accumulated on a plethora of TSP instances, which are shown in a series of figures and tables, allow us to conclude that the novel GVNS algorithm can provide an efficient solution for this type of geographical problem.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Medical healthcare is one of the fascinating applications using Internet of Things (IoTs). The pervasive smart environment in IoTs has the potential to monitor various human activities by deploying smart devices. In our pilot study, we look at narcolepsy, a disorder in which individuals lose the ability to regulate their sleep-wake cycle. An imbalance in the brain chemical called orexin makes the sleep pattern irregular. This sleep disorder in patients suffering from narcolepsy results in them experience irrepressible sleep episodes while performing daily routine activities. This study presents a novel method for detecting sleep attacks or sleepiness due to immune system attacks and affecting daily activities measured using the S-band sensing technique. The S-Band sensing technique is channel sensing based on frequency spectrum sensing using the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing transmission at a 2 to 4 GHz frequency range leveraging amplitude and calibrated phase information of different frequencies obtained using wireless devices such as card, and omni-directional antenna. Each human behavior induces a unique channel information (CI) signature contained in amplitude and phase information. By linearly transforming raw phase measurements into calibrated phase information, we ascertain phase coherence. Classification and validation of various human activities such as walking, sitting on a chair, push-ups, and narcolepsy sleep episodes are done using support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, and random forest algorithms. The measurement and evaluation were carried out several times with classification values of accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, Kappa, and F-measure of more than 90% that were achieved when delineating sleep attacks.

AB  - Driving experiences provided by the introduction of new vehicle technologies are directly impacting the criteria for road network design. New criteria should be taken into consideration by designers, researchers and car owners in order to assure traffic safety in changed conditions that will appear with, for example, introduction of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in everyday traffic. In this paper, roundabout safety level is analysed on the originally developed microsimulation model in circumstances where different numbers of AVs vehicles are mixed with Conventional Vehicles (CVs). Field data about speed and traffic volumes from existing roundabouts in Croatia were used for development of the model. The simulations done with the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) give some relevant highlights on how the introduction of AVs could change both operational and safety parameters at roundabouts. To further explore the effects on safety of roundabouts with the introduction of different shares of AVs, hypothetical safety treatments could be tested to explore whether their effects may change, leading to the estimation of a new set of Crash Modification Factors.

AB  - Modern cities are subject to periodic or unexpected critical events, which may bring economic losses or even put people in danger. When some monitoring systems based on wireless sensor networks are deployed, sensing and transmission configurations of sensor nodes may be adjusted exploiting the relevance of the considered events, but efficient detection and classification of events of interest may be hard to achieve. In Smart City environments, several people spontaneously post information in social media about some event that is being observed and such information may be mined and processed for detection and classification of critical events. This article proposes an integrated approach to detect and classify events of interest posted in social media, notably in Twitter, and the assignment of sensing priorities to source nodes. By doing so, wireless sensor networks deployed in Smart City scenarios can be optimized for higher efficiency when monitoring areas under the influence of the detected events.

AB  - The advent of alternative vehicle technologies such as Electrical Vehicles (EVs) is an efficient effort to reduce the emission of carbon oxides and nitrogen oxides. Ironically, EVs poses concerns related to vehicle recharging and management. Due to the significance of charging station infrastructure, electric vehicles&rsquo; charging stations deployment is investigated in this work. Its aim is to consider several limitations such as the power of charging station, the average time needed for each recharge, and traveling distance per day. Initially, a mathematical formulation of the problem is framed. Then, this problem is optimized by application of Genetic Algorithm (GA), with the objective to calculate the necessary number of charging stations then finding the best positions to locate them to satisfy the clients demand.

AB  - This work presents a framework that monitors particular symptoms such as respiratory conditions (abnormal breathing pattern) experienced by hyperthyreosis, sleep apnea, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) patients. The proposed framework detects and monitors respiratory condition using S-Band sensing technique that leverages the wireless devices such as antenna, card, omni-directional antenna operating in 2 GHz to 4 GHz frequency range, and wireless channel information extraction tool. The rhythmic patterns extracted using S-Band sensing present the periodic and non-periodic waveforms that correspond to normal and abnormal respiratory conditions, respectively. The fine-grained amplitude information obtained using aforementioned devices is used to examine the breathing pattern over a period of time and accurately identifies the particular condition.

AB  - This paper describes the evolution of the thermal network and its applications for making simplified thermal models of buildings by means of thermal resistances (R) and capacitances (C). In the literature, there are several modelling schemes for buildings. Here, we investigate the advantages, disadvantages, and improvements of thermal networks. The thermal network method has been used in different studies for calculating indoor air temperature and heating load, estimating model parameters, and studying building interactions with heating and cooling systems. This review paper conducts an investigation into the application, system identification, and structure of thermal networks compared to other tools. Within the framework of the thermal network method, we conclude with some new proposals for research in this field to expand the idea of the thermal network to other engineering and energy management fields.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Big Data is a large-sized and complex dataset, which cannot be managed using traditional data processing tools. Mining process of big data is the ability to extract valuable information from these large datasets. Association rule mining is a type of data mining process, which is indented to determine interesting associations between items and to establish a set of association rules whose support is greater than a specific threshold. The classical association rules can only be extracted from binary data where an item exists in a transaction, but it fails to deal effectively with quantitative attributes, through decreasing the quality of generated association rules due to sharp boundary problems. In order to overcome the drawbacks of classical association rule mining, we propose in this research a new neutrosophic association rule algorithm. The algorithm uses a new approach for generating association rules by dealing with membership, indeterminacy, and non-membership functions of items, conducting to an efficient decision-making system by considering all vague association rules. To prove the validity of the method, we compare the fuzzy mining and the neutrosophic mining. The results show that the proposed approach increases the number of generated association rules.

AB  - A smart city implies a consistent use of technology for the benefit of the community. As the city develops over time, components and subsystems such as smart grids, smart water management, smart traffic and transportation systems, smart waste management systems, smart security systems, or e-governance are added. These components ingest and generate a multitude of structured, semi-structured or unstructured data that may be processed using a variety of algorithms in batches, micro batches or in real-time. The ICT architecture must be able to handle the increased storage and processing needs. When vertical scaling is no longer a viable solution, Hadoop can offer efficient linear horizontal scaling, solving storage, processing, and data analyses problems in many ways. This enables architects and developers to choose a stack according to their needs and skill-levels. In this paper, we propose a Hadoop-based architectural stack that can provide the ICT backbone for efficiently managing a smart city. On the one hand, Hadoop, together with Spark and the plethora of NoSQL databases and accompanying Apache projects, is a mature ecosystem. This is one of the reasons why it is an attractive option for a Smart City architecture. On the other hand, it is also very dynamic; things can change very quickly, and many new frameworks, products and options continue to emerge as others decline. To construct an optimized, modern architecture, we discuss and compare various products and engines based on a process that takes into consideration how the products perform and scale, as well as the reusability of the code, innovations, features, and support and interest in online communities.

SN  - 2076-0760

AB  - We are living in a data-driven society. Big Data and the Internet of Things are popular terms. Governments, universities and the private sector make great investments in collecting and storing data and also extracting new knowledge from these data banks. Technological enthusiasm runs throughout political discourses. “Algorithmic regulation” is defined as a form of data-driven governance. Big Data shall offer brand new opportunities in scientific research. At the same time, political criticism of data storage grows because of a lack of privacy protection and the centralization of data in the hands of governments and corporations. Calls for data-driven dynamic regulation have existed in the past. In Chile, cybernetic development led to the creation of Cybersyn, a computer system that was created to manage the socialist economy under the Allende government 1971–1973. My contribution will present this Cybersyn project created by Stafford Beer. Beer proposed the creation of a “liberty machine” in which expert knowledge would be grounded in data-guided policy. The paper will focus on the human–technological complex in society. The first section of the paper will discuss whether the political and social environment can completely change the attempts of algorithmic regulation. I will deal specifically with the development of technological knowledge in Chile, a postcolonial state, and the relationship between citizens and data storage in a socialist state. In a second section, I will examine the question of which measures can lessen the danger of data storage regarding privacy in a democratic society. Lastly, I will discuss how much data-driven governance is required for democracy and political participation. I will present a second case study: digital participatory budgeting (DPB) in Brazil.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Aiming for sustainable buildings and cities is critical to achieving a future that is socially just, ecologically regenerative, culturally rich, and economically viable. However, our current concepts of sustainability often exclude the essential domains of data, information, and the knowledge relating to the relationship between buildings and people that inhabit them. Thus, the research questions at the core of this paper have been as follows: Can technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) be used to create systems that enhance relationships between buildings and inhabitants? Can social networks and natural interactions support further research relating to human-centric design tools for the built environment? The Human Observation Meta-Environment (HOME) project was developed to address this question. The ICT architecture has been tested to observe and collect human behaviour data within a sentient room at the Politecnico di Torino (IT), where the inhabitants were strategically aware of their behaviours. Methods of analysis included technologies related to the domain of AI (such as Natural Language Analysis, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning) that have been used in social network analysis in connection with the word &lsquo;comfort&rsquo;, and definitions resonate strongly with the realm of regenerative design. Results were used to further research the role of users that could serve as leverages to design (both spaces and related smart systems) according to actual user needs. People from very different disciplinary backgrounds interacted with the prototype in a workshop and provided stimuli for further considerations regarding the possible technological, psychological, cognitive, cultural, social, political, and aesthetical impacts of the use of these technologies inside sentient buildings. The paper enriches the discourse on how ICT data can be organised and read in a human-centric regenerative design process perspective.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 4
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - One of the main aspects affecting the quality of life of people living in urban and suburban areas is the continuous exposure to high road traffic noise (RTN) levels. Nowadays, thanks to Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) noise in Smart Cities has started to be automatically mapped. To obtain a reliable picture of the RTN, those anomalous noise events (ANE) unrelated to road traffic (sirens, horns, people, etc.) should be removed from the noise map computation by means of an Anomalous Noise Event Detector (ANED). In Hybrid WASNs, with master-slave architecture, ANED should be implemented in both high-capacity (Hi-Cap) and low-capacity (Lo-Cap) sensors, following the same principle to obtain consistent results. This work presents an ANED version to run in real-time on   &mu;   Controller-based Lo-Cap sensors of a hybrid WASN, discriminating RTN from ANE through their Mel-based spectral energy differences. The experiments, considering 9 h and 8 min of real-life acoustic data from both urban and suburban environments, show the feasibility of the proposal both in terms of computational load and in classification accuracy. Specifically, the ANED Lo-Cap requires around     1 6     of the computational load of the ANED Hi-Cap, while classification accuracies are slightly lower (around 10%). However, preliminary analyses show that these results could be improved in around 4% in the future by means of considering optimal frequency selection.

AB  - Many municipalities express a wish to use digital technologies to achieve environmental aims. However, there is still a need for a better understanding of how this should practically be done, both among municipalities and among ICT developers. We have used workshops and literature studies to formulate technological abilities of digitalization. We use two EU directives that are relevant for municipal environmental goals and combine the activities that these directives indicate with technological abilities of digitalization, in order to formulate practical implementations of digital technology to help these activities and reach the directives&rsquo; goals. We suggest that this method can be used for any municipal goal, as follows: (1) Identify the objective (in our case set by the EU-directives); (2) Identify what activities these points will require or generate; (3a) From a municipal viewpoint: Based on the results of 1 and 2, formulate and structure ideas of how digitalization can support the objectives and how those ideas can be implemented; (3b) From a provider&rsquo;s viewpoint: Investigate what digital solutions supporting 1 and 2 exist, or how existing services can be tweaked to support the objectives and explore how new digital solutions supporting 1 and 2 can be developed.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Human activity recognition is a challenging problem for context-aware systems and applications. It is gaining interest due to the ubiquity of different sensor sources, wearable smart objects, ambient sensors, etc. This task is usually approached as a supervised machine learning problem, where a label is to be predicted given some input data, such as the signals retrieved from different sensors. For tackling the human activity recognition problem in sensor network environments, in this paper we propose the use of deep learning (convolutional neural networks) to perform activity recognition using the publicly available OPPORTUNITY dataset. Instead of manually choosing a suitable topology, we will let an evolutionary algorithm design the optimal topology in order to maximize the classification F1 score. After that, we will also explore the performance of committees of the models resulting from the evolutionary process. Results analysis indicates that the proposed model was able to perform activity recognition within a heterogeneous sensor network environment, achieving very high accuracies when tested with new sensor data. Based on all conducted experiments, the proposed neuroevolutionary system has proved to be able to systematically find a classification model which is capable of outperforming previous results reported in the state-of-the-art, showing that this approach is useful and improves upon previously manually-designed architectures.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has become a hot trend and is used in a wide variety of fields. For instance, in education, this technology contributes to improving learning efficiency in the class by enabling learners to interact with physical devices and providing appropriate learning content based on this interaction. Such interaction data can be collected through the physical devices to define personal data. In the meanwhile, multimedia contents in this environment usually have a wide variety of formats and standards, making it difficult for computers to understand their meaning and reuse them. This could be a serious obstacle to the effective use or sustainable management of educational contents in IoT-based educational systems. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a semantic annotation scheme for sustainable computing in the IoT environment. More specifically, we first show how to collect appropriate multimedia contents and interaction data. Next, we calculate the readability of learning materials and define the user readability level to provide appropriate contents to the learners. Finally, we describe our semantic annotation scheme and show how to annotate collected data using our scheme. We implement a prototype system and show that our scheme can achieve efficient management of various learning materials in the IoT-based educational system.

AB  - Smart city (SC) technologies can provide appropriate services according to citizens&rsquo; demands. One of the key enablers in a SC is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which enables a massive number of devices to connect with each other. However, these devices usually come from different manufacturers with different product standards, which confront interactive control problems. Moreover, these devices will produce large amounts of data, and efficiently analyzing these data for intelligent services. In this paper, we propose a novel artificial intelligence-based semantic IoT (AI-SIoT) hybrid service architecture to integrate heterogeneous IoT devices to support intelligent services. In particular, the proposed architecture is empowered by semantic and AI technologies, which enable flexible connections among heterogeneous devices. The AI technology can support very implement efficient data analysis and make accurate decisions on service provisions in various kinds. Furthermore, we also present several practical use cases of the proposed AI-SIoT architecture and the opportunities and challenges to implement the proposed AI-SIoT for future SCs are also discussed.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 5
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The emergence of smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices has highly favored the realization of smart homes in a down-stream sector of a smart grid. The underlying objective of Demand Response (DR) schemes is to actively engage customers to modify their energy consumption on domestic appliances in response to pricing signals. Domestic appliance scheduling is widely accepted as an effective mechanism to manage domestic energy consumption intelligently. Besides, to residential customers for DR implementation, maintaining a balance between energy consumption cost and users&rsquo; comfort satisfaction is a challenge. Hence, in this paper, a constrained Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based residential consumer-centric load-scheduling method is proposed. The method can be further featured with edge computing. In contrast with cloud computing, edge computing&mdash;a method of optimizing cloud computing technologies by driving computing capabilities at the IoT edge of the Internet as one of the emerging trends in engineering technology&mdash;addresses bandwidth-intensive contents and latency-sensitive applications required among sensors and central data centers through data analytics at or near the source of data. A non-intrusive load-monitoring technique proposed previously is utilized to automatic determination of physical characteristics of power-intensive home appliances from users&rsquo; life patterns. The swarm intelligence, constrained PSO, is used to minimize the energy consumption cost while considering users&rsquo; comfort satisfaction for DR implementation. The residential consumer-centric load-scheduling method proposed in this paper is evaluated under real-time pricing with inclining block rates and is demonstrated in a case study. The experimentation reported in this paper shows the proposed residential consumer-centric load-scheduling method can re-shape loads by home appliances in response to DR signals. Moreover, a phenomenal reduction in peak power consumption is achieved by 13.97%.

In this purpose, we have developed a mixed artificial neural network (ANN) approach using both non-linear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) ANNs and function fitting neural networks (FITNETs). We have used a large dataset containing detailed electricity consumption data recorded by sensors, monitoring a series of individual appliances, while in the NARX case we have also used timestamps datasets as exogenous variables. After having developed and validated the forecasting method, we have compiled it in view of incorporating it into a cloud solution, being delivered to the contractor that can provide it as a service for a monthly fee to both the operators and residential consumers.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Service perception analysis is crucial for understanding both user experiences and network quality as well as for maintaining and optimizing of mobile networks. Given the rapid development of mobile Internet and over-the-top (OTT) services, the conventional network-centric mode of network operation and maintenance is no longer effective. Therefore, developing an approach to evaluate and optimizing users’ service perceptions has become increasingly important. Meanwhile, the development of a new sensing paradigm, mobile crowdsensing (MCS), makes it possible to evaluate and analyze the user’s OTT service perception from end-user’s point of view other than from the network side. In this paper, the key factors that impact users’ end-to-end OTT web browsing service perception are analyzed by monitoring crowdsourced user perceptions. The intrinsic relationships among the key factors and the interactions between key quality indicators (KQI) are evaluated from several perspectives. Moreover, an analytical framework of perceptional degradation and a detailed algorithm are proposed whose goal is to identify the major factors that impact the perceptional degradation of web browsing service as well as their significance of contribution. Finally, a case study is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method using a dataset crowdsensed from a large number of smartphone users in a real mobile network. The proposed analytical framework forms a valuable solution for mobile network maintenance and optimization and can help improve web browsing service perception and network quality.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) concept is aiming at being an integral part of the next generation networking services by introducing pervasiveness and ubiquitous interconnectivity of uniquely-identifiable objects. The massive availability of personalized smart devices such as smartphones and wearables enable their penetration into the IoT ecosystem with their built-in sensors, particularly in Mobile Crowd-Sensing (MCS) campaigns. The MCS systems achieve the objectives of the large-scale non-dedicated sensing concept in the IoT if a sufficient number of participants are engaged to the collaborative data acquisition process. Therefore, user recruitment is a key challenge in MCS, which requires effective incentivization of cooperative, truthful and trustworthy users. A grand concern for the participants is the battery drain on the mobile devices. It is a known fact that battery drain in a smartphone is a function of the user activity, which can be modeled under various contexts. With this in mind, we propose a new social activity-aware recruitment policy, namely Sociability-Oriented and Battery-Efficient Recruitment for Mobile Crowd-Sensing (SOBER-MCS). SOBER-MCS uses sociability and the residual power of the participant smartphones as two primary criteria in the selection of participating devices. The former is an indicator of the participant willingness toward sensing campaigns, whereas the latter is used to prioritize personal use over crowd-sensing under critical battery levels. We use sociability profiles that were obtained in our previous work and use those values to simulate the sociability behavior of a large pool of participants in an MCS environment. Through simulations, we show that SOBER-MCS is able to introduce battery savings up to 18.5% while improving user and platform utilities by 12% and 20%, respectively.

Two of them based on standardized methodologies, face the problem by considering the indoor environment in steady-state conditions (PMV and PPD) and users as active subjects whose thermal perception is influenced by outdoor climatic conditions (adaptive approach). The latter method is the starting point to investigate thermal comfort from an overall perspective by considering endogenous variables besides the traditional physical and environmental ones. Following this perspective, the paper describes the results of an in-field investigation of thermal conditions through the use of nearable and wearable solutions, parametric models and machine learning techniques. The aim of the research is the exploration of the reliability of IoT-based solutions combined with advanced algorithms, in order to create a replicable framework for the assessment and improvement of user thermal satisfaction. For this purpose, an experimental test in real offices was carried out involving eight workers. Parametric models are applied for the assessment of thermal comfort; IoT solutions are used to monitor the environmental variables and the users&rsquo; parameters; the machine learning CART method allows to predict the users&rsquo; profile and the thermal comfort perception respect to the indoor environment.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - With the recent advances of information and communication technology, people communicate with each other through online communities or social networking services, such as PatientsLikeMe and Facebook. One of the key challenges in aspects of providing sustainable situation-aware services is how to utilize peoples&rsquo; experiences shared as reusable social-intelligence. If domain-specific collective intelligence is well constructed, the knowledge usages can be extended to situation-awareness-based personal situation understanding, and sustainable recommendation services with user intent. In this paper, we introduce a sustainable situation-awareness supporting framework based on text-mining techniques and a domain-specific knowledge model, the so-called Service Quality Model for Hospitals (SQM-H). Different from obtaining sustainable contexts from heterogeneous sensors surrounding users, it aggregates SQM-H based service-specific knowledge from online health communities. Our framework includes a set of components: data aggregation, text-mining, service quality analysis, and open Application Programming Interface (APIs) for recommendation services. Those components have been designed to deal with users&rsquo; immediate request, providing service quality related information reflected in collective intelligence and analyzed information based on that along with the SQM-H. As a proof of concept, we implemented a prototype system which interacts with users through smartphone user interface. Our framework supports qualitative and quantitative information based on SQM-H and statistical analyses for the given user queries. Through the implementation and user tests, we confirmed an increased knowledge support for decision-making and an easy mashup with provided Open APIs. We believe that the suggested situation-awareness supporting framework can be applied to numerous sustainable applications related to healthcare and wellness domain areas if domain-specific knowledge models are redesigned.

AB  - With the development of wireless sensor networks, IoT devices are crucial for the Smart City; these devices change people&rsquo;s lives such as e-payment and e-voting systems. However, in these two systems, the state-of-art authentication protocols based on traditional number theory cannot defeat a quantum computer attack. In order to protect user privacy and guarantee trustworthy of big data, we propose a new identity-based blind signature scheme based on number theorem research unit lattice, this scheme mainly uses a rejection sampling theorem instead of constructing a trapdoor. Meanwhile, this scheme does not depend on complex public key infrastructure and can resist quantum computer attack. Then we design an e-payment protocol using the proposed scheme. Furthermore, we prove our scheme is secure in the random oracle, and satisfies confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the other traditional existing identity-based blind signature schemes in signing speed and verification speed, outperforms the other lattice-based blind signature in signing speed, verification speed, and signing secret key size.

AB  - The new sensing applications need enhanced computing capabilities to handle the requirements of complex and huge data processing. The Internet of Things (IoT) concept brings processing and communication features to devices. In addition, the Cloud Computing paradigm provides resources and infrastructures for performing the computations and outsourcing the work from the IoT devices. This scenario opens new opportunities for designing advanced IoT-based applications, however, there is still much research to be done to properly gear all the systems for working together. This work proposes a collaborative model and an architecture to take advantage of the available computing resources. The resulting architecture involves a novel network design with different levels which combines sensing and processing capabilities based on the Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) paradigm. An experiment is included to demonstrate that this approach can be used in diverse real applications. The results show the flexibility of the architecture to perform complex computational tasks of advanced applications.

AB  - The increasing number of sensors used in diverse applications has provided a massive number of continuous, unbounded, rapid data and requires the management of distinct protocols, interfaces and intermittent connections. As traditional sensor networks are error-prone and difficult to maintain, the study highlights the emerging role of &ldquo;citizens as sensors&rdquo; as a complementary data source to increase public awareness. To this end, an interoperable, reusable middleware for managing spatial, temporal, and thematic data using Sensor Web Enablement initiative services and a processing engine was designed, implemented, and deployed. The study found that its approach provided effective sensor data-stream access, publication, and filtering in dynamic scenarios such as disaster management, as well as it enables batch and stream management integration. Also, an interoperability analytics testing of a flood citizen observatory highlighted even variable data such as those provided by the crowd can be integrated with sensor data stream. Our approach, thus, offers a mean to improve near-real-time applications.

VL  - 11

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In the last few years, a large number of smart meters have been deployed in buildings to continuously monitor fine-grained energy consumption. Meteorological data deeply impact energy consumption, and an in-depth analysis of collected and correlated data can uncover interesting and actionable insights to improve the overall energy balance of our communities and to enhance people&rsquo;s awareness of energy wasting. To effectively extract meaningful and interpretable insights from large collections of energy measurements and multi-dimensional meteorological data, innovative data science methodologies should be devised. Research frontiers are addressing self-learning approaches, which allow non-experts to exploit machine learning techniques more easily, and algorithmic transparency of models, hence providing actionable, explicit, declarative knowledge representation. This paper presents METeorological Data Analysis for Thermal Energy CHaracterization (METATECH), a data mining engine based on both exploratory and unsupervised data analytics algorithms, devised to build transparent models correlating weather conditions and energy consumption in buildings. METATECH exploits a joint approach coupling cluster analysis and generalized association rules to allow a deeper yet human-readable understanding of how meteorological data impact heating consumption. First, a partitional clustering algorithm is applied to weather conditions. Then, resulting clusters are characterized by means of generalized association rules, which provide a self-learning explainable model of the most interesting correlations between energy consumption and weather conditions at different granularity levels. The experimental evaluation performed on real datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in automatically extracting interesting knowledge from data, and provide it transparently to domain experts.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has opened productive ways to cultivate soil with the use of low-cost hardware (sensors/actuators) and communication (Internet) technologies. Remote equipment and crop monitoring, predictive analytic, weather forecasting for crops or smart logistics and warehousing are some examples of these new opportunities. Nevertheless, farmers are agriculture experts but, usually, do not have experience in IoT applications. Users who use IoT applications must participate in its design, improving the integration and use. In this work, different industrial agricultural facilities are analysed with farmers and growers to design new functionalities based on IoT paradigms deployment. User-centred design model is used to obtain knowledge and experience in the process of introducing technology in agricultural applications. Internet of things paradigms are used as resources to facilitate the decision making. IoT architecture, operating rules and smart processes are implemented using a distributed model based on edge and fog computing paradigms. A communication architecture is proposed using these technologies. The aim is to help farmers to develop smart systems both, in current and new facilities. Different decision trees to automate the installation, designed by the farmer, can be easily deployed using the method proposed in this document.

AB  - This paper serves as a survey and empirical evaluation of the state-of-the-art in activity recognition methods using accelerometers. The paper is particularly focused on long-term activity recognition in real-world settings. In these environments, data collection is not a trivial matter; thus, there are performance trade-offs between prediction accuracy, which is not the sole system objective, and keeping the maintenance overhead at minimum levels. We examine research that has focused on the selection of activities, the features that are extracted from the accelerometer data, the segmentation of the time-series data, the locations of accelerometers, the selection and configuration trade-offs, the test/retest reliability, and the generalisation performance. Furthermore, we study these questions from an experimental platform and show, somewhat surprisingly, that many disparate experimental configurations yield comparable predictive performance on testing data. Our understanding of these results is that the experimental setup directly and indirectly defines a pathway for context to be delivered to the classifier, and that, in some settings, certain configurations are more optimal than alternatives. We conclude by identifying how the main results of this work can be used in practice, specifically in experimental configurations in challenging experimental conditions.

AB  - The traditional classification methods for limb motion recognition based on sEMG have been deeply researched and shown promising results. However, information loss during feature extraction reduces the recognition accuracy. To obtain higher accuracy, the deep learning method was introduced. In this paper, we propose a parallel multiple-scale convolution architecture. Compared with the state-of-art methods, the proposed architecture fully considers the characteristics of the sEMG signal. Larger sizes of kernel filter than commonly used in other CNN-based hand recognition methods are adopted. Meanwhile, the characteristics of the sEMG signal, that is, muscle independence, is considered when designing the architecture. All the classification methods were evaluated on the NinaPro database. The results show that the proposed architecture has the highest recognition accuracy. Furthermore, the results indicate that parallel multiple-scale convolution architecture with larger size of kernel filter and considering muscle independence can significantly increase the classification accuracy.

AB  - The development of self-driving vehicles is proceeding rapidly and with significant investment of resources. However, a full-scale deployment is not imminent. Among the challenges self-driving vehicles are facing, they will have to navigate complex ethical challenges. The algorithms governing their behavior will have to decide how to steer them in situations where accidents cannot be avoided. In some of these situations they will have to decide which of several potential parties to injure in the process. We investigate the preferences of Swiss customers for this decision by forcing a selection between simplified scenarios where a given number of car passengers or a given number of pedestrians will be killed in the accident. Both passengers and pedestrians can be adults or children. The passengers are explicitly identified as the respondent themselves and their family. While children are implicitly valued higher than adults, Swiss customers value passengers and pedestrians implicitly roughly equally, and assign increasingly higher marginal values to additional people, both passengers and pedestrians. These results seem to partially contradict similar studies conducted in other countries and recent statements by automotive companies, potentially indicating the need to adapt both corporate communications and steering algorithms in different geographies.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Predictive industrial maintenance promotes proactive scheduling of maintenance to minimize unexpected device anomalies/faults. Almost all current predictive industrial maintenance techniques construct a model based on prior knowledge or data at build-time. However, anomalies/faults will propagate among sensors and devices along correlations hidden among sensors. These correlations can facilitate maintenance. This paper makes an attempt on predicting the anomaly/fault propagation to perform predictive industrial maintenance by considering the correlations among faults. The main challenge is that an anomaly/fault may propagate in multiple ways owing to various correlations. This is called as the uncertainty of anomaly/fault propagation. This present paper proposes a correlation-based event routing approach for predictive industrial maintenance by improving our previous works. Our previous works mapped physical sensors into a soft-ware-defined abstraction, called proactive data service. In the service model, anomalies/faults are encapsulated into events. We also proposed a service hyperlink model to encapsulate the correlations among anomalies/faults. This paper maps the anomalies/faults propagation into event routing and proposes a heuristic algorithm based on service hyperlinks to route events among services. The experiment results show that, our approach can reach 100% precision and 88.89% recall at most.

AB  - Demand-driven HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) operation is essential in occupant-oriented smart buildings, where the levels of heating, cooling, and ventilation are intelligently regulated to avoid energy waste. Despite the great potential of building energy efficiency, one of the remaining technical challenges is how to accurately estimate building occupancy information in real time. In this paper, this design challenge is addressed. An advanced audio-processing technique is adopted that minimizes the impacts of environmental sounds on the recorded voice sounds of humans. Adopted mathematical modeling and signal processing procedures are elaborated in this work. Experimental studies show that our proposed audio processing with background sound cancellation algorithm improves the estimation accuracy of room occupancy quantity by approximately 11&ndash;12%, which results in an averaged ventilation energy reduction of 3.54% compared to the case of not applying background sound cancellation. The proposed audio-processing technique is promising to achieve non-intrusive, cost-effective, robust, and accurate solutions for building occupancy estimation.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - We present the main messages of a European Expert Round Table (ERT) on the unintended side effects (unseens) of the digital transition. Seventeen experts provided 42 propositions from ten different perspectives as input for the ERT. A full-day ERT deliberated communalities and relationships among these unseens and provided suggestions on (i) what the major unseens are; (ii) how rebound effects of digital transitioning may become the subject of overarching research; and (iii) what unseens should become subjects of transdisciplinary theory and practice processes for developing socially robust orientations. With respect to the latter, the experts suggested that the &ldquo;ownership, economic value, use and access of data&rdquo; and, related to this, algorithmic decision-making call for transdisciplinary processes that may provide guidelines for key stakeholder groups on how the responsible use of digital data can be developed. A cluster-based content analysis of the propositions, the discussion and inputs of the ERT, and a theoretical analysis of major changes to levels of human systems and the human&ndash;environment relationship resulted in the following greater picture: The digital transition calls for redefining economy, labor, democracy, and humanity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based machines may take over major domains of human labor, reorganize supply chains, induce platform economics, and reshape the participation of economic actors in the value chain. (Digital) Knowledge and data supplement capital, labor, and natural resources as major economic variables. Digital data and technologies lead to a post-fuel industry (post-) capitalism. Traditional democratic processes can be (intentionally or unintentionally) altered by digital technologies. The unseens in this field call for special attention, research and management. Related to the conditions of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development (humanity), the ubiquitous, global, increasingly AI-shaped interlinkage of almost every human personal, social, and economic activity and the exposure to indirect, digital, artificial, fragmented, electronically mediated data affect behavioral, cognitive, psycho-neuro-endocrinological processes on the level of the individual and thus social relations (of groups and families) and culture, and thereby, the essential quality and character of the human being (i.e., humanity). The findings suggest a need for a new field of research, i.e., focusing on sustainable digital societies and environments, in which the identification, analysis, and management of vulnerabilities and unseens emerging in the sociotechnical digital transition play an important role.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) is essential for understanding people&rsquo;s habits and behaviors, providing an important data source for precise marketing and research in psychology and sociology. Different approaches have been proposed and applied to HAR. Data segmentation using a sliding window is a basic step during the HAR procedure, wherein the window length directly affects recognition performance. However, the window length is generally randomly selected without systematic study. In this study, we examined the impact of window length on smartphone sensor-based human motion and pose pattern recognition. With data collected from smartphone sensors, we tested a range of window lengths on five popular machine-learning methods: decision tree, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, Gaussian na&iuml;ve Bayesian, and adaptive boosting. From the results, we provide recommendations for choosing the appropriate window length. Results corroborate that the influence of window length on the recognition of motion modes is significant but largely limited to pose pattern recognition. For motion mode recognition, a window length between 2.5&ndash;3.5 s can provide an optimal tradeoff between recognition performance and speed. Adaptive boosting outperformed the other methods. For pose pattern recognition, 0.5 s was enough to obtain a satisfactory result. In addition, all of the tested methods performed well.

Associated also with Data Science is how direct and indirect outcomes and consequences of Data Science include decision support and policy making, and both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes. For such reasons, the importance is noted of how Data Science builds collaboratively on other domains, potentially with innovative methodologies and practice.

AB  - Anomalies on road pavement cause discomfort to drivers and passengers, and may cause mechanical failure or even accidents. Governments spend millions of Euros every year on road maintenance, often causing traffic jams and congestion on urban roads on a daily basis. This paper analyses the difference between the deployment of a road anomalies detection and identification system in a &ldquo;conditioned&rdquo; and a real world setup, where the system performed worse compared to the &ldquo;conditioned&rdquo; setup. It also presents a system performance analysis based on the analysis of the training data sets; on the analysis of the attributes complexity, through the application of PCA techniques; and on the analysis of the attributes in the context of each anomaly type, using acceleration standard deviation attributes to observe how different anomalies classes are distributed in the Cartesian coordinates system. Overall, in this paper, we describe the main insights on road anomalies detection challenges to support the design and deployment of a new iteration of our system towards the deployment of a road anomaly detection service to provide information about roads condition to drivers and government entities.

However, there is no commonly agreed-upon definition of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Therefore, we attempted to answer the following four research questions. &ldquo;What is the definition of the Fourth Industrial Revolution?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How can we respond to the Fourth Industrial Revolution in terms of institutions?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How can we respond to the Fourth Industrial Revolution in terms of technology?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How can we respond to the Fourth Industrial Revolution in terms of firm innovation and start-up strategy?&rdquo; Brainstorming was conducted by 11 scholars from several countries to answer these four research questions. Therefore, this research is not the end product of four research questions, but a kind of advanced template to answer the four research questions for continuing research.

AB  - This article presents a Virtual Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (VTEDS)-based framework for the development of intelligent sensor nodes with plug-and-play capabilities in order to contribute to the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) toward the Web of Things (WoT). It makes use of new lightweight protocols that allow sensors to self-describe, auto-calibrate, and auto-register. Such protocols enable the development of novel IoT solutions while guaranteeing low latency, low power consumption, and the required Quality of Service (QoS). Thanks to the developed human-centered tools, it is possible to configure and modify dynamically IoT device firmware, managing the active transducers and their communication protocols in an easy and intuitive way, without requiring any prior programming knowledge. In order to evaluate the performance of the system, it was tested when using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ethernet-based smart sensors in different scenarios. Specifically, user experience was quantified empirically (i.e., how fast the system shows collected data to a user was measured). The obtained results show that the proposed VTED architecture is very fast, with some smart sensors (located in Europe) able to self-register and self-configure in a remote cloud (in South America) in less than 3 s and to display data to remote users in less than 2 s.

AB  - Automatic data annotation eliminates most of the challenges we faced due to the manual methods of annotating sensor data. It significantly improves users&rsquo; experience during sensing activities since their active involvement in the labeling process is reduced. An unsupervised learning technique such as clustering can be used to automatically annotate sensor data. However, the lingering issue with clustering is the validation of generated clusters. In this paper, we adopted the k-means clustering algorithm for annotating unlabeled sensor data for the purpose of detecting sensitive location information of mobile crowd sensing users. Furthermore, we proposed a cluster validation index for the k-means algorithm, which is based on Multiple Pair-Frequency. Thereafter, we trained three classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Na&iuml;ve Bayes) using cluster labels generated from the k-means clustering algorithm. The accuracy, precision, and recall of these classifiers were evaluated during the classification of &ldquo;non-sensitive&rdquo; and &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; data from motion and location sensors. Very high accuracy scores were recorded from Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers while a fairly high accuracy score was recorded from the Na&iuml;ve Bayes classifier. With the hybridized machine learning (unsupervised and supervised) technique presented in this paper, unlabeled sensor data was automatically annotated and then classified.

TI  - Internet-Of-Things in Motion: A UAV Coalition Model for Remote Sensing in Smart Cities

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are increasingly used in cities to provide service tasks that are too dangerous, expensive or difficult for human beings. Drones are also used in cases where a task can be performed more economically and or more efficiently than if done by humans. These include remote sensing tasks where drones can be required to form coalitions by pooling their resources to meet the service requirements at different locations of interest in a city. During such coalition formation, finding the shortest path from a source to a location of interest is key to efficient service delivery. For fixed-wing UAVs, Dubins curves can be applied to find the shortest flight path. When a UAV flies to a location of interest, the angle or orientation of the UAV upon its arrival is often not important. In such a case, a simplified version of the Dubins curve consisting of two instead of three parts can be used. This paper proposes a novel model for UAV coalition and an algorithm derived from basic geometry that generates a path derived from the original Dubins curve for application in remote sensing missions of fixed-wing UAVs. The algorithm is tested by incorporating it into three cooperative coalition formation algorithms. The performance of the model is evaluated by varying the number of types of resources and the sensor ranges of the UAVs to reveal the relevance and practicality of the proposed model.

AB  - Integration of high volume (high penetration) of photovoltaic (PV) generation with power grids consequently leads to some technical challenges that are mainly due to the intermittent nature of solar energy, the volume of data involved in the smart grid architecture, and the impact power electronic-based smart inverters. These challenges include reverse power flow, voltage fluctuations, power quality issues, dynamic stability, big data challenges and others. This paper investigates the existing challenges with the current level of PV penetration and looks into the challenges with high PV penetration in future scenarios such as smart cities, transactive energy, proliferation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), possible eclipse events, big data issues and environmental impacts. Within the context of these future scenarios, this paper reviewed the existing solutions and provides insights to new and future solutions that could be explored to ultimately address these issues and improve the smart grid&rsquo;s security, reliability and resiliency.

AB  - Urban computing at present often relies on a large number of manually extracted features. This may require a considerable amount of feature engineering, and the procedure may miss certain hidden features and relationships among data items. In this paper, we propose a method to use structured prior knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs to improve the precision and interpretability in applications such as optimal store placement and traffic accident inference. Specifically, we integrate sub-graph feature extraction, sub-knowledge graph gated neural networks, and kernel-based knowledge graph convolutional neural networks as ways of incorporating large urban knowledge graphs into a fully end-to-end learning system. Experiments using data from several large cities showed that our method outperforms the baseline methods.

AB  - Modern geoinformation technologies for collecting and processing data, such as laser scanning or photogrammetry, can generate point clouds with billions of points. They provide abundant information that can be used for different types of analysis. Due to its characteristics, the point cloud is often viewed as a special type of geospatial data. In order to efficiently manage such volumes of data, techniques based on a computer cluster have to be used. The Apache Spark framework has proven to be a solution for efficient processing of large volumes of data. This paper thoroughly examines the representation of point cloud data type using Apache Spark constructs. The common operations over point clouds, range queries and k-nearest neighbors queries (kNN) are implemented using Apache Spark DataFrame Application Programming Interface (API). It enabled the design of point cloud related user defined types (UDT) and user defined functions (UDF). The structure of the point cloud for efficient storing in Big Data key-value stores was analyzed and described. The methods presented in this paper were compared to PostgreSQL RDBMS, and the results were discussed.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In modern society, air pollution is an important topic as this pollution exerts a critically bad influence on human health and the environment. Among air pollutants, Particulate Matter (PM2.5) consists of suspended particles with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 &mu;m. Sources of PM2.5 can be coal-fired power generation, smoke, or dusts. These suspended particles in the air can damage the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of the human body, which may further lead to other diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, or cardiovascular diseases. To monitor and estimate the PM2.5 concentration, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are combined and applied to the PM2.5 forecasting system. To compare the overall performance of each algorithm, four measurement indexes, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) Pearson correlation coefficient and Index of Agreement (IA) are applied to the experiments in this paper. Compared with other machine learning methods, the experimental results showed that the forecasting accuracy of the proposed CNN-LSTM model (APNet) is verified to be the highest in this paper. For the CNN-LSTM model, its feasibility and practicability to forecast the PM2.5 concentration are also verified in this paper. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a deep neural network model that integrates the CNN and LSTM architectures, and through historical data such as cumulated hours of rain, cumulated wind speed and PM2.5 concentration. In the future, this study can also be applied to the prevention and control of PM2.5.

AB  - Smart homes play a strategic role for improving life quality of people, enabling to monitor people at home with numerous intelligent devices. Sensors can be installed to provide a continuous assistance without limiting the resident&rsquo;s daily routine, giving her/him greater comfort, well-being and safety. This paper is based on the development of domestic technological solutions to improve the life quality of citizens and monitor the users and the domestic environment, based on features extracted from the collected data. The proposed smart sensing architecture is based on an integrated sensor network to monitor the user and the environment to derive information about the user&rsquo;s behavior and her/his health status. The proposed platform includes biomedical, wearable, and unobtrusive sensors for monitoring user&rsquo;s physiological parameters and home automation sensors to obtain information about her/his environment. The sensor network stores the heterogeneous data both locally and remotely in Cloud, where machine learning algorithms and data mining strategies are used for user behavior identification, classification of user health conditions, classification of the smart home profile, and data analytics to implement services for the community. The proposed solution has been experimentally tested in a pilot study based on the development of both sensors and services for elderly users at home.

AB  - Railway industry plays a critical role in transportation and transit systems attributed to the ever-growing demand for catering to both freight and passengers. However, owing to many challenges faced by railway stations such as harsh environments, traffic flow, safety and security risks, new and adaptive systems employing new technology are recommended. In this review, several wireless sensor networks (WSNs) applications are proposed for use in railway station systems, including advanced WSNs, which will enhance security, safety, and decision-making processes to achieve more cost-effective management in railway stations, as well as the development of integrated systems. The size, efficiency, and cost of WSNs are influential factors that attract the railway industry to adopt these devices. This paper presents a review of WSNs that have been designed for uses in monitoring and securing railway stations. This article will first briefly focus on the presence of different WSN applications in diverse applications. In addition, it is important to note that exploitation of the state-of-the-art tools and techniques such as WSNs to gain an enormous amount of data from a railway station is a new and novel concept requiring the development of artificial intelligence methods, such machine learning, which will be vital for the future of the railway industry.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Delivering effortless interactions and appropriate interventions through pervasive systems requires making sense of multiple streams of sensor data. This is particularly challenging when these concern people&rsquo;s natural behaviours in the real world. This paper takes a multidisciplinary perspective of annotation and draws on an exploratory study of 12 people, who were encouraged to use a multi-modal annotation app while living in a prototype smart home. Analysis of the app usage data and of semi-structured interviews with the participants revealed strengths and limitations regarding self-annotation in a naturalistic context. Handing control of the annotation process to research participants enabled them to reason about their own data, while generating accounts that were appropriate and acceptable to them. Self-annotation provided participants an opportunity to reflect on themselves and their routines, but it was also a means to express themselves freely and sometimes even a backchannel to communicate playfully with the researchers. However, self-annotation may not be an effective way to capture accurate start and finish times for activities, or location associated with activity information. This paper offers new insights and recommendations for the design of self-annotation tools for deployment in the real world.

AB  - Ubiquity, heterogeneity and dense deployment of sensors have yielded the Internet of Things (IoT) concept, which is an integral component of various smart spaces including smart cities. Applications and services in a smart city ecosystem aim at minimizing the cost and maximizing the quality of living. Among these services, waste management is a unique service that covers both aspects. To this end, in this paper, we propose a WSN-driven system for smart waste management in urban areas. In our proposed framework, the waste bins are equipped with sensors that continuously monitor the waste level and trigger alarms that are wirelessly communicated to a cloud platform to actuate the municipal agents, i.e., waste collection trucks. We formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to find the best set of trajectory-truck with the objectives of minimum cost or minimum delay. In order for the trajectory assistance to work in real time, we propose three heuristics, one of which is a greedy one. Through simulations, we show that the ILP formulation can provide a baseline reference to the heuristics, whereas the non-greedy heuristics can significantly outperform the greedy approach regarding cost and delay under moderate waste accumulation scenarios.

TI  - Multi-Agent Systems Applications in Energy Optimization Problems: A State-of-the-Art Review
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2018
VL  - 11
IS  - 8
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This article reviews the state-of-the-art developments in Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) and their application to energy optimization problems. This methodology and related tools have contributed to changes in various paradigms used in energy optimization. Behavior and interactions between agents are key elements that must be understood in order to model energy optimization solutions that are robust, scalable and context-aware. The concept of MAS is introduced in this paper and it is compared with traditional approaches in the development of energy optimization solutions. The different types of agent-based architectures are described, the role played by the environment is analysed and we look at how MAS recognizes the characteristics of the environment to adapt to it. Moreover, it is discussed how MAS can be used as tools that simulate the results of different actions aimed at reducing energy consumption. Then, we look at MAS as a tool that makes it easy to model and simulate certain behaviors. This modeling and simulation is easily extrapolated to the energy field, and can even evolve further within this field by using the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Therefore, we can argue that MAS is a widespread approach in the field of energy optimization and that it is commonly used due to its capacity for the communication, coordination, cooperation of agents and the robustness that this methodology gives in assigning different tasks to agents. Finally, this article considers how MASs can be used for various purposes, from capturing sensor data to decision-making. We propose some research perspectives on the development of electrical optimization solutions through their development using MASs. In conclusion, we argue that researchers in the field of energy optimization should use multi-agent systems at those junctures where it is necessary to model energy efficiency solutions that involve a wide range of factors, as well as context independence that they can achieve through the addition of new agents or agent organizations, enabling the development of energy-efficient solutions for smart cities and intelligent buildings.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 8
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, cloud computing and fog computing have appeared one after the other, as promising technologies for augmenting the computing capability of devices locally. By offloading computational tasks to fog servers or cloud servers, the time for task processing decreases greatly. Thus, to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) of smart manufacturing systems, fog servers are deployed at network edge to provide fog computing services. In this paper, we study the following problems in a mixed computing system: (1) which computing mode should be chosen for a task in local computing, fog computing or cloud computing? (2) In the fog computing mode, what is the execution sequence for the tasks cached in a task queue? Thus, to solve the problems above, we design a Software-Defined Network (SDN) framework in a smart factory based on an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) system. A method based on Computing Mode Selection (CMS) and execution sequences based on the task priority (ASTP) is proposed in this paper. First, a CMS module is designed in the SDN controller and then, after operating the CMS algorithm, each task obtains an optimal computing mode. Second, the task priorities can be calculated according to their real-time performance and calculated amount. According to the task priority, the SDN controller sends a flow table to the SDN switch to complete the task transmission. In other words, the higher the task priority is, the earlier the fog computing service is obtained. Finally, a series of experiments and simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our method can achieve real-time performance and high reliability in IIoT.

AB  - The development of information technology has added many conveniences to our lives. On the other hand, however, we have to deal with various kinds of information, which can be a difficult task for elderly people or those who are not familiar with information devices. A technology to recognize each person&rsquo;s activity and providing appropriate support based on that activity could be useful for such people. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained activity recognition method for user support systems that focuses on identifying the text at which a user is gazing, based on the idea that the content of the text is related to the activity of the user. It is necessary to keep in mind that the meaning of the text depends on its location. To tackle this problem, we propose the simultaneous use of a wearable device and fixed camera. To obtain the global location of the text, we perform image matching using the local features of the images obtained by these two devices. Then, we generate a feature vector based on this information and the content of the text. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we performed activity recognition experiments with six subjects in a laboratory environment.

AB  - In the era of Big Data and IoT, successful systems have to be designed to discover, store, process, learn, analyse, and predict from a massive amount of data&mdash;in short, they have to behave intelligently. Despite the success of non-symbolic techniques such as deep learning, symbolic approaches to machine intelligence still have a role to play in order to achieve key properties such as observability, explainability, and accountability. In this paper we focus on logic programming (LP), and advocate its role as a provider of symbolic reasoning capabilities in IoT scenarios, suitably complementing non-symbolic ones. In particular, we show how its re-interpretation in terms of LPaaS (Logic Programming as a Service) can work as an enabling technology for distributed situated intelligence. A possible example of hybrid reasoning&mdash;where symbolic and non-symbolic techniques fruitfully combine to produce intelligent behaviour&mdash;is presented, demonstrating how LPaaS could work in a smart energy grid scenario.

AB  - Most of the currently mature methods that are used globally for population spatialization are researched on a single level, and are dependent on the spatial relationship between population and land covers (city, road, water area, etc.), resulting in difficulties in data acquisition and an inability to identify precise features on the different levels. This paper proposes a multi-level population spatialization method on the different administrative levels with the support of China&rsquo;s first national geoinformation survey, and then considers several approaches to verify the results of the multi-level method. This paper aims to establish a multi-level population spatialization method that is suitable for the administrative division of districts and streets. It is assumed that the same residential house has the same population density on the district level. Based on this assumption, the least squares regression model is used to obtain the optimized prediction model and accurate population space prediction results by dynamically segmenting and aggregating house categories.In addition, it is assumed that the distribution of the population is relatively regular in communities that are spatially close to each other, and that the population densities on the street level are similar, so the average population density is assessed by optimizing the community and surrounding residential houses on the street level. Finally, the scientificalness and rationality of the proposed method is proved by spatial autocorrelation analysis, overlay analysis, cross-validation analysis and accuracy assessment methods.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of smart devices to collect data and make intelligent decisions. However, a lack of intrinsic security measures makes IoT vulnerable to privacy and security threats. With its &ldquo;security by design,&rdquo; Blockchain (BC) can help in addressing major security requirements in IoT. BC capabilities like immutability, transparency, auditability, data encryption and operational resilience can help solve most architectural shortcomings of IoT. This article presents a comprehensive survey on BC and IoT integration. The objective of this paper is to analyze the current research trends on the usage of BC-related approaches and technologies in an IoT context. This paper presents the following novelties, with respect to related work: (i) it covers different application domains, organizing the available literature according to this categorization, (ii) it introduces two usage patterns, i.e., device manipulation and data management (open marketplace solution), and (iii) it reports on the development level of some of the presented solutions. We also analyze the main challenges faced by the research community in the smooth integration of BC and IoT, and point out the main open issues and future research directions. Last but not least, we also present a survey about novel uses of BC in the machine economy.

AB  - The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has increased the ubiquity of the Internet by integrating all objects for interaction via embedded systems, leading to a highly distributed network of devices communicating with human beings as well as other devices. In recent years, cloud computing has attracted a lot of attention from specialists and experts around the world. With the increasing number of distributed sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks, new models for interacting with wireless sensors using the cloud are intended to overcome restricted resources and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel sensor-cloud based platform which is able to virtualize physical sensors as virtual sensors in the CoT (Cloud of Things) environment. Virtual sensors, which are the essentials of this sensor-cloud architecture, simplify the process of generating a multiuser environment over resource-constrained physical wireless sensors and can help in implementing applications across different domains. Virtual sensors are dynamically provided in a group which advantages capability of the management the designed platform. An auto-detection approach on the basis of virtual sensors is additionally proposed to identify the accessible physical sensors nodes even if the status of these sensors are offline. In order to assess the usability of the designed platform, a smart-space-based IoT case study was implemented, and a series of experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed system performance. Furthermore, a comparison analysis was made and the results indicate that the proposed platform outperforms the existing platforms in numerous respects.

AB  - As the number of facilities adopting a Building Management System under the Industry 4.0 paradigm increases, it is critical to ensure the good health of their operations. Business continuity and uninterrupted operations are key requirements for any building, for which Power Quality and Supply Reliability sophisticated monitoring can play an extremely important role. Submetering, as opposed to bulk-metering, implies measuring power consumption for individual units or appliances in a building complex. An Internet of Things mesh network, which brings ubiquitous power quality submetering inside the entire facility, would be extremely beneficial for the management of the building thus ensuring seamless business operations. This work describes a novel low-cost Internet of Things sensor for measuring and analyzing power quality at the input of any individual Alternating Current (AC) appliance, providing an early detection and analysis system which controls those critical variables inside the facility and leads to anticipate faults with early-stage alerts based on on-time data streams treatment. Moreover, the recorded power quality parameters that are processed in the Cloud system can help to reduce energy consumption, as power quality disturbances can be automatically analyzed and even compared to standard values. The proposed Internet of Things sensor will help users to detect most power quality steady-state and events disturbances, while monitoring the energy consumption. This Internet of Things Power Quality sensor is built around a flexible microcontroller, which manages an energy metering Integrated Circuit (IC) through Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), increasing its original capabilities by including new sophisticated software functionality. Additionally, it wirelessly communicates with a cloud-based Internet of Things Platform to allow the storage and supervision of the different power quality events for the entire facility. An example of the access to the data is also included.

AB  - Noise pollution is an emerging and challenging problem of all large metropolitan areas, affecting the health of citizens in multiple ways. Therefore, obtaining a detailed and real-time map of noise in cities becomes of the utmost importance for authorities to take preventive measures. Until now, these measurements were limited to occasional sampling made by specialized companies, that mainly focus on major roads. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to this problem based on crowdsensing. Our proposed architecture empowers participating citizens by allowing them to seamlessly, and based on their context, sample the noise in their surrounding environment. This allows us to provide a global and detailed view of noise levels around the city, including places traditionally not monitored due to poor accessibility, even while using their vehicles. In the paper, we detail how the different relevant issues in our architecture, i.e., smartphone calibration, measurement adequacy, server design, and client&ndash;server interaction, were solved, and we have validated them in real scenarios to illustrate the potential of the solution achieved.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - In this paper, we investigate an animal-human cohabitation problem with the help of machine learning and fiber-wireless (FiWi) access networks integrating cloud and edge (fog) computing. We propose an early warning system which detects wild animals near the road/rail with the help of wireless sensor networks and alerts passing vehicles of possible animal crossing. Additionally, we show that animals&rsquo; detection at the earliest and the related processing, if possible, at sensors would reduce the energy consumption of edge devices and the end-to-end delay in notifying vehicles, as compared to the scenarios where raw sensed data needs to be transferred up the base stations or the cloud. At the same time, machine learning helps in classification of captured images at edge devices, and in predicting different time-varying traffic profiles&mdash; distinguished by latency and bandwidth requirements&mdash;at base stations, including animal appearance events at sensors, and allocating bandwidth in FiWi access networks accordingly. We compare three scenarios of processing data at sensor nodes, base stations and a hybrid case of processing sensed data at either sensors or at base stations, and showed that dynamic allocation of bandwidth in FiWi access networks and processing data at its origin lead to lowering the congestion of network traffic at base stations and reducing the average end-to-end delay.

AB  - With the emergence of technologies such as electronic health and mobile health (eHealth/mHealth), cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT), health related data are increasing and many applications such as smartphone apps and wearable devices that provide wellness and fitness tracking are entering the market. Some apps provide health related data such as sleep monitoring, heart rate measuring, and calorie expenditure collected and processed by the devices and servers in the cloud. These requirements can be extended to provide a personalized life expectancy (PLE) for the purpose of wellbeing and encouraging lifestyle improvement. No existing works provide this PLE information that is developed and customized for the individual. This article is based on the concurrent models and methodologies to calculate and predict life expectancy (LE) and proposes an idea of using multi-phased approaches to the solution as the project requires an immense and broad range of work to accomplish. As a result, the current prediction of LE, which was found to be up to a maximum of five years could potentially be extended to a lifetime prediction by utilizing generic health data. In this article, the novel idea of the solution proposing a PLE on an individual basis, which can be extended to lifetime is presented in addition to the existing works.

TI  - Design, Implementation and Practical Evaluation of an IoT Home Automation System for Fog Computing Applications Based on MQTT and ZigBee-WiFi Sensor Nodes
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 8
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, the improvement of wireless protocols, the development of cloud services and the lower cost of hardware have started a new era for smart homes. One such enabling technologies is fog computing, which extends cloud computing to the edge of a network allowing for developing novel Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services. Under the IoT fog computing paradigm, IoT gateways are usually utilized to exchange messages with IoT nodes and a cloud. WiFi and ZigBee stand out as preferred communication technologies for smart homes. WiFi has become very popular, but it has a limited application due to its high energy consumption and the lack of standard mesh networking capabilities for low-power devices. For such reasons, ZigBee was selected by many manufacturers for developing wireless home automation devices. As a consequence, these technologies may coexist in the 2.4 GHz band, which leads to collisions, lower speed rates and increased communications latencies. This article presents ZiWi, a distributed fog computing Home Automation System (HAS) that allows for carrying out seamless communications among ZigBee and WiFi devices. This approach diverges from traditional home automation systems, which often rely on expensive central controllers. In addition, to ease the platform&rsquo;s building process, whenever possible, the system makes use of open-source software (all the code of the nodes is available on GitHub) and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware. The initial results, which were obtained in a number of representative home scenarios, show that the developed fog services respond several times faster than the evaluated cloud services, and that cross-interference has to be taken seriously to prevent collisions. In addition, the current consumption of ZiWi&rsquo;s nodes was measured, showing the impact of encryption mechanisms.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Key agreement between two constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices that have not met each other is an essential feature to provide in order to establish trust among its users. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) on a device represent a low cost primitive exploiting the unique random patterns in the device and have been already applied in a multitude of applications for secure key generation and key agreement in order to avoid an attacker to take over the identity of a tampered device, whose key material has been extracted. This paper shows that the key agreement scheme of a recently proposed PUF based protocol, presented by Chatterjee et al., for Internet of Things (IoT) is vulnerable for man-in-the-middle, impersonation, and replay attacks in the Yao&ndash;Dolev security model. We propose an alternative scheme, which is able to solve these issues and can provide in addition a more efficient key agreement and subsequently a communication phase between two IoT devices connected to the same authentication server. The scheme also offers identity based authentication and repudiation, when only using elliptic curve multiplications and additions, instead of the compute intensive pairing operations.

As the debate on delivering better education for all gains momentum, the big question is how to integrate advances in social networks research, corresponding advances in information and communication technology (ICT) and effectively employ them in the domain of education. To address this question, this paper proposes a conceptual framework (maturity model) that integrates social network research, the debate on technology-enhanced learning (TEL) and the emerging concept of smart education.

AB  - The use of the Internet is growing in this day and age, so another area has developed to use the Internet, called Internet of Things (IoT). It facilitates the machines and objects to communicate, compute and coordinate with each other. It is an enabler for the intelligence affixed to several essential features of the modern world, such as homes, hospitals, buildings, transports and cities. The security and privacy are some of the critical issues related to the wide application of IoT. Therefore, these issues prevent the wide adoption of the IoT. In this paper, we are presenting an overview about different layered architectures of IoT and attacks regarding security from the perspective of layers. In addition, a review of mechanisms that provide solutions to these issues is presented with their limitations. Furthermore, we have suggested a new secure layered architecture of IoT to overcome these issues.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Energy consumption in the residential sector is 25% of all the sectors. The advent of smart appliances and intelligent sensors have increased the realization of home energy management systems. Acquiring balance between energy consumption and user comfort is in the spotlight when the performance of the smart home is evaluated. Appliances of heating, ventilation and air conditioning constitute up to 64% of energy consumption in residential buildings. A number of research works have shown that fuzzy logic system integrated with other techniques is used with the main objective of energy consumption minimization. However, user comfort is often sacrificed in these techniques. In this paper, we have proposed a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that uses humidity as an additional input parameter in order to maintain the thermostat set-points according to user comfort. Additionally, we have used indoor room temperature variation as a feedback to proposed FIS in order to get the better energy consumption. As the number of rules increase, the task of defining them in FIS becomes time consuming and eventually increases the chance of manual errors. We have also proposed the automatic rule base generation using the combinatorial method. The proposed techniques are evaluated using Mamdani FIS and Sugeno FIS. The proposed method provides a flexible and energy efficient decision-making system that maintains the user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. The proposed FIS system requires less memory and low processing power along with the use of sensors, making it possible to be used in the IoT operating system e.g., RIOT. Simulation results validate that the proposed technique reduces energy consumption by 28%.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Human behavior is one of the most challenging aspects in the understanding of building physics. The need to evaluate it requires controlled environments and facilities in which researchers can test their methods. In this paper, we present the commissioning of the Controlled and Automatized Testing Facility for Human Behavior (CASITA). This is a controlled space emulation of an office or flat, with more than 20 environmental sensors, 5 electrical meters, and 10 actuators. Our contribution shown in this paper is the development of an infrastructure-Artificial Intelligence (AI) model pair that is perfectly integrated for the study of a variety of human energy use aspects. This facility will help to perform studies about human behavior in a controlled space. To verify this, we have tested this emulation for 60 days, in which equipment was turned on and off, the settings of the conditioning system were modified remotely, and lighting operation was similar to that in real behaviors. This period of commissioning generated 74.4 GB of raw data including high-frequency measurements. This work has shown that CASITA performs beyond expectations and that sensors and actuators could enable research on a variety of disciplines related to building physics and human behavior. Also, we have tested the PROPHET software, which was previously used in other disciplines and found that it could be an excellent complement to CASITA for experiments that require the prediction of several pertinent variables in a given study. Our contribution has also been to proof that this package is an ideal “soft” addition to the infrastructure. A case study forecasting energy consumption has been performed, concluding that the facility and the software PROPHET have a great potential for research and an outstanding accuracy.

AB  - The emerging fog computing technology is characterized by an ultralow latency response, which benefits a massive number of time-sensitive services and applications in the Internet of things (IoT) era. To this end, the fog computing infrastructure must minimize latencies for both service delivery and execution phases. While the transmission latency significantly depends on external factors (e.g., channel bandwidth, communication resources, and interferences), the computation latency can be considered as an internal issue that the fog computing infrastructure could actively self-handle. From this view point, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that utilizes the evolution strategies for real-time task assignment among fog servers to minimize the total computation latency during a long-term period. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the latency by approximately 16.1% compared to the existing methods. Additionally, the proposed learning algorithm has low computational complexity and an effectively parallel operation; therefore, it is especially appropriate to be implemented in modern heterogeneous computing platforms.

AB  - This paper introduces the concept of Comfort as a Service (CaaS), a new energy supply paradigm for providing comfort to residential customers. CaaS takes into account the available passive and active elements, the external factors that affect energy consumption and associated costs, and occupants&rsquo; behaviors to generate optimal control strategies for the domestic equipment automatically. As a consequence, it releases building occupants from operating the equipment, which gives rise to a disruption of the traditional model of paying per consumed energy in favor of a model of paying per provided comfort. In the paper, we envision a realization of CaaS based on several technologies such as ambient intelligence, big data, cloud computing and predictive computing. We discuss the opportunities and the barriers of CaaS-centered business and exemplify the potential of CaaS deployments by quantifying the expected energy savings achieved after limiting occupants&rsquo; control over the air conditioning system in a test scenario.

AB  - This paper presents features and advanced settings for a robot manipulator controller in a fully interconnected intelligent manufacturing system. Every system is made up of different agents. As also occurs in the Internet of Things and smart cities, the big issue here is to ensure not only that implementation is key, but also that there is better common understanding among the main players. The commitment of all agents is still required to translate that understanding into practice in Industry 4.0. Mutual interactions such as machine-to-machine and man-to-machine are solved in real time with cyber physical capabilities. This paper explores intelligent manufacturing through the context of industrial robot manipulators within a Smart Factory. An online communication algorithm with proven intelligent manufacturing abilities is proposed to solve real-time interactions. The algorithm is developed to manage and control all robot parameters in real-time. The proposed tool in conjunction with the intelligent manufacturing core incorporates data from the robot manipulators into the industrial big data to manage the factory. The novelty is a communication tool that implements the Industry 4.0 standards to allow communications among the required entities in the complete system. It is achieved by the developed tool and implemented in a real robot and simulation

AB  - Real estate needs to improve its adoption of disruptive technologies to move from traditional to smart real estate (SRE). This study reviews the adoption of disruptive technologies in real estate. It covers the applications of nine such technologies, hereby referred to as the Big9. These are: drones, the internet of things (IoT), clouds, software as a service (SaaS), big data, 3D scanning, wearable technologies, virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The Big9 are examined in terms of their application to real estate and how they can furnish consumers with the kind of information that can avert regrets. The review is based on 213 published articles. The compiled results show the state of each technology&rsquo;s practice and usage in real estate. This review also surveys dissemination mechanisms, including smartphone technology, websites and social media-based online platforms, as well as the core components of SRE: sustainability, innovative technology and user centredness. It identifies four key real estate stakeholders&mdash;consumers, agents and associations, government and regulatory authorities, and complementary industries&mdash;and their needs, such as buying or selling property, profits, taxes, business and/or other factors. Interactions between these stakeholders are highlighted, and the specific needs that various technologies address are tabulated in the form of a what, who and how analysis to highlight the impact that the technologies have on key stakeholders. Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumers&rsquo; needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumers&rsquo; needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders. Such high-quality information can bridge the gap between real estate consumers and other stakeholders and raise the state of the industry to a level where its consumers have fewer or no regrets. The study, being the first to explore real estate technologies, is limited by the number of research publications on the SRE technologies that has been compensated through incorporation of online reports.

AB  - The adoption of advanced Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has impressively improved in recent years by placing such services at the extreme Edge of the network. There are, however, specific Quality of Service (QoS) trade-offs that must be considered, particularly in situations when workloads vary over time or when IoT devices are dynamically changing their geographic position. This article proposes an innovative capillary computing architecture, which benefits from mainstream Fog and Cloud computing approaches and relies on a set of new services, including an Edge/Fog/Cloud Monitoring System and a Capillary Container Orchestrator. All necessary Microservices are implemented as Docker containers, and their orchestration is performed from the Edge computing nodes up to Fog and Cloud servers in the geographic vicinity of moving IoT devices. A car equipped with a Motorhome Artificial Intelligence Communication Hardware (MACH) system as an Edge node connected to several Fog and Cloud computing servers was used for testing. Compared to using a fixed centralized Cloud provider, the service response time provided by our proposed capillary computing architecture was almost four times faster according to the 99th percentile value along with a significantly smaller standard deviation, which represents a high QoS.

AB  - With the increase in the amount of data captured during the manufacturing process, monitoring systems are becoming important factors in decision making for management. Current technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors can be considered a solution to provide efficient monitoring of the manufacturing process. In this study, a real-time monitoring system that utilizes IoT-based sensors, big data processing, and a hybrid prediction model is proposed. Firstly, an IoT-based sensor that collects temperature, humidity, accelerometer, and gyroscope data was developed. The characteristics of IoT-generated sensor data from the manufacturing process are: real-time, large amounts, and unstructured type. The proposed big data processing platform utilizes Apache Kafka as a message queue, Apache Storm as a real-time processing engine and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the manufacturing process. Secondly, for the proposed hybrid prediction model, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)-based outlier detection and Random Forest classification were used to remove outlier sensor data and provide fault detection during the manufacturing process, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated and tested at an automotive manufacturing assembly line in Korea. The results showed that IoT-based sensors and the proposed big data processing system are sufficiently efficient to monitor the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid prediction model has better fault prediction accuracy than other models given the sensor data as input. The proposed system is expected to support management by improving decision-making and will help prevent unexpected losses caused by faults during the manufacturing process.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Traffic prediction is a critical task for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Prediction at intersections is challenging as it involves various participants, such as vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the accurate intersection traffic prediction by introducing extra data sources other than road traffic volume data into the prediction model. In particular, we take advantage of the data collected from the reports of road accidents and roadworks happening near the intersections. In addition, we investigate two types of learning schemes, namely batch learning and online learning. Three popular ensemble decision tree models are used in the batch learning scheme, including Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting Trees (XGBoost), while the Fast Incremental Model Trees with Drift Detection (FIMT-DD) model is adopted for the online learning scheme. The proposed approach is evaluated using public data sets released by the Victorian Government of Australia. The results indicate that the accuracy of intersection traffic prediction can be improved by incorporating nearby accidents and roadworks information.

AB  - The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are the basic building blocks of today&rsquo;s modern internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure in smart buildings, smart parking, and smart cities. The WSN nodes suffer from a major design constraint in that their battery energy is limited and can only work for a few days depending upon the duty cycle of operation. The main contribution of this research article is to propose an efficient solar energy harvesting solution to the limited battery energy problem of WSN nodes by utilizing ambient solar photovoltaic energy. Ideally, the Optimized Solar Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Network (SEH-WSN) nodes should operate for an infinite network lifetime (in years). In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient solar energy harvesting system with pulse width modulation (PWM) and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for WSN nodes. The research focus is to increase the overall harvesting system efficiency, which further depends upon solar panel efficiency, PWM efficiency, and MPPT efficiency. Several models for solar energy harvester system have been designed and iterative simulations were performed in MATLAB/SIMULINK for solar powered DC-DC converters with PWM and MPPT to achieve optimum results. From the simulation results, it is shown that our designed solar energy harvesting system has 87% efficiency using PWM control and 96% efficiency     (  &eta;  s y s   )     by using the MPPT control technique. Finally, an experiment for PWM controlled SEH-WSN is performed using Scientech 2311 WSN trainer kit and a Generic LM2575 DC-DC buck converter based solar energy harvesting module for validation of simulation results.

AB  - Governments these days are demanding better Smart City technologies in order to connect with citizens and understand their demands. For such governments, much needed information exists on social media where members belonging to diverse groups share different interests, post statuses, review and comment on various topics. Aspect extraction from this data can provide a thorough understanding of citizens&rsquo; behaviors and choices. Also, categorization of these aspects can better summarize societal concerns regarding political, economic, religious and social issues. Aspect category detection (ACD) from people reviews is one of the major tasks of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). The success of ABSA is mainly defined by the inexpensive and accurate machine-processable representation of the raw input sentences. Previous approaches rely on cumbersome feature extraction procedures from sentences, which adds its own complexity and inaccuracy in performing ACD tasks. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive and simple method to obtain the most suitable representation of a sentence-vector through different algebraic combinations of a sentence&rsquo;s word vectors, which will act as an input to any machine learning classifier. We have tested our technique on the restaurant review data provided in SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2016. SemEval is a series of global challenges to evaluate the effectiveness of disambiguation of word sense. Our results showed the highest F1-scores of 76.40% in SemEval-2016 Task 5, and 94.99% in SemEval-2015 Task 12.

AB  - Urban environments are regions in which spectral variability and spatial variability are extremely high, with a huge range of shapes and sizes, and they also demand high resolution images for applications involving their study. Due to the fact that these environments can grow even more over time, applications related to their monitoring tend to turn to autonomous intelligent systems, which together with remote sensing data could help or even predict daily life situations. The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the fa&ccedil;ade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based fa&ccedil;ade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the fa&ccedil;ade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The fa&ccedil;ade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem.

AB  - This paper aims to contribute to the debate on Open Innovation in the age of Big Data by shedding new light on the role that social networks can play as enabling platforms for tourists&rsquo; involvement and sources for the creation and management of valuable knowledge assets. The huge amount of data generated on social media by tourists related to their travel experiences can be a valid source of open innovation. To achieve this aim, this paper presents evidence of a digital tourism experience, through a longitudinal case study of a destination in Apulia, a Southern European region. The findings of the study demonstrate how social Big Data could open up innovation processes that could be of support in defining sustainable tourism experiences in a destination.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - The paper examines today&rsquo;s debate on the legal status of AI robots, and how often scholars and policy makers confuse the legal agenthood of these artificial agents with the status of legal personhood. By taking into account current trends in the field, the paper suggests a twofold stance. First, policy makers shall seriously mull over the possibility of establishing novel forms of accountability and liability for the activities of AI robots in contracts and business law, e.g., new forms of legal agenthood in cases of complex distributed responsibility. Second, any hypothesis of granting AI robots full legal personhood has to be discarded in the foreseeable future. However, how should we deal with Sophia, which became the first AI application to receive citizenship of any country, namely, Saudi Arabia, in October 2017? Admittedly, granting someone, or something, legal personhood is&mdash;as always has been&mdash;a highly sensitive political issue that does not simply hinge on rational choices and empirical evidence. Discretion, arbitrariness, and even bizarre decisions play a role in this context. However, the normative reasons why legal systems grant human and artificial entities, such as corporations, their status, help us taking sides in today&rsquo;s quest for the legal personhood of AI robots. Is citizen Sophia really conscious, or capable of suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous scholars?

AB  - Against the backdrop of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) taking effect in the European Union (EU), a debate emerged about the role of citizens and their relationship with data. European city authorities claim that (smart) citizens are as important to a successful smart city program as data and technology are, and that those citizens must be convinced of the benefits and security of such initiatives. This paper examines how the city of Barcelona is marking a transition from the conventional, hegemonic smart city approach to a new paradigm&mdash;the experimental city. Through (i) a literature review, (ii) carrying out twenty in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, and (iii) actively participating in three symposiums in Barcelona from September 2017 to March 2018, this paper elucidates how (smart) citizens are increasingly considered decision-makers rather than data providers. This paper considers (i) the implications of the technopolitics of data ownership and, as a result, (ii) the ongoing implementation of the Digital Plan 2017&ndash;2020, its three experimental strategies, and the related seven strategic initiatives. This paper concludes that, from the policy perspective, smartness may not be appealing in Barcelona, although the experimental approach has yet to be entirely established as a paradigm.

AB  - The use of sensors and actuators as a form of controlling cyber-physical systems in resource networks has been integrated and referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the connectivity of many stand-alone IoT systems through the Internet introduces numerous cybersecurity challenges as sensitive information is prone to be exposed to malicious users. This paper focuses on the improvement of IoT cybersecurity from an ontological analysis, proposing appropriate security services adapted to the threats. The authors propose an ontology-based cybersecurity framework using knowledge reasoning for IoT, composed of two approaches: (1) design time, which provides a dynamic method to build security services through the application of a model-driven methodology considering the existing enterprise processes; and (2) run time, which involves monitoring the IoT environment, classifying threats and vulnerabilities, and actuating in the environment ensuring the correct adaptation of the existing services. Two validation approaches demonstrate the feasibility of our concept. This entails an ontology assessment and a case study with an industrial implementation.

TI  - MODC: A Pareto-Optimal Optimization Approach for Network Traffic Classification Based on the Divide and Conquer Strategy

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - Network traffic classification aims to identify categories of traffic or applications of network packets or flows. It is an area that continues to gain attention by researchers due to the necessity of understanding the composition of network traffics, which changes over time, to ensure the network Quality of Service (QoS). Among the different methods of network traffic classification, the payload-based one (DPI) is the most accurate, but presents some drawbacks, such as the inability of classifying encrypted data, the concerns regarding the users&rsquo; privacy, the high computational costs, and ambiguity when multiple signatures might match. For that reason, machine learning methods have been proposed to overcome these issues. This work proposes a Multi-Objective Divide and Conquer (MODC) model for network traffic classification, by combining, into a hybrid model, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, based on the divide and conquer strategy. Additionally, it is a flexible model since it allows network administrators to choose between a set of parameters (pareto-optimal solutions), led by a multi-objective optimization process, by prioritizing flow or byte accuracies. Our method achieved 94.14% of average flow accuracy for the analyzed dataset, outperforming the six DPI-based tools investigated, including two commercial ones, and other machine learning-based methods.

AB  - Parks are essential public places and play a central role in urban livability. However, traditional methods of investigating their attractiveness, such as questionnaires and in situ observations, are usually time- and resource-consuming, while providing less transferable and only site-specific results. This paper presents an improved methodology of using social media (Twitter) data to extract spatial and temporal patterns of park visits for urban planning purposes, along with the sentiment of the tweets, focusing on frequent Twitter users. We analyzed the spatiotemporal park visiting behavior of more than 4000 users for almost 1700 parks, examining 78,000 tweets in London, UK. The novelty of the research is in the combination of spatial and temporal aspects of Twitter data analysis, applying sentiment and emotion extraction for park visits throughout the whole city. This transferable methodology thereby overcomes many of the limitations of traditional research methods. This study concluded that people tweeted mostly in parks 3&ndash;4 km away from their center of activity and they were more positive than elsewhere while doing so. In our analysis, we identified four types of parks based on their visitors&rsquo; spatial behavioral characteristics, the sentiment of the tweets, and the temporal distribution of the users, serving as input for further urban planning-related investigations.

AB  - The Internet-of-Things (IoT) introduces several technical and managerial challenges when it comes to the use of data generated and exchanged by and between various Smart, Connected Products (SCPs) that are part of an IoT system (i.e., physical, intelligent devices with sensors and actuators). Added to the volume and the heterogeneous exchange and consumption of data, it is paramount to assure that data quality levels are maintained in every step of the data chain/lifecycle. Otherwise, the system may fail to meet its expected function. While Data Quality (DQ) is a mature field, existing solutions are highly heterogeneous. Therefore, we propose that companies, developers and vendors should align their data quality management mechanisms and artefacts with well-known best practices and standards, as for example, those provided by ISO 8000-61. This standard enables a process-approach to data quality management, overcoming the difficulties of isolated data quality activities. This paper introduces DAQUA-MASS, a methodology based on ISO 8000-61 for data quality management in sensor networks. The methodology consists of four steps according to the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle by Deming.

AB  - Load curve data from advanced metering infrastructure record the consumers&rsquo; behavior. User consumption models help one understand a more intelligent power provisioning and clustering the load data is one of the popular approaches for building these models. Similarity measurements are important in the clustering model, but, load curve data is a time series style data, and traditional measurement methods are not suitable for load curve data. To cluster the load curve data more accurately, this paper applied an enhanced Pearson similarity for load curve data clustering. Our method introduces the &lsquo;trend alteration point&rsquo; concept and integrates it with the Pearson similarity. By introducing a weight for Pearson distance, this method helps to keep the whole contour of the load data and the partial similarity. Based on the weighed Pearson distance, a weighed Pearson-based hierarchy clustering algorithm is proposed. Years of load curve data are used for evaluation. Several user consumption models are found and analyzed. Results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of load data clustering.

AB  - In recent years, healthcare has attracted much attention, which is looking for more and more data analytics in healthcare to relieve medical problems in medical staff shortage, ageing population, people living alone, and quality of life. Data mining, analysis, and forecasting play a vital role in modern social and medical fields. However, how to select a proper model to mine and analyze the relevant medical information in the data is not only an extremely challenging problem, but also a concerning problem. Tuberculosis remains a major global health problem despite recent and continued progress in prevention and treatment. There is no doubt that the effective analysis and accurate forecasting of global tuberculosis prevalence rates lay a solid foundation for the construction of an epidemic disease warning and monitoring system from a global perspective. In this paper, the tuberculosis prevalence rate time series for four World Bank income groups are targeted. Kruskal&ndash;Wallis analysis of variance and multiple comparison tests are conducted to determine whether the differences of tuberculosis prevalence rates for different income groups are statistically significant or not, and a novel combined forecasting model with its weights optimized by a recently developed artificial intelligence algorithm&mdash;cuckoo search&mdash;is proposed to forecast the hierarchical tuberculosis prevalence rates from 2013 to 2016. Numerical results show that the developed combination model is not only simple, but is also able to satisfactorily approximate the actual tuberculosis prevalence rate, and can be an effective tool in mining and analyzing big data in the medical field.

AB  - Smart cities work with large volumes of data from sensor networks and other sources. To prevent data from being compromised by attacks or errors, smart city IT administrators need to apply attack detection techniques to evaluate possible incidents as quickly as possible. Machine learning has proven to be effective in many fields and, in the context of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), it has proven adequate to detect attacks. However, a smart city poses a much more complex scenario than a WSN, and it has to be evaluated whether these techniques are equally valid and effective. In this work, we evaluate two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines (SVM) and isolation forests) to detect anomalies in a laboratory that reproduces a real smart city use case with heterogeneous devices, algorithms, protocols, and network configurations. The experience has allowed us to show that, although these techniques are of great value for smart cities, additional considerations must be taken into account to effectively detect attacks. Thus, through this empiric analysis, we point out broader challenges and difficulties of using machine learning in this context, both for the technical complexity of the systems, and for the technical difficulty of configuring and implementing them in such environments.

AB  - Electric power systems are experiencing relevant changes involving the growing penetration of distributed generation and energy storage systems, the introduction of electric vehicles, the management of responsive loads, the proposals for new energy markets and so on. Such an evolution is pushing a paradigm shift that is one of the most important challenges in power network design: the management must move from traditional planning and manual intervention to full &ldquo;smartization&rdquo; of medium and low voltage networks. Peculiarities and criticalities of future power distribution networks originate from the complexity of the system which includes both the physical aspects of electric networks and the cyber aspects, like data elaboration, feature extraction, communication, supervision and control; only fully integrated advanced monitoring systems can foster this transition towards network automation. The design and development of such future networks require distinct kinds of expertise in the industrial and information engineering fields. In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive review of current challenges and multidisciplinary interactions in the development of smart distribution networks. The aim of this paper is to discuss, in an integrated and organized manner, the state of the art while focusing on the need for interaction between different disciplines and highlighting how innovative and future-proof outcomes of both research and practice can only emerge from a coordinated design of all the layers in the smart distribution network architecture.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent times, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are broadly applied in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in order to enhance the productivity and efficiency of existing and prospective manufacturing industries. In particular, an area of interest that concerns the use of WSNs in IIoT is the concept of sensor network virtualization and overlay networks. Both network virtualization and overlay networks are considered contemporary because they provide the capacity to create services and applications at the edge of existing virtual networks without changing the underlying infrastructure. This capability makes both network virtualization and overlay network services highly beneficial, particularly for the dynamic needs of IIoT based applications such as in smart industry applications, smart city, and smart home applications. Consequently, the study of both WSN virtualization and overlay networks has become highly patronized in the literature, leading to the growth and maturity of the research area. In line with this growth, this paper provides a review of the development made thus far concerning virtualized sensor networks, with emphasis on the application of overlay networks in IIoT. Principally, the process of virtualization in WSN is discussed along with its importance in IIoT applications. Different challenges in WSN are also presented along with possible solutions given by the use of virtualized WSNs. Further details are also presented concerning the use of overlay networks as the next step to supporting virtualization in shared sensor networks. Our discussion closes with an exposition of the existing challenges in the use of virtualized WSN for IIoT applications. In general, because overlay networks will be contributory to the future development and advancement of smart industrial and smart city applications, this review may be considered by researchers as a reference point for those particularly interested in the study of this growing field.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Air pollution is a global problem and can be perceived as a modern-day curse. One way of dealing with it is by finding economical ways to monitor and forecast air quality. Accurately monitoring and forecasting fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations is a challenging prediction task but Internet of Things (IoT) can help in developing economical and agile ways to design such systems. In this paper, we use a historical data-based approach to perform PM2.5 forecasting. A forecasting method is developed which uses exponential smoothing with drift. Experiments and evaluation were performed using the real-time PM2.5 data obtained from large scale deployment of IoT devices in Taichung region in Taiwan. We used the data from 132 monitoring stations to evaluate our model&rsquo;s performance. A comparison of prediction accuracy and computation time between the proposed model and three widely used forecasting models was done. The results suggest that our method can perform PM2.5 forecast for 132 monitoring stations with error as low as 0.16    &mu;   g/    m 3     and also with an acceptable computation time of 30 s. Further evaluation was done by forecasting PM2.5 for next 3 h. The results show that 90 % of the monitoring stations have error under 1.5    &mu;   g/    m 3     which is significantly low.

In recent years, a considerable amount of work has been developed around the use of social media data, most of which focusses on mining the content, with comparatively less attention given to the location information. Furthermore, what aggregated scale spatial patterns show still needs extensive discussion. This paper proposes a tweet-topic-function-structure framework to reveal spatial patterns from individual tweets at aggregated spatial levels, combining an unsupervised learning algorithm with spatial measures. Two-year geo-tweets collected in Greater London were analyzed as a demonstrator of the framework and as a case study. The results indicate, at a disaggregated level, that the distribution of topics possess a fair degree of spatial randomness related to tweeting behavior. When aggregating tweets by zones, the areas with the same topics form spatial clusters but of entangled urban functions. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering generates a clear spatial structure with orders of centers. Our work demonstrates that although uncertainties exist, geo-tweets should still be a useful resource for informing spatial planning, especially for the strategic planning of economic clusters.

AB  - This paper reviews low-cost vehicle and pedestrian detection methods and compares their accuracy. The main goal of this survey is to summarize the progress achieved to date and to help identify the sensing technologies that provide high detection accuracy and meet requirements related to cost and ease of installation. Special attention is paid to wireless battery-powered detectors of small dimensions that can be quickly and effortlessly installed alongside traffic lanes (on the side of a road or on a curb) without any additional supporting structures. The comparison of detection methods presented in this paper is based on results of experiments that were conducted with a variety of sensors in a wide range of configurations. During experiments various sensor sets were analyzed. It was shown that the detection accuracy can be significantly improved by fusing data from appropriately selected set of sensors. The experimental results reveal that accurate vehicle detection can be achieved by using sets of passive sensors. Application of active sensors was necessary to obtain satisfactory results in case of pedestrian detection.

AB  - With the increasing popularity of the Internet, user requests for cloud applications have dramatically increased. The traditional model of relying on dedicated hardware to implement cloud applications has not kept pace with the rapid growth in demand. Network function virtualization (NFV) architecture emerged at a historic moment. By moving the implementation of functions to software, a separation of functions and hardware was achieved. Therefore, when user demand increases, cloud application providers only need to update the software; the underlying hardware does not change, which can improve network scalability. Although NFV solves the problem of network expansion, deploying service function chains into the underlying network to optimize indicators remains an important research problem that requires consideration of delay, reliability, and power consumption. In this paper, we consider the optimization of power consumption with the premise of guaranteeing a certain virtual function link yield. We propose an efficient algorithm that is based on first-fit and greedy algorithms to solve the problem. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm substantially improves the path-finding efficiency, achieves a higher request acceptance ratio and reduces power consumption while provisioning the cloud applications. Compared with the baseline algorithm, the service function chain (SFC) acceptance ratio of our proposed algorithms improves by a maximum of approximately 15%, our proposed algorithm reduces the power consumption by a maximum of approximately 15%, the average link load ratio of our proposed algorithm reduces by a maximum of approximately 20%, and the average mapped path length of our proposed algorithm reduces by a maximum of approximately 1.5 hops.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper studies a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-aware fog computing by using a simple model, where a sensor harvests energy and receives information from a hybrid access point (HAP) through power splitting (PS) receiver architecture. Two information processing modes, local computing and fog offloading modes are investigated. For such a system, two optimization problems are formulated to minimize the sensor&rsquo;s required power for the two modes under the information rate and energy harvesting constraints by jointly optimizing the time assignment and the transmit power, as well as the PS ratio. The closed-form and semi-closed-form solutions to the proposed optimization problems are derived based on convex optimization theory. Simulation results show that neither mode is always superior to the other one. It also shows that when the number of logic operations per bit associated with local computing is less than a certain value, the local computing mode is a better choice; otherwise, the fog offloading mode should be selected. In addition, the mode selection associated with the positions of the user for fixed HAP and fog server (FS) is also discussed.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the last decade, the growth of the automotive market with the aid of technologies has been notable for the economic, automotive and technological sectors. Alongside this growing recognition, the so called Internet of Intelligent Vehicles (IoIV) emerges as an evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) applied to the automotive sector. Closely related to IoIV, emerges the concept of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which is the current revolution seen in industrial automation. IIoT, in its turn, relates to the concept of Industry 4.0, that is used to represent the current Industrial Revolution. This revolution, however, involves different areas: from manufacturing to healthcare. The Industry 4.0 can create value during the entire product lifecycle, promoting customer feedback, that is, having information about the product history throughout it is life. In this way, the automatic communication between vehicle and factory was facilitated, allowing the accomplishment of different analysis regarding vehicles, such as the identification of a behavioral pattern through historical driver usage, fuel consumption, maintenance indicators, so on. Thus, allowing the prevention of critical issues and undesired behaviors, since the automakers lose contact with the vehicle after the purchase. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a customer feedback platform for vehicle manufacturing in Industry 4.0 context, capable of collecting and analyzing, through an OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) scanner, the sensors available by vehicles, with the purpose of assisting in the management, prevention, and mitigation of different vehicular problems. An intercontinental evaluation conducted between Brazil and Italy locations shown the feasibility of platform and the potential to use in order to improve the vehicle manufacturing process.

AB  - Accurate forecasting of the produced and consumed electricity from wind farms is an essential aspect for wind power plant operators. In this context, our research addresses small-scale wind farms situated on hilly terrain, with the main purpose of overcoming the low accuracy limitations arising from the wind deflection, caused by the quite complex hilly terrain. A specific aspect of our devised forecasting method consists of incorporating advantages of recurrent long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, benefiting from their long-term dependencies, learning capabilities, and the advantages of feed-forward function fitting neural networks (FITNETs) that have the ability to map between a dataset of numeric inputs and a set of numeric targets. Another specific element of our approach consists of improving forecasting accuracy by means of refining the accuracy of the weather data input parameters within the same weather forecast resolution area. The developed method has power plant operators as main beneficiaries, but it can also be successfully applied in order to assess the energy potential of hilly areas with deflected wind, being useful for potential investors who want to build this type of wind farms. The method can be compiled and incorporated in the development of a wide range of customized applications targeting electricity forecasting for small wind farms situated on hilly terrain with deflected wind. The experimental results, the implementation of the developed method in a real production environment, its validation, and the comparison between our proposed method and other ones from the literature, confirm that the developed forecasting method represents an accurate, useful, and viable tool that addresses a gap in the current state of knowledge regarding the necessity for an accurate forecasting method that is able to predict with a high degree of accuracy both the produced and consumed electricity for small wind power plants situated on quite complex hilly terrain with deflected wind.

AB  - Urban cycling is a sustainable transport mode that many cities are promoting. However, few cities are taking advantage of geospatial technologies to represent and analyse cycling mobility based on the behavioural patterns and difficulties faced by cyclists. This study analyses a geospatial dataset crowdsourced by urban cyclists using an experimental, mobile geo-game. Fifty-seven participants recorded bicycle trips during one week periods in three cities. By aggregating them, we extracted not only the cyclists’ preferred streets but also the frictions faced during cycling. We successfully identified 284 places potentially having frictions: 71 in Münster, Germany; 70 in Castelló, Spain; and 143 in Valletta, Malta. At such places, participants recorded bicycle segments at lower speeds indicating a deviation from an ideal cycling scenario. We describe the potential frictions inhibiting bicycle commuting with regard to the distance to bicycle paths, surrounding infrastructure, and location in the urban area.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the increasing volume and diversity of sources of geospatial big data have created challenges in storing, managing, and processing data. In addition to the general characteristics of big data, the unique properties of spatial data make the handling of geospatial big data even more complicated. To facilitate users implementing geospatial big data applications in a MapReduce framework, several big data processing systems have extended the original Hadoop to support spatial properties. Most of those platforms, however, have included spatial functionalities by embedding them as a form of plug-in. Although offering a convenient way to add new features to an existing system, the plug-in has several limitations. In particular, while executing spatial and nonspatial operations by alternating between the existing system and the plug-in, additional read and write overheads have to be added to the workflow, significantly reducing performance efficiency. To address this issue, we have developed Marmot, a high-performance, geospatial big data processing system based on MapReduce. Marmot extends Hadoop at a low level to support seamless integration between spatial and nonspatial operations of a solid framework, allowing improved performance of geoprocessing workflow. This paper explains the overall architecture and data model of Marmot as well as the main algorithm for automatic construction of MapReduce jobs from a given spatial analysis task. To illustrate how Marmot transforms a sequence of operators for spatial analysis to map and reduce functions in a way to achieve better performance, this paper presents an example of spatial analysis retrieving the number of subway stations per city in Korea. This paper also experimentally demonstrates that Marmot generally outperforms SpatialHadoop, one of the top plug-in based spatial big data frameworks, particularly in dealing with complex and time-intensive queries involving spatial index.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Anomaly detection is an important research direction, which takes the real-time information system from different sensors and conditional information sources into consideration. Based on this, we can detect possible anomalies expected of the devices and components. One of the challenges is anomaly detection in multivariate-sensing time-series in this paper. Based on this situation, we propose RADM, a real-time anomaly detection algorithm based on Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and Bayesian Network (BN). First of all, we use HTM model to evaluate the real-time anomalies of each univariate-sensing time-series. Secondly, a model of anomalous state detection in multivariate-sensing time-series based on Naive Bayesian is designed to analyze the validity of the above time-series. Lastly, considering the real-time monitoring cases of the system states of terminal nodes in Cloud Platform, the effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated using a simulated example. Extensive simulation results show that using RADM in multivariate-sensing time-series is able to detect more abnormal, and thus can remarkably improve the performance of real-time anomaly detection.

AB  - The emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) will not only leverage new and potentially disruptive business models but will also change the way software applications will be analyzed and designed. Agility is a need in a systematic service engineering as well as a co-design of requirements and architectural artefacts. Functional and non-functional requirements of IT users (in smart manufacturing mostly from the disciplines of mechanical engineering and electrical engineering) need to be mapped to the capabilities and interaction patterns of emerging IIoT service platforms, not to forget the corresponding information models. The capabilities of such platforms are usually described, structured, and formalized by software architects and software engineers. However, their technical descriptions are far away from the thinking and the thematic terms of end-users. This complicates the transition from requirements analysis to system design, and hence the re-use of existing and the design of future platform capabilities. Current software engineering methodologies do not systematically cover these interlinked and two-sided aspects. The article describes in a comprehensive manner how to close this gap with the help of a service-oriented analysis and design methodology entitled SERVUS (also mentioned in ISO 19119 Annex D) and a corresponding Web-based Platform Engineering Information System (PEIS).

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Every day we experience unprecedented data growth from numerous sources, which contribute to big data in terms of volume, velocity, and variability. These datasets again impose great challenges to analytics framework and computational resources, making the overall analysis difficult for extracting meaningful information in a timely manner. Thus, to harness these kinds of challenges, developing an efficient big data analytics framework is an important research topic. Consequently, to address these challenges by exploiting non-linear relationships from very large and high-dimensional datasets, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are being used in analytics frameworks. Apache Spark has been in use as the fastest big data processing arsenal, which helps to solve iterative ML tasks, using distributed ML library called Spark MLlib. Considering real-world research problems, DL architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an effective approach to overcoming practical issues such as reduced accuracy, long-term sequence dependency, and vanishing and exploding gradient in conventional deep architectures. In this paper, we propose an efficient analytics framework, which is technically a progressive machine learning technique merged with Spark-based linear models, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and LSTM, using a two-stage cascade structure in order to enhance the predictive accuracy. Our proposed architecture enables us to organize big data analytics in a scalable and efficient way. To show the effectiveness of our framework, we applied the cascading structure to two different real-life datasets to solve a multiclass and a binary classification problem, respectively. Experimental results show that our analytical framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a high-level of classification accuracy.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The main aim of this paper is to provide a theoretically and empirically grounded discussion on big data and to propose a conceptual framework for big data based on a temporal dimension. This study adopts two research methods. The first research method is a critical assessment of the literature that aims to identify the concept of big data in organizations. This method is composed of a search for source materials, the selection of the source materials, and their analysis and synthesis. It has been used to develop a conceptual framework for assessing an organization&rsquo;s readiness to adopt big data. The purpose of the second research method is to provide an initial verification of the developed framework. This verification consisted of conducting qualitative research with the use of an in-depth interview in 15 selected organizations. The main contribution of this study is the Temporal Big Data Maturity Model (TBDMM) framework, which can help to measure the current state of an organization&rsquo;s big data assets, and to plan their future development with respect to sustainability issues. The proposed framework has been built over a time dimension as a fundamental internal structure with the goal of providing a complete means for assessing an organization&rsquo;s readiness to process the temporal data and knowledge that can be found in modern information sources. The proposed framework distinguishes five maturity levels: atemporal, pre-temporal, partly temporal, predominantly temporal, and temporal, which are used to evaluate data/knowledge, information technology (IT) solutions, functionalities offered by IT solutions, and the sustainable development context.

AB  - Advances in embedded systems, based on System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architectures, have enabled the development of many commercial devices that are powerful enough to run operating systems and complex algorithms. These devices integrate a set of different sensors with connectivity, computing capacities and cost reduction. In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) potential increases and introduces other development possibilities: &ldquo;Things&rdquo; can now increase computation near the source of the data; consequently, different IoT services can be deployed on local systems. This paradigm is known as &ldquo;edge computing&rdquo; and it integrates IoT technologies and cloud computing systems. Edge computing reduces the communications&rsquo; bandwidth needed between sensors and the central data centre. Management of sensors, actuators, embedded devices and other resources that may not be continuously connected to a network (such as smartphones) are required for this method. This trend is very attractive for smart building designs, where different subsystems (energy, climate control, security, comfort, user services, maintenance, and operating costs) must be integrated to develop intelligent facilities. In this work, a method to design smart services based on the edge computing paradigm is analysed and proposed. This novel approach overcomes some drawbacks of existing designs related to interoperability and scalability of services. An experimental architecture based on embedded devices is described. Energy management, security system, climate control and information services are the subsystems on which new smart facilities are implemented.

AB  - Hyperspectral image classification is a hot issue in the field of remote sensing. It is possible to achieve high accuracy and strong generalization through a good classification method that is used to process image data. In this paper, an efficient hyperspectral image classification method based on improved Rotation Forest (ROF) is proposed. It is named ROF-KELM. Firstly, Non-negative matrix factorization( NMF) is used to do feature segmentation in order to get more effective data. Secondly, kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) is chosen as base classifier to improve the classification efficiency. The proposed method inherits the advantages of KELM and has an analytic solution to directly implement the multiclass classification. Then, Q-statistic is used to select base classifiers. Finally, the results are obtained by using the voting method. Three simulation examples, classification of AVIRIS image, ROSIS image and the UCI public data sets respectively, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Energy sustainability is one of the key questions that drive the debate on cities&rsquo; and urban areas development. In parallel, artificial intelligence and cognitive computing have emerged as catalysts in the process aimed at designing and optimizing smart services&rsquo; supply and utilization in urban space. The latter are paramount in the domain of energy provision and consumption. This paper offers an insight into pilot systems and prototypes that showcase in which ways artificial intelligence can offer critical support in the process of attaining energy sustainability in smart cities. To this end, this paper examines smart metering and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) to make a case for the latter&rsquo;s value added in context of profiling electric appliances&rsquo; electricity consumption. By employing the findings in context of smart cities research, the paper then adds to the debate on energy sustainability in urban space. Existing research tends to be limited by data granularity (not in high frequency) and consideration of about six kinds of appliances. In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm support vector machine multiple kernel learning approach (GA-SVM-MKL) is proposed for NILM, with consideration of 20 kinds of appliance. Genetic algorithm helps to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and design the optimal kernel function based on various kernel properties. The performance indicators are sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and overall accuracy (OA) of the classifier. First, the performance evaluation of proposed GA-SVM-MKL achieves Se of 92.1%, Sp of 91.5% and OA of 91.8%. Second, the percentage improvement of performance indicators using proposed method is more than 21% compared with traditional kernel. Third, results reveal that by keeping different modes of electric appliance as identical class label, the performance indicators can increase to about 15%. Forth, tunable modes of GA-SVM-MKL classifier are proposed to further enhance the performance indicators up to 7%. Overall, this paper is a bold and novel contribution to the debate on energy utilization and sustainability in urban spaces as it integrates insights from artificial intelligence, IoT, and big data analytics and queries them in a context defined by energy sustainability in smart cities.

AB  - Road traffic and its impacts affect various aspects of wellbeing with safety, congestion and pollution being of significant concern in cities. Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios&mdash;low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)&mdash;demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities.

AB  - The field of education is not immune to advances in sophisticated information and communication technology (ICT). Going beyond the ICT-hype, the objective of this paper is to examine to what extent and how technology-enhanced teaching and learning (TEL) can enhance teaching and learning and, hence, turn them into levers of sustainable socio-economic growth and development. To address these questions, a multidimensional survey was developed and distributed internationally to lecturers/professors active in the field of higher education. The initial point of departure for this study was consistent with the well-referenced in the literature thesis that TEL has profound value added in view of enhancing the teaching and learning process. Yet, as the outcomes of the survey underpinning the discussion in this paper suggest, there is much more is at stake than that. Indeed, it is argued that several conditions need to be fulfilled if technology is to serve as a benefit, and not an obstacle to teaching and learning, and thus boost the delivery of quality education. This paper outlines them.

AB  - Provision of smart city services often relies on users contribution, e.g., of data, which can be costly for the users in terms of privacy. Privacy risks, as well as unfair distribution of benefits to the users, should be minimized as they undermine user participation, which is crucial for the success of smart city applications. This paper investigates privacy, fairness, and social welfare in smart city applications by means of computer simulations grounded on real-world data, i.e., smart meter readings and participatory sensing. We generalize the use of public good theory as a model for resource management in smart city applications, by proposing a design principle that is applicable across application scenarios, where provision of a service depends on user contributions. We verify its applicability by showing its implementation in two scenarios: smart grid and traffic congestion information system. Following this design principle, we evaluate different classes of algorithms for resource management, with respect to human-centered measures, i.e., privacy, fairness and social welfare, and identify algorithm-specific trade-offs that are scenario independent. These results could be of interest to smart city application designers to choose a suitable algorithm given a scenario-specific set of requirements, and to users to choose a service based on an algorithm that matches their privacy preferences.

AB  - The continuous increase in deprived living conditions in many cities of the Global South contradicts efforts to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable places. Using examples of Asian, African, and Latin American cities, this study shows the scope and limits of earth observation (EO)-based mapping of deprived living conditions in support of providing consistent global information for the SDG indicator 11.1.1 “proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing”. At the technical level, we compare several EO-based methods and imagery for mapping deprived living conditions, discussing their ability to map such areas including differences in terms of accuracy and performance at the city scale. At the operational level, we compare available municipal maps showing identified deprived areas with the spatial extent of morphological mapped areas of deprived living conditions (using EO) at the city scale, discussing the reasons for inconsistencies between municipal and EO-based maps. We provide an outlook on how EO-based mapping of deprived living conditions could contribute to a global spatial information base to support targeting of deprived living conditions in support of the SDG Goal 11.1.1 indicator, when uncertainties and ethical considerations on data provision are well addressed.

AB  - This paper describes the development and implementation of an electronic platform for energy management in public buildings. The developed platform prototype is based on the installation of a network of wireless sensors using the emerging Long Range (LoRa) low power long-range wireless network technology. This network is used to collect sensor data, which is stored online and manipulated to extract knowledge and generate actions toward energy saving solutions. In this process, gamification approaches were used to motivate changes in the users&rsquo; behavior towards more sustainable actions in public buildings. These actions and the associated processes can be implemented as public services, and they can be replicated to different public buildings, contributing to a more energy-sustainable world. The developed platform allows the monitoring and management of the heating/cooling, electric power consumption, and lighting levels. In order to validate the proposed electronic platform, sensor information was collected in the context of a university campus, which was used as an application scenario in public buildings.

AB  - Drones have recently become extremely popular, especially in military and civilian applications. Examples of drone utilization include reconnaissance, surveillance, and packet delivery. As time has passed, drones’ tasks have become larger and more complex. As a result, swarms or clusters of drones are preferred, because they offer more coverage, flexibility, and reliability. However, drone systems have limited computing power and energy resources, which means that sometimes it is difficult for drones to finish their tasks on schedule. A solution to this is required so that drone clusters can complete their work faster. One possible solution is an offloading scheme between drone clusters. In this study, we propose an opportunistic computational offloading system, which allows for a drone cluster with a high intensity task to borrow computing resources opportunistically from other nearby drone clusters. We design an artificial neural network-based response time prediction module for deciding whether it is faster to finish tasks by offloading them to other drone clusters. The offloading scheme is conducted only if the predicted offloading response time is smaller than the local computing time. Through simulation results, we show that our proposed scheme can decrease the response time of drone clusters through an opportunistic offloading process.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Low-cost sensors are a current trend in citizen science projects that focus on air quality. Until now, devices incorporating such sensors have been tested primarily for their technical capabilities and limitations, whereas their usability and acceptability amongst the public rarely goes beyond proof of concept, leaving user experience (UX) unstudied. The authors argue that UX should be taken into account to make sure that products and services are fit for purpose. Nineteen volunteers tested and evaluated a prototype device and provided feedback through semi-structured interviews and during focus group sessions. Their UX was then coded using mixed coding methods regarding device functionality and recommendations for future product development. The results indicate that UX can identify potentially problematic design aspects while giving deeper insights into user needs. For example, UX recognized that one of the most important aspects of user involvement and motivation was successful data harvesting, which frequently failed. This study recommends that future developers of low-cost portable air quality sensor systems prioritize reliable data transmission to minimize data loss. This will ensure an efficient and positive UX that supports user engagement in citizen science based research where collecting sensor-based data is the primary objective.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the dramatic increase of connected devices, the Internet of things (IoT) paradigm has become an important solution in supporting dense scenarios such as smart cities. The concept of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) has emerged as a viable solution to improving the capacity of cellular networks in such scenarios. However, achieving optimal load balancing is not trivial due to the complexity and dynamics in HetNets. For this reason, we propose a load balancing scheme based on machine learning techniques that uses both unsupervised and supervised methods, as well as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). As a use case, we apply our scheme to enhance the capabilities of an urban IoT network operating under the LoRaWAN standard. The simulation results show that the packet delivery ratio (PDR) is increased when our scheme is utilized in an unbalanced network and, consequently, the energy cost of data delivery is reduced. Furthermore, we demonstrate that better outcomes are attained when some techniques are combined, achieving a PDR improvement of up to about 50% and reducing the energy cost by nearly 20% in a multicell scenario with 5000 devices requesting downlink traffic.

AB  - Digitalization has enabled infrastructure and cities to be “smarter”; the use of physical space and energy, the transmission of information, the management of users, assets and processes, the operation of businesses and companies have been progressively digitalized. The main challenges of a Smart City is its definition, scope and interconnections; there are different approaches to Smart City implementations that vary from collaborative multidisciplinary environments, the addition of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) within its physical fabric to the use of Big Data for higher abstraction decisions. This paper presents the concept of Digital as a Service (DaaS), where any complete digitalization can be implemented independently of its associated physical infrastructure in a Cloud environment; DasS would enable an interoperable Virtual Digital Infrastructure (VDI). In addition, this paper reviews the current Digital Systems, Transmission Networks, Servers and Management Systems. The next Industrial Revolution will be founded on Artificial Intelligence that will entirely replace humans by taking production and management decisions based on the Internet of Things (IoT), the Cloud, BlockChain, Big Data, Virtual Reality and the combination of digital and real infrastructure or city. Digital as a Service would be its enabler by providing the entire interconnection, integration and virtualization of its Space, Services and Structure (3S).

A wireless sensor network has been deployed to gather the measurements from the sensor nodes. A control central coordinates the network and processes the data. Users can remotely inquire for the presence of water, status of the batteries for a specific node, the type of liquid and information about its functionality and alarms, thanks to a proprietary software application. The alerts are also communicated to the user within the home through an audible siren. The designed device is optimized in terms of costs, ease of deployment and maintenance, thus making it widely acceptable to end users.

AB  - Cloud computing has significantly enhanced the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) by ensuring and supporting the Quality of Service (QoS) of IoT applications. However, cloud services are still far from IoT devices. Notably, the transmission of IoT data experiences network issues, such as high latency. In this case, the cloud platforms cannot satisfy the IoT applications that require real-time response. Yet, the location of cloud services is one of the challenges encountered in the evolution of the IoT paradigm. Recently, edge cloud computing has been proposed to bring cloud services closer to the IoT end-users, becoming a promising paradigm whose pitfalls and challenges are not yet well understood. This paper aims at presenting the leading-edge computing concerning the movement of services from centralized cloud platforms to decentralized platforms, and examines the issues and challenges introduced by these highly distributed environments, to support engineers and researchers who might benefit from this transition.

TI  - Streaming MASSIF: Cascading Reasoning for Efficient Processing of IoT Data Streams
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 11
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the Internet of Things (IoT), multiple sensors and devices are generating heterogeneous streams of data. To perform meaningful analysis over multiple of these streams, stream processing needs to support expressive reasoning capabilities to infer implicit facts and temporal reasoning to capture temporal dependencies. However, current approaches cannot perform the required reasoning expressivity while detecting time dependencies over high frequency data streams. There is still a mismatch between the complexity of processing and the rate data is produced in volatile domains. Therefore, we introduce Streaming MASSIF, a Cascading Reasoning approach performing expressive reasoning and complex event processing over high velocity streams. Cascading Reasoning is a vision that solves the problem of expressive reasoning over high frequency streams by introducing a hierarchical approach consisting of multiple layers. Each layer minimizes the processed data and increases the complexity of the data processing. Cascading Reasoning is a vision that has not been fully realized. Streaming MASSIF is a layered approach allowing IoT service to subscribe to high-level and temporal dependent concepts in volatile data streams. We show that Streaming MASSIF is able to handle high velocity streams up to hundreds of events per second, in combination with expressive reasoning and complex event processing. Streaming MASSIF realizes the Cascading Reasoning vision and is able to combine high expressive reasoning with high throughput of processing. Furthermore, we formalize semantically how the different layers in our Cascading Reasoning Approach collaborate.

TI  - DynDL: Scheduling Data-Locality-Aware Tasks with Dynamic Data Transfer Cost for Multicore-Server-Based Big Data Clusters
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2018
VL  - 8
IS  - 11
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Network bandwidth is a scarce resource in big data environments, so data locality is a fundamental problem for data-parallel frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark. This problem is exacerbated in multicore server-based clusters, where multiple tasks running on the same server compete for the server&rsquo;s network bandwidth. Existing approaches solve this problem by scheduling computational tasks near the input data and considering the server&rsquo;s free time, data placements, and data transfer costs. However, such approaches usually set identical values for data transfer costs, even though a multicore server&rsquo;s data transfer cost increases with the number of data-remote tasks. Eventually, this hampers data-processing time, by minimizing it ineffectively. As a solution, we propose DynDL (Dynamic Data Locality), a novel data-locality-aware task-scheduling model that handles dynamic data transfer costs for multicore servers. DynDL offers greater flexibility than existing approaches by using a set of non-decreasing functions to evaluate dynamic data transfer costs. We also propose online and offline algorithms (based on DynDL) that minimize data-processing time and adaptively adjust data locality. Although DynDL is NP-complete (nondeterministic polynomial-complete), we prove that the offline algorithm runs in quadratic time and generates optimal results for DynDL&rsquo;s specific uses. Using a series of simulations and real-world executions, we show that our algorithms are 30% better than algorithms that do not consider dynamic data transfer costs in terms of data-processing time. Moreover, they can adaptively adjust data localities based on the server&rsquo;s free time, data placement, and network bandwidth, and schedule tens of thousands of tasks within subseconds or seconds.

TI  - Post-Occupancy Evaluation and IEQ Measurements from 64 Office Buildings: Critical Factors and Thresholds for User Satisfaction on Thermal Quality
T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2018
VL  - 8
IS  - 11
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - The indoor environmental quality (IEQ) of buildings can have a strong influence on occupants&rsquo; comfort, productivity, and health. Post-occupancy evaluation (POE) is necessary in assessing the IEQ of the built environment, and it typically relies on the subjective surveys of thermal quality, air quality, visual quality, and acoustic quality. In this research, we expanded POE to include both objective IEQ measurements and the technical attributes of building systems (TABS) that may affect indoor environment and user satisfaction. The suite of three tools, including user satisfaction survey, workstation IEQ measurements, and TABS in the National Environmental Assessment Toolkit (NEAT) has been deployed in 1601 workstations in 64 office buildings, generating a rich database for statistical evaluation of possible correlations between the physical attributes of workstations, environmental conditions, and user satisfaction. Multivariate regression and multiple correlation coefficient statistical analysis revealed the relationship between measured and perceived IEQ indices, interdependencies between IEQ indices, and other satisfaction variables of significance. The results showed that overall, 55% of occupants responded as &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; or &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;, and 45% reported being &ldquo;dissatisfied&rdquo; in their thermal quality. Given the dataset, air temperature in work area, size of thermal zone, window quality, level of temperature control, and radiant temperature asymmetry with fa&ccedil;ade are the critical factors for thermal quality satisfaction in the field. As a result, the outcome of this research contributes to identifying correlations between occupant satisfaction, measured data, and technical attributes of building systems. The presented integrated IEQ assessment method can further afford robust predictions of building performance against metrics and guidelines for IEQ standards to capture revised IEQ thresholds that impact building occupants&rsquo; satisfaction.

AB  - Sensor-driven systems provide data and information that facilitate real-time decision-making and autonomous actuation, as well as enable informed policy choices. However, can we be sure that these systems work as expected? Can we model them in a way that captures all the key issues? We define two concepts: frames of reference and frames of function that help us organise models of sensor-based systems and their purpose. Examples from a smart water distribution network illustrate how frames offer a lens through which to organise and balance multiple views of the system. Frames aid communication between modellers, analysts and stakeholders, and distinguish the purpose of each model, which contributes towards our trust that the system fulfils its purpose.

In this research, a solution to improve the user&rsquo;s experience in Smart Environments based on information obtained from indoor areas, following a non-intrusive approach, is proposed. We used Machine Learning techniques to determine occupants and estimate the number of persons in a specific indoor space. The solution proposed was tested in a real scenario using a prototype system, integrated by nodes and sensors, specifically designed and developed to gather the environmental data of interest. The results obtained demonstrate that with the developed system it is possible to obtain, process, and store environmental information. Additionally, the analysis performed over the gathered data using Machine Learning and pattern recognition mechanisms shows that it is possible to determine the occupancy of indoor environments.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Various heterogeneous devices or objects will be integrated for transparent and seamless communication under the umbrella of Internet of things (IoT). This would facilitate the open access of data for the growth of various digital services. Building a general framework of IoT is a complex task because of the heterogeneity in devices, technologies, platforms and services operating in the same system. In this paper, we mainly focus on the framework for Big Data analytics in Smart City applications, which being a broad category specifies the different domains for each application. IoT is intended to support the vision of Smart City, where advance technologies will be used for communication to improve the quality of life of citizens. A novel approach is proposed in this paper to enhance energy conservation and reduce the delay in Big Data gathering at tiny sensor nodes used in IoT framework. To implement the Smart City scenario in terms of Big Data in IoT, an efficient (optimized in quality of service) wireless sensor network (WSN) is required where communication of nodes is energy efficient. Thus, a new protocol, QoS-IoT(quality of service enabled IoT), is proposed on the top layer of the proposed architecture (the five-layer architecture consists of technology, data source, data management, application and utility programs) which is validated over the traditional protocols.

VL  - 7
IS  - 4
SN  - 2073-431X

AB  - Providing Internet of Things (IoT) environments with service level guarantee is a challenging task for improving IoT application usage experience. We specify in this paper an IoT architecture enabling an IoT Service Level Agreement (iSLA) achievement between an IoT Service Provider (IoT-SP) and an IoT Client (IoT-C). In order to guarantee the IoT applications&rsquo; requirements, Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms should be implemented within all the layers of the IoT architecture. Thus, we propose a specific mechanism for the lowest layer of our service level based IoT architecture (i.e., sensing layer). It is an adaptation of the IEEE 802.15.4 slotted CSMA/CA mechanism enabling to take into consideration the requirements of real-time IoT services. Our access method called QBAIoT (QoS based Access for IoT) extends IEEE 802.15.4 systems by creating a new contention access period for each specified traffic class in the iSLA. Furthermore, due to the huge number of IoT connected devices, self-configuring capability provisioning is necessary for limiting human intervention and total cost of ownership (TCO). Thus, we integrate a self-configuring capability to the QBAIoT access method by implementing the MAPE-K closed control loop within the IoT High Level Gateway (HL-Gw) of our proposed QoS based IoT architecture.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enormous potential in enabling new applications in various areas, ranging from military, security, medicine, and surveillance to traffic-monitoring applications. Lately, there has been heavy investment in the development of UAVs and multi-UAVs systems that can collaborate and complete missions more efficiently and economically. Emerging technologies such as 4G/5G networks have significant potential on UAVs equipped with cameras, sensors, and GPS receivers in delivering Internet of Things (IoT) services from great heights, creating an airborne domain of the IoT. However, there are many issues to be resolved before the effective use of UAVs can be made, including security, privacy, and management. As such, in this paper we review new UAV application areas enabled by the IoT and 5G technologies, analyze the sensor requirements, and overview solutions for fleet management over aerial-networking, privacy, and security challenges. Finally, we propose a framework that supports and enables these technologies on UAVs. The introduced framework provisions a holistic IoT architecture that enables the protection of UAVs as “flying” things in a collaborative networked environment.

AB  - The Smart Grid (SG) is nowadays an essential part of modern society, providing two-way energy flow and smart services between providers and customers. The main drawback is the SG complexity, with an SG composed of multiple layers, with devices and components that have to communicate, integrate, and cooperate as a unified system. Such complexity brings challenges for ensuring proper reliability, resilience, availability, integration, and security of the overall infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce a new smart grid testing management platform (herein called SGTMP) for executing real-time hardware-in-the-loop SG tests and experiments that can simplify the testing process in the context of interconnected SG devices. We discuss the context of usage, the system architecture, the interactive web-based interface, the provided API, and the integration with co-simulations frameworks to provide virtualized environments for testing. Furthermore, we present one main scenario about the stress-testing of SG devices that can showcase the applicability of the platform.

AB  - Activity of daily living (ADL) is a significant predictor of the independence and functional capabilities of an individual. Measurements of ADLs help to indicate one&rsquo;s health status and capabilities of quality living. Recently, the most common ways to capture ADL data are far from automation, including a costly 24/7 observation by a designated caregiver, self-reporting by the user laboriously, or filling out a written ADL survey. Fortunately, ubiquitous sensors exist in our surroundings and on electronic devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) era. We proposed the ADL Recognition System that utilizes the sensor data from a single point of contact, such as smartphones, and conducts time-series sensor fusion processing. Raw data is collected from the ADL Recorder App constantly running on a user&rsquo;s smartphone with multiple embedded sensors, including the microphone, Wi-Fi scan module, heading orientation of the device, light proximity, step detector, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, etc. Key technologies in this research cover audio processing, Wi-Fi indoor positioning, proximity sensing localization, and time-series sensor data fusion. By merging the information of multiple sensors, with a time-series error correction technique, the ADL Recognition System is able to accurately profile a person&rsquo;s ADLs and discover his life patterns. This paper is particularly concerned with the care for the older adults who live independently.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Cultural landscapes are regarded to be complex socioecological systems that originated as a result of the interaction between humanity and nature across time. Cultural landscapes present complex-system properties, including nonlinear dynamics among their components. There is a close relationship between socioeconomy and landscape in cultural landscapes, so that changes in the socioeconomic dynamic have an effect on the structure and functionality of the landscape. Several numerical analyses have been carried out to study this relationship, with linear regression models being widely used. However, cultural landscapes comprise a considerable amount of elements and processes, whose interactions might not be properly captured by a linear model. In recent years, machine-learning techniques have increasingly been applied to the field of ecology to solve regression tasks. These techniques provide sound methods and algorithms for dealing with complex systems under uncertainty. The term &lsquo;machine learning&rsquo; includes a wide variety of methods to learn models from data. In this paper, we study the relationship between socioeconomy and cultural landscape (in Andalusia, Spain) at two different spatial scales aiming at comparing different regression models from a predictive-accuracy point of view, including model trees and neural or Bayesian networks.

AB  - Smart cities are built to help people address issues like air pollution, traffic optimization, and energy efficiency. Electrical energy efficiency has become a central research issue in the energy field. Smart houses and buildings, which lower electricity costs, form an integral part of a smart city in a smart grid. This article presents an Internet of Things (IoT)-oriented smart Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that identifies electrical home appliances based on a novel hybrid Unsupervised Automatic Clustering-Integrated Neural-Fuzzy Classification (UAC-NFC) model. The smart HEMS designed and implemented in this article is composed of (1) a set of IoT-empowered smart e-meters, called smart sockets, installed as a benchmark in a realistic domestic environment with uncertainties and deployed against non-intrusive load monitoring; (2) a central Advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computing machine-based home gateway configured with a ZigBee wireless communication network; and (3) a cloud-centered analytical platform constructed to the hybrid UAC-NFC model for Demand-Side Management (DSM)/home energy management as a load classification task. The novel hybrid UAC-NFC model proposed in DSM and presented in this article is used to overcome the difficulties in distinguishing electrical appliances operated under similar electrical features and classified as unsupervised and self-organized. The smart HEMS developed with the proposed novel hybrid UAC-NFC model for DSM was able to identify electrical household appliances with an acceptable average and generalized classification rate of 95.73%.

AB  - Nowadays, it is more and more important to deal with the potential security issues of internet-of-things (IoT). Indeed, using the physical layer features of IoT wireless signals to achieve individual identity authentication is an effective way to enhance the security of IoT. However, traditional classifiers need to know all the categories in advance to get the recognition models. Realistically, it is difficult to collect all types of samples, which will result in some mistakes that the unknown target class may be decided as a known one. Consequently, this paper constructs an improving open-categorical classification model based on the generative adversarial networks (OCC-GAN) to solve the above problems. Here, we have modified the loss function of the generative model G and the discriminative model D. Compared to the traditional GAN model which can generate the fake sample overlapping with the real samples, our proposed G model generates the fake samples as negative samples which are evenly surrounding with the real samples, while the D model learns to distinguish between real samples and fake samples. Besides, we add auxiliary training not only to gain a better recognition result but also to improve the efficiency of the model. Furthermore, Our proposed model is verified through experimental study. Compared to other common methods, such as one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) and one-versus-rest support vector machine (OvR-SVM), the OCC-GAN model has a better performance. The recognition rate of the OCC-GAN model can reach more than 90% with a recall rate of 97% by the data of the IoT module.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Social sensors perceive the real world through social media and online web services, which have the advantages of low cost and large coverage over traditional physical sensors. In intelligent transportation researches, sensing and analyzing such social signals provide a new path to monitor, control and optimize transportation systems. However, current research is largely focused on using single channel online social signals to extract and sense traffic information. Clearly, sensing and exploiting multi-channel social signals could effectively provide deeper understanding of traffic incidents. In this paper, we utilize cross-platform online data, i.e., Sina Weibo and News, as multi-channel social signals, then we propose a word2vec-based event fusion (WBEF) model   for sensing, detecting, representing, linking and fusing urban traffic incidents. Thus, each traffic incident can be comprehensively described from multiple aspects, and finally the whole picture of unban traffic events can be obtained and visualized. The proposed WBEF architecture was trained by about 1.15 million multi-channel online data from Qingdao (a coastal city in China), and the experiments show our method surpasses the baseline model, achieving an 88.1% F1 score in urban traffic incident detection. The model also demonstrates its effectiveness in the open scenario test.

AB  - Forests represent important habitats for species and provide multiple ecosystem services for human well-being. Preserving forests and other terrestrial ecosystems has become crucial to halt desertification, land degradation, and biodiversity loss worldwide, and is also one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. Remote sensing could greatly contribute to measuring progress toward SDGs by providing consistent and repetitive coverage of large areas, as well as information in various wavelengths, which facilitates the monitoring of environmental trends at various scales. This paper focuses on SDG indicator 15.1.1&mdash;&ldquo;Forest area as a percentage of total land area&rdquo; to demonstrate the potential of Earth Observation Data Cubes for SDGs. The approach presented here uses Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) stored in the Swiss Data Cube, and offers a complementary method to ground-based approaches to monitor Switzerland&rsquo;s forest extent based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The proposed method performs time-series analyses to extract a forest/non-forest map and a graph representing the trend of SDG 15.1.1 indicator over time. Preliminary results suggest that this approach can identify similar forest extent and growth patterns to observed trends, and can therefore help monitor progress toward the selected SDG indicator more effectively.

AB  - Renewable energy sources, on one hand, are environmentally friendly, but on the other, they suffer from volatility in power generation, which endangers power-grid stability. A viable solution to circumvent the intermittent behavior of renewables is the usage of energy-storage systems. In this paper, we study the energy management of a proof-of-concept system consisting of solar panels, energy-storage systems, a power grid, and household loads. Using neural networks, we identify the most relevant parameters impacting the power generation of solar panels, and then train the corresponding network to derive forecasts. We also go one step further, and propose a heuristics-based energy-management policy for the purpose of reducing curtailments. We show that our proposed policy outperforms the naive policy by 8%, which does not consider any power-generation forecasts.

We model and solve the task of reducing the size of the dataset used for learning about campus mobility. Our conclusions show an important reduction of the required data to learn mobility patterns by more than 90%, while improving (at the same time) the precision of the predictions of theapplied machine-learning method (up to 15%). All this was done along with the construction of a real system in a city, which hopefully resulted in a very comprehensive work in smart cities using sensors.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is complex given the wide variety of governmental and NGO actors involved in development projects as well as the increased number of targets and indicators. However, data on the wide variety of indicators must be collected regularly, in a robust manner, comparable across but also within countries and at different administrative and disaggregated levels for adequate decision making to take place. Traditional census and household survey data is not enough. The increase in Small and Big Data streams have the potential to complement official statistics. The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a framework to characterize a data ecosystem in a developing country in its totality and to show how this can be used to identify data, outside the official statistics realm, that enriches the reporting on SDG indicators. Our method consisted of a literature study and an interpretative case study (two workshops with 60 and 35 participants and including two questionnaires, over 20 consultations and desk research). We focused on SDG 6.1.1. (Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services) in rural Malawi. We propose a framework with five dimensions (actors, data supply, data infrastructure, data demand and data ecosystem governance). Results showed that many governmental and NGO actors are involved in water supply projects with different funding sources and little overall governance. There is a large variety of geospatial data sharing platforms and online accessible information management systems with however a low adoption due to limited internet connectivity and low data literacy. Lots of data is still not open. All this results in an immature data ecosystem. The characterization of the data ecosystem using the framework proves useful as it unveils gaps in data at geographical level and in terms of dimensionality (attributes per water point) as well as collaboration gaps. The data supply dimension of the framework allows identification of those datasets that have the right quality and lowest cost of data extraction to enrich official statistics. Overall, our analysis of the Malawian case study illustrated the complexities involved in achieving self-regulation through interaction, feedback and networked relationships. Additional complexities, typical for developing countries, include fragmentation, divide between governmental and non-governmental data activities, complex funding relationships and a data poor context.

AB  - Undoubtedly, the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has impacted on our every-day life, surrounding us with smart objects. Thus, the potentialities of this new market attracted the industry, so that many enterprises developed their own IoT platforms aiming at helping IoT services&rsquo; developers. In the multitude of possible platforms, selecting the most suitable to implement a specific service is not straightforward, especially from a security perspective. This paper analyzes some of the most prominent proposals in the IoT platforms market-place, performing an in-depth security comparison using five common criteria. These criteria are detailed in sub-criteria, so that they can be used as a baseline for the development of a secure IoT service. Leveraging the knowledge gathered from our in-depth study, both researchers and developers may select the IoT platform which best fits their needs. Additionally, an IoT service for monitoring commercial flights is implemented in two previously analyzed IoT platforms, giving an adequate detail level to represent a solid guideline for future IoT developers.

AB  - The gaming industry has evolved into a multi-functional smart city that combines integrated casinos and entertainment (ICE). ICE logistics involve supply chains with various stages in geographically-distributed locations and with limited and complex storage and warehouses. Challenges are to leverage demands, traffic, and storage allocation in ICE logistics. The decentralized structure of blockchain technology allows all parties to participate in ICE logistics. Its cryptography-based, immutable nature gives the assurance of security. This research deals with the design and application of blockchains in ICE logistics. We first adopt a Concentric Value Circles (CVC) model to identify the requirements and business opportunities that use blockchain technology in ICE logistics. We develop an open, automated, and transparent platform, TransICE, which utilizes the feature of smart contracts in blockchain technology and adopts a decentralized model, Hawk, where no financial transactions are stored on the blockchain to hold privacy of transactions publicly. Two cases, (1) the Shipment Pricing and Scheduling process and (2) the Pickup, Shipping and Delivery process in TransICE, are studied to illustrate the applications and feasibility of the proposed TransICE platform and the developed smart contracts of the Hawk model.

AB  - Smart cities are primarily based on information and communications technology development and applications across various academic subjects and domains. Integrating new-generation information and communications technologies, including the Internet of Things data collection, cloud computation, big data applications, and mobile network, smart cities organize the people and things of a city according to application needs to perform real-time computation and processing. Information transmission must be rapid and reliable to protect personal privacy and to secure data. All types of information security problems can lead to disastrous consequences; in particular, they pose great challenges to traditional information security systems. To explore possible solutions to the challenges that Taiwan&rsquo;s smart city information security faces, this study used the enterprise architecture method and discussed the emphasis and investment capacity of the government and enterprises on information security. Moreover, this study reviewed correct methods of using a smart information security collaborative system to protect not only privacy, however also networks with a large attack surface; the purpose was to establish a reliable data sharing practice and alleviate the cascading effect of failures of smart networks. Finally, this paper provides future research directions for building smart cities and encouraging further explorations in this domain. It is hoped that smart cities can conduct overall planning for information security during the process of construction. Future researchers will be able to propose more effective solutions for smart city information security while developing information and communication technologies.

AB  - In the era of digital transformation, the Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging with improved data collection methods, advanced data processing mechanisms, enhanced analytic techniques, and modern service platforms. However, one of the major challenges is to provide an integrated design that can provide analytic capability for heterogeneous types of data and support the IoT applications with modular and robust services in an environment where the requirements keep changing. An enhanced analytic functionality not only provides insights from IoT data, but also fosters productivity of processes. Developing an efficient and easily maintainable IoT analytic system is a challenging endeavor due to many reasons such as heterogeneous data sources, growing data volumes, and monolithic service development approaches. In this view, the article proposes a design methodology that presents analytic capabilities embedded in modular microservices to realize efficient and scalable services in order to support adaptive IoT applications. Algorithms for analytic procedures are developed to underpin the model. We implement the Web Objects to virtualize IoT resources. The semantic data modeling is used to promote interoperability across the heterogeneous systems. We demonstrate the use case scenario and validate the proposed design with a prototype implementation.

AB  - Evidence of something unusual happening in urban areas can be collected from different data sources, such as police officers, cameras, or specialized physical infrastructures. In this paper, we propose using geotagged posts on location-based social networks (LBSNs) to detect crowd dynamics anomalies automatically as evidence of a potential unusual event. To this end, we use the Instagram API media/search endpoint to collect the location of the pictures posted by Instagram users in a given area periodically. The collected locations are summarized by their centroid. The novelty of our work relies on using the entropy of the sequence of centroid locations in order to detect abnormal patterns in the city. The proposal is tested on a data set collected from Instagram during seven months in New York City and validated with another data set from Manchester. The results have also been compared with an alternative approach, a training phase plus a ranking of outliers. The main conclusion is that the entropy algorithm succeeds inn finding abnormal events without the need for a training phase, being able to dynamically adapt to changes in crowd behavior.

AB  - The use of wearable and Internet-of-Things (IoT) for smart and affordable healthcare is trending. In traditional setups, the cloud backend receives the healthcare data and performs monitoring and prediction for diseases, diagnosis, and wellness prediction. Fog computing (FC) is a distributed computing paradigm that leverages low-power embedded processors in an intermediary node between the client layer and cloud layer. The diagnosis for wellness and fitness monitoring could be transferred to the fog layer from the cloud layer. Such a paradigm leads to a reduction in latency at an increased throughput. This paper processes a fog-based deep learning model, DeepFog that collects the data from individuals and predicts the wellness stats using a deep neural network model that can handle heterogeneous and multidimensional data. The three important abnormalities in wellness namely, (i) diabetes; (ii) hypertension attacks and (iii) stress type classification were chosen for experimental studies. We performed a detailed analysis of proposed models&rsquo; accuracy on standard datasets. The results validated the efficacy of the proposed system and architecture for accurate monitoring of these critical wellness and fitness criteria. We used standard datasets and open source software tools for our experiments.

AB  - This work focuses on fuzzy data processing in control and decision-making systems based on the transformation of real-timeseries and high-frequency data to fuzzy sets with further implementation of diverse fuzzy arithmetic operations. Special attention was paid to the synthesis of the computational library of horizontal and vertical analytic models for fuzzy sets as the results of fuzzy arithmetic operations. The usage of the developed computational library allows increasing the operating speed and accuracy of fuzzy data processing in real time. A computational library was formed for computing of such fuzzy arithmetic operations as fuzzy-maximum. Fuzzy sets as components of fuzzy data processing were chosen as triangular fuzzy numbers. The analytic models were developed based on the analysis of the intersection points between left and right branches of considered triangular fuzzy numbers with different relations between their parameters. Our study introduces the mask for the evaluation of the relations between corresponding parameters of fuzzy numbers that allows to determine the appropriate model from the computational library in automatic mode. The simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed computational library for different applications.

AB  - Structured-light vision sensor, as an important tool for obtaining 3D data, is widely used in fields of online high-precision measurement. However, the captured stripe images can show high-dynamic characteristics of low signal-to-noise ratio and uneven brightness due to the complexity of the onsite environment. These conditions seriously affect measurement reliability and accuracy. In this study, a wheel size measurement framework based on a structured-light vision sensor, which has high precision and reliability and is suitable for highly reflective conditions, is proposed. Initially, the quality evaluation criterion of stripe images is established, and the entire stripe is distinguished into high- and low-quality segments. In addition, the multi-scale Retinex theory is adopted to enhance stripe brightness, which improves the reliability of subsequent stripe center extraction. Experiments verify that this approach can remarkably improve measurement reliability and accuracy and has important practical value.

AB  - Authentication systems based on biometrics characteristics and data represents one of the most important trend in the evolution of the society, e.g., Smart City, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Big Data. In the near future, biometrics systems will be everywhere in the society, such as government, education, smart cities, banks etc. Due to its uniqueness, characteristic, biometrics systems will become more and more vulnerable, privacy being one of the most important challenges. The classic cryptographic primitives are not sufficient to assure a strong level of secureness for privacy. The current paper has several objectives. The main objective consists in creating a framework based on cryptographic modules which can be applied in systems with biometric authentication methods. The technologies used in creating the framework are: C#, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell. The wide range of technologies for developing the algorithms give the readers the possibility and not only, to choose the proper modules for their own research or business direction. The cryptographic modules contain algorithms based on machine learning and modern cryptographic algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption System), SHA-256, RC4, RC5, RC6, MARS, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, THREEFISH, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), Elliptic Curve, and Diffie Hellman. As methods for implementing with success the cryptographic modules, we will propose a methodology which can be used as a how-to guide. The article will focus only on the first category, machine learning, and data clustering, algorithms with applicability in the cloud computing environment. For tests we have used a virtual machine (Virtual Box) with Apache Hadoop and a Biometric Analysis Tool. The weakness of the algorithms and methods implemented within the framework will be evaluated and presented in order for the reader to acknowledge the latest status of the security analysis and the vulnerabilities founded in the mentioned algorithms. Another important result of the authors consists in creating a scheme for biometric enrollment (in Results). The purpose of the scheme is to give a big overview on how to use it, step by step, in real life, and how to use the algorithms. In the end, as a conclusion, the current work paper gives a comprehensive background on the most important and challenging aspects on how to design and implement an authentication system based on biometrics characteristics.

AB  - Current studies show that traditional deterministic models tend to struggle to capture the non-linear relationship between the concentration of air pollutants and their sources of emission and dispersion. To tackle such a limitation, the most promising approach is to use statistical models based on machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, it is puzzling why a certain algorithm is chosen over another for a given task. This systematic review intends to clarify this question by providing the reader with a comprehensive description of the principles underlying these algorithms and how they are applied to enhance prediction accuracy. A rigorous search that conforms to the PRISMA guideline is performed and results in the selection of the 46 most relevant journal papers in the area. Through a factorial analysis method these studies are synthetized and linked to each other. The main findings of this literature review show that: (i) machine learning is mainly applied in Eurasian and North American continents and (ii) estimation problems tend to implement Ensemble Learning and Regressions, whereas forecasting make use of Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The next challenges of this approach are to improve the prediction of pollution peaks and contaminants recently put in the spotlights (e.g., nanoparticles).

AB  - Renewable energy systems (RES) are reliable by nature; the sun and wind are theoretically endless resources. From the beginnings of the power systems, the concern was to know &ldquo;how much&rdquo; energy will be generated. Initially, there were voltmeters and power meters; nowadays, there are much more advanced solar controllers, with small displays and built-in modules that handle big data. Usually, large photovoltaic (PV)-battery systems have sophisticated energy management strategies in order to operate unattended. By adding the information collected by sensors managed with powerful technologies such as big data and analytics, the system is able to efficiently react to environmental factors and respond to consumers&rsquo; requirements in real time. According to the weather parameters, the output of PV could be symmetric, supplying an asymmetric electricity demand. Thus, a smart adaptive switching module that includes a forecasting component is proposed to improve the symmetry between the PV output and daily load curve. A scaling approach for smaller off-grid systems that provides an accurate forecast of the PV output based on data collected from sensors is developed. The proposed methodology is based on sensor implementation in RES operation and big data technologies are considered for data processing and analytics. In this respect, we analyze data captured from loggers and forecast the PV output with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and linear regression, finding that Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for prediction is considerably improved when using more parameters in the machine learning process.

AB  - Traffic jams can be avoided by controlling traffic signals according to quickly building congestion with steep gradients on short temporal and small spatial scales. With the rising standards of computational technology, single-board computers, software packages, platforms, and APIs (Application Program Interfaces), it has become relatively easy for developers to create systems for controlling signals and informative systems. Hence, for enhancing the power of Intelligent Transport Systems in automotive telematics, in this study, we used crowdsourced traffic congestion data from Google to adjust traffic light cycle times with a system that is adaptable to congestion. One aim of the system proposed here is to inform drivers about the status of the upcoming traffic light on their route. Since crowdsourced data are used, the system does not entail the high infrastructure cost associated with sensing networks. A full system module-level analysis is presented for implementation. The system proposed is fail-safe against temporal communication failure. Along with a case study for examining congestion levels, generic information processing for the cycle time decision and status delivery system was tested and confirmed to be viable and quick for a restricted prototype model. The information required was delivered correctly over sustained trials, with an average time delay of 1.5 s and a maximum of 3 s.

VL  - 11

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - Freight transportation is becoming an increasingly critical activity for enterprises in a global world. Moreover, the distribution activities have a non-negligible impact on the environment, as well as on the citizens&rsquo; welfare. The classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) aims at designing routes that minimize the cost of serving customers using a given set of capacitated vehicles. Some VRP variants consider traveling times, either in the objective function (e.g., including the goal of minimizing total traveling time or designing balanced routes) or as constraints (e.g., the setting of time windows or a maximum time per route). Typically, the traveling time between two customers or between one customer and the depot is assumed to be both known in advance and static. However, in real life, there are plenty of factors (predictable or not) that may affect these traveling times, e.g., traffic jams, accidents, road works, or even the weather. In this work, we analyze the VRP with dynamic traveling times. Our work assumes not only that these inputs are dynamic in nature, but also that they are a function of the structure of the emerging routing plan. In other words, these traveling times need to be dynamically re-evaluated as the solution is being constructed. In order to solve this dynamic optimization problem, a learnheuristic-based approach is proposed. Our approach integrates statistical learning techniques within a metaheuristic framework. A number of computational experiments are carried out in order to illustrate our approach and discuss its effectiveness.

AB  - Data collection is one of the main operations performed in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Even if several interesting approaches on data collection have been proposed during the last decade, it remains a research focus in full swing with a number of important challenges. Indeed, the continuous reduction in sensor size and cost, the variety of sensors available on the market, and the tremendous advances in wireless communication technology have potentially broadened the impact of WSNs. The range of application of WSNs now extends from health to the military field through home automation, environmental monitoring and tracking, as well as other areas of human activity. Moreover, the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in an important amount of heterogeneous data that are produced at an exponential rate. Furthermore, these data are of interest to both industry and in research. This fact makes their collection and analysis imperative for many purposes. In view of the characteristics of these data, we believe that very large-scale and heterogeneous WSNs can be very useful for collecting and processing these Big Data. However, the scaling up of WSNs presents several challenges that are of interest in both network architecture to be proposed, and the design of data-routing protocols. This paper reviews the background and state of the art of Big Data collection in Large-Scale WSNs (LS-WSNs), compares and discusses on challenges of Big Data collection in LS-WSNs, and proposes possible directions for the future.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Land take is one of the most studied phenomena in land use science. The increased attention to the issue of urban growth from both scientists and decision makers is justified by the dramatic negative effects on land use caused by anthropogenic activities. Within this context, researchers have developed and explored several models to forecast land use changes, some of which establish excellent scenario-based predictions of urban growth. However, there is still a lack of operative and user-friendly tools to be integrated into standard urban planning procedures. This paper explores the features of the recently published model FUTure Urban-Regional Environment Simulation integrated into the GRASSGIS environment, which generates urban growth simulation based on a plethora of driving variables. Specifically, the model was applied to the case study of urbanization in the Italian national territory. Hence, the aim of this work is to analyze the importance of population dynamics within the process of urban growth. A simulation of urban growth up to the year 2035 was performed. Results show that, despite the importance given to demographic aspects when defining urban policies over the last several decades, additional factors need to be considered during planning processes to overcome the housing issues currently experienced in Italy.

AB  - The new Internet of Things/Everything (IoT/IoE) paradigm and architecture allows one to rethink the way Smart City infrastructures are designed and managed, but on the other hand, a number of problems have to be solved. In terms of mobility the cities that embrace the sensoring era can take advantage of this disruptive technology to improve the quality of life of their citizens, also thanks to the rationalization in the use of their resources. In Sii-Mobility, a national smart city project on mobility and transportation, a flexible platform has been designed and here, in this paper, is presented. It permits one to set up heterogeneous and complex scenarios that integrate sensors/actuators as IoT/IoE in an overall Big Data, Machine Learning and Data Analytics scenario. A detailed and complex case-study has been presented to validate the solution in the context of a system that dynamically reverse the traveling direction of a road segment, with all the safety conditions in place. This case study composes several building blocks of the IoT platform, which demonstrate that a flexible and dynamic set-up is possible, supporting security, safety, local, cloud and mixed solutions.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - Over the past few decades, the growth of the urban population has been remarkable. Nowadays, 50% of the population lives in urban areas, and forecasts point that by 2050 this number will reach 70%. Today, 64% of all travel made is within urban environments and the total amount of urban kilometers traveled is expected to triple by 2050. Thus, seeking novel solutions for urban mobility becomes paramount for 21st century society. In this work, we discuss the performance of vehicular networks. We consider the metric Delta Network. The Delta Network characterizes the connectivity of the vehicular network through the percentage of travel time in which vehicles are connected to roadside units. This article reviews the concept of the Delta Network and extends its study through the presentation of a general heuristic based on the definition of scores to identify the areas of the road network that should receive coverage. After defining the general heuristic, we show how small changes in the score computation can generate very distinct (and interesting) patterns of coverage, each one suited to a given scenario. In order to exemplify such behavior, we propose three deployment strategies based on simply changing the computation of scores. We compare the proposed strategies to the intuitive strategy of allocating communication units at the most popular zones of the road network. Experiments show that the strategies derived from the general heuristic provide higher coverage than the intuitive strategy when using the same number of communication devices. Moreover, the resulting pattern of coverage is very interesting, with roadside units deployed a circle pattern around the traffic epicenter.

AB  - The fifth generation (5G) of wireless communication systems is considered the key technology to enable a wide range of application scenarios and the effective spreading of the smart city concept. Vertical business use cases, specifically designed for the future 5G city, will have a strong economical and social impact. For this reason, ongoing 5G field trials have to test newly deployed technologies as well as the capability of 5G to create a new digital economy. This paper describes the 5G field trial environment that was launched in Italy at the end of 2017. The aim is to evaluate the capability of the 5G network of supporting innovative services with reference to suitably designed key performance indicators and to evaluate the opportunities offered by these services. Indeed, vertical business use cases, specifically designed for the future 5G city, with a strong economic and social impact, are under implementation and will be evaluated. In particular, the paper provides a detailed description of the deployment of an actual complete integrated 5G network. It shows how 5G is effective enabling technology for a wide range of vertical business and use cases. Indeed, its flexibility allows to satisfy completely different performance requirements of real services. Some preliminary results, obtained during the first phase, are presented for a smart mobility scenario.

VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SN  - 2411-9660

AB  - To be able to provide appropriate services in social and human application contexts, smart cyber-physical systems (S-CPSs) need ampliative reasoning and decision-making (ARDM) mechanisms. As one option, procedural abduction (PA) is suggested for self-managing S-CPSs. PA is a knowledge-based computation and learning mechanism. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive description of the computational framework proposed for PA. Towards this end, first the essence of smart cyber-physical systems is discussed. Then, the main recent research results related to computational abduction and ampliative reasoning are discussed. PA facilitates beliefs-driven contemplation of the momentary performance of S-CPSs, including a &lsquo;best option&rsquo;-based setting of the servicing objective and realization of any demanded adaptation. The computational framework of PA includes eight clusters of computational activities: (i) run-time extraction of signals and data by sensing, (ii) recognition of events, (iii) inferring about existing situations, (iv) building awareness of the state and circumstances of operation, (v) devising alternative performance enhancement strategies, (vi) deciding on the best system adaptation, (vii) devising and scheduling the implied interventions, and (viii) actuating effectors and controls. Several cognitive algorithms and computational actions are used to implement PA in a compositional manner. PA necessitates not only a synergic interoperation of the algorithms, but also an objective-dependent fusion of the pre-programmed and the run time acquired chunks of knowledge. A fully fledged implementation of PA is underway, which will make verification and validation possible in the context of various smart CPSs.

AB  - Plan Ceibal is the name coined in Uruguay for the local implementation of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative. Plan Ceibal distributes laptops and tablets to students and teachers, and also deploys a nationwide wireless network to provide Internet access to these devices, provides video conference facilities, and develops educational applications. Given the scale of the program, management in general, and specifically device management, is a very challenging task. Device maintenance and replacement is a particularly important process; users trigger such kind of replacement processes and usually imply several days without the device. Early detection of fault conditions in the most stressed hardware parts (e.g., batteries) would permit to prompt defensive replacement, contributing to reduce downtime, and improving the user experience. Seeking for better, preventive and scalable device management, in this paper we present a prototype of a Mobile Device Management (MDM) module for Plan Ceibal, developed over an IoT infrastructure, showing the results of a controlled experiment over a sample of the devices. The prototype is deployed over a public IoT infrastructure to speed up the development process, avoiding, in this phase, the need for local infrastructure and maintenance, while enforcing scalability and security requirements. The presented data analysis was implemented off-line and represents a sample of possible metrics which could be used to implement preventive management in a real deployment.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Predicting the exact urban places where crime is most likely to occur is one of the greatest interests for Police Departments. Therefore, the goal of the research presented in this paper is to identify specific urban areas where a crime could happen in Manhattan, NY for every hour of a day. The outputs from this research are the following: (i) predicted land uses that generates the top three most committed crimes in Manhattan, by using machine learning (random forest and logistic regression), (ii) identifying the exact hours when most of the assaults are committed, together with hot spots during these hours, by applying time series and hot spot analysis, (iii) built hourly prediction models for assaults based on the land use, by deploying logistic regression. Assault, as a physical attack on someone, according to criminal law, is identified as the third most committed crime in Manhattan. Land use (residential, commercial, recreational, mixed use etc.) is assigned to every area or lot in Manhattan, determining the actual use or activities within each particular lot. While plotting assaults on the map for every hour, this investigation has identified that the hot spots where assaults occur were ‘moving’ and not confined to specific lots within Manhattan. This raises a number of questions: Why are hot spots of assaults not static in an urban environment? What makes them ‘move’—is it a particular urban pattern? Is the ‘movement’ of hot spots related to human activities during the day and night? Answering these questions helps to build the initial frame for assault prediction within every hour of a day. Knowing a specific land use vulnerability to assault during each exact hour can assist the police departments to allocate forces during those hours in risky areas. For the analysis, the study is using two datasets: a crime dataset with geographical locations of crime, date and time, and a geographic dataset about land uses with land use codes for every lot, each obtained from open databases. The study joins two datasets based on the spatial location and classifies data into 24 classes, based on the time range when the assault occurred. Machine learning methods reveal the effect of land uses on larceny, harassment and assault, the three most committed crimes in Manhattan. Finally, logistic regression provides hourly prediction models and unveils the type of land use where assaults could occur during each hour for both day and night.

AB  - With the increase of population density and the rural exodus to cities, urbanization is assuming extreme proportions and presents a tremendous urban problem related to waste generation. The increase of waste generation has been considered a significant challenge to large urban centers worldwide and represents a critical issue for countries with accelerated population growth in cities. The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing offer an automation possibility through cyberphysical systems that will change the way solid waste management is performed. Considering IoT requirements, a review analysis of waste management models available in the literature is performed in detail in this paper. Then, a deep review is undertaken of the related literature based on IoT infrastructure for efficient handling of waste generated in urban scenarios, focusing on the interaction among concessionaires and waste generators (citizens) from the perspective of a shorter collection time with reduced costs, as well as citizenship promotion. An IoT-based reference model is described, and a comparison analysis of the available solutions is presented, with the goal to highlight the most relevant approaches and identify open research issues on the topic.

AB  - We describe the sentiment analysis experiments that were performed on the Lithuanian Internet comment dataset using traditional machine learning (Na&iuml;ve Bayes Multinomial&mdash;NBM and Support Vector Machine&mdash;SVM) and deep learning (Long Short-Term Memory&mdash;LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network&mdash;CNN) approaches. The traditional machine learning techniques were used with the features based on the lexical, morphological, and character information. The deep learning approaches were applied on the top of two types of word embeddings (Vord2Vec continuous bag-of-words with negative sampling and FastText). Both traditional and deep learning approaches had to solve the positive/negative/neutral sentiment classification task on the balanced and full dataset versions. The best deep learning results (reaching 0.706 of accuracy) were achieved on the full dataset with CNN applied on top of the FastText embeddings, replaced emoticons, and eliminated diacritics. The traditional machine learning approaches demonstrated the best performance (0.735 of accuracy) on the full dataset with the NBM method, replaced emoticons, restored diacritics, and lemma unigrams as features. Although traditional machine learning approaches were superior when compared to the deep learning methods; deep learning demonstrated good results when applied on the small datasets.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - It has been widely speculated that the performance of the next generation based wireless network should meet a transmission speed on the order of 1000 times more than the current cellular communication systems. The frequency bands above 6 GHz have received significant attention lately as a prospective band for next generation 5G systems. The propagation characteristics for 5G networks need to be fully understood for the 5G system design. This paper presents the channel propagation characteristics for a 5G system in line of sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. The diffraction loss (DL) and frequency drop (FD) are investigated based on collected measurement data. Indoor measurement results obtained using a high-resolution channel sounder equipped with directional horn antennas at 3.5 GHz and 28 GHz as a comparative study of the two bands below and above 6 GHz. The parameters for path loss using different path loss models of single and multi-frequencies have been estimated. The excess delay, root mean square (RMS) delay spread and the power delay profile of received paths are analyzed. The results of the path loss models show that the path loss exponent (PLE) in this indoor environment is less than the free space path loss exponent for LOS scenario at both frequencies. Moreover, the PLE is not frequency dependent. The 3GPP path loss models for single and multi-frequency in LOS scenarios have good performance in terms of PLE that is as reliable as the physically-based models. Based on the proposed models, the diffraction loss at 28 GHz is approximately twice the diffraction loss at 3.5 GHz. The findings of the power delay profile and RMS delay spread indicate that these parameters are comparable for frequency bands below and above 6 GHz.

AB  - The integration of renewable energy resources (RES) (such as wind and photovoltaic (PV)) on large or small scales, in addition to small generation units, and individual producers, has led to a large variation in energy production, adding uncertainty to power systems (PS) due to the inherent stochasticity of natural resources. The implementation of demand-side management (DSM) in distribution grids (DGs), enabled by intelligent electrical devices and advanced communication infrastructures, ensures safer and more economical operation, giving more flexibility to the intelligent smart grid (SG), and consequently reducing pollutant emissions. Consumers play an active and key role in modern SG as small producers, using RES or through participation in demand response (DR) programs. In this work, the proposed DSM model follows a two-stage stochastic approach to deal with uncertainties associated with RES (wind and PV) together with demand response aggregators (DRA). Three types of DR strategies offered to consumers are compared. Nine test cases are modeled, simulated, and compared in order to analyze the effects of the different DR strategies. The purpose of this work is to minimize DG operating costs from the Distribution System Operator (DSO) point-of-view, through the analysis of different levels of DRA presence, DR strategies, and price variations.

AB  - The large amount of programmable logic controller (PLC) sensing data has rapidly increased in the manufacturing environment. Therefore, a large data store is necessary for Big Data platforms. In this paper, we propose a Hadoop ecosystem for the support of many features in the manufacturing industry. In this ecosystem, Apache Hadoop and HBase are used as Big Data storage and handle large scale data. In addition, Apache Kafka is used as a data streaming pipeline which contains many configurations and properties that are used to make a better-designed environment and a reliable system, such as Kafka offset and partition, which is used for program scaling purposes. Moreover, Apache Spark closely works with Kafka consumers to create a real-time processing and analysis of the data. Meanwhile, data security is applied in the data transmission phase between the Kafka producers and consumers. Public-key cryptography is performed as a security method which contains public and private keys. Additionally, the public-key is located in the Kafka producer, and the private-key is stored in the Kafka consumer. The integration of these above technologies will enhance the performance and accuracy of data storing, processing, and securing in the manufacturing environment.

AB  - Lack of diversity, and specifically, gender diversity, is one of the key problems that both technological companies and academia are facing these days. Moreover, recent studies show that the number of female students enrolled in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) related disciplines have been decreasing in the last twenty years, while the number of women resigning from technological job positions remains unacceptably high. As members of a higher education institution, we foresee that working towards increasing and retaining the number of female students enrolled in STEM disciplines can help to alleviate part of the challenges faced by women in STEM fields. In this paper, we first review the main barriers and challenges that women encounter in their professional STEM careers through different age stages. Next, we focus on the special case of the information theory field, discussing the potential of gendered innovation, and whether it can be applied in the Information Theory case. The working program developed by the School of Engineering at the University of Valencia (ETSE-UV), Spain, which aims at decreasing the gender diversity gap, is then presented and recommendations for practice are given. This program started in 2011 and it encompasses Bachelor, Master and PhD levels. Four main actions are implemented: Providing institutional encouragement and support, increasing the professional support network, promoting and supporting the leadership, and increasing the visibility of female role models. To assess the impact of these actions, a chi-square test of independence is included to evaluate whether there is a significant effect on the percentage of enrolled female students. The percentage of graduated female students in the information and Communications Technology Field is also positioned with respect to other universities and the Spanish reference value. This analysis establishes that, in part, this program has helped to achieve higher female graduation rates, especially among Bachelor students, as well as increasing the number of top-decision positions held by faculty women.

AB  - This study proposes a mobile positioning method that adopts recurrent neural network algorithms to analyze the received signal strength indications from heterogeneous networks (e.g., cellular networks and Wi-Fi networks) for estimating the locations of mobile stations. The recurrent neural networks with multiple consecutive timestamps can be applied to extract the features of time series data for the improvement of location estimation. In practical experimental environments, there are 4525 records, 59 different base stations, and 582 different Wi-Fi access points detected in Fuzhou University in China. The lower location errors can be obtained by the recurrent neural networks with multiple consecutive timestamps (e.g., two timestamps and three timestamps); from the experimental results, it can be observed that the average error of location estimation was 9.19 m by the proposed mobile positioning method with two timestamps.

AB  - Residential energy consumption accounts for the majority of building energy consumption. Physical factors and technological developments to address this problem have been researched continuously. However, physical improvements have limitations, and there is a paradigm shift towards energy research based on occupant behavior. Furthermore, the rapid increase in the number of single-person households around the world is decreasing residential energy efficiency, which is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. This study prepared a large dataset for analysis based on the Korean Time Use Survey (KTUS), which provides behavioral data for actual occupants of single-person households, and energy usage pattern (EUP) types that were derived through K-modes clustering. The characteristics and energy consumption of each type of household were analyzed, and their relationships were examined. Finally, an EUP-type predictive model, with a prediction rate of 95.0%, was implemented by training a support vector machine, and an energy consumption information model based on a Gaussian process regression was provided. The results of this study provide useful basic data for future research on energy consumption based on the behaviors of occupants, and the method proposed in this study will also be applicable to other regions.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications are required to provide precise measurement functions as feedback for controlling devices. The applications traditionally use polling-based communication protocols. However, in polling-based communication over current industrial wireless network protocols such as ISA100.11a, WirelessHART have difficulty in realizing both scheduled periodic data collection at high success ratio and unpredictable on-demand communications with short latency. In this paper, a polling-based transmission scheme using a network traffic uniformity metric is proposed for IIoT applications. In the proposed scheme, a center node controls the transmission timing of all polling-based communication in accordance with a schedule that is determined by a Genetic Algorithm. Communication of both periodic and unpredictable on-demand data collection are uniformly assigned to solve the above difficulties in the schedule. Simulation results show that network traffic is generated uniformly and a center node can collect periodic data from nodes at high success ratio. The average success probability of periodical data collection is     97.4 %     and the lowest probability is     95.2 %    .
