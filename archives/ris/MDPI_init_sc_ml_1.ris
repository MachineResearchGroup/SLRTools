AB  - Smart cities aim to integrate technological development with different functions/components such as mobility, management of energy, natural resources, water, and the waste cycle, air quality, land use, service network, construction, but also the economy, social participation, increased employment, and citizen safety. It includes a series of coordinated and integrated social, environmental and economic interventions to enhance human capital, reduce environmental impacts and solve ecological emergencies. The holistic approach is particular to smart cities, including several mobility aspects in the main European classifications. In particular, the development of smart cities depends on several factors related to transport supply (i.e., mobility service, infrastructure details, ICT) and demand (socio-demographic aspects), and the size of the city. This paper provides an overview of the development of smart cities by defining a methodology that allows the identification of criteria for determining the optimisation of urban mobility with a particular interest in the development of future autonomous mobility. The analysis of current literature on the concept of smart cities and new mobility technologies made it possible to analyse the compatibility between them and possible criticalities. The definition of criteria lays the groundwork for future research steps focused on the application of multicriteria analysis.

AB  - Citizens are expected to require the growth of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) -based applications to improve public and private services. According to their concept, smart cities seek to improve the efficiency, reliability, and resilience of these services. Consequently, this paper searches for a new vision for resolving problems related to the quick deployment of a wireless sensor network (WSN) by using a sizing model and considering the capacity and coverage of the concentrators. Additionally, three different routing models of these technology resources are presented as alternatives for each WSN deployment to ensure connectivity between smart meters and hubs required for smart metering. On the other hand, these solutions must reduce costs when this type of wireless communication network is deployed. The present work proposes various optimization models that consider the physical and network layers in order to integrate different wireless communication technologies, thus reducing costs in terms of the minimum number of data aggregation points. Using a heterogeneous wireless network can reduce resource costs and energy consumption in comparison to a single cellular technology, as proposed in previous works. This work proposes a sizing model and three different models for routing wireless networks. In each case, constraints are evaluated and can be associated with different real-world scenarios. This document provides an optimization model that encompasses all of the proposed constraints; due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, this would require a heuristic technique.

TI  - Mapping Urban Air Quality from Mobile Sensors Using Spatio-Temporal Geostatistics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 14
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the advancement of technology and the arrival of miniaturized environmental sensors that offer greater performance, the idea of building mobile network sensing for air quality has quickly emerged to increase our knowledge of air pollution in urban environments. However, with these new techniques, the difficulty of building mathematical models capable of aggregating all these data sources in order to provide precise mapping of air quality arises. In this context, we explore the spatio-temporal geostatistics methods as a solution for such a problem and evaluate three different methods: Simple Kriging (SK) in residuals, Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Kriging with External Drift (KED). On average, geostatistical models showed 26.57% improvement in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to the standard Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) technique in interpolating scenarios (27.94% for KED, 26.05% for OK, and 25.71% for SK). The results showed less significant scores in extrapolating scenarios (a 12.22% decrease in the RMSE for geostatisical models compared to IDW). We conclude that univariable geostatistics is suitable for interpolating this type of data but is less appropriate for an extrapolation of non-sampled places since it does not create any information.

TI  - Theft Prediction Model Based on Spatial Clustering to Reflect Spatial Characteristics of Adjacent Lands
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 14
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Previous studies have shown that when a crime occurs, the risk of crime in adjacent areas increases. To reflect this, previous grid-based crime prediction studies combined all the cells surrounding the event location to be predicted for use in model training. However, the actual land is continuous rather than a set of independent cells as in a geographic information system. Because the patterns that occur according to the detailed method of crime vary, it is necessary to reflect the spatial characteristics of the adjacent land in crime prediction. In this study, cells with similar spatial characteristics were classified using the Max-p region model (a spatial clustering technique), and the performance was compared to the existing method using random forest (a tree-based machine learning model). According to the results, the F1 score of the model using spatial clustering increased by approximately 2%. Accordingly, there are differences in the physical environmental factors influenced by the detailed method of crime. The findings reveal that crime involving the same offender is likely to occur around the area of the original crime, indicating that a repeated crime is likely in areas with similar spatial features to the area where the crime occurred.

AB  - This study aimed to identify: (i) the relevant applications based on information technologies and requiring smart cities’ infrastructure to facilitate the mobility of older adults in URBAN SPACES; (ii) the type of data being used by the proposed applications; (iii) the maturity level of these applications; and (iv) the barriers TO their dissemination. An electronic search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases, combining relevant keywords. Then, titles and abstracts were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the full texts of the eligible articles were retrieved and screened for inclusion. A total of 28 articles were included. These articles report smart cities’ applications to facilitate the mobility of older adults using different types of sensing devices. The number of included articles is reduced when compared with the total number of articles related to smart cities, which means that the mobility of older adults it is still a not significant topic within the research on smart cities’. Although most of the included studies aimed the implementation of specific applications, these were still in an early stage of development, without the assessment of potential end-users. This is an important research gap since it makes difficult the creation of market-oriented solutions. Another research gap is the integration of knowledge generated by other research topics related to smart cities and smart mobility. Consequently, important issues (e.g., user privacy, data standardization and integration, Internet of Things implementation, and sensors’ characteristics) were poorly addressed by the included studies.

AB  - Solar cars are energy-sensitive and affected by many factors. In order to achieve optimal energy management of solar cars, it is necessary to comprehensively characterize the energy flow of vehicular components. To model these components which are hard to formulate, this study stimulates a solar car with the digital twin (DT) technology to accurately characterize energy. Based on the hybrid modeling approach combining mechanistic and data-driven technologies, the DT model of a solar car is established with a designed cloud platform server based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to realize data interaction between physical and virtual entities. The DT model is further modified by the offline optimization data of drive motors, and the energy consumption is evaluated with the DT system in the real-world experiment. Specifically, the energy consumption error between the experiment and simulation is less than 5.17%, which suggests that the established DT model can accurately stimulate energy consumption. Generally, this study lays the foundation for subsequent performance optimization research.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - There is a massive growth in malicious software (Malware) development, which causes substantial security threats to individuals and organizations. Cybersecurity researchers makes continuous efforts to defend against these malware risks. This research aims to exploit the significant advantages of Transfer Learning (TL) and Fine-Tuning (FT) methods to introduce efficient malware detection in the context of imbalanced families without the need to apply complex features extraction or data augmentation processes. Therefore, this paper proposes a visualized malware multi-classification framework to avoid false positives and imbalanced datasets’ challenges through using the fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN)-based TL models. The proposed framework comprises eight different FT CNN models including VGG16, AlexNet, DarkNet-53, DenseNet-201, Inception-V3, Places365-GoogleNet, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-V2. First, the binary files of different malware families were transformed into 2D images and then forwarded to the FT CNN models to detect and classify the malware families. The detection and classification performance was examined on a benchmark Malimg imbalanced dataset using different, comprehensive evaluation metrics. The evaluation results prove the FT CNN models’ significance in detecting malware types with high accuracy that reached 99.97% which also outperforms the performance of related machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based malware multi-classification approaches tested on the same malware dataset.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused effects in many sectors, including in businesses and enterprises. The most vulnerable businesses to COVID-19 are micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the business vulnerability of MSMEs in Indonesia using the fuzzy spatial clustering approach. The fuzzy spatial clustering approach had been implemented to analyze the social vulnerability to natural hazards in Indonesia. Moreover, this study proposes the Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) to optimize the Fuzzy Geographically Weighted Clustering (FGWC) in order to cluster the business vulnerability in Indonesia. We performed the data analysis with the dataset from Indonesia’s national socioeconomic and labor force survey (SUSENAS and SAKERNAS). We first compared the performance of FPA with traditional FGWC, as well as several known optimization algorithms in FGWC such as Artificial Bee Colony, Intelligent Firefly Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Gravitational Search Algorithm. Our results showed that FPAFGWC has the best performance in optimizing the FGWC clustering result in the business vulnerability context. We found that almost all of the regions in Indonesia outside Java Island have vulnerable businesses. Meanwhile, in most of Java Island, particularly the JABODETABEK area that is the national economic backbone, businesses are not vulnerable. Based on the results of the study, we provide the recommendation to handle the gap between the number of micro and small enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia.

AB  - A repeatable and deterministic non-random weight initialization method in convolutional layers of neural networks examined with the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FSGM). Using the FSGM approach as a technique to measure the initialization effect with controlled distortions in transferred learning, varying the dataset numerical similarity. The focus is on convolutional layers with induced earlier learning through the use of striped forms for image classification. Which provided a higher performing accuracy in the first epoch, with improvements of between 3–5% in a well known benchmark model, and also ~10% in a color image dataset (MTARSI2), using a dissimilar model architecture. The proposed method is robust to limit optimization approaches like Glorot/Xavier and He initialization. Arguably the approach is within a new category of weight initialization methods, as a number sequence substitution of random numbers, without a tether to the dataset. When examined under the FGSM approach with transferred learning, the proposed method when used with higher distortions (numerically dissimilar datasets), is less compromised against the original cross-validation dataset, at ~31% accuracy instead of ~9%. This is an indication of higher retention of the original fitting in transferred learning.

AB  - COVID-19 is a community-acquired infection with symptoms that resemble those of influenza and bacterial pneumonia. Creating an infection control policy involving isolation, disinfection of surfaces, and identification of contagions is crucial in eradicating such pandemics. Incorporating social distancing could also help stop the spread of community-acquired infections like COVID-19. Social distancing entails maintaining certain distances between people and reducing the frequency of contact between people. Meanwhile, a significant increase in the development of different Internet of Things (IoT) devices has been seen together with cyber-physical systems that connect with physical environments. Machine learning is strengthening current technologies by adding new approaches to quickly and correctly solve problems utilizing this surge of available IoT devices. We propose a new approach using machine learning algorithms for monitoring the risk of COVID-19 in public areas. Extracted features from IoT sensors are used as input for several machine learning algorithms such as decision tree, neural network, naïve Bayes classifier, support vector machine, and random forest to predict the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic and calculate the risk probability of public places. This research aims to find vulnerable populations and reduce the impact of the disease on certain groups using machine learning models. We build a model to calculate and predict the risk factors of populated areas. This model generates automated alerts for security authorities in the case of any abnormal detection. Experimental results show that we have high accuracy with random forest of 97.32%, with decision tree of 94.50%, and with the naïve Bayes classifier of 99.37%. These algorithms indicate great potential for crowd risk prediction in public areas.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - This work deals with the presentation of a spiking neural network as a means for efficiently solving the reduction of dimensionality of data in a nonlinear manner. The underneath neural model, which can be integrated as neuromorphic hardware, becomes suitable for intelligent processing in edge computing within Internet of Things systems. In this sense, to achieve a meaningful performance with a low complexity one-layer spiking neural network, the training phase uses the metaheuristic Artificial Bee Colony algorithm with an objective function from the principals in the machine learning science, namely, the modified Stochastic Neighbor Embedding algorithm. To demonstrate this fact, complex benchmark data were used and the results were compared with those generated by a reference network with continuous-sigmoid neurons. The goal of this work is to demonstrate via numerical experiments another method for training spiking neural networks, where the used optimizer comes from metaheuristics. Therefore, the key issue is defining the objective function, which can relate optimally the information at both sides of the spiking neural network. Certainly, machine learning techniques have advanced in defining efficient loss functions that can become suitable objective function candidates in the metaheuristic training phase. The practicality of these ideas is shown in this article. We use MSE values for evaluating the relative quality of the results and also co-ranking matrices.

TI  - IoT-Enabled Solid Waste Management in Smart Cities

VL  - 4

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm plays a vital role for improving smart city applications by tracking and managing city processes in real-time. One of the most significant issues associated with smart city applications is solid waste management, which has a negative impact on our society’s health and the environment. The traditional waste management process begins with waste created by city residents and disposed of in garbage bins at the source. Municipal department trucks collect garbage and move it to recycling centers on a fixed schedule. Municipalities and waste management companies fail to keep up with outdoor containers, making it impossible to determine when to clean them or when they are full. This work proposes an IoT-enabled solid waste management system for smart cities to overcome the limitations of the traditional waste management systems. The proposed architecture consists of two types of end sensor nodes: PBLMU (Public Bin Level Monitoring Unit) and HBLMU (Home Bin Level Monitoring Unit), which are used to track bins in public and residential areas, respectively. The PBLMUs and HBLMUs measure the unfilled level of the trash bin and its location data, process it, and transmit it to a central monitoring station for storage and analysis. An intelligent Graphical User Interface (GUI) enables the waste collection authority to view and evaluate the unfilled status of each trash bin. To validate the proposed system architecture, the following significant experiments were conducted: (a) Eight trash bins were equipped with PBLMUs and connected to a LoRaWAN network and another eight trash bins were equipped with HBLMUs and connected to a Wi-Fi network. The trash bins were filled with wastes at different levels and the corresponding unfilled levels of every trash bin were monitored through the intelligent GUI. (b) An experimental setup was arranged to measure the sleep current and active current contributions of a PBLMU to estimate its average current consumption. (c) The life expectancy of a PBLMU was estimated as approximately 70 days under hypothetical conditions.

AB  - Ever-changing conditions and emerging new challenges affect the ability of the healthcare sector to survive with the current system, and to maintain its processes effectively. In the healthcare sector, the conservation of the natural resources is being obstructed by insufficient infrastructure for managing residual waste resulting from single-use medical materials, increased energy use, and its environmental burden. In this context, circularity and sustainability concepts have become essential in healthcare to meliorate the sector’s negative impacts on the environment. The main aim of this study is to identify the barriers related to circular economy (CE) in the healthcare sector, apply big data analytics in healthcare, and provide solutions to these barriers. The contribution of this research is the detailed examination of the current healthcare literature about CE adaptation, and a proposal for a big data-enabled solutions framework to barriers to circularity, using fuzzy best-worst Method (BWM) and fuzzy VIKOR. Based on the findings, managerial, policy, and theoretical implementations are recommended to support sustainable development initiatives in the healthcare sector.

TI  - Onboard Real-Time Dense Reconstruction in Large Terrain Scene Using Embedded UAV Platform
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 14
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for remote sensing has the advantages of high flexibility, convenient operation, low cost, and wide application range. It fills the need for rapid acquisition of high-resolution aerial images in modern photogrammetry applications. Due to the insufficient parallaxes and the computation-intensive process, dense real-time reconstruction for large terrain scenes is a considerable challenge. To address these problems, we proposed a novel SLAM-based MVS (Multi-View-Stereo) approach, which can incrementally generate a dense 3D (three-dimensional) model of the terrain by using the continuous image stream during the flight. The pipeline of the proposed methodology starts with pose estimation based on SLAM algorithm. The tracked frames were then selected by a novel scene-adaptive keyframe selection method to construct a sliding window frame-set. This was followed by depth estimation using a flexible search domain approach, which can improve accuracy without increasing the iterate time or memory consumption. The whole system proposed in this study was implemented on the embedded GPU based on an UAV platform. We proposed a highly parallel and memory-efficient CUDA-based depth computing architecture, enabling the system to achieve good real-time performance. The evaluation experiments were carried out in both simulation and real-world environments. A virtual large terrain scene was built using the Gazebo simulator. The simulated UAV equipped with an RGB-D camera was used to obtain synthetic evaluation datasets, which were divided by flight altitudes (800-, 1000-, 1200 m) and terrain height difference (100-, 200-, 300 m). In addition, the system has been extensively tested on various types of real scenes. Comparison with commercial 3D reconstruction software is carried out to evaluate the precision in real-world data. According to the results on the synthetic datasets, over 93.462% of the estimation with absolute error distance of less then 0.9%. In the real-world dataset captured at 800 m flight height, more than 81.27% of our estimated point cloud are less then 5 m difference with the results of Photoscan. All evaluation experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

AB  - The sewerage system is a primary element of a city and is responsible for the congestion of both rain and gray water from homes and industries. It is essential to have a monitoring system and a plan to perform prior expansion in the sewerage management system, to avoid massive disruption. However, there is no monitoring system in several overpopulated cities in the world, and the expansion process faces myriad difficulties and takes much time. This paper presents a model for an intelligent sewerage management system that provides real-time monitoring without any major changes to the previous system, using water sensors, a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) module, and a micro-controller. The condition of the sewerage acts as an input through the sensors; then, the microcontroller stores the value in the cloud and performs waste collection depending on the current situation. Meanwhile, after processing, the information reaches the monitoring system. Various trial installations of the proposed system have shown that it enables real-time monitoring to observe live conditions and helps to prevent sewerage blockage caused by solid waste. Considering a deficient cost model, this system can intensify the performance of poorly managed sewerage systems.

AB  - Many countries are contemplating a smart sustainable approach to the next generation of cities. However, there are many obstacles to achieve this objective, such as planning and implementing sustainable dimensions. The aim of this study is to (1) investigate the level of importance of the different sustainable dimensions in Riyadh and (2) distinguish the effect of two proposed solutions on dimensions for a smart approach to rank the proposed solutions based on their level of impact in Riyadh. In this study, the sustainability dimensions are six main measurable criteria that include Smart Economy, Smart Mobility, Smart Environment, Smart People, Smart Governance, and Smart Living. The research also utilized a multi-step methodology that involved an expert-based survey and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) to assess the performance indices of components for a smart method in Riyadh and evaluate the proposed solutions, namely, the construction of a metro network to link all of Riyadh to align with the government objective for 2030, and encouraging the construction of smart buildings through Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. The results show that Smart People, Smart Mobility, and Smart Living were the three most important sustainable indices for Riyadh. Furthermore, the results of the proposed construction projects illustrate that both projects had the same impact on five of the six sustainable indices, but that the metro project had a significantly higher impact on one of the indices. The study is also envisaged to aid decision-makers in prioritizing the upcoming public construction projects. Finally, this is the first study of its kind to address ranking real public construction projects in terms of sustainable development.

AB  - Crowd size estimation is a challenging problem, especially when the crowd is spread over a significant geographical area. It has applications in monitoring of rallies and demonstrations and in calculating the assistance requirements in humanitarian disasters. Therefore, accomplishing a crowd surveillance system for large crowds constitutes a significant issue. UAV-based techniques are an appealing choice for crowd estimation over a large region, but they present a variety of interesting challenges, such as integrating per-frame estimates through a video without counting individuals twice. Large quantities of annotated training data are required to design, train, and test such a system. In this paper, we have first reviewed several crowd estimation techniques, existing crowd simulators and data sets available for crowd analysis. Later, we have described a simulation system to provide such data, avoiding the need for tedious and error-prone manual annotation. Then, we have evaluated synthetic video from the simulator using various existing single-frame crowd estimation techniques. Our findings show that the simulated data can be used to train and test crowd estimation, thereby providing a suitable platform to develop such techniques. We also propose an automated UAV-based 3D crowd estimation system that can be used for approximately static or slow-moving crowds, such as public events, political rallies, and natural or man-made disasters. We evaluate the results by applying our new framework to a variety of scenarios with varying crowd sizes. The proposed system gives promising results using widely accepted metrics including MAE, RMSE, Precision, Recall, and F1 score to validate the results.

AB  - As Internet of Things (IoT) networks expand globally with an annual increase of active devices, providing better safeguards to threats is becoming more prominent. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is the most viable solution that mitigates the threats of cyberattacks. Given the many constraints of the ever-changing network environment of IoT devices, an effective yet lightweight IDS is required to detect cyber anomalies and categorize various cyberattacks. Additionally, most publicly available datasets used for research do not reflect the recent network behaviors, nor are they made from IoT networks. To address these issues, in this paper, we have the following contributions: (1) we create a dataset from IoT networks, namely, the Center for Cyber Defense (CCD) IoT Network Intrusion Dataset V1 (CCD-INID-V1); (2) we propose a hybrid lightweight form of IDS—an embedded model (EM) for feature selection and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for attack detection and classification. The proposed method has two models: (a) RCNN: Random Forest (RF) is combined with CNN and (b) XCNN: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is combined with CNN. RF and XGBoost are the embedded models to reduce less impactful features. (3) We attempt anomaly (binary) classifications and attack-based (multiclass) classifications on CCD-INID-V1 and two other IoT datasets, the detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT dataset (Balot) and the CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 dataset (DoH20), to explore the effectiveness of these learning-based security models. Using RCNN, we achieved an Area under the Receiver Characteristic Operator (ROC) Curve (AUC) score of 0.956 with a runtime of 32.28 s on CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 71.46 s on Balot, and 0.986 with a runtime of 35.45 s on DoH20. Using XCNN, we achieved an AUC score of 0.998 with a runtime of 51.38 s for CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 72.12 s for Balot, and 0.999 with a runtime of 72.91 s for DoH20. Compared to KNN, XCNN required 86.98% less computational time, and RCNN required 91.74% less computational time to achieve equal or better accurate anomaly detections. We find XCNN and RCNN are consistently efficient and handle scalability well; in particular, 1000 times faster than KNN when dealing with a relatively larger dataset-Balot. Finally, we highlight RCNN and XCNN’s ability to accurately detect anomalies with a significant reduction in computational time. This advantage grants flexibility for the IDS placement strategy. Our IDS can be placed at a central server as well as resource-constrained edge devices. Our lightweight IDS requires low train time and hence decreases reaction time to zero-day attacks.

SN  - 2073-431X

AB  - With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, more and more smart devices are connected to the Internet. Since these devices were designed for better connections with each other, very limited security mechanisms have been considered. It would be costly to develop separate security mechanisms for the diverse behaviors in different devices. Given new and changing devices and attacks, it would be helpful if the characteristics of diverse device types could be dynamically learned for better protection. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to device type identification through network traffic analysis for anomaly detection in IoT. Firstly, the characteristics of different device types are learned from their generated network packets using supervised learning methods. Secondly, by learning important features from selected device types, we further compare the effects of unsupervised learning methods including One-class SVM, Isolation forest, and autoencoders for dimensionality reduction. Finally, we evaluate the performance of anomaly detection by transfer learning with autoencoders. In our experiments on real data in the target factory, the best performance of device type identification can be achieved by XGBoost with an accuracy of 97.6%. When adopting autoencoders for learning features from the network packets in Modbus TCP protocol, the best F1 score of 98.36% can be achieved. Comparable performance of anomaly detection can be achieved when using autoencoders for transfer learning from the reference dataset in the literature to our target site. This shows the potential of the proposed approach for automatic anomaly detection in smart factories. Further investigation is needed to verify the proposed approach using different types of devices in different IoT environments.

AB  - Over recent years, massive open online courses (MOOCs) have gained increasing popularity in the field of online education. Students with different needs and learning specificities are able to attend a wide range of specialized online courses offered by universities and educational institutions. As a result, large amounts of data regarding students’ demographic characteristics, activity patterns, and learning performances are generated and stored in institutional repositories on a daily basis. Unfortunately, a key issue in MOOCs is low completion rates, which directly affect student success. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for educational institutions and faculty members to find more effective practices and reduce non-completer ratios. In this context, the main purpose of the present study is to employ a plethora of state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting student dropout in a MOOC for smart city professionals at an early stage. The experimental results show that accuracy exceeds 96% based on data collected during the first week of the course, thus enabling effective intervention strategies and support actions.

AB  - Sustainable development can be attained at a microlevel and having smart campuses around the world presents an opportunity to achieve city-wide smartness. In the process of attaining smartness on campuses, the elements requiring attention must be investigated. There are many publications on smart campuses, and this investigation used the bibliometric analysis method to identify such publications produced over the last decade. A matrix of 578 nodes and 3217 edges was developed from 285 publications on smart campus construction and procurement. Fifteen cluster themes were produced from the bibliometric analysis. The findings revealed that China contributed 48.4% of all published articles on the smart campus. The findings presented a framework from the cluster themes under the four broad infrastructure areas of building construction or repurposing, technology and IT network, continuous improvement, and smart learning and teaching management. The implications of the findings identified that IT project management, traditional procurement strategy, and standard forms of contracts such as the New Engineering Contract (NEC) and the Joint Contract Tribunal (JCT) are applicable in the procurement of smart cities.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The world is moving rapidly from carbon-producing vehicles to green transportation systems. Electric vehicles (EV) are a big step towards a friendly mode of transport. With the constant rise in the number of electric vehicles, we need a widespread and seamless charging infrastructure that supports seamless charging and billing. Some users generate electricity using solar panels and charge their electric vehicles. In contrast, some use charging stations, and they pay for vehicle charging. This raises the question of trust and transparency. There are many countries where laws are not strictly enforced to prevent fraud in payment systems. One of the preeminent problems presently existing with any of the trading systems is the lack of transparency. The service provider can overcharge the customer. Blockchain is a modern-day solution that mitigates trust and privacy issues. We have proposed a peer-to-peer energy trading and charging payment system for electric vehicles based on blockchain technology. Users who have excess electricity which they can sell to the charging stations through smart contracts. Electric vehicle users can pay the charging bills through electronic wallets. We have developed the electric vehicle’s automatic-payment system using the open-source platform Hyperledger fabric. The proposed system will reduce human interaction and increase trust, transparency, and privacy among EV participants. We have analyzed the resource utilization and also performed average transaction latency and throughput evaluation. This system can be helpful for the policymakers of smart cities.

AB  - The relevance of this study is determined by the need to develop technologies for effective urban systems management and resolution of urban planning conflicts. The paper presents an algorithm for analyzing urban planning conflicts. The material for the study was data from social networks, microblogging, blogs, instant messaging, forums, reviews, video hosting services, thematic portals, online media, print media and TV related to the construction of the North-Eastern Chord (NEC) in Moscow (RF). To analyze the content of social media, a multimodal approach was used. The paper presents the results of research on the development of methods and approaches for constructing mathematical and neural network models for analyzing the social media users’ perceptions based on their digital footprints. Artificial neural networks, differential equations, and mathematical statistics were involved in building the models. Differential equations of dynamic systems were based on observations enabled by machine learning. Mathematical models were developed to quickly detect, prevent, and address conflicts in urban planning in order to manage urban systems efficiently. In combination with mathematical and neural network model the developed approaches, made it possible to draw a conclusion about the tense situation around the construction of the NEC, identify complaints of residents to constructors and city authorities, and propose recommendations to resolve and prevent conflicts. Research data could be of use in solving similar problems in sociology, ecology, and economics.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Since its emergence in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has swept through many cities around the world, claiming millions of lives and causing major socio-economic impacts. The pandemic occurred at an important historical juncture when smart solutions and technologies have become ubiquitous in many cities. Against this background, in this review, we examine how smart city solutions and technologies have contributed to resilience by enhancing planning, absorption, recovery, and adaptation abilities. For this purpose, we reviewed 147 studies that have discussed issues related to the use of smart solutions and technologies during the pandemic. The results were synthesized under four themes, namely, planning and preparation, absorption, recovery, and adaptation. This review shows that investment in smart city initiatives can enhance the planning and preparation ability. In addition, the adoption of smart solutions and technologies can, among other things, enhance the capacity of cities to predict pandemic patterns, facilitate an integrated and timely response, minimize or postpone transmission of the virus, provide support to overstretched sectors, minimize supply chain disruption, ensure continuity of basic services, and offer solutions for optimizing city operations. These are promising results that demonstrate the utility of smart solutions for enhancing resilience. However, it should be noted that realizing this potential hinges on careful attention to important issues and challenges related to privacy and security, access to open-source data, technological affordance, legal barriers, technological feasibility, and citizen engagement. Despite this, this review shows that further development of smart city initiatives can provide unprecedented opportunities for enhancing resilience to the pandemic and similar future events.

AB  - The rapid development and widespread use of information and telecommunication technologies do not mitigate, in many situations, information exclusion, nor the physical isolation of people—mainly that of the elderly living in remote locations, whose mobile network coverage is deficient or non-existent, preventing them from accessing health care, be it routine follow-up procedures or emergencies. Addressing this, we raise the question that guides our study: how can we monitor the elderly’s residence and health conditions, detect falls, and track their movement in the vicinity of their homes in a non-intrusive manner? To answer this question, we present a system prototype that uses affordable, low-cost, and low-energy equipment with media and data processing, supported by LoRa (Long Range) and ESP32 microcontrollers, coupling several sensors. As a result, it is possible to monitor sensors that predict and detect falls or other risk events for the user, e.g., fire, with authorized persons and entities, family members, civil protection, and security forces accessing the gathered data, assuring their security. We conclude that the system could decisively improve people’s quality of life, particularly those of the elderly who live in remote places with greater vulnerability.

TI  - Using Machine Learning to Predict Retrofit Effects for a Commercial Building Portfolio

VL  - 14
IS  - 14
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Buildings account for 40% of the energy consumption and 31% of the CO2 emissions in the United States. Energy retrofits of existing buildings provide an effective means to reduce building consumption and carbon footprints. A key step in retrofit planning is to predict the effect of various potential retrofits on energy consumption. Decision-makers currently look to simulation-based tools for detailed assessments of a large range of retrofit options. However, simulations often require detailed building characteristic inputs, high expertise, and extensive computational power, presenting challenges for considering portfolios of buildings or evaluating large-scale policy proposals. Data-driven methods offer an alternative approach to retrofit analysis that could be more easily applied to portfolio-wide retrofit plans. However, current applications focus heavily on evaluating past retrofits, providing little decision support for future retrofits. This paper uses data from a portfolio of 550 federal buildings and demonstrates a data-driven approach to generalizing the heterogeneous treatment effect of past retrofits to predict future savings potential for assisting retrofit planning. The main findings include the following: (1) There is high variation in the predicted savings across retrofitted buildings, (2) GSALink, a dashboard tool and fault detection system, commissioning, and HVAC investments had the highest average savings among the six actions analyzed; and (3) by targeting high savers, there is a 110–300 billion Btu improvement potential for the portfolio in site energy savings (the equivalent of 12–32% of the portfolio-total site energy consumption).

PY  - 2021

IS  - 14
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Numerous reviews are posted every day on travel information sharing platforms and sites. Hotels want to develop a customer recommender system to quickly and effectively identify potential target customers. TripAdvisor, the travel website that provided the data used in this study, allows customers to rate the hotel based on six criteria: Value, Service, Location, Room, Cleanliness, and Sleep Quality. Existing studies classify reviews into positive, negative, and neutral by extracting sentiment terms through simple sentimental analysis. However, this method has limitations in that it does not consider various aspects of hotels well. Therefore, this study performs fine-tuning the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model using review data with rating labels on the TripAdvisor site. This study suggests a multi-criteria recommender system to recommend a suitable target customers for the hotel. As the rating values of six criteria of TripAdvisor are insufficient, the proposed recommender system uses fine-tuned BERT to predict six criteria ratings. Based on this predicted ratings, a multi-criteria recommender system recommends personalized Top-N customers for each hotel. The performance of the multi-criteria recommender system suggested in this study is better than that of the benchmark system, a single-criteria recommender system using overall ratings.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - As automated vehicles have been considered one of the important trends in intelligent transportation systems, various research is being conducted to enhance their safety. In particular, the importance of technologies for the design of preventive automated driving systems, such as detection of surrounding objects and estimation of distance between vehicles. Object detection is mainly performed through cameras and LiDAR, but due to the cost and limits of LiDAR’s recognition distance, the need to improve Camera recognition technique, which is relatively convenient for commercialization, is increasing. This study learned convolutional neural network (CNN)-based faster regions with CNN (Faster R-CNN) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) V2 to improve the recognition techniques of vehicle-mounted monocular cameras for the design of preventive automated driving systems, recognizing surrounding vehicles in black box highway driving videos and estimating distances from surrounding vehicles through more suitable models for automated driving systems. Moreover, we learned the PASCAL visual object classes (VOC) dataset for model comparison. Faster R-CNN showed similar accuracy, with a mean average precision (mAP) of 76.4 to YOLO with a mAP of 78.6, but with a Frame Per Second (FPS) of 5, showing slower processing speed than YOLO V2 with an FPS of 40, and a Faster R-CNN, which we had difficulty detecting. As a result, YOLO V2, which shows better performance in accuracy and processing speed, was determined to be a more suitable model for automated driving systems, further progressing in estimating the distance between vehicles. For distance estimation, we conducted coordinate value conversion through camera calibration and perspective transform, set the threshold to 0.7, and performed object detection and distance estimation, showing more than 80% accuracy for near-distance vehicles. Through this study, it is believed that it will be able to help prevent accidents in automated vehicles, and it is expected that additional research will provide various accident prevention alternatives such as calculating and securing appropriate safety distances, depending on the vehicle types.

AB  - Information security is considered one of the most important issues in various infrastructures related to the field of data communication where most of the modern studies focus on finding effective and low-weight secure approaches. Digital watermarking is a trend in security techniques that hides data by using data embedding and data extraction processes. Watermarking technology is integrated into different frames without adding an overheard as in the conventional encryption. Therefore, it is efficient to be used in data encryption for applications that run over limited resources such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, different digital watermarking algorithms and approaches are presented. Additionally, watermarking requirements and challenges are illustrated in detail. Moreover, the common architecture of the watermarking system is described. Furthermore, IoT technology and its challenges are highlighted. Finally, the paper provides the motivations, objectives and applications of the recent secure watermarking techniques in IoT and summarises them into one table. In addition, the paper highlights the potential to apply the modified watermark algorithms to secure IoT networks.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a real-time cloud-based in-vehicle air quality monitoring system that enables the prediction of the current and future cabin air quality. The designed system provides predictive analytics using machine learning algorithms that can measure the drivers’ drowsiness and fatigue based on the air quality presented in the cabin car. It consists of five sensors that measure the level of CO2, particulate matter, vehicle speed, temperature, and humidity. Data from these sensors were collected in real-time from the vehicle cabin and stored in the cloud database. A predictive model using multilayer perceptron, support vector regression, and linear regression was developed to analyze the data and predict the future condition of in-vehicle air quality. The performance of these models was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and coefficient of determination (R2). The results showed that the support vector regression achieved excellent performance with the highest linearity between the predicted and actual data with an R2 of 0.9981.

IS  - 15
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Agenda 2030 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 and 11 recognizes tourism as one of the central industries to global development to tackle global challenges. With the transformation of information and communication technologies (ICT), e-tourism has evolved globally to establish commercial relationships using the Internet for offering tourism-related products, including giving personalised suggestions. The contextual suggestion has emerged as a modified recommendation system that is integrated with information-retrieval techniques within large databases to provide tourists with a list of suggestions based on contexts, such as location, time of day, or day of the week (weekdays or weekends). This study surveyed literature in the field of contextual suggestion and recommendation systems with a focus on e-tourism. The concerns linked with approaches used in contextual suggestion and recommendation systems are highlighted in this systematic review, while motivations, recommendations, and practical implications in e-tourism are also discussed in this paper. A query search using the keywords “contextual suggestion system”, “recommendation system”, and “tourism” identified 143 relevant articles published from 2012 to 2020. Four major repositories are considered for searching, namely, (i) Science Direct, (ii) Scopus, (iii) IEEE, and (iv) Web of Science. This review was carried out under the protocols of four phases, namely, (i) query searching in major article repositories, (ii) removal of duplicates, (iii) scan of title and abstract, and (iv) complete reading of articles. To identify the gaps in current research, a taxonomy analysis was exemplified into categories and subcategories. The main categories were highlighted as (i) review articles, (ii) model/framework, and (iii) applications. Critical analysis was carried out on the basis of the available literature on the limitations of approaches used in contextual suggestion and recommendation systems. In conclusion, the approaches used are mainly based on content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, preference-based product ranking, and language modelling. The evaluation measures for the contextual suggestion system include precision, normalized discounted cumulative, and mean reciprocal rank, while test collections comprise Internet resources. Given that the tourism industry contributed to the environmental and social-economic development, contextual suggestion and recommendation systems have presented themselves to be relevant in integrating and achieving SDG 9 and SDG 11 in many ways such as web-based e-services by the government sector and smart gadgets based on reliable and real-time data and information for city planners as well as law enforcement personnel in a sustainable city.

AB  - COVID-19 shocked cities around the world and revealed the vulnerability of urban lives and functions. Most cities experienced a catastrophic disturbance that has lasted for a long time. Planning plays a critical role in responding efficiently to this crisis and enabling rapid functional recovery in the post-disaster era. Cities that have implemented digitalization initiatives and programs are likely to have more capacity to react appropriately. Specifically, digitalized cities could ensure the well-being of their residents and maintain continuity of urban functions. This research aims to analyze the role of technology in crisis management in the last two decades and provide appropriate policy recommendations for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Systematic literature review and subjective content analysis are employed to investigate the effects of technology on community well-being and making cities more resilient in past crises. This study shows that different technology-driven policies and actions enable crisis management, enhance community well-being, and increase urban resilience. Technology has enhanced coping and recovery capacities by increasing participation and social connectedness, enhancing physical and mental health and maintaining the functionality of education and economic systems. These have been achieved through various solutions and technologies such as social media, telehealth, tracking and monitoring systems, sensors and locational applications, teleworking systems, etc. These solutions and technologies have also been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance community well-being and sustain urban functions. However, technology deployment might have adverse effects such as social exclusion, digital divide, privacy and confidentiality violation, political bias and misinformation dissemination, and inefficient remote working and education. It is suggested that to mitigate these side effects, policymakers should liberate the process of digitalization, increase the accessibility to digital services, and enhance digital literacy.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Research on flourishing public bike-sharing systems has been widely discussed in recent years. In these studies, many existing works focus on accurately predicting individual stations in a short time. This work, therefore, aims to predict long-term bike rental/drop-off demands at given bike station locations in the expansion areas. The real-world bike stations are mainly built-in batches for expansion areas. To address the problem, we propose LDA (Long-Term Demand Advisor), a framework to estimate the long-term characteristics of newly established stations. In LDA, several engineering strategies are proposed to extract discriminative and representative features for long-term demands. Moreover, for original and newly established stations, we propose several feature extraction methods and an algorithm to model the correlations between urban dynamics and long-term demands. Our work is the first to address the long-term demand of new stations, providing the government with a tool to pre-evaluate the bike flow of new stations before deployment; this can avoid wasting resources such as personnel expense or budget. We evaluate real-world data from New York City’s bike-sharing system, and show that our LDA framework outperforms baseline approaches.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - In 2015, Taiwan’s government announced the “Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act”, the goal of which was a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050, compared with 2005. The residential and commercial sectors produce approximately one third of all carbon emissions in Taiwan, and the number of construction renovation projects is much larger than that of new construction projects. In this paper, we considered the life-cycle CO2 (LCCO2) of a building envelope renovation project in Tainan and focused on local construction methods for typical row houses. The LCCO2 of 744 cases with various climate zones, orientations, and insulation and glazing types was calculated via EnergyPlus, SimaPro, and a local database (LCBA database), and the results were then used to develop a machine learning model. Our findings showed that the machine learning model was capable of predicting annual energy consumption and LCCO2. With regard to annual energy consumption, the RMSE was 227.09 kW·h (per year) and the R2 was 0.992. For LCCO2, the RMSE was 2792.47 kgCO2eq and the R2 was 0.989, which indicates a high-confidence process for decision making in the early stages of building design and renovation.

AB  - The envisioned smart city domains are expected to rely heavily on artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) approaches for their operations, where the basic ingredient is data. Privacy of the data and training time have been major roadblocks to achieving the specific goals of each application domain. Policy makers, the research community, and the industrial sector have been putting their efforts into addressing these issues. Federated learning, with its distributed and local training approach, stands out as a potential solution to these challenges. In this article, we discuss the potential interplay of different technologies and AI for achieving the required features of future smart city services. Having discussed a few use-cases for future eHealth, we list design goals and technical requirements of the enabling technologies. The paper confines its focus on federated learning. After providing the tutorial on federated learning, we analyze the Federated Learning research literature. We also highlight the challenges. A solution sketch and high-level research directions may be instrumental in addressing the challenges.

TI  - Integrating Inland and Coastal Water Quality Data for Actionable Knowledge

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Water quality measures for inland and coastal waters are available as discrete samples from professional and volunteer water quality monitoring programs and higher-frequency, near-continuous data from automated in situ sensors. Water quality parameters also are estimated from model outputs and remote sensing. The integration of these data, via data assimilation, can result in a more holistic characterization of these highly dynamic ecosystems, and consequently improve water resource management. It is becoming common to see combinations of these data applied to answer relevant scientific questions. Yet, methods for scaling water quality data across regions and beyond, to provide actionable knowledge for stakeholders, have emerged only recently, particularly with the availability of satellite data now providing global coverage at high spatial resolution. In this paper, data sources and existing data integration frameworks are reviewed to give an overview of the present status and identify the gaps in existing frameworks. We propose an integration framework to provide information to user communities through the the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) AquaWatch Initiative. This aims to develop and build the global capacity and utility of water quality data, products, and information to support equitable and inclusive access for water resource management, policy and decision making.

TI  - Does Environment Matter in Smart Revitalization Strategies? Management towards Sustainable Urban Regeneration Programs in Poland

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 15
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The article presents the course of the evolution of the concept of urban renewal’s emergence into its current, mature, integrated form of sustainable regeneration (sustainable urban regeneration—SUR). We present how the determination of renewal areas and its goals began to be based on particular indicators, and how the importance of these analyses gradually increased in managing the implementation of urban regeneration programs. Analytical techniques using GIS were used in the analyses of the differentiation of crisis phenomena inside cities before they became popular in smart city tools. Despite the wide use of GIS to analyze the diversity of crisis phenomena within the city, the availability of data means that different spheres are characterized with different accuracy. Starting from the significance of individual spheres, the focus has primarily been on the environment, which is underappreciated in Poland. Municipalities (urban, rural, urban–rural) with regeneration programs do not perceive negative environmental phenomena as significant in assessing a crisis in a degraded area. Nevertheless, municipalities that do analyze environmental issues in regeneration programs also see the need for action and implementation of projects in the environmental sphere. In order to verify the hypothesis, the Statistics Poland (formerly known in English as the Central Statistical Office; Polish: Główny Urząd Statystyczny, abbreviated and known as GUS) data on the regeneration process was analyzed, with reference to the relationships between renewal areas and the natural environment. In order to check these dependencies (or the lack thereof), the Yule φ coefficient and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient were used. As a result, this study showed that analysis of the level and degree of degradation of the environmental sphere is not carried out frequently enough in municipalities. Secondly, the difficulties of municipalities, especially small ones (urban-rural and rural), in their analysis of the environmental sphere are the result of poor data availability. Thirdly, it is noted that there is a relationship between the designation of environmental zones and the type of municipality. This is of particular importance for the enhancement of smart city tools for the regeneration of existing cities, esp. small ones.

TI  - Optimizing the Performance of Pure ALOHA for LoRa-Based ESL
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 15
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - (1) Background: The scientific development in the field of industrialization demands the automization of electronic shelf labels (ESLs). COVID-19 has limited the manpower responsible for the frequent updating of the ESL system. The current ESL uses QR (quick response) codes, NFC (near-field communication), and RFID (radio-frequency identification). These technologies have a short range or need more manpower. LoRa is one of the prominent contenders in this category as it provides long-range connectivity with less energy harvesting and location tracking. It uses many gateways (GWs) to transmit the same data packet to a node, which causes collision at the receiver side. The restriction of the duty cycle (DC) and dependency of acknowledgment makes it unsuitable for use by the common person. The maximum efficiency of pure ALOHA is 18.4%, while that of slotted ALOHA is 36.8%, which makes LoRa unsuitable for industrial use. It can be used for applications that need a low data rate, i.e., up to approximately 27 Kbps. The ALOHA mechanism can cause inefficiency by not eliminating fast saturation even with the increasing number of gateways. The increasing number of gateways can only improve the global performance for generating packets with Poisson law having a uniform distribution of payload of 1~51 bytes. The maximum expected channel capacity usage is similar to the pure ALOHA throughput. (2) Methods: In this paper, the improved ALOHA mechanism is used, which is based on the orthogonal combination of spreading factor (SF) and bandwidth (BW), to maximize the throughput of LoRa for ESL. The varying distances (D) of the end nodes (ENs) are arranged based on the K-means machine learning algorithm (MLA) using the parameter selection principle of ISM (industrial, scientific and medical) regulation with a 1% DC for transmission to minimize the saturation. (3) Results: The performance of the improved ALOHA degraded with the increasing number of SFs and as well ENs. However, after using K-mapping, the network changes and the different number of gateways had a greater impact on the probability of successful transmission. The saturation decreased from 57% to 1~2% by using MLA. The RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) plays a key role in determining the exact position of the ENs, which helps to improve the possibility of successful transmission and synchronization at higher BW (250 kHz). In addition, a high BW has lower energy consumption than a low BW at the same DC with a double-bit rate and almost half the ToA (time on-air).

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Blockchain networks are based on cryptographic notions that include asymmetric-key encryption, hash functions and consensus protocols. Despite their popularity, mainstream protocols, such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake still have drawbacks. Efforts to enhance these protocols led to the birth of alternative consensus protocols, catering to specific areas, such as medicine or transportation. These protocols remain relatively unknown despite having unique merits worth investigating. Although past reviews have been published on popular blockchain consensus protocols, they do not include most of these lesser-known protocols. Highlighting these alternative consensus protocols contributes toward the advancement of the state of the art, as they have design features that may be useful to academics, blockchain practitioners and researchers. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing an overview of alternative consensus protocols proposed within the past 3 years. We evaluate their overall performance based on metrics such as throughput, scalability, security, energy consumption, and finality. In our review, we examine the trade-offs that these consensus protocols have made in their attempts to optimize scalability and performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that focuses on these alternative protocols, highlighting their unique features that can be used to develop future consensus protocols.

AB  - The tremendous number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, with their ubiquity, has provided us with unprecedented productivity and simplified our daily life. At the same time, the insecurity of these technologies ensures that our daily lives are surrounded by vulnerable computers, allowing for the launch of multiple attacks via large-scale botnets through the IoT. These attacks have been successful in achieving their heinous objectives. A strong identification strategy is essential to keep devices secured. This paper proposes and implements a model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in IoT networks that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to detect and classify binary and multiclass IoT network data. The proposed model is validated using the BoT-IoT, IoT Network Intrusion, MQTT-IoT-IDS2020, and IoT-23 intrusion detection datasets. Our proposed binary and multiclass classification model achieved an exceptionally high level of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the ongoing efforts for widespread Internet of Things (IoT) adoption, one of the key factors hindering the wide acceptance of IoT is security. Securing IoT networks such as the electric power grid or water supply systems has emerged as a major national and global priority. To address the security issue of IoT, several studies are being carried out that involve the use of, but are not limited to, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and edge/fog computing. Authentication and authorization are crucial aspects of the CIA triad to protect the network from malicious parties. However, existing authorization and authentication schemes are not sufficient for handling security, due to the scale of the IoT networks and the resource-constrained nature of devices. In order to overcome challenges due to various constraints of IoT networks, there is a significant interest in using machine learning techniques to assist in the authentication and authorization process for IoT. In this paper, recent advances in authentication and authorization techniques for IoT networks are reviewed. Based on the review, we present a taxonomy of authentication and authorization schemes in IoT focusing on machine learning-based schemes. Using the presented taxonomy, a thorough analysis is provided of the authentication and authorization (AA) security threats and challenges for IoT. Furthermore, various criteria to achieve a high degree of AA resiliency in IoT implementations to enhance IoT security are evaluated. Lastly, a detailed discussion on open issues, challenges, and future research directions is presented for enabling secure communication among IoT nodes.

AB  - The exponential evolution of technology and the growth of the elderly population are two phenomena that will inevitably interact with increasing frequency in the future. This paper analyses scientific literature as a means of furthering progress in sustainable technology for senior living. We carried out a bibliometric analysis of papers published in this area and compiled by the Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus, examining the main participants and advances in the field from 2000 to the first quarter of 2021. The study describes some interesting research projects addressing three different aspects of older adults’ daily lives—health, daily activities and wellbeing—and policies to promote healthy aging and improve the sustainability of the healthcare system. It also looks at lines of research into transversal characteristics of technology. Our analysis showed that publications mentioning sustainability technologies for older adults have been growing progressively since the 2000s, but that the big increase in the number of research works in this area took place during the period 2016–2021. These more recent works show a tendency to study those factors that improve healthy aging, ensure the social inclusion of the elderly through technology and prolong the time in which they can live independent lives thanks to smart environments. Current research gaps in the literature are also discussed.

AB  - A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical entity, with dynamic, bi-directional links between the physical entity and its corresponding twin in the digital domain. Digital twins are increasingly used today in different industry sectors. Applied to medicine and public health, digital twin technology can drive a much-needed radical transformation of traditional electronic health/medical records (focusing on individuals) and their aggregates (covering populations) to make them ready for a new era of precision (and accuracy) medicine and public health. Digital twins enable learning and discovering new knowledge, new hypothesis generation and testing, and in silico experiments and comparisons. They are poised to play a key role in formulating highly personalised treatments and interventions in the future. This paper provides an overview of the technology’s history and main concepts. A number of application examples of digital twins for personalised medicine, public health, and smart healthy cities are presented, followed by a brief discussion of the key technical and other challenges involved in such applications, including ethical issues that arise when digital twins are applied to model humans.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretically grounded discussion on big data mining for customer insights, as well as to identify and describe a research gap due to the shortcomings in the use of the temporal approach in big data analyzes in scientific literature sources. This article adopts two research methods. The first method is the systematic search in bibliographic repositories aimed at identifying the concepts of big data mining for customer insights. This method has been conducted in four steps: search, selection, analysis, and synthesis. The second research method is the bibliographic verification of the obtained results. The verification consisted of querying the Scopus database with previously identified key phrases and then performing trend analysis on the revealed Scopus results. The main contributions of this study are: (1) to organize knowledge on the role of advanced big data analytics (BDA), mainly big data mining in understanding customer behavior; (2) to indicate the importance of the temporal dimension of customer behavior; and (3) to identify an interesting research gap: mining of temporal big data for a complete picture of customers.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 15
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Software-defined networking (SDN) is an innovative architecture that separates the control plane from the data plane to simplify and speed up the management of large networks. This means the control logic has been moved from the network hardware level to the centralized control management level. Therefore, the use of the OpenFlow Discovery Protocol (OFDP) is one of the most common protocols used to discover the network topology in a data plane and then transmit it to the control plane for management. However, OFDP has various shortcomings in its performance such as exchanging too many messages between both levels (control and data), which in turn increases the load on the SDN-Controller. Additionally, since the application layer depends entirely on the network topologies plotted in the control plane, it is very important to obtain accurate network topology information from data plane. Therefore, after providing background on topology discovery protocols to the reader, we will concentrate on performance issues. The present study identifies and discuss the primary concerns involved in the complex query process, infrastructure, influencing factors, and challenges for the topology discovery process. Furthermore, this paper will present several recent studies that have overcome and enhanced these issues. In addition, open discussion and future work concerning these issues are also discussed.

AB  - From the end of 2019, the world has been facing the threat of COVID-19. It is predicted that, before herd immunity is achieved globally via vaccination, people around the world will have to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic using precautionary steps. This paper suggests a COVID-19 identification and control system that operates in real-time. The proposed system utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) platform to capture users’ time-sensitive symptom information to detect potential cases of coronaviruses early on, to track the clinical measures adopted by survivors, and to gather and examine appropriate data to verify the existence of the virus. There are five key components in the framework: symptom data collection and uploading (via communication technology), a quarantine/isolation center, an information processing core (using artificial intelligent techniques), cloud computing, and visualization to healthcare doctors. This research utilizes eight machine/deep learning techniques—Neural Network, Decision Table, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, OneR, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Dense Neural Network (DNN), and the Long Short-Term Memory technique—to detect coronavirus cases from time-sensitive information. A simulation was performed to verify the eight algorithms, after selecting the relevant symptoms, on real-world COVID-19 data values. The results showed that five of these eight algorithms obtained an accuracy of over 90%. Conclusively, it is shown that real-world symptomatic information would enable these three algorithms to identify potential COVID-19 cases effectively with enhanced accuracy. Additionally, the framework presents responses to treatment for COVID-19 patients.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 15
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A low-cost machine learning (ML) algorithm is proposed and discussed for spatial tracking of unknown, correlated signals in localized, ad-hoc wireless sensor networks. Each sensor is modeled as one neuron and a selected subset of these neurons are called to identify the spatial signal. The algorithm is implemented in two phases of spatial modeling and spatial tracking. The spatial signal is modeled using its M iso-contour lines at levels {ℓj}j=1M and those sensors that their sensor observations are in Δ margin of any of these levels report their sensor observations to the fusion center (FC) for spatial signal reconstruction. In spatial modeling phase, the number of these contour lines, their levels and a proper Δ are identified. In this phase, the algorithm may either use adaptive-weight stochastic gradient or scaled stochastic gradient method to select a proper Δ. Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean is assumed along with the sensor observations. To reduce the observation noise’s effect, each sensor applies moving average filter on its observation to drastically reduce the effect of noise. The modeling performance, the cost and the convergence of the algorithm are discussed based on extensive computer simulations and reasoning. The algorithm is proposed for climate and environmental monitoring. In this paper, the percentage of wireless sensors that initiate a communication attempt is assumed as cost. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed spatial tracking approach is low-cost and can model the spatial signal over time with the same performance as that of spatial modeling.

Due to many victims requiring care within adequate time (e.g., cardiac arrest), improving ARTs is vital. This paper proposes to predict ARTs using machine-learning (ML) techniques, which could be used as a decision-support system by EMS to allow a dynamic selection of ambulance dispatch centers. However, one well-known predictor of ART is the location of the emergency (e.g., if it is urban or rural areas), which is sensitive data because it can reveal who received care and for which reason. Thus, we considered the ‘input perturbation’ setting in the privacy-preserving ML literature, which allows EMS to sanitize each location data independently and, hence, ML models are trained only with sanitized data. In this paper, geo-indistinguishability was applied to sanitize each emergency location data, which is a state-of-the-art formal notion based on differential privacy. To validate our proposals, we used retrospective data of an EMS in France, namely Departmental Fire and Rescue Service of Doubs, and publicly available data (e.g., weather and traffic data). As shown in the results, the sanitization of location data and the perturbation of its associated features (e.g., city, distance) had no considerable impact on predicting ARTs. With these findings, EMSs may prefer using and/or sharing sanitized datasets to avoid possible data leakages, membership inference attacks, or data reconstructions, for example.

TI  - An Efficient Hardware Design for a Low-Latency Traffic Flow Prediction System Using an Online Neural Network

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 16
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in human brains. They are trained in a batch learning mode; hence, the whole training data should be ready before the training task. However, this is not applicable for many real-time applications where data arrive sequentially such as online topic-detection in social communities, traffic flow prediction, etc. In this paper, an efficient hardware implementation of a low-latency online neural network system is proposed for a traffic flow prediction application. The proposed model is implemented with different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict the traffic flow with high accuracy where the Hedge Backpropagation (HBP) model achieves the least mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.001. The proposed system is implemented using floating point and fixed point arithmetics on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) part of the ZedBoard. The implementation is provided using BRAM architecture and distributed memory in FPGA in order to achieve the best trade-off between latency, the consumption of area, and power. Using the fixed point approach, the prediction times using the distributed memory and BRAM architectures are 150 ns and 420 ns, respectively. The area delay product (ADP) of the proposed system is reduced by 17 × compared with the hardware implementation of the latest proposed system in the literature. The execution time of the proposed hardware system is improved by 200 × compared with the software implemented on a dual core Intel i7-7500U CPU at 2.9 GHz. Consequently, the proposed hardware model is faster than the software model and more suitable for time-critical online machine learning models.

AB  - To enhance the forecasting accuracy of daily teleconsultation demand, this study proposes an ensemble hybrid deep learning model. The proposed ensemble CNN attention-based BILSTM model (ECA-BILSTM) combines shallow convolutional neural networks (CNNs), attention mechanisms, and bidirectional long short-term memory (BILSTM). Moreover, additional variables are selected according to the characteristics of teleconsultation demand and added to the inputs of forecasting models. To verify the superiority of ECA-BILSTM and the effectiveness of additional variables, two actual teleconsultation datasets collected in the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC) are used as the experimental data. Results showed that ECA-BILSTMs can significantly outperform corresponding benchmark models. And two key additional variables were identified for teleconsultation demand prediction improvement. Overall, the proposed ECA-BILSTM model with effective additional variables is a feasible promising approach in teleconsultation demand forecasting.

AB  - In the field of strategic marketing, the recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) variables model has been applied for years to determine how solid a database is in terms of spending and customer activity. Retailers almost never obtain data related to their customers beyond their purchase history, and if they do, the information is often out of date. This work presents a new method, based on the fuzzy linguistic 2-tuple model and the definition of product hierarchies, which provides a linguistic interpretability giving business meaning and improving the precision of conventional models. The fuzzy linguistic 2-tuple RFM model, adapted by the product hierarchy thanks to the analytical hierarchical process (AHP), is revealed to be a useful tool for including business criteria, product catalogues and customer insights in the definition of commercial strategies. The result of our method is a complete customer segmentation that enriches the clusters obtained with the traditional fuzzy linguistic 2-tuple RFM model and offers a clear view of customers’ preferences and possible actions to define cross- and up-selling strategies. A real case study based on a worldwide leader in home decoration was developed to guide, step by step, other researchers and marketers. The model was built using the only information that retailers always have: customers’ purchase ticket details.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - A successful application of low-cost 3D cameras in combination with artificial intelligence (AI)-based 3D object detection algorithms to outdoor mobile mapping would offer great potential for numerous mapping, asset inventory, and change detection tasks in the context of smart cities. This paper presents a mobile mapping system mounted on an electric tricycle and a procedure for creating on-street parking statistics, which allow government agencies and policy makers to verify and adjust parking policies in different city districts. Our method combines georeferenced red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) imagery from two low-cost 3D cameras with state-of-the-art 3D object detection algorithms for extracting and mapping parked vehicles. Our investigations demonstrate the suitability of the latest generation of low-cost 3D cameras for real-world outdoor applications with respect to supported ranges, depth measurement accuracy, and robustness under varying lighting conditions. In an evaluation of suitable algorithms for detecting vehicles in the noisy and often incomplete 3D point clouds from RGB-D cameras, the 3D object detection network PointRCNN, which extends region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) to 3D point clouds, clearly outperformed all other candidates. The results of a mapping mission with 313 parking spaces show that our method is capable of reliably detecting parked cars with a precision of 100% and a recall of 97%. It can be applied to unslotted and slotted parking and different parking types including parallel, perpendicular, and angle parking.

AB  - Due to Internet of Things (IoT), it has become easy to surveil the critical regions. Images are important parts of Surveillance Systems, and it is required to protect the images during transmission and storage. These secure surveillance frameworks are required in IoT systems, because any kind of information leakage can thwart the legal system as well as personal privacy. In this paper, a secure surveillance framework for IoT systems is proposed using image encryption. A hyperchaotic map is used to generate the pseudorandom sequences. The initial parameters of the hyperchaotic map are obtained using partial-regeneration-based non-dominated optimization (PRNDO). The permutation and diffusion processes are applied to generate the encrypted images, and the convolution neural network (CNN) can play an essential role in this part. The performance of the proposed framework is assessed by drawing comparisons with competitive techniques based on security parameters. It shows that the proposed framework provides promising results as compared to the existing techniques.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Only recently, smart cities are taking shape, thanks to the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and other similar technologies. Given the high demands placed on advanced technologies such as autonomous driving, cloud data services, and high-precision sensors, smart cities are creating an intelligent transportation environment conducive to the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this context, the use of AVs in transportation is also considered a form of transportation innovation. As a result, AVs are considered more favorable to people interested in new technologies because they appear to be technologically superior. Their association with the most up-to-date technology can serve as a symbol for those who wish to demonstrate their interest in new technologies through their appearance. The positive image of technological innovation projected by AVs may influence their acceptance among technology enthusiasts to a significant degree. In this context, this study investigates the effects of perceived advantage, perceived risk, and perceived safety on the intention to use autonomous vehicles. For this purpose, data were collected from vehicle users living in Turkey by survey method. Secondly, factor analyses and regression analyses were performed with the data set obtained from 611 participants. As a result of the analyses, it has been determined that the perceived advantage and perceived security increase the intention to use autonomous vehicles. In contrast, the perceived risk reduces this intention to use. According to these results, recommendations were made to the companies about the level of acceptance of this technology by the users to assess their investments in autonomous vehicles better.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Constant monitoring of road traffic is important part of modern smart city systems. The proposed method estimates average speed of road vehicles in the observation period, using a passive acoustic vector sensor. Speed estimation based on sound intensity analysis is a novel approach to the described problem. Sound intensity in two orthogonal axes is measured with a sensor placed alongside the road. Position of the apparent sound source when a vehicle passes by the sensor is estimated by means of sound intensity analysis in three frequency bands: 1 kHz, 2 kHz and 4 kHz. The position signals calculated for each vehicle are averaged in the analysis time frames, and the average speed estimate is calculated using a linear regression. The proposed method was validated in two experiments, one with controlled vehicle speed and another with real, unrestricted traffic. The calculated speed estimates were compared with the reference lidar and radar sensors. Average estimation error from all experiment was 1.4% and the maximum error was 3.2%. The results confirm that the proposed method allow for estimation of time-averaged road traffic speed with accuracy sufficient for gathering traffic statistics, e.g., in a smart city monitoring station.

AB  - The Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) industry is generally slow in adopting emerging technologies, and such hesitance invariably restricts performance improvements. A plethora of studies have focused on the barriers, Critical Success Factors (CSFs), lifecycle and drivers independently, but none have explored the impact of BIM drivers and awareness on the project lifecycle. This study empirically explored the impact of BIM drivers and awareness on the project lifecycle using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Initially, a conceptual model was developed from an extensive literature review. Thereafter, the model was tested using primary questionnaire data obtained from 90 construction professionals in Lagos, Nigeria. Emergent findings indicate that Building Information Modelling (BIM) drivers have a high impact on BIM awareness at the operation stage of the project lifecycle. The SEM model has an average R2 value of 23% which is moderate. Consequently, this research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing invaluable insight into the impact of BIM drivers on BIM awareness in the project lifecycle. Knowledge acquired will help industry stakeholders and government to develop appropriate policies to increase BIM uptake within contemporary practice.

TI  - Network Intrusion Detection Based on an Efficient Neural Architecture Search

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Deep learning has been applied in the field of network intrusion detection and has yielded good results. In malicious network traffic classification tasks, many studies have achieved good performance with respect to the accuracy and recall rate of classification through self-designed models. In deep learning, the design of the model architecture greatly influences the results. However, the design of the network model architecture usually requires substantial professional knowledge. At present, the focus of research in the field of traffic monitoring is often directed elsewhere. Therefore, in the classification task of the network intrusion detection field, there is much room for improvement in the design and optimization of the model architecture. A neural architecture search (NAS) can automatically search the architecture of the model under the premise of a given optimization goal. For this reason, we propose a model that can perform NAS in the field of network traffic classification and search for the optimal architecture suitable for traffic detection based on the network traffic dataset. Each layer of our depth model is constructed according to the principle of maximum coding rate attenuation, which has strong consistency and symmetry in structure. Compared with some manually designed network architectures, classification indicators, such as Top-1 accuracy and F1 score, are also greatly improved while ensuring the lightweight nature of the model. In addition, we introduce a surrogate model in the search task. Compared to using the traditional NAS model to search the network traffic classification model, our NAS model greatly improves the search efficiency under the premise of ensuring that the results are not substantially different. We also manually adjust some operations in the search space of the architecture search to find a set of model operations that are more suitable for traffic classification. Finally, we apply the searched model to other traffic datasets to verify the universality of the model. Compared with several common network models in the traffic field, the searched model (NAS-Net) performs better, and the classification effect is more accurate.

AB  - The network session constraints for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications are different and challenging. These constraints necessitates a high level of reconfigurability, so that the system can assess the impact of an event and adjust the network effectively. Software Defined Networking (SDN) in contrast to existing networks segregates the control and data plane to support network configuration which is programmable with smart cities requirement that shows the highest impact on the system but faces the problem of reliability. To address this issue, the SDN-IIoT based load balancing algorithm is proposed in this article and it is not application specific.Quality of service (QoS) aware architecture i.e., SDN-IIoT load balancing scheme is proposed and it deals with load on the servers. Huge load on the servers, makes them vulnerable to halt the system and hence leads to faults which creates the reliability problem for real time applications. In this article, load is migrated from one server to another server, if load on one server is more than threshold value. Load distribution has made the proposed scheme more reliable than already existing schemes. Further, the topology used for the implementation has been designed using POX controller and the results has been evaluated using Mininet emulator with its support in python programming. Lastly, the performance is evaluated based on the various Quality of Service (QoS) metrics; data transmission, response time and CPU utilization which shows that the proposed algorithm has shown 10% improvement over the existing LBBSRT, Random, Round-robin, Heuristic algorithms.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Conventional crop insurance systems are complex and often not economically feasible. Farmers are often reluctant to be covered for their crops due to lack of trust in insurance firms and the fear of delayed or non-payment of claims. In this paper, a blockchain based crop insurance solution is suggested. The solution suggested in this paper is an affordable, efficient, low cost crop insurance solution which will ensure many farmers are insured and benefiting from timely crop insurance. Currently the cost of administering insurance is an essential barrier to accessing this facility. With the proper use of blockchain based on ethereum this expense can be reduced dramatically. We have conducted various tests on platforms such as Google Cloud and found that the least throughput is 165 transactions. Upon analysis we have found that the time taken by the block formation is directly proportional to the timing of processing. The end-to-end average latency of the system was achieved as 31.2 s, which was quite effective for the infrastructure what we are using. Upon conducting acceptance testing, we found that the system suggested in the paper is effective and we are planning to release the application on open source platforms for future improvements.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 16
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The fifth-generation (5G) mobile network services are currently being made available for different use case scenarios like enhanced mobile broadband, ultra-reliable and low latency communication, and massive machine-type communication. The ever-increasing data requests from the users have shifted the communication paradigm to be based on the type of the requested data content or the so-called information-centric networking (ICN). The ICN primarily aims to enhance the performance of the network infrastructure in terms of the stretch to opt for the best routing path. Reduction in stretch merely reduces the end-to-end (E2E) latency to ensure the requirements of the 5G-enabled tactile internet (TI) services. The foremost challenge tackled by the ICN-based system is to minimize the stretch while selecting an optimal routing path. Therefore, in this work, a reinforcement learning-based intelligent stretch optimization (ISO) strategy has been proposed to reduce stretch and obtain an optimal routing path in ICN-based systems for the realization of 5G-enabled TI services. A Q-learning algorithm is utilized to explore and exploit the different routing paths within the ICN infrastructure. The problem is designed as a Markov decision process and solved with the help of the Q-learning algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy finds the optimal routing path for the delay-sensitive haptic-driven services of 5G-enabled TI based upon their stretch profile over ICN, such as the augmented reality /virtual reality applications. Moreover, we compare and evaluate the simulation results of propsoed ISO strategy with random routing strategy and history aware routing protocol (HARP). The proposed ISO strategy reduces 33.33% and 33.69% delay as compared to random routing and HARP, respectively. Thus, the proposed strategy suggests an optimal routing path with lesser stretch to minimize the E2E latency.

AB  - The paper describes the process of designing a simple fiducial marker. The marker is meant for use in augmented reality applications. Unlike other systems, it does not encode any information, but it can be used for obtaining the position, rotation, relative size, and projective transformation. Also, the system works well with motion blur and is resistant to the marker’s imperfections, which could theoretically be drawn only by hand. Previous systems put constraints on colors that need to be used to form the marker. The proposed system works with any saturated color, leading to better blending with the surrounding environment. The marker’s final shape is a rectangular area of a solid color with three lines of a different color going from the center to three corners of the rectangle. Precise detection can be achieved using neural networks, given that the training set is very varied and well designed. A detailed literature review was performed, and no such system was found. Therefore, the proposed design is novel for localization in the spatial scene. The testing proved that the system works well both indoor and outdoor, and the detections are precise.

AB  - The application mode of army mobile communication networks is closely related to combat mission and application environment. Different combat missions and application environments result in different network structures and different service priorities, which requires a semi-automatic system to support the network scheme design. Therefore, evaluating the efficiency of network schemes generated by automatic planning is a problem that needs to be urgently addressed. In the past, researchers have proposed a variety of methods to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile communication systems, most of which are based on simulation methods and ignore the historical data of network usage. This paper studies an effectiveness evaluation method of mobile communication network design schemes and proposes a design scheme for the evaluation and optimization of network plans. Furthermore, the improved method of effectiveness evaluation based on factor analysis is discussed in detail. The method not only effectively uses historical data but also reduces the amount of data collection and calculation. In order to adapt to the preference requirements of different task scenarios, a decision preference setting method based on cluster analysis is proposed, which can render the output optimization result more reasonable and feasible.

IoT-based healthcare systems are considered mission-critical applications whose missing deadlines cause critical situations. For example, in patients with chronic diseases or other fatal diseases, a missed task could lead to fatalities. This study presents a smart patient health monitoring system (PHMS) based on an optimized scheduling mechanism using IoT-tasks orchestration architecture to monitor vital signs data of remote patients. The proposed smart PHMS consists of two core modules: a healthcare task scheduling based on optimization and optimization of healthcare services using a real-time IoT-based task orchestration architecture. First, an optimized time-constraint-aware scheduling mechanism using a real-time IoT-based task orchestration architecture is developed to generate autonomous healthcare tasks and effectively handle the deployment of emergent healthcare tasks. Second, an optimization module is developed to optimize the services of the e-Health industry based on objective functions. Furthermore, our study uses Libelium e-Health toolkit to monitors the physiological data of remote patients continuously. The experimental results reveal that an optimized scheduling mechanism reduces the tasks starvation by 14% and tasks failure by 17% compared to a conventional fair emergency first (FEF) scheduling mechanism. The performance analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, and it suggests that the proposed solution can be an effective and sustainable solution towards monitoring patient’s vital signs data in the IoT-based e-Health domain.

AB  - Twenty-first century infrastructure needs to respond to changing demographics, becoming climate neutral, resilient, and economically affordable, while remaining a driver for development and shared prosperity. However, the infrastructure sector remains one of the least innovative and digitalized, plagued by delays, cost overruns, and benefit shortfalls. The authors assessed trends and barriers in the planning and delivery of infrastructure based on secondary research, qualitative interviews with internationally leading experts, and expert workshops. The analysis concludes that the root-cause of the industry’s problems is the prevailing fragmentation of the infrastructure value chain and a lacking long-term vision for infrastructure. To help overcome these challenges, an integration of the value chain is needed. The authors propose that this could be achieved through a use-case-based, as well as vision and governance-driven creation of federated digital platforms applied to infrastructure projects and outline a concept. Digital platforms enable full-lifecycle participation and responsible governance guided by a shared infrastructure vision. This paper has contributed as policy recommendation to the Group of Twenty (G20) in 2021.

AB  - Energy management and exchange have increasingly shifted from concentrated to hierarchical modes. Numerous issues have arisen in the decentralized energy sector, including the storage of customer data and the need to ensure data integrity, fairness, and accountability in the transaction phase. The problem is that in the field of the innovative technology of blockchain and its applications, with the energy sector still in the developmental stages, there is still a need for more research to understand the full capacity of the technology in the field. The main aim of this work was to investigate the state of the current research of blockchain technologies as well as their application within the field of energy. This work also set out to identify certain research gaps and provide a set of recommendations for future directions. Among these research gaps is the application of blockchain in decentralized storage, the integration of blockchain with artificial intelligence, and security and privacy concerns, which have not received much attention despite their importance. An analysis of fifty-seven carefully reviewed studies revealed that the emerging blockchain which provides privacy-protection technologies in cryptography and other areas that can be integrated to address users’ privacy concerns is another aspect that needs further investigation. Grid operations, economies, and customers will all learn from blockchain technology as it provides disintermediation, confidentiality, and tamper-proof transfers. Moreover, it provides innovative ways for customers and small solar generators to participate more actively in the electricity sector and to benefit from their properties. Blockchains are a rapidly evolving field of research and growth. A study of this emerging technology is necessary to increase comprehension, to educate the body of expertise on blockchains, and to realize its potential. This study recommends that future work investigates the potential application of blockchain in the energy sector as well as the challenges that face its implementation from the perspective of policy makers. This future approach will enable researchers to direct their focus to the case studies approach, which will facilitate and ease the application of blockchain technology.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - To provide more accurate and stable recommendations, it is necessary to combine display information with implicit information and to dig out potential information. Existing methods only consider explicit feedback information or implicit feedback information unilaterally and ignore the potential information of explicit feedback information and implicit feedback information, which is also crucial to the accuracy of the recommendation system. However, the traditional Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN) recommendation ignores the attribute information in the meta-path and the interaction between the user and the item and, instead, only considers the linear characteristics of the user-object often ignoring its non-linear characteristics. Aiming at the potential information acquisition problem from assorted feedback, we propose a new top-N recommendation method MFDNN for Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs). First, we consider explicit and implicit feedback information to determine the potential preferences of users and the potential features of the product. Then, matrix factorization (MF) and a deep neural network (DNN) are fused to learn independent feature embeddings through MF and DNN, and fully considering the linear and non-linear characteristics of the user-object. MFDNN was tested on several real data sets, such as Movie-Lens, and compared with benchmark experiments. MFDNN significantly improved the hit ratio (HR) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). Further research showed that the meta-path bias had an excellent effect on the gain of potential information mining and the fusion of explicit and implicit information in the accuracy and stability of user interest classification.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 16
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are generally considered to be the next generation of engineered systems. However, the actual application of CPSs in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is still at a low level. The sensing method in the construction process plays a very important role in the establishment of CPSs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the application potential of computer vision-based sensing methods and provide practical suggestions through a literature review. This paper provides a review of the current application of CPSs in the AEC industry, summarizes the current knowledge gaps, and discusses the problems with the current construction site sensing approach. Considering the unique advantages of the computer vision (CV) method at the construction site, the application of CV for different construction entities was reviewed and summarized to achieve a CV-based construction site sensing approach for construction process CPSs. The potential of CPS can be further stimulated by providing rich information from on-site sensing using CV methods. According to the review, this approach has unique advantages in the specific environment of the construction site. Based on the current knowledge gap identified in the literature review, this paper proposes a novel concept of visual-based construction site sensing method for CPS application, and an architecture for CV-based CPS is proposed as an implementation of this concept. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a CPS architecture using computer vision as the main information acquisition method based on the literature review. This architecture innovatively introduces computer vision as a sensing method of construction sites, and realizes low-cost and non-invasive information acquisition in complex construction scenarios. This method can be used as an important supplement to on-site sensing to further promote the automation and intelligence of the construction process.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology and provides connectivity among physical objects with the support of 5G communication. In recent decades, there have been a lot of applications based on IoT technology for the sustainability of smart cities, such as farming, e-healthcare, education, smart homes, weather monitoring, etc. These applications communicate in a collaborative manner between embedded IoT devices and systematize daily routine tasks. In the literature, many solutions facilitate remote users to gather the observed data by accessing the stored information on the cloud network and lead to smart systems. However, most of the solutions raise significant research challenges regarding information sharing in mobile IoT networks and must be able to stabilize the performance of smart operations in terms of security and intelligence. Many solutions are based on 5G communication to support high user mobility and increase the connectivity among a huge number of IoT devices. However, such approaches lack user and data privacy against anonymous threats and incur resource costs. In this paper, we present a mobility support 5G architecture with real-time routing for sustainable smart cities that aims to decrease the loss of data against network disconnectivity and increase the reliability for 5G-based public healthcare networks. The proposed architecture firstly establishes a mutual relationship among the nodes and mobile sink with shared secret information and lightweight processing. Secondly, multi-secured levels are proposed to protect the interaction with smart transmission systems by increasing the trust threshold over the insecure channels. The conducted experiments are analyzed, and it is concluded that their performance significantly increases the information sustainability for mobile networks in terms of security and routing.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 16
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The substantial advancements offered by the edge computing has indicated serious evolutionary improvements for the internet of things (IoT) technology. The rigid design philosophy of the traditional network architecture limits its scope to meet future demands. However, information centric networking (ICN) is envisioned as a promising architecture to bridge the huge gaps and maintain IoT networks, mostly referred as ICN-IoT. The edge-enabled ICN-IoT architecture always demands efficient in-network caching techniques for supporting better user’s quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we propose an enhanced ICN-IoT content caching strategy by enabling artificial intelligence (AI)-based collaborative filtering within the edge cloud to support heterogeneous IoT architecture. This collaborative filtering-based content caching strategy would intelligently cache content on edge nodes for traffic management at cloud databases. The evaluations has been conducted to check the performance of the proposed strategy over various benchmark strategies, such as LCE, LCD, CL4M, and ProbCache. The analytical results demonstrate the better performance of our proposed strategy with average gain of 15% for cache hit ratio, 12% reduction in content retrieval delay, and 28% reduced average hop count in comparison to best considered LCD. We believe that the proposed strategy will contribute an effective solution to the related studies in this domain.

AB  - Disasters pose a real threat to the lives and property of citizens; therefore, it is necessary to reduce their impact to the minimum possible. In order to achieve this goal, a framework for enhancing the current disaster management system was proposed, called the smart disaster management system. The smart aspect of this system is due to the application of the principles of information and communication technology, especially the Internet of Things. All participants and activities of the proposed system were clarified by preparing a conceptual design by using The Unified Modeling Language diagrams. This effort was made to overcome the lack of citizens’ readiness towards the use of information and communication technology as well as increase their readiness towards disasters. This study aims to develop conceptual design that can facilitate in development of smart management system for flooding disaster. This will assist in the design process of the Internet of Things systems in this regard.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) workflow applications have been rapidly growing in practice. These internet-based applications can run on the distributed healthcare sensing system, which combines mobile computing, edge computing and cloud computing. Offloading and scheduling are the required methods in the distributed network. However, a security issue exists and it is hard to run different types of tasks (e.g., security, delay-sensitive, and delay-tolerant tasks) of IoMT applications on heterogeneous computing nodes. This work proposes a new healthcare architecture for workflow applications based on heterogeneous computing nodes layers: an application layer, management layer, and resource layer. The goal is to minimize the makespan of all applications. Based on these layers, the work proposes a secure offloading-efficient task scheduling (SEOS) algorithm framework, which includes the deadline division method, task sequencing rules, homomorphic security scheme, initial scheduling, and the variable neighbourhood searching method. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed plans outperform all existing baseline approaches for healthcare applications in terms of makespan.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - IoT technologies enable millions of devices to transmit their sensor data to the external world. The device–object pairing problem arises when a group of Internet of Things is concurrently tracked by cameras and sensors. While cameras view these things as visual “objects”, these things which are equipped with “sensing devices” also continuously report their status. The challenge is that when visualizing these things on videos, their status needs to be placed properly on the screen. This requires correctly pairing visual objects with their sensing devices. There are many real-life examples. Recognizing a vehicle in videos does not imply that we can read its pedometer and fuel meter inside. Recognizing a pet on screen does not mean that we can correctly read its necklace data. In more critical ICU environments, visualizing all patients and showing their physiological signals on screen would greatly relieve nurses’ burdens. The barrier behind this is that the camera may see an object but not be able to see its carried device, not to mention its sensor readings. This paper addresses the device–object pairing problem and presents a multi-camera, multi-IoT device system that enables visualizing a group of people together with their wearable devices’ data and demonstrating the ability to recover the missing bounding box.

AB  - Recently, many companies have adopted smart factories to increase productivity and efficiency. However, the fashion industry is one of the industries that have been relatively slow at embracing automation and switching to a smart factory. The purpose of the study is to suggest the future direction of the low-maturity smart factory in the fashion industry through newspaper analysis. In this study, semantic network analysis and convergence of iterated correlation (CONCOR) analysis were performed on 15,523 news articles. The analyses revealed that the smart fashion factory was developing to incorporate automated, unmanned, and intelligent operation. The problem of job loss owing to the smart factory was also heavily addressed in the news articles. In the newspaper articles, the view that the smart factory is efficient, fast, and innovative, and concerns regarding the possible damages that will result from hacking and machine malfunction were simultaneously expressed. Therefore, if news about security improvement emerges in the future, negative public opinion will be reduced, positively influencing the government’s support for smart factories and policy making.

AB  - Smart cities connect people and places using innovative technologies such as Data Mining (DM), Machine Learning (ML), big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper presents a bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of studies associated with DM technologies used in smart cities applications. The study aims to identify the main DM techniques used in the context of smart cities and how the research field of DM for smart cities evolves over time. We adopted both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the topic. We used the Scopus database to find relative articles published in scientific journals. This study covers 197 articles published over the period from 2013 to 2021. For the bibliometric analysis, we used the Biliometrix library, developed in R. Our findings show that there is a wide range of DM technologies used in every layer of a smart city project. Several ML algorithms, supervised or unsupervised, are adopted for operating the instrumentation, middleware, and application layer. The bibliometric analysis shows that DM for smart cities is a fast-growing scientific field. Scientists from all over the world show a great interest in researching and collaborating on this interdisciplinary scientific field.

TI  - Automating Visual Blockage Classification of Culverts with Deep Learning
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 16
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Blockage of culverts by transported debris materials is reported as the salient contributor in originating urban flash floods. Conventional hydraulic modeling approaches had no success in addressing the problem primarily because of the unavailability of peak floods hydraulic data and the highly non-linear behavior of debris at the culvert. This article explores a new dimension to investigate the issue by proposing the use of intelligent video analytics (IVA) algorithms for extracting blockage related information. The presented research aims to automate the process of manual visual blockage classification of culverts from a maintenance perspective by remotely applying deep learning models. The potential of using existing convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms (i.e., DarkNet53, DenseNet121, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MobileNet, ResNet50, VGG16, EfficientNetB3, NASNet) is investigated over a dataset from three different sources (i.e., images of culvert openings and blockage (ICOB), visual hydrology-lab dataset (VHD), synthetic images of culverts (SIC)) to predict the blockage in a given image. Models were evaluated based on their performance on the test dataset (i.e., accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1 score, Jaccard Index, region of convergence (ROC) curve), floating point operations per second (FLOPs) and response times to process a single test instance. Furthermore, the performance of deep learning models was benchmarked against conventional machine learning algorithms (i.e., SVM, RF, xgboost). In addition, the idea of classifying deep visual features extracted by CNN models (i.e., ResNet50, MobileNet) using conventional machine learning approaches was also implemented in this article. From the results, NASNet was reported most efficient in classifying the blockage images with the 5-fold accuracy of 85%; however, MobileNet was recommended for the hardware implementation because of its improved response time with 5-fold accuracy comparable to NASNet (i.e., 78%). Comparable performance to standard CNN models was achieved for the case where deep visual features were classified using conventional machine learning approaches. False negative (FN) instances, false positive (FP) instances and CNN layers activation suggested that background noise and oversimplified labelling criteria were two contributing factors in the degraded performance of existing CNN algorithms. A framework for partial automation of the visual blockage classification process was proposed, given that none of the existing models was able to achieve high enough accuracy to completely automate the manual process. In addition, a detection-classification pipeline with higher blockage classification accuracy (i.e., 94%) has been proposed as a potential future direction for practical implementation.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Recent technological advancements in geomatics and mobile sensing have led to various urban big data, such as Tencent street view (TSV) photographs; yet, the urban objects in the big dataset have hitherto been inadequately exploited. This paper aims to propose a pedestrian analytics approach named vectors of uncountable and countable objects for clustering and analysis (VUCCA) for processing 530,000 TSV photographs of Hong Kong Island. First, VUCCA transductively adopts two pre-trained deep models to TSV photographs for extracting pedestrians and surrounding pixels into generalizable semantic vectors of features, including uncountable objects such as vegetation, sky, paved pedestrian path, and guardrail and countable objects such as cars, trucks, pedestrians, city animals, and traffic lights. Then, the extracted pedestrians are semantically clustered using the vectors, e.g., for understanding where they usually stand. Third, pedestrians are semantically indexed using relations and activities (e.g., walking behind a guardrail, road-crossing, carrying a backpack, or walking a pet) for queries of unstructured photographic instances or natural language clauses. The experiment results showed that the pedestrians detected in the TSV photographs were successfully clustered into meaningful groups and indexed by the semantic vectors. The presented VUCCA can enrich eye-level urban features into computational semantic vectors for pedestrians to enable smart city research in urban geography, urban planning, real estate, transportation, conservation, and other disciplines.

AB  - The provision of high data rate services to mobile users combined with improved quality of experience (i.e., zero latency multimedia content) drives technological evolution towards the design and implementation of fifth generation (5G) broadband wireless networks. To this end, a dynamic network design approach is adopted whereby network topology is configured according to service demands. In parallel, many private companies are interested in developing their own 5G networks, also referred to as non-public networks (NPNs), since this deployment is expected to leverage holistic production monitoring and support critical applications. In this context, this paper introduces a 5G NPN architectural approach, supporting among others various key enabling technologies, such as cell densification, disaggregated RAN with open interfaces, edge computing, and AI/ML-based network optimization. In the same framework, potential applications of our proposed approach in real world scenarios (e.g., support of mission critical services and computer vision analytics for emergencies) are described. Finally, scalability issues are also highlighted since a deployment framework of our architectural design in an additional real-world scenario related to Industry 4.0 (smart manufacturing) is also analyzed.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - Many smart city and society applications such as smart health (elderly care, medical applications), smart surveillance, sports, and robotics require the recognition of user activities, an important class of problems known as human activity recognition (HAR). Several issues have hindered progress in HAR research, particularly due to the emergence of fog and edge computing, which brings many new opportunities (a low latency, dynamic and real-time decision making, etc.) but comes with its challenges. This paper focuses on addressing two important research gaps in HAR research: (i) improving the HAR prediction accuracy and (ii) managing the frequent changes in the environment and data related to user activities. To address this, we propose an HAR method based on Soft-Voting and Self-Learning (SVSL). SVSL uses two strategies. First, to enhance accuracy, it combines the capabilities of Deep Learning (DL), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and AdaBoost classifiers using soft-voting. Second, to classify the most challenging data instances, the SVSL method is equipped with a self-training mechanism that generates training data and retrains itself. We investigate the performance of our proposed SVSL method using two publicly available datasets on six human activities related to lying, sitting, and walking positions. The first dataset consists of 562 features and the second dataset consists of five features. The data are collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope smartphone sensors. The results show that the proposed method provides 6.26%, 1.75%, 1.51%, and 4.40% better prediction accuracy (average over the two datasets) compared to GLM, DL, RF, and AdaBoost, respectively. We also analyze and compare the class-wise performance of the SVSL methods with that of DL, GLM, RF, and AdaBoost.

Today, governments in Europe are struggling to publish open data in a sustainable, predictable and cost-effective way. Our research question considers what methods for publishing Linked Open Data time series, in particular air quality data, are suitable in a sustainable and cost-effective way. Furthermore, we demonstrate the cross-domain applicability of our data publishing approach through a different use case on railway infrastructure—Linked Open Data. Based on scenarios co-created with various governmental stakeholders, we researched methods to promote data interoperability, scalability and flexibility. The results show that applying a Linked Data Fragments-based approach on public endpoints for air quality and railway infrastructure data, lowers the cost of publishing and increases availability due to better Web caching strategies.

AB  - Address is a structured description used to identify a specific place or point of interest, and it provides an effective way to locate people or objects. The standardization of Chinese place name and address occupies an important position in the construction of a smart city. Traditional address specification technology often adopts methods based on text similarity or rule bases, which cannot handle complex, missing, and redundant address information well. This paper transforms the task of address standardization into calculating the similarity of address pairs, and proposes a contrast learning address matching model based on the attention-Bi-LSTM-CNN network (ABLC). First of all, ABLC use the Trie syntax tree algorithm to extract Chinese address elements. Next, based on the basic idea of contrast learning, a hybrid neural network is applied to learn the semantic information in the address. Finally, Manhattan distance is calculated as the similarity of the two addresses. Experiments on the self-constructed dataset with data augmentation demonstrate that the proposed model has better stability and performance compared with other baselines.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Lidar is a key sensor of autonomous driving systems, but the spatial distribution of its point cloud is uneven because of its scanning mechanism, which greatly degrades the clustering performance of the traditional density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DSC). Considering the outline feature of detected objects for intelligent vehicles, a DSC-based adaptive clustering method (DAC) is proposed with the adoption of an elliptic neighborhood, which is designed according to the distribution properties of the point cloud. The parameters of the ellipse are adaptively adjusted with the location of the sample point to deal with the uniformity of points in different ranges. Furthermore, the dependence among different parameters of DAC is analyzed, and the parameters are numerically optimized with the KITTI dataset by considering comprehensive performance. To verify the effectiveness, a comparative experiment was conducted with a vehicle equipped with three IBEO LUX8 lidars on campus, and the results show that compared with DSC using a circular neighborhood, DAC has a better clustering performance and can notably reduce the rate of over-segmentation and under-segmentation.

AB  - The increasing use of electric vehicles in road and air transportation, especially in last-mile delivery and city mobility, raises new operational challenges due to the limited capacity of electric batteries. These limitations impose additional driving range constraints when optimizing the distribution and mobility plans. During the last years, several researchers from the Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research communities have been developing optimization, simulation, and machine learning approaches that aim at generating efficient and sustainable routing plans for hybrid fleets, including both electric and internal combustion engine vehicles. After contextualizing the relevance of electric vehicles in promoting sustainable transportation practices, this paper reviews the existing work in the field of electric vehicle routing problems. In particular, we focus on articles related to the well-known vehicle routing, arc routing, and team orienteering problems. The review is followed by numerical examples that illustrate the gains that can be obtained by employing optimization methods in the aforementioned field. Finally, several research opportunities are highlighted.

AB  - One of the key challenges of developing countries is to tackle the mitigation of the impacts of rapid and uncontrolled urbanization. Assessing this phenomenon is crucial to lessen the consequences for the environment and society. ‘Literature has been concentrated in planning strategies for the cities’ adaptation and engagements to the principles of green development ensuring a long-term quality of life for their citizens. Hereby, smart technologies and applications consist of two of the most encouraging concepts for solutions for achieving the 2030 and 2050 horizon targets towards clean energy transition and carbon neutrality. In academia, scholars have already raised the importance of ‘smartness’ to define the adaptative patterns for the global pressures of climate change and uncontrolled urban growth. The mitigation of these phenomena is crucial to ensure the cities’ future and lessen their impacts. This study seeks a strategic and smart-driven vision to leverage smartness on the phenomenon of rapid urbanization that occurred in the case of Beijing, China. Defining and evaluating the environmental impacts in line with the RIAM approach as one of its main targets. Future works can be focused on addressing solutions in similar cases in further developing countries to not only overcome environmental, but also economic, social, and digital complications.

TI  - An Application of a Deep Q-Network Based Dynamic Fare Bidding System to Improve the Use of Taxi Services during Off-Peak Hours in Seoul
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 16
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The problem of structural imbalance in terms of supply and demand due to changes in traffic patterns by time zone has been continuously raised in the mobility market. In Korea, unlike large overseas cities, the waiting time tolerance increases during the daytime when supply far exceeds demand, resulting in a large loss of operating profit. The purpose of this study is to increase taxi demand and further improve driver’s profits through real-time fare discounts during off-peak daytime hours in Seoul, Korea. To this end, we propose a real-time fare bidding system among taxi drivers based on a dynamic pricing scheme and simulate the appropriate fare discount level for each regional time zone. The driver-to-driver fare competition system consists of simulating fare competition based on the multi-agent Deep Q-Network method after developing a fare discount index that reflects the supply and demand level of each region in 25 districts in Seoul. According to the optimal fare discount level analysis in the off-peak hours, the lower the OI Index, which means the level of demand relative to supply, the higher the fare discount rate. In addition, an analysis of drivers’ profits and matching rates according to the distance between the origin and destination of each region showed up to 89% and 65% of drivers who actively offered discounts on fares. The results of this study in the future can serve as the foundation of a fare adjustment system for varying demand and supply situations in the Korean mobility market.

TI  - Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Fire Safety of Agricultural Structures
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 16
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Artificial intelligence applications in fire safety of agricultural structures have practical economic and technological benefits on commercial agriculture. The FAO estimates that wildfires result in at least USD 1 billion in agriculture-related losses due to the destruction of livestock pasture, destruction of agricultural buildings, premature death of farm animals, and general disruption of agricultural activities. Even though artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and adaptive neurofuzzy inference systems (ANFISs), among others, have proven useful in fire prevention, their application is limited in real farm environments. Most farms rely on traditional/non-technology-based methods of fire prevention. The case for AI in agricultural fire prevention is grounded on the accuracy and reliability of computer simulations in smoke movement analysis, risk assessment, and postfire analysis. In addition, such technologies can be coupled with next-generation fire-retardant materials such as intumescent coatings with a polymer binder, blowing agent, carbon donor, and acid donor. Future prospects for AI in agriculture transcend basic fire safety to encompass Society 5.0, energy systems in smart cities, UAV monitoring, Agriculture 4.0, and decentralized energy. However, critical challenges must be overcome, including the health and safety aspects, cost, and reliability. In brief, AI offers unlimited potential in the prevention of fire hazards in farms, but the existing body of knowledge is inadequate.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data represent a source of information in real time not only about electricity consumption but also as an indicator of other social, demographic, and economic dynamics within a city. This paper presents a Data Analytics/Big Data framework applied to AMI data as a tool to leverage the potential of this data within the applications in a Smart City. The framework includes three fundamental aspects. First, the architectural view places AMI within the Smart Grids Architecture Model-SGAM. Second, the methodological view describes the transformation of raw data into knowledge represented by the DIKW hierarchy and the NIST Big Data interoperability model. Finally, a binding element between the two views is represented by human expertise and skills to obtain a deeper understanding of the results and transform knowledge into wisdom. Our new view faces the challenges arriving in energy markets by adding a binding element that gives support for optimal and efficient decision-making. To show how our framework works, we developed a case study. The case implements each component of the framework for a load forecasting application in a Colombian Retail Electricity Provider (REP). The MAPE for some of the REP’s markets was less than 5%. In addition, the case shows the effect of the binding element as it raises new development alternatives and becomes a feedback mechanism for more assertive decision making.

AB  - Smart cities are an extremely important, multi-faceted subject, both in terms of their practical aspects and in terms of research. This is expressed, among other things, in the multitude of approaches to this concept. These approaches differ based on the emphasis placed on individual aspects: some focus more on technology, and others put more weight on social issues, while still others value sustainable development issues. Currently, an important topic of discussion about the development of the smart city—the importance of which has become even greater in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic—is the digital transformation of the city. The use of robotic process automation (RPA) tools can be a part of such a transformation, as such tools, using advanced software, enable the automation of those tasks carried out thus far by humans. Although such an approach has, to date, been widespread in the case of enterprises (in particular, those operating in the financial and BPO/SSC sectors, but less often in the utilities sector, the first applications of these solutions in the context of process automation for cities are also beginning to emerge in various parts of the world. This article is based on a case study approach. The implementation conditions (including the constraints) of such an approach, the benefits achieved, and the lessons learned (which can be important for other local government units) are outlined using the example of the Bydgoszcz city hall’s (Poland) electricity billing document management. The results of the case study presented here lead to the conclusion that the use of RPA tools enables, very quickly and at relatively low cost, measurable results to be achieved that are related to the processing of electricity billing documentation for the city of Bydgoszcz. This allows the assertion to be made that robotic process automation can be taken into consideration as one of the tools used to build smart cities.

AB  - According to the security breach level index, millions of records are stolen worldwide on every single day. Personal health records are the most targeted records on the internet, and they are considered sensitive, and valuable. Security and privacy are the most important parameters of cryptography and encryption. They reduce the availability of data on patients and healthcare to the appropriate personnel and ultimately lead to a barrier in the transfer of healthcare into a digital health system. Using a permission blockchain to share healthcare data can reduce security and privacy issues. According to the literature, most healthcare systems rely on a centralized system, which is more prone to security vulnerabilities. The existing blockchain-based healthcare schemes provide only a data-sharing framework, but they lack security and privacy. To cope with these kinds of security issues, we have designed a novel security algorithm that provides security as well as privacy with much better efficiency and a lower cost. Hence, in this research, we have proposed a patient healthcare framework that provides greater security, reliability, and authentication compared to existing blockchain-based access control.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - Smart city is a collective term for technologies and concepts that are directed toward making cities efficient, technologically more advanced, greener and more socially inclusive. These concepts include technical, economic and social innovations. This term has been tossed around by various actors in politics, business, administration and urban planning since the 2000s to establish tech-based changes and innovations in urban areas. The idea of the smart city is used in conjunction with the utilization of digital technologies and at the same time represents a reaction to the economic, social and political challenges that post-industrial societies are confronted with at the start of the new millennium. The key focus is on dealing with challenges faced by urban society, such as environmental pollution, demographic change, population growth, healthcare, the financial crisis or scarcity of resources. In a broader sense, the term also includes non-technical innovations that make urban life more sustainable. So far, the idea of using IoT-based sensor networks for healthcare applications is a promising one with the potential of minimizing inefficiencies in the existing infrastructure. A machine learning approach is key to successful implementation of the IoT-powered wireless sensor networks for this purpose since there is large amount of data to be handled intelligently. Throughout this paper, it will be discussed in detail how AI-powered IoT and WSNs are applied in the healthcare sector. This research will be a baseline study for understanding the role of the IoT in smart cities, in particular in the healthcare sector, for future research works.

AB  - The epidemic disease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) called COVID-19 has become a more frequently active disease. Managing and monitoring COVID-19 patients is still a challenging issue for advanced technologies. The first and foremost critical issue in COVID-19 is to diagnose it timely and cut off the chain of transmission by isolating the susceptible and patients. COVID-19 spreads through close interaction and contact with an infected person. It has affected the entire world, and every country is facing the challenges of having adequate medical facilities along with the availability of medical staff in rural and urban areas that have a high number of patients due to the pandemic. Due to the invasive method of treatment, SARS-COVID is spreading swiftly. In this paper, we propose an intelligent health monitoring framework using wearable Internet of Things (IoT) and Geo-fencing for COVID-19 susceptible and patient monitoring, and isolation and quarantine management to control the pandemic. The proposed system consists of four layers, and each layer has different functionality: a wearable sensors layer, IoT gateway layer, cloud server layer, and client application layer for visualization and analysis. The wearable sensors layer consists of wearable biomedical and GPS sensors for physiological parameters, and GPS and Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator acquisition for health monitoring and user Geo-fencing. The IoT gateway layer provides a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi based wireless body area network and IoT environment for data transmission anytime and anywhere. Cloud servers use Raspberry Pi and ThingSpeak cloud for data analysis and web-based application layers for remote monitoring based on user consent. The susceptible and patient conditions, real-time sensor’s data, and Geo-fencing enables minimizing the spread through close interaction. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Nowadays, the internet of things (IoT) is used to generate data in several application domains. A logistic regression, which is a standard machine learning algorithm with a wide application range, is built on such data. Nevertheless, building a powerful and effective logistic regression model requires large amounts of data. Thus, collaboration between multiple IoT participants has often been the go-to approach. However, privacy concerns and poor data quality are two challenges that threaten the success of such a setting. Several studies have proposed different methods to address the privacy concern but to the best of our knowledge, little attention has been paid towards addressing the poor data quality problems in the multi-party logistic regression model. Thus, in this study, we propose a multi-party privacy-preserving logistic regression framework with poor quality data filtering for IoT data contributors to address both problems. Specifically, we propose a new metric gradient similarity in a distributed setting that we employ to filter out parameters from data contributors with poor quality data. To solve the privacy challenge, we employ homomorphic encryption. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations using real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework is privacy-preserving and robust against poor quality data.

AB  - The abundance of type and quantity of available data in the healthcare field has led many to utilize machine learning approaches to keep up with this influx of data. Data pertaining to COVID-19 is an area of recent interest. The widespread influence of the virus across the United States creates an obvious need to identify groups of individuals that are at an increased risk of mortality from the virus. We propose a so-called clustered random forest approach to predict COVID-19 patient mortality. We use this approach to examine the hidden heterogeneity of patient frailty by examining demographic information for COVID-19 patients. We find that our clustered random forest approach attains predictive performance comparable to other published methods. We also find that follow-up analysis with neural network modeling and k-means clustering provide insight into the type and magnitude of mortality risks associated with COVID-19.

Furthermore, we present the most commonly used commercial case studies and address the latest advancements and solutions proposed for the IoD environments. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future research directions of IoD.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This paper develops a novel hybrid feature learner and classifier for vibration-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) of industrial apartments. The trained model extracts high-level discriminative features from vibration signals and predicts equipment state. Against the limitations of traditional machine learning (ML)-based classifiers, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep neural network (DNN) are not only superior for real-time applications, but they also come with other benefits including ease-of-use, automated feature learning, and higher predictive accuracies. This study proposes a hybrid DNN and one-dimensional CNN diagnostics model (D-dCNN) which automatically extracts high-level discriminative features from vibration signals for FDI. Via Softmax averaging at the output layer, the model mitigates the limitations of the standalone classifiers. A diagnostic case study demonstrates the efficiency of the model with a significant accuracy of 92% (F1 score) and extensive comparative empirical validations.

AB  - Heritage buildings are often lost without being adequately documented. Significant research has gone into automated building modelling from point clouds, challenged by irregularities in building design and the presence of occlusion-causing clutter and non-Manhattan World features. Previous work has been largely focused on the extraction and representation of walls, floors, and ceilings from either interior or exterior single storey scans. Significantly less effort has been concentrated on the automated extraction of smaller features such as windows and doors from complete (interior and exterior) scans. In addition, the majority of the work done on automated building reconstruction pertains to the new-build and construction industries, rather than for heritage buildings. This work presents a novel multi-level storey separation technique as well as a novel door and window detection strategy within an end-to-end modelling software for the automated creation of 2D floor plans and 3D building models from complete terrestrial laser scans of heritage buildings. The methods are demonstrated on three heritage sites of varying size and complexity, achieving overall accuracies of 94.74% for multi-level storey separation and 92.75% for the building model creation. Additionally, the automated door and window detection methodology achieved absolute mean dimensional errors of 6.3 cm.

AB  - Vocabulary knowledge is a prerequisite for mastering any foreign language. It takes a lot of time and effort to develop English as a foreign language (EFL) vocabulary skills. Efficient ways to facilitate this process should be studied and analyzed. The present study aimed to investigate the role of the Discord application in teaching and learning EFL vocabulary. Discord is a free messenger with support for IP telephony and video conferencing, as well as the possibility to create public and private chats for exchanging text and voice messages. The study relied on pre-test and post-test design to get the necessary data of one experimental and one control group, 80 university students altogether. The results of the pre-test showed no significant difference between the two groups. The experimental group was taught with the help of the Discord application, while the control group was dealing with the traditional educational process, that is, 180 min every week in a classroom with a textbook and no electronic educational resources. Results of the t-test indicated that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group on a researcher-made vocabulary post-test. A post-treatment speaking test was administered—the participants took part in speaking interviews where they were asked to give a short speech on one of the topics studied during the experimental training. The representatives of the experimental group managed to use more vocabulary items per person correctly (pronunciation, lexical combinability, etc.). The findings revealed that the suggested way of using the Discord application may positively influence the acquisition of EFL vocabulary and its further application in speaking. Hence, it is recommended that the Discord application be used as a tool in the EFL vocabulary teaching and learning process to reinforce in-class tasks and activities.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Recent developments in the renewable energy sector have seen an unprecedented growth in residential photovoltaic (PV) installations. However, high PV penetration levels often lead to overvoltage problems in low-voltage (LV) distribution feeders. Smart inverter control such as active power curtailment (APC)-based overvoltage control can be implemented to overcome these challenges. The APC technique utilizes a constant droop-based approach which curtails power rigidly, which can lead to significant energy curtailment in the LV distribution feeders. In this paper, different variations of the APC technique with linear, quadratic, and exponential droops have been analyzed from the point-of-view of energy curtailment for a LV distribution network in North America. Further, a combinatorial approach using various droop-based APC methods in conjunction with adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) as a supplementary control scheme has also been proposed. The proposed approach minimizes energy curtailment in the LV distribution network by adjusting the droop gains. Simulation results depict that ADP in conjunction with exponential droop reduces the energy curtailment to approximately 50% compared to using the standard linear droop.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Energy consumption in Bangladesh increased for economic, industrial, and digitalization growth. Reductions in conventional sources such as natural gas (54%) and coal (5.6%) are calls to enhance renewable resources. This paper aims to investigate the atmospheric variables for potential wind zones and develop a statistical power-forecasting model. The study-site is Bangladesh, focusing on eight divisions across two regions. First, the southern zone includes Dhaka (Capital), Chittagong, Barishal, and Khulna. The northern regions are Rajshahi, Rangpur, Mymensingh, and Sylhet. This investigation illustrates wind (m/s) speeds at various heights (m) and analyzes the boundary layer height (BLH) from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast reanalysis 5th generation (ERA5). The data is from a period of 40 years from 1979 to 2018, assessing with a climatic base of 20 years (1979 to 2000). The climatological analysis comprises trends, time series, anomalies, and linear correlations. The results for the wind speed (BLH) indicate that the weakest (lower) and strongest (higher) regions are Sylhet and Barishal, respectively. Based on power-curve relationships, a simple power predictive model (SPPM) is developed using global wind atlas (GWA) data (sample: 1100) to estimate the power density (W/m2) and found an accuracy of 0.918 and 0.892 for Exponential (EXP) and Polynomial (PN) with mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 22.92 and 21.8%, respectively. For validation, SPPM also forecasts power incorporating historical observations for Chittagong and obtains correlations of 0.970 and 0.974 for EXP and PN with a MAPE of 10.26 and 7.69% individually. Furthermore, calculations for annual energy production reveal an average megawattage of 1748 and 1070 in the southern and northern regions, with an MAPE of 15.71 and 5.85% for EXP and PN models, except Sylhet. The SPPM’s predictability can be improved with observed wind speeds and turbine types. The research wishes to apply SPPM for estimating energy in operational power plants.

VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc globally and still persists even after a year of its initial outbreak. Several reasons can be considered: people are in close contact with each other, i.e., at a short range (1 m), and the healthcare system is not sufficiently developed or does not have enough facilities to manage and fight the pandemic, even in developed countries such as the USA and the U.K. and countries in Europe. There is a great need in healthcare for remote monitoring of COVID-19 symptoms. In the past year, a number of IoT-based devices and wearables have been introduced by researchers, providing good results in terms of high accuracy in diagnosing patients in the prodromal phase and in monitoring the symptoms of patients, i.e., respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature, etc. In this systematic review, we analyzed these wearables and their need in the healthcare system. The research was conducted using three databases: IEEE Xplore®, Web of Science®, and PubMed Central®, between December 2019 and June 2021. This article was based on the PRISMA guidelines. Initially, 1100 articles were identified while searching the scientific literature regarding this topic. After screening, ultimately, 70 articles were fully evaluated and included in this review. These articles were divided into two categories. The first one belongs to the on-body sensors (wearables), their types and positions, and the use of AI technology with ehealth wearables in different scenarios from screening to contact tracing. In the second category, we discuss the problems and solutions with respect to utilizing these wearables globally. This systematic review provides an extensive overview of wearable systems for the remote management and automated assessment of COVID-19, taking into account the reliability and acceptability of the implemented technologies.

TI  - A Smart Capsule Equipped with Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Delivery of Medical Material through Drones
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 17
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In the last few years, many examples of blood and medicine delivery drones have been demonstrated worldwide, which mainly rely on aeronautical experience that is not common in the medical world. Speaking about drone delivery, attention should focus on the most important thing: the transported lifesaving good. Traditional boxes that monitor temperature are not usually in real time, and are not suitable for drone transportation because they are heavy and bulky. This means that the biomedical characteristics of delivery are of primary importance. A Smart Capsule, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), is the first system ever proposed to provide a fully autonomous drone delivery service for perishable and high-value medical products, integrating real-time quality monitoring and control. It consists in a smart casing that is able to guide any autonomous aerial vehicle attached to it, specifically designed for transporting blood, organs, tissues, test samples and drugs, among others. The system monitors the conditions of the product (e.g., temperature, agitation and humidity) and adjusts them when needed by exploiting, for instance, vibrations to maintain the required agitation, ensuring that goods are ready to be used as soon as they are delivered. The Smart Capsule also leverages external temperature to reduce energy uptake from the drone, thus improving the drone’s battery life and flight range. The system replaces the need for specialized drivers and traditional road-bound transportation means, while guaranteeing compliance with all applicable safety regulations. A series of 16 experimental tests was performed to demonstrate the possibility of using the smart capsule to manage the flight and internal good delivery. Eighty-one missions were carried out for a total of 364 min of flight. The Smart Capsule greatly improves emergency response and efficiency of healthcare systems by reducing delivery times by up to 80% and costs by at least 28%. The Smart Capsule and its enabling technology based on AI for drone deliveries are discussed in this paper. The aim of this work is to show the possibility of managing drone delivery with an AI-based device.

SN  - 2227-9032

AB  - Mobile healthcare service has become increasingly popular thanks to the significant advances in the wireless body area networks (WBANs). It helps medical professionals to collect patient’s healthcare data remotely and provides remote medical diagnosis. Since the health data are privacy-related, they should provide services with privacy-preserving, which should consider security and privacy at the same time. Recently, some lightweight patient healthcare authentication protocols were proposed for WBANs. However, we observed that they are vulnerable to tracing attacks because the patient uses the same identifier in each session, which could leak privacy-related information on the patient. To defeat the weakness, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving authentication protocol for WBANs in healthcare service. The proposed protocol is only based on one-way hash function and with exclusive-or operation, which are lightweight operations than asymmetric cryptosystem operations. We performed two rigorous formal security proofs based on BAN logic and ProVerif tool. Furthermore, comparison results with the relevant protocols show that the proposed protocol achieves more privacy and security features than the other protocols and has suitable efficiency in computational and communicational concerns.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The current state of technological progress offers extensive opportunities for the development of urban infrastructure and the construction of Smart Cities, but the city will only become intelligent if it raises the living standards of all citizens in it. The Smart City uses information and communication technologies to improve its functionality and long-term sustainability and to increase the living standards of its citizens. In this context, it is necessary to address the issue of mutual communication between the city and the citizen and its implementation. The aim of the paper is to design a suitable smart solution that would streamline two-way communication between the city and its citizens. This solution is an urban mobile application, which is also a simple and yet sufficiently effective solution for the transformation of cities into Smart Cities. The main benefit is the implementation of research assessing the requirements of the citizens of a particular city for the services and functions that the application should offer. After analysing the results, a specific urban application design was processed using User Interface and User Interface design. The proposal consists of seven consecutive phases. All phases were completed in solving the design and the result can be seen in the resulting interactive prototype, which was finally tested by authors and random users representing all age categories. The results of the prototype usability tests enabled a gradual improvement of the solution, which culminated in the confirmation of its effectiveness.

AB  - Automatic acquisition of the canopy volume parameters of the Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju tree is of great significance to precision management of the orchard. This research combined the point cloud deep learning algorithm with the volume calculation algorithm to segment the canopy of the Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju trees. The 3D (Three-Dimensional) point cloud model of a Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju orchard was generated using UAV tilt photogrammetry images. The segmentation effects of three deep learning models, PointNet++, MinkowskiNet and FPConv, on Shatangju trees and the ground were compared. The following three volume algorithms: convex hull by slices, voxel-based method and 3D convex hull were applied to calculate the volume of Shatangju trees. Model accuracy was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results show that the overall accuracy of the MinkowskiNet model (94.57%) is higher than the other two models, which indicates the best segmentation effect. The 3D convex hull algorithm received the highest R2 (0.8215) and the lowest RMSE (0.3186 m3) for the canopy volume calculation, which best reflects the real volume of Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju trees. The proposed method is capable of rapid and automatic acquisition for the canopy volume of Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju trees.

With the rapid development in technology, a key feature of 5G networks is the increased level of connectivity between everyday objects, facilitated by faster internet speeds with smart facilities indicative of the forthcoming 5G-driven revolution in Internet of Things (IoT). This study revisited the benefits of 5G network technologies to enhance the efficiency of the smart city and minimize climate change impacts in Singapore, thus creating a clean environment for healthy living. Results revealed that the smart management of energy, wastes, water resources, agricultures, risk factors, and the economy adopted in Singapore can remarkably contribute to reducing climate change, thus attaining the sustainability goals. Hence, future studies on cost-effective design and implementation are essential to increase the focus on the smart city concept globally.

VL  - 10
IS  - 17
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks aim to deplete the network bandwidth and computing resources of targeted victims. Low-rate DDoS attacks exploit protocol features such as the transmission control protocol (TCP) three-way handshake mechanism for connection establishment and the TCP congestion-control induced backoffs to attack at a much lower rate and still effectively bring down the targeted network and computer systems. Most of the statistical and machine/deep learning-based detection methods proposed in the literature require keeping track of packets by flows and have high processing overheads for feature extraction. This paper presents a novel two-stage model that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest (RF) to detect the presence of attack flows in a group of flows. This model has a very low data processing overhead; it uses only two features and does not require keeping track of packets by flows, making it suitable for continuous monitoring of network traffic and on-the-fly detection. The paper also presents an LSTM Autoencoder to detect individual attack flows with high detection accuracy using only two features. Additionally, the paper presents an analysis of a support vector machine (SVM) model that detects attack flows in slices of network traffic collected for short durations. The low-rate attack dataset used in this study is made available to the research community through GitHub.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Sign language is designed to assist the deaf and hard of hearing community to convey messages and connect with society. Sign language recognition has been an important domain of research for a long time. Previously, sensor-based approaches have obtained higher accuracy than vision-based approaches. Due to the cost-effectiveness of vision-based approaches, researchers have been conducted here also despite the accuracy drop. The purpose of this research is to recognize American sign characters using hand images obtained from a web camera. In this work, the media-pipe hands algorithm was used for estimating hand joints from RGB images of hands obtained from a web camera and two types of features were generated from the estimated coordinates of the joints obtained for classification: one is the distances between the joint points and the other one is the angles between vectors and 3D axes. The classifiers utilized to classify the characters were support vector machine (SVM) and light gradient boosting machine (GBM). Three character datasets were used for recognition: the ASL Alphabet dataset, the Massey dataset, and the finger spelling A dataset. The results obtained were 99.39% for the Massey dataset, 87.60% for the ASL Alphabet dataset, and 98.45% for Finger Spelling A dataset. The proposed design for automatic American sign language recognition is cost-effective, computationally inexpensive, does not require any special sensors or devices, and has outperformed previous studies.

One of the promising applications of UAVs is in transportation systems. As the current transportation system is moving towards Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), UAVs will play a significant role in the functioning of ITS. This paper presents a survey on the recent advances of UAVs and their roles in current and future transportation systems. Moreover, the emerging technologies of UAVs in the transportation section and the current research areas are summarized. From the discussion, the challenges and opportunities of integrating UAVs towards future ITS are highlighted. In addition, some of the potential research areas involving UAVs in future ITS are also identified.

Larger appliances used in an industry context are now provided with Internet of Things (IoT)-based interfaces that can be remotely monitored, with some also provided with actuation interfaces. The combined use of IoT and edge computing enables connectivity between energy systems and infrastructure, providing the means to implement both energy efficiency/optimisation and cost reduction strategies. We investigate the economic implications of harnessing IoT and edge/cloud technologies to support energy management for HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems in buildings. In particular, we evaluate the cost savings for building operations through energy optimisation. We use a real use case for energy optimisation as identified in the EU “Sporte2” project (focusing on the energy optimisation of sports facilities) and explore several scenarios in relation to costs and energy optimisation.

The aim is to build an effective hybrid normalization technique that ensures the use of useful information of the noisy text in its intended form instead of filtering them out to analyze SM text better. The proposed TVH performs context-aware text normalization based on intended meaning to avoid the wrong word substitution. We integrate the TVH with state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep-learning-based text analysis methods to enhance their performance for noisy SM text data. The proposed scheme shows promising improvement in the text analysis of informal SM text in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score in simulation.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has become one of the key technologies in subsurface sensing and, in general, in nondestructive testing (NDT), since it is able to detect both metallic and nonmetallic targets. GPR has proven its ability to work in electromagnetic frequency range for subsoil investigations, and it is a risk-reduction strategy for surveying underground various targets and their identification and detection. This paper presents the results of a case study which exceeds the laboratory level being realized in the field in a real case where the scanning conditions are much more difficult using GPR signals for detecting and assessing underground drainage metallic pipes which cross an area with large buildings parallel to the riverbed. The two urban drainage pipes are detected based on GPR imaging. This provides an approximation of their location and depth which are convenient to find from the reconstructed profiles of both simulated and practical GPR signals. The processing of data recorded with GPR tools requires appropriate software for this type of measurement to detect between different reflections at multiple interfaces located at different depths below the surface. In addition to the radargrams recorded and processed with the software corresponding to a GPR device, the paper contains significant results obtained using techniques and algorithms of the processing and post-processing of the signals (background removal and migration) that gave us the opportunity to estimate the location, depth, and profile of pipes, placed into a concrete duct bank, under a structure with different layers, including pavement, with good accuracy.

AB  - North Korea being one of the most degraded forests globally has recently been emphasizing in forest restoration. Monitoring the trend of forest restoration in North Korea has important reference significance for regional environmental management and ecological security. Thus, this study constructed and analyzed a time-series land use land cover (LULC) map to identify the LULC changes (LULCCs) over extensive periods across North Korea and understand the forest change trends. The analysis of LULC used Landsat multi-temporal image and Random Forest algorithm on Google Earth Engine(GEE) from 2001 to 2018 in North Korea. Through the LULCC detection technique and consideration of the cropland change relation with elevation, the forest change in North Korea for 2001–2018 was evaluated. We extended the existing sampling methodology and obtained a higher overall accuracy (98.2% ± 1.6%), with corresponding kappa coefficients (0.959 ± 0.037), and improved the classification accuracy in cropland and forest cover. Through the change detection and spatial analysis, our research shows that the forests in the southern and central regions of North Korea are undergoing restoration. The sampling method we extended in this study can effectively and reliably monitoring the change trend of North Korea forests. It also provides an important reference for the regional environmental management and ecological security in North Korea.

AB  - Experts confirm that 85% of the world’s population is expected to live in cities by 2050. Therefore, cities should be prepared to satisfy the needs of their citizens and provide the best services. The idea of a city of the future is commonly represented by the smart city, which is a more efficient system that optimizes its resources and services, through the use of monitoring and communication technology. Thus, one of the steps towards sustainability for cities around the world is to make a transition into smart cities. Here, sensors play an important role in the system, as they gather relevant information from the city, citizens, and the corresponding communication networks that transfer the information in real-time. Although the use of these sensors is diverse, their application can be categorized in six different groups: energy, health, mobility, security, water, and waste management. Based on these groups, this review presents an analysis of different sensors that are typically used in efforts toward creating smart cities. Insights about different applications and communication systems are provided, as well as the main opportunities and challenges faced when making a transition to a smart city. Ultimately, this process is not only about smart urban infrastructure, but more importantly about how these new sensing capabilities and digitization developments improve quality of life. Smarter communities are those that socialize, adapt, and invest through transparent and inclusive community engagement in these technologies based on local and regional societal needs and values. Cyber security disruptions and privacy remain chief vulnerabilities.

To illustrate the novelty of our work, we present a brainstorming mind-map of all the topics discussed in this article. We emphasise the design aspects of the TI and discuss the three main sections of the TI, i.e., master, network, and slave sections, with a focus on the proposed application-centric design architecture. With the help of the proposed illustrative diagrams of use cases, we discuss and tabulate the possible applications of the TI with a 5G framework and its requirements. Then, we extensively address the currently identified issues and challenges with promising potential enablers of the TI. Moreover, a comprehensive review focussing on related articles on enabling technologies is explored, including Fifth Generation (5G), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Cloud/Edge/Fog Computing, Multiple Access, and Network Coding. Finally, we conclude the survey with several research issues that are open for further investigation. Thus, the survey provides insights into the TI that can help network researchers and engineers to contribute further towards developing the next-generation Internet.

AB  - In a context with an increasing number of non-traditional power sources, smart inverters function as the main interfaces between distributed energy resources (DERs) and the power bus. This role is even more prominent in microgrids (MGs), where numerous DERs must be controlled and coordinated. For this aim, MGs need to implement suitable communication links since, even in distributed control, the system must compensate voltage and frequency deviations caused by local controllers. Likewise, a communication system is required to optimize its operation. This paper aims to apply the technological advances brought by the Internet of Things (IoT) to the issue of communication within an MG. The work proposes a wireless communication architecture based on the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol, accompanied by a set of requirements and specifications to establish a multi-directional information flow between DERs in an MG, and potential energy management system (EMS) or secondary controllers. A laboratory-scale testbed was implemented to demonstrate the operation of an EMS in the proposed architecture. The experimental results showed how current control structures seamlessly integrate with the proposed communication system. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that communication latencies or failures did not comprise the stability of the MG, but only decreased the optimality of the EMS control strategy.

TI  - Spectrum Demand Forecasting for IoT Services
T2  - Future Internet

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - The evolution of IoT has come with the challenge of connecting not only a massive number of devices, but also providing an always wider variety of services. In the next few years, a big increase in the number of connected devices is expected, together with an important increase in the amount of traffic generated. Never before have wireless communications permeated so deeply in all industries and economic sectors. Therefore, it is crucial to correctly forecast the spectrum needs, which bands should be used for which services, and the economic potential of its utilization. This paper proposes a methodology for spectrum forecasting consisting of two phases: a market study and a spectrum forecasting model. The market study determines the main drivers of the IoT industry for any country: services, technologies, frequency bands, and the number of devices that will require IoT connectivity. The forecasting model takes the market study as the input and calculates the spectrum demand in 5 steps: Defining scenarios for spectrum contention, calculating the offered traffic load, calculating a capacity for some QoS requirements, finding the spectrum required, and adjusting according to key spectral efficiency determinants. This methodology is applied for Colombia’s IoT spectrum forecast. We provide a complete step-by-step implementation in fourteen independent spectrum contention scenarios, calculating offered traffic, required capacity, and spectrum for cellular licensed bands and non-cellular unlicensed bands in a 10-year period. Detailed results are presented specifying coverage area requirements per economic sector, frequency band, and service. The need for higher teledensity and higher spectral efficiency turns out to be a determining factor for spectrum savings.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Continuous and emerging advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have enabled Internet-of-Things (IoT)-to-Cloud applications to be induced by data pipelines and Edge Intelligence-based architectures. Advanced vehicular networks greatly benefit from these architectures due to the implicit functionalities that are focused on realizing the Internet of Vehicle (IoV) vision. However, IoV is susceptible to attacks, where adversaries can easily exploit existing vulnerabilities. Several attacks may succeed due to inadequate or ineffective authentication techniques. Hence, there is a timely need for hardening the authentication process through cutting-edge access control mechanisms. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based Multi-Factor authentication model that uses an embedded Digital Signature (MFBC_eDS) for vehicular clouds and Cloud-enabled IoV. Our proposed MFBC_eDS model consists of a scheme that integrates the Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML) to the Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for a connected edge to cloud ecosystem. MFBC_eDS draws an essential comparison with the baseline authentication scheme suggested by Karla and Sood. Based on the foundations of Karla and Sood’s scheme, an embedded Probabilistic Polynomial-Time Algorithm (ePPTA) and an additional Hash function for the Pi generated during Karla and Sood’s authentication were proposed and discussed. The preliminary analysis of the proposition shows that the approach is more suitable to counter major adversarial attacks in an IoV-centered environment based on the Dolev–Yao adversarial model while satisfying aspects of the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 18
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Edge intelligence (EI) has received a lot of interest because it can reduce latency, increase efficiency, and preserve privacy. More significantly, as the Internet of Things (IoT) has proliferated, billions of portable and embedded devices have been interconnected, producing zillions of gigabytes on edge networks. Thus, there is an immediate need to push AI (artificial intelligence) breakthroughs within edge networks to achieve the full promise of edge data analytics. EI solutions have supported digital technology workloads and applications from the infrastructure level to edge networks; however, there are still many challenges with the heterogeneity of computational capabilities and the spread of information sources. We propose a novel event-driven deep-learning framework, called EDL-EI (event-driven deep learning for edge intelligence), via the design of a novel event model by defining events using correlation analysis with multiple sensors in real-world settings and incorporating multi-sensor fusion techniques, a transformation method for sensor streams into images, and lightweight 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) models. To demonstrate the feasibility of the EDL-EI framework, we presented an IoT-based prototype system that we developed with multiple sensors and edge devices. To verify the proposed framework, we have a case study of air-quality scenarios based on the benchmark data provided by the USA Environmental Protection Agency for the most polluted cities in South Korea and China. We have obtained outstanding predictive accuracy (97.65% and 97.19%) from two deep-learning models on the cities’ air-quality patterns. Furthermore, the air-quality changes from 2019 to 2020 have been analyzed to check the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.

SN  - 2075-1702

AB  - Digital twins (DTs) is a promising technology in the revolution of the industry and essential for Industry 4.0. DTs play a vital role in improving distributed manufacturing, providing up-to-date operational data representation of physical assets, supporting decision-making, and avoiding the potential risks in distributed manufacturing systems. Furthermore, DTs need to collaborate within distributed manufacturing systems to predict the risks and reach consensus-based decision-making. However, DTs collaboration suffers from single failure due to attack and connection in a centralized manner, data interoperability, authentication, and scalability. To overcome the above challenges, we have discussed the major high-level requirements for the DTs collaboration. Then, we have proposed a conceptual framework to fulfill the DTs collaboration requirements by using the combination of blockchain, predictive analysis techniques, and DTs technologies. The proposed framework aims to empower more intelligence DTs based on blockchain technology. In particular, we propose a concrete ledger-based collaborative DTs framework that focuses on real-time operational data analytics and distributed consensus algorithms. Furthermore, we describe how the conceptual framework can be applied using smart transportation system use cases, i.e., smart logistics and railway predictive maintenance. Finally, we highlighted the future direction to guide interested researchers in this interesting area.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - A literature review of the important trends in predictive crime modeling and the existing measures of accuracy was undertaken. It highlighted the need for a robust, comprehensive and independent evaluation and the need to include complementary measures for a more complete assessment. We develop a new measure called the penalized predictive accuracy index (PPAI), propose the use of the expected utility function to combine multiple measures and the use of the average logarithmic score, which measures accuracy differently than existing measures. The measures are illustrated using hypothetical examples. We illustrate how PPAI could identify the best model for a given problem, as well as how the expected utility measure can be used to combine different measures in a way that is the most appropriate for the problem at hand. It is important to develop measures that empower the practitioner with the ability to input the choices and preferences that are most appropriate for the problem at hand and to combine multiple measures. The measures proposed here go some way towards providing this ability. Further development along these lines is needed.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) deployments have shown their potential for aiding the realisation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Concerns regarding how the IoT can specifically drive SDGs 6, 11 and 9 in developing countries have been raised with respect to the challenges of deploying licensed and unlicensed low-power wide area network (LPWAN) IoT technologies and their opportunities for IoT consumers and service providers. With IoT infrastructure and protocols being ubiquitous and each being proposed for different SDGs, we review and compare the various performance characteristics of LoRaWAN and NB-IoT networks. From the performance analysis of our networks, NB-IoT, one of the standardised promising cellular IoT solutions for developing countries, is more expensive and less energy-efficient than LoRaWAN. Utilising the same user equipment (UE), NB-IoT consumed an excess of 2 mAh of power for joining the network and 1.7 mAh more for a 44-byte uplink message compared to LoRaWAN. However, NB-IoT has the advantage of reliably and securely delivering higher network connection capacity in IoT use cases, leveraging existing cellular infrastructure. With a maximum throughput of 264 bps at 837 ms measured latency, NB-IoT outperformed LoRaWAN and proved robust for machine-type communications. These findings will help IoT consumers and service providers understand the performance differences and deployment challenges of NB-IoT and LoRaWAN and establish new research directions to tackle IoT issues in developing countries. With Nigeria as a case study, for consumers and organisations at a crossroads in their long-term deployment decisions, the proposed LPWAN integrated architecture is an example of the deployment opportunities for consumer and industrial IoT applications in developing countries.

AB  - The technologies of the fourth industrial revolution have the potential to make zero harm possible for the first time in the history of mining. In the journey toward zero harm, rock stress monitoring systems are important for the risk management process. Although communication systems for underground mining have improved significantly over the past two decades, it remains difficult to achieve reliable-all-the-time wireless communication in ultra-deep level underground mines. The aim of this study is to explore and test a smart phone network for communicating sensor data from the underground production environment to the surface. In this paper, the evaluation and performance over distance of a wireless communication system is performed in underground mining environments. The wireless system transmits the data collected from a sensor installed in a narrow reef stope, horizontal tunnel, and vertical shaft area of a mock underground mine. The evaluation was performed using the received signal strength of a mobile receiver over distance. The path loss coefficients of the underground mining environment were then derived for the measurement areas. The results show that a communication speed of 80 Mbps was achieved in a 60 m range, thus, indicating the potential for the support of applications requiring higher data rates.

But how much of this is “smart washing”, and how much progress has really been made? We focus on the adoption and implementation of technological innovations to analyze the publicly available descriptions of Smart Tourism projects implemented in Europe according to the stringent technological criteria of contemporary Smart Tourism definitions. The results show that the vast majority of projects branded as “smart” predominantly pursue environmental sustainability goals, but do not feature advanced technology that meets the Smart Actionable attribute criteria, and do not address social sustainability issues to the same extent as the environmental ones.

AB  - The close development of the economic relations between China and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) since 2012 has triggered the European Union’s criticism of China’s foreign policy towards Eastern European countries. The European Union believes that China’s investment growth has led to a governance crisis in CEE countries. Based on the global governance indicators of the World Bank and the outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) data of the Ministry of Commerce of China, this paper conducts a test using the panel data model and the regression discontinuity method. An imbalanced panel dataset is adopted, covering 16 CEE countries from 2000 to 2018. The empirical research results indicate that, representing a small proportion of the investment inflows to CEE countries, China is not yet able to exert a domination effect on the region, and China’s economic power is far less than the European Union’s regulatory influence. Furthermore, China’s share of the OFDI in CEE has a U-shaped effect on the regulatory quality of host countries, and the two have a mutually causal relationship. Specifically, the impact on the host country’s regulatory quality is first manifested in the Shanghai effect, and when China’s share reaches a certain level, it is manifested in the California effect. The U-shaped effect is associated with the strategic factors of CEE countries and China’s positive contribution to good global governance.

VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The collapse of overhead power line guyed towers is one of the leading causes of power grid failures, subjecting electricity companies to pay considerable, high-value fines. In this way, the current work proposes a novel and complete framework for the remote monitoring of mechanical stresses in guyed towers. The framework method comprises a mesh network for data forwarding and neural networks to improve the performance of Low-Power and Lossy Networks. The method also considers the use of multiple sensors in the sensor fusion technique. As a result, the risk of collapse of guyed cable towers reduces, due to the remote monitoring and preventive actions promoted by the framework. Furthermore, the proposed method uses multiple input variable fusions, such as accelerometers and tension sensors, to estimate the tower’s displacement. These estimations help address the structural health of the tower against failures (i.e., loosening of the stay cables, displacement, and vibrations) that can cause catastrophic events, such as tower collapse or even cable rupture.

AB  - In the ecological future of the planet, intelligent agriculture relies on CPS and IoT to free up human resources and increase production efficiency. Due to the growing number of connected IoT devices, the maximum scalability capacity, and available computing power of the existing architectural frameworks will be reached. This necessitates finding a solution that meets the continuously growing demands in smart farming. Cloud-based IoT solutions are achieving increasingly high popularity. The aim of this study was to design a scalable cloud-based architecture for a smart livestock monitoring system following Agile methodology and featuring environmental monitoring, health, growth, behaviour, reproduction, emotional state, and stress levels of animals. The AWS services used, and their specific tasks related to the proposed architecture are explained in detail. A stress test was performed to prove the data ingesting and processing capability of the proposed architecture. Experimental results proved that the proposed architecture using AWS automated scaling mechanisms and IoT devices are fully capable of processing the growing amount of data, which in turn allow for meeting the required needs of the constantly expanding number of CPS systems.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Monitoring driving behaviour is important in controlling driving risk, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. Recent advances in machine learning, which include several variants of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks, could be valuable for the development of objective and efficient computational tools in this direction. The main idea in this work is to complement data-driven classification of driving behaviour with rules derived from domain knowledge. In this light, we present a hybrid representation approach, which employs NN-based time-series encoding and rule-guided event detection. Histograms derived from the output of these two components are concatenated, normalized, and used to train a standard support vector machine (SVM). For the NN-based component, CNN-based, LSTM-based, and GRU-based variants are investigated. The CNN-based variant uses image-like representations of sensor measurements, whereas the RNN-based variants (LSTM and GRU) directly process sensor measurements in the form of time-series. Experimental evaluation on three datasets leads to the conclusion that the proposed approach outperforms a state-of-the-art camera-based approaches in distinguishing between normal and aggressive driving behaviour without using data derived from a camera. Moreover, it is demonstrated that both NN-guided time-series encoding and rule-guided event detection contribute to overall classification accuracy.

AB  - The fourth industrial era, known as ‘Industry 4.0’ (I4.0), aided and abetted by the digital revolution, has attracted increasing attention among scholars and practitioners in the last decade. The adoption of I4.0 principles in Disaster Risk Management (DRM) research and associated industry practices is particularly notable, although its origins, impacts and potential are not well understood. In response to this knowledge gap, this paper conducts a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis of the application and contribution of I4.0 in DRM. The systematic literature review identified 144 relevant articles and then employed descriptive and content analysis of a focused set of 70 articles published between 2011 and 2021. The results of this review trace the growing trend for adoption of I4.0 tools and techniques in disaster management, and in parallel their influence in resilient infrastructure and digital construction fields. The results are used to identify six dominant clusters of research activity: big data analytics, Internet of Things, prefabrication and modularization, robotics and cyber-physical systems. The research in each cluster is then mapped to the priorities of the Sendai framework for DRR, highlighting the ways it can support this international agenda. Finally, this paper identifies gaps within the literature and discusses possible future research directions for the combination of I4.0 and DRM.

AB  - The expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) in public administration is generating numerous opportunities for governments. Current Spanish regulations have established electronic administration and support the expansion and implementation of this new technology, but they may not be adapted to the legal needs caused by AI. Consequently, this research aims to identify the risks associated with AI uses in Spanish public administration and if the legal mechanisms can solve them. We answer these questions by employing a qualitative research approach, conducting semi-structured interviews with several experts in the matter. Despite the benefits that this technology may involve, throughout this research we can confirm that the use of artificial intelligence can generate several problems such as opacity, legal uncertainty, biases, or breaches of personal data protection. The mechanisms already provided by Spanish law are not enough to avoid these risks as they have not been designed to face the use of artificial intelligence in public administration. In addition, a homogeneous legal definition of AI needs to be established.

AB  - With unlabeled music data widely available, it is necessary to build an unsupervised latent music representation extractor to improve the performance of classification models. This paper proposes an unsupervised latent music representation learning method based on a deep 3D convolutional denoising autoencoder (3D-DCDAE) for music genre classification, which aims to learn common representations from a large amount of unlabeled data to improve the performance of music genre classification. Specifically, unlabeled MIDI files are applied to 3D-DCDAE to extract latent representations by denoising and reconstructing input data. Next, a decoder is utilized to assist the 3D-DCDAE in training. After 3D-DCDAE training, the decoder is replaced by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for music genre classification. Through the unsupervised latent representations learning method, unlabeled data can be applied to classification tasks so that the problem of limiting classification performance due to insufficient labeled data can be solved. In addition, the unsupervised 3D-DCDAE can consider the musicological structure to expand the understanding of the music field and improve performance in music genre classification. In the experiments, which utilized the Lakh MIDI dataset, a large amount of unlabeled data was utilized to train the 3D-DCDAE, obtaining a denoising and reconstruction accuracy of approximately 98%. A small amount of labeled data was utilized for training a classification model consisting of the trained 3D-DCDAE and the MLP classifier, which achieved a classification accuracy of approximately 88%. The experimental results show that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms other methods for music genre classification with only a small amount of labeled data.

AB  - The number of smart homes is rapidly increasing. Smart homes typically feature functions such as voice-activated functions, automation, monitoring, and tracking events. Besides comfort and convenience, the integration of smart home functionality with data processing methods can provide valuable information about the well-being of the smart home residence. This study is aimed at taking the data analysis within smart homes beyond occupancy monitoring and fall detection. This work uses a multilayer perceptron neural network to recognize multiple human activities from wrist- and ankle-worn devices. The developed models show very high recognition accuracy across all activity classes. The cross-validation results indicate accuracy levels above 98% across all models, and scoring evaluation methods only resulted in an average accuracy reduction of 10%.

AB  - Society’s energy consumption has shot up in recent years, making the prediction of its demand a current challenge to ensure an efficient and responsible use. Artificial intelligence techniques have proven to be potential tools in handling tedious tasks and making sense of large-scale data to make better business decisions in different areas of knowledge. In this article, the use of random forests algorithms in a Big Data environment is proposed for household energy demand forecasting. The predictions are based on the use of information from different sources, confirming a fundamental role of socioeconomic data in consumer’s behaviours. On the other hand, the use of Big Data architectures is proposed to perform horizontal and vertical scaling of the solution to be used in real environments. Finally, a tool for high-resolution predictions with great efficiency is introduced, which enables energy management in a very accurate way.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems and is of great significance for traffic management. The main issue of traffic forecasting is how to model spatial and temporal dependence. Current state-of-the-art methods tend to apply deep learning models; these methods are unexplainable and ignore the a priori characteristics of traffic flow. To address these issues, a temporal directed graph convolution network (T-DGCN) is proposed. A directed graph is first constructed to model the movement characteristics of vehicles, and based on this, a directed graph convolution operator is used to capture spatial dependence. For temporal dependence, we couple a keyframe sequence and transformer to learn the tendencies and periodicities of traffic flow. Using a real-world dataset, we confirm the superior performance of the T-DGCN through comparative experiments. Moreover, a detailed discussion is presented to provide the path of reasoning from the data to the model design to the conclusions.

AB  - A smart city is an urbanization region that collects data using several digital and physical devices. The information collected from such devices is used efficiently to manage revenues, resources, and assets, etc., while the information obtained from such devices is utilized to boost performance throughout the city. Cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications could help smart cities that contain information gathered from citizens, devices, homes, and other things. This information is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage transportation networks, electric utilities, resources management, water supply systems, waste management, crime detection, security mechanisms, proficiency, digital library, healthcare facilities, and other opportunities. A cloud service provider offers public cloud services that can update the IoT environment, enabling third-party activities to embed IoT data within electronic devices executing on the IoT.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11

SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - The negative climate change induced by rapid urbanization has become a global environmental issue. Numerous studies have been devoted to microclimate regulation functions performed by urban vegetation. Digital city information modeling provides a powerful tool for various simulations and data analytics for the sustainable development of urban areas. However, the method reconstructing urban trees is still in its early stage compared to the relatively mature building modeling. Most prior studies on tree reconstruction focused on retrieving geometric features, while other factors related to urban microclimate simulation were rarely addressed. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review and in-depth analysis covering two distinct research directions in relation to urban microclimate simulation. The first one is set on the identification of key factors related to trees’ impact on urban microclimate. The second one is dedicated to approaches for three-dimensional (3D) tree reconstruction. Based on the findings, the paper identifies information including trees’ geometric, physiological characteristics and relation to the surroundings required for 3D tree reconstruction in the context of urban microclimate simulation, and further assesses the potential of the 3D tree reconstruction approaches to accommodate these pieces of information. An appropriate 3D tree reconstruction approach, which allows for the supply of the required information for urban microclimate simulation, is recommended.

AB  - This paper describes an automated method for the calibration of RSS-fingerprinting-based positioning systems. The method assumes using a robotic platform to gather fingerprints in the system environment and using them for training machine learning models. The obtained models are used for positioning purposes during the system operation. The presented calibration method covers all steps of the system calibration, from mapping the system environment using a GraphSLAM based algorithm to training models for radio map calibration. The study analyses four different models: fitting a log-distance path loss model, Gaussian Process Regression, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest Regression. The proposed method was tested in a BLE-based indoor localisation system set up in a fully furnished apartment. The results have shown that the tested models allow for localisation with accuracy comparable to those reported in the literature. In the case of the Neural Network regression, the median error of robot positioning was 0.87 m. The median of trajectory error in a walking person localisation scenario was 0.4 m.

AB  - In the era of limited resources and progressive environmental degradation, the circular economy is a practical application of sustainable development. It is an alternative, but also competitive way to achieve economic growth in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. This issue was considered in this paper in the context of the Ukrainian economy. The Ukrainian economy’s transformation into a circular one needs to find ways to choose practical tools for such a transition, considering the destructive impact of economic activities on the environment, population, and economy. The goal was to develop a method of choosing tools for the circular transformations of economic activities for each cluster and to reduce man-made damage to the environment. Cluster analysis, fuzzy C-means method, and grouping of economic activities were used. Two analyzed sectors turned out to be the most interesting: mining and quarrying, and electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning supply, which were finally assigned to the cluster with a high level of destructive impact, defined as ‘environmentally unfriendly’. The proposed method allows the choice of circular transformation tools for economic activities depending on the destructive impact of these economic activities within each cluster.

TI  - Spatial Pattern Simulation of Land Use Based on FLUS Model under Ecological Protection: A Case Study of Hengyang City
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 18
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - With rapid economic development in China, the excessive expansion of cities has led to the imbalance of land use structure, and then the ecological regulation function of the land ecosystem experiences problems, which has become an obstacle to sustainable development. Therefore, in order to protect the ecological environment, regulate urban development and pursue the maximization of ecological benefits, it is necessary to analyze, simulate and predict land use change. In this study, Hengyang City was taken as the study area, and based on the current land use data of Hengyang City in 2010, 2015, and 2018, the land use type transfer during 2010–2015 and 2015–2018 was analyzed. Then, starting from 2010, the FLUS model was used to simulate the spatial distribution of land use in 2015 and 2018, and then the spatial distribution of land use in Hengyang City in 2025 was predicted with the Markov prediction method under the premise of ecological protection priority. The results show that the change in ecological land in Hengyang City is mainly distributed in the surrounding and marginal areas, because the topography of Hengyang City is a basin. Changes in land type in Hengyang City in 2015 were subtle and difficult to observe. However, in 2018, the transformation of non-ecological land into ecological land was obvious, and the distribution area of ecological land expanded significantly. The Kappa index of the results simulated by the FLUS model based on neural network is above 0.72, and overall accuracy is above 0.9, which is highly consistent with the actual situation. It is reasonable and convincing to predict the spatial distribution of land use in the context of ecological protection. The predicted results can be useful for urban planning and land use distribution and provide a reference for relevant decision-makers.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have grown rapidly in recent years and are considered by both academia and industry to be key enablers for Industry 4.0. As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and human–robot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels. A route for AI-integration in multiscale/fidelity DTs with multiscale/fidelity data sources in Industry 4.0 is outlined.

TI  - An Attribute-Based Access Control for IoT Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 19
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - With opportunities brought by the Internet of Things (IoT), it is quite a challenge to maintain concurrency and privacy when a huge number of resource-constrained distributed devices are involved. Blockchain have become popular for its benefits, including decentralization, persistence, immutability, auditability, and consensus. Great attention has been received by the IoT based on the construction of distributed file systems worldwide. A new generation of IoT-based distributed file systems has been proposed with the integration of Blockchain technology, such as the Swarm and Interplanetary File System. By using IoT, new technical challenges, such as Credibility, Harmonization, large-volume data, heterogeneity, and constrained resources are arising. To ensure data security in IoT, centralized access control technologies do not provide credibility. In this work, we propose an attribute-based access control model for the IoT. The access control lists are not required for each device by the system. It enhances access management in terms of effectiveness. Moreover, we use blockchain technology for recording the attribute, avoiding data tempering, and eliminating a single point of failure at edge computing devices. IoT devices control the user’s environment as well as his or her private data collection; therefore, the exposure of the user’s personal data to non-trusted private and public servers may result in privacy leakage. To automate the system, smart contracts are used for data accessing, whereas Proof of Authority is used for enhancing the system’s performance and optimizing gas consumption. Through smart contracts, ciphertext can be stored on a blockchain by the data owner. Data can only be decrypted in a valid access period, whereas in blockchains, the trace function is achieved by the storage of invocation and the creation of smart contracts. Scalability issues can also be resolved by using the multichain blockchain. Eventually, it is concluded from the simulation results that the proposed system is efficient for IoT.

AB  - Rapidly developed information technologies (IT) have continuously empowered manufacturing systems and accelerated the evolution of manufacturing system paradigms, and smart manufacturing (SM) has become one of the most promising paradigms. The study of SM has attracted a great deal of attention for researchers in academia and practitioners in industry. However, an obvious fact is that people with different backgrounds have different expectations for SM, and this has led to high diversity, ambiguity, and inconsistency in terms of definitions, reference models, performance matrices, and system design methodologies. It has been found that the state of the art SM research is limited in two aspects: (1) the highly diversified understandings of SM may lead to overlapped, missed, and non-systematic research efforts in advancing the theory and methodologies in the field of SM; (2) few works have been found that focus on the development of generic design methodologies for smart manufacturing systems from the practice perspective. The novelty of this paper consists of two main aspects which are reported in two parts respectively. In the first part, a simplified definition of SM is proposed to unify the existing diversified expectations, and a newly developed concept named digital triad (DT-II) is adopted to define a reference model for SM. The common features of smart manufacturing systems in various applications are identified as functional requirements (FRs) in systems design. To model a system that is capable of reconfiguring itself to adapt to changes, the concept of IoDTT is proposed as a reference model for smart manufacturing systems. In the second part, these two concepts are used to formulate a system design problem, and a generic methodology, based on axiomatic design theory (ADT), is proposed for the design of smart manufacturing systems.

AB  - Using Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 standard, radio frequency waves are mainly used for communication on various devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and smart televisions. Apart from communication applications, the recent research in wireless technology has turned Wi-Fi into other exploration possibilities such as human activity recognition (HAR). HAR is a field of study that aims to predict motion and movement made by a person or even several people. There are numerous possibilities to use the Wi-Fi-based HAR solution for human-centric applications in intelligent surveillance, such as human fall detection in the health care sector or for elderly people nursing homes, smart homes for temperature control, a light control application, and motion detection applications. This paper’s focal point is to classify human activities such as EMPTY, LYING, SIT, SIT-DOWN, STAND, STAND-UP, WALK, and FALL with deep neural networks, such as long-term short memory (LSTM) and support vector machines (SVM). Special care was taken to address practical issues such as using available commodity hardware. Therefore, the open-source tool Nexmon was used for the channel state information (CSI) extraction on inexpensive hardware (Raspberry Pi 3B+, Pi 4B, and Asus RT-AC86U routers). We conducted three different types of experiments using different algorithms, which all demonstrated a similar accuracy in prediction for HAR with an accuracy between 97% and 99.7% (Raspberry Pi) and 96.2% and 100% (Asus RT-AC86U), for the best models, which is superior to previously published results. We also provide the acquired datasets and disclose details about the experimental setups.

AB  - In entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), geographical and contextual factors play a big role in shaping the knowledge bases for digital innovation. While cities around the world compete to be perceived as successful “tech startup hubs”, proactive urban strategies are needed to create knowledge spillovers into EEs. This study explores the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) knowledge practices in the EEs of Berlin and Sydney by using knowledge-spillover theory of entrepreneurship. The study utilizes a bibliometric analysis of secondary data in combination with exploratory stakeholder interviews conducted for both cities. Findings underline the critical role of experimental knowledge in driving the momentum of the EEs and the supporting role of policies imprinting knowledge practices. The paper shows how the dynamics of EEs can be explored empirically and raises awareness of the role of specialised and integrated policies in determining a city’s overall success in building EEs.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The transportation sector has traditionally been considered essential for commercial activities, although nowadays, it presents clear negative impacts on the environment and can reduce social welfare. Thus, advanced optimization techniques are required to design sustainable routes with low logistic costs. Moreover, these negative impacts may be significantly increased as a consequence of the lack of synergy between the sustainability objectives. Correspondingly, the concept of transport optimization in smart cities is becoming popular in both the real world and academia when public decision making is lit by operations research models. In this paper, however, we argue that the level of urban smartness depends on its sustainability and on the level of information and communication technologies developed in the city. Therefore, the operations research models seek to achieve a higher threshold in the sustainable transport standards in smart cities. Thus, we present a generic definition of smart city, which includes the triple bottom line of sustainability, with the purpose of analyzing its effects on city performance. Finally, this work provides a consolidate study about urban freight transport problems, which show that sustainability is only one facet of the diamond of characteristics that depict a real smart city.

SN  - 2075-4426

AB  - The psychiatric diagnostic procedure is currently based on self-reports that are subject to personal biases. Therefore, the diagnostic process would benefit greatly from data-driven tools that can enhance accuracy and specificity. In recent years, many studies have achieved promising results in detecting and diagnosing depression based on machine learning (ML) analysis. Despite these favorable results in depression diagnosis, which are primarily based on ML analysis of neuroimaging data, most patients do not have access to neuroimaging tools. Hence, objective assessment tools are needed that can be easily integrated into the routine psychiatric diagnostic process. One solution is to use behavioral data, which can be easily collected while still maintaining objectivity. The current paper summarizes the main ML-based approaches that use behavioral data in diagnosing depression and other psychiatric disorders. We classified these studies into two main categories: (a) laboratory-based assessments and (b) data mining, the latter of which we further divided into two sub-groups: (i) social media usage and movement sensors data and (ii) demographic and clinical information. The paper discusses the advantages and challenges in this field and suggests future research directions and implementations. The paper’s overarching aim is to serve as a first step in synthetizing existing knowledge about ML-based behavioral diagnosis studies in order to develop interventions and individually tailored treatments in the future.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - With data collected by Internet of Things sensors, deep learning (DL) models can forecast the generation capacity of photovoltaic (PV) power plants. This functionality is especially relevant for PV power operators and users as PV plants exhibit irregular behavior related to environmental conditions. However, DL models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which may lead to increased predictive error and wrong operational decisions. This work proposes a new scheme to detect adversarial examples and mitigate their impact on DL forecasting models. This approach is based on one-class classifiers and features extracted from the data inputted to the forecasting models. Tests were performed using data collected from a real-world PV power plant along with adversarial samples generated by the Fast Gradient Sign Method under multiple attack patterns and magnitudes. One-class Support Vector Machine and Local Outlier Factor were evaluated as detectors of attacks to Long-Short Term Memory and Temporal Convolutional Network forecasting models. According to the results, the proposed scheme showed a high capability of detecting adversarial samples with an average F1-score close to 90%. Moreover, the detection and mitigation approach strongly reduced the prediction error increase caused by adversarial samples.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Carpooling schemes for mutual cost benefits between the driver and the passengers has a long history. However, the convenience of driving alone, the increasing level of car ownership, and the difficulties in finding travelers with matching timing and routes keep car occupancy low. Technology is a key enabler of online platforms which facilitate the ride matching process and lead to an increase in carpooling services. Smart carpooling services may be an alternative and enrichment for mobility, which can help smart cities (SCs) reduce traffic congestion and gas emissions but require the appropriate architecture to support connection with the city infrastructure such as high-occupancy vehicle lanes, parking space, tolls, and the public transportation services. To better understand the evolution of carpooling platforms in SCs, bibliometric analysis of three separate specialized literature collections, combined with a systematic literature review, is performed. It is identified that smart carpooling platforms could generate additional value for participants and SCs. To deliver this value to an SC, a multi-sided platform business model is proposed, suitable for a carpooling service provider with multiple customer segments and partners. Finally, after examining the SC structure, a carpooling platform architecture is presented, which interconnects with the applicable smart city layers.

AB  - This paper surveys the deep learning (DL) approaches for intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) in Internet of Things (IoT) and the associated datasets toward identifying gaps, weaknesses, and a neutral reference architecture. A comparative study of IDSs is provided, with a review of anomaly-based IDSs on DL approaches, which include supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid methods. All techniques in these three categories have essentially been used in IoT environments. To date, only a few have been used in the anomaly-based IDS for IoT. For each of these anomaly-based IDSs, the implementation of the four categories of feature(s) extraction, classification, prediction, and regression were evaluated. We studied important performance metrics and benchmark detection rates, including the requisite efficiency of the various methods. Four machine learning algorithms were evaluated for classification purposes: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Therefore, we compared each via the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The study model exhibits promising outcomes for all classes of attacks. The scope of our analysis examines attacks targeting the IoT ecosystem using empirically based, simulation-generated datasets (namely the Bot-IoT and the IoTID20 datasets).

TI  - A CSI-Based Indoor Positioning System Using Single UWB Ranging Correction
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 19
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A fingerprint-based localization system is an economic way to solve an indoor positioning problem. However, the traditional off-line fingerprint collection stage is a time-consuming and laborious process which limits the use of fingerprint-based localization systems. In this paper, based on ubiquitous Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) equipment and a low-cost Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging system (with only one UWB anchor), a ready-to-use indoor localization system is proposed to realize long-term and high-accuracy indoor positioning. More specifically, in this system, it is divided into two stages: (1) an initial stage, and (2) a positioning stage. In the initial stage, an Inertial Measure Unit (IMU) is used to calculate the position using Pedestrian Dead Reckon (PDR) algorithm within a preset number of steps, and the location-related fingerprints are collected to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression model; simultaneously, in order to make the UWB ranging system adapt to the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environment, the increments of acceleration and angular velocity in IMU and the increments of single UWB ranging measures are correlated to pre-train a Supported Vector Regression (SVR). After reaching the threshold of time or step number, the system is changed into a positioning stage, and the CNN predicts the position calibrated by corrected UWB ranging. At last, a series of practical experiments are conducted in the real environment; the experiment results show that, due to the corrected UWB ranging measures calibrating the CNN parameters in every positioning period, this system has stable localization results in a comparative long-term range. Additionally, it has the advantages of stability, low cost, anti-noise, etc.

AB  - Real-time health monitoring of civil infrastructures is performed to maintain their structural integrity, sustainability, and serviceability for a longer time. With smart electronics and packaging technology, large amounts of complex monitoring data are generated, requiring sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for their processing. With the advancement of technology, more complex AI models have been applied, from simple models to sophisticated deep learning (DL) models, for structural health monitoring (SHM). In this article, a comprehensive review is performed, primarily on the applications of AI models for SHM to maintain the sustainability of diverse civil infrastructures. Three smart data capturing methods of SHM, namely, camera-based, smartphone-based, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based methods, are also discussed, having made the utilization of intelligent paradigms easier. UAV is found to be the most promising smart data acquisition technology, whereas convolution neural networks are the most impressive DL model reported for SHM. Furthermore, current challenges and future perspectives of AI-based SHM systems are also described separately. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city concepts are explained to elaborate on the contributions of intelligent SHM systems. The integration of SHM with IoT and cloud-based computing is leading us towards the evolution of future smart cities.

TI  - Traffic Signal Control System Based on Intelligent Transportation System and Reinforcement Learning

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 19
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Traffic congestion has several causes, including insufficient road capacity, unrestricted demand and improper scheduling of traffic signal phases. A great variety of efforts have been made to properly program such phases. Some of them are based on traditional transportation assumptions, and others are adaptive, allowing the system to learn the control law (signal program) from data obtained from different sources. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a technique commonly used in previous research. However, properly determining the states and the reward is key to obtain good results and to have a real chance to implement it. This paper proposes and implements a traffic signal control system (TSCS), detailing its development stages: (a) Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) architecture design for the TSCS; (b) design and development of a system prototype, including an RL algorithm to minimize the vehicle queue at intersections, and detection and calculation of such queues by adapting a computer vision algorithm; and (c) design and development of system tests to validate operation of the algorithms and the system prototype. Results include the development of the tests for each module (vehicle queue measurement and RL algorithm) and real-time integration tests. Finally, the article presents a system simulation in the context of a medium-sized city in a developing country, showing that the proposed system allowed reduction of vehicle queues by 29%, of waiting time by 50%, and of lost time by 50%, when compared to fixed phase times in traffic signals.

AB  - Since the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) was invented, it has received extensive attention from researchers. Among the many pieces of research based on TENG, the research of hybridized generators is progressing rapidly. In recent years, the research and application of the electromagnetic–triboelectric hybridized nanogenerator (EMG-TENG) have made great progress. This review mainly focuses on the latest research development of EMG-TENG and elaborates on the principles, materials, structure, and applications of EMG-TENG. In this paper, the microscopic charge transfer mechanism of TENG is explained by the most primitive friction electrification phenomenon and electrostatic induction phenomenon. The commonly used materials for fabricating TENG and the selection and modification methods of the materials are introduced. According to the difference in structure, EMG-TENG is divided into two categories: vibratory EMG-TENG and rotating EMG-TENG. The summary explains the application of EMG-TENG, including the energy supply and self-powered system of small electronic devices, EMG-TENG as a sensor, and EMG-TENG in wearable devices. Finally, based on summarizing previous studies, the author puts forward new views on the development direction of EMG-TENG.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Most cities have adopted smart city services to solve urban problems. However, an examination of their operations reveals that many of these services have either been discontinued or have failed to advance further since they were not profitable. Therefore, this study reviews and proposes the business models of smart city services at a fundamental level. It defines and classifies the smart city service focusing on transportation and the components. The business model has been constructed for electric vehicles and autonomous shuttle businesses in terms of transportation services. It found that the model was profitable in each business only when various stakeholders were linked for mutual interests. Since various service stakeholders cooperate in smart city service, if one of them is unable to secure profitability, it is difficult to operate the smart city service fully. Therefore, a detailed review of the business model is required before providing a smart city service.

TI  - Fraud Detection Using the Fraud Triangle Theory and Data Mining Techniques: A Literature Review
T2  - Computers

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2073-431X

AB  - Fraud entails deception in order to obtain illegal gains; thus, it is mainly evidenced within financial institutions and is a matter of general interest. The problem is particularly complex, since perpetrators of fraud could belong to any position, from top managers to payroll employees. Fraud detection has traditionally been performed by auditors, who mainly employ manual techniques. These could take too long to process fraud-related evidence. Data mining, machine learning, and, as of recently, deep learning strategies are being used to automate this type of processing. Many related techniques have been developed to analyze, detect, and prevent fraud-related behavior, with the fraud triangle associated with the classic auditing model being one of the most important of these. This work aims to review current work related to fraud detection that uses the fraud triangle in addition to machine learning and deep learning techniques. We used the Kitchenham methodology to analyze the research works related to fraud detection from the last decade. This review provides evidence that fraud is an area of active investigation. Several works related to fraud detection using machine learning techniques were identified without the evidence that they incorporated the fraud triangle as a method for more efficient analysis.

AB  - Building on the debate about global convergence or divergence of practices, this study aims to query the viability of a new strategic action tool specifically geared to the interests of public bus transportation authorities (PBTA) around the globe and explore the degree of homogeneity in their responses as well as the possible drivers of them. To answer its research question, the study first offers a generic business model design for a PBTA, which integrates an extended version of the business model canvas with external environmental factors in order to enhance its sustainability. Subsequently, the importance attributions of international transportation experts to different model components are evaluated by using the Spherical Fuzzy AHP method. The model is developed in three hierarchical layers and evaluated by experts from four continents: America, Asia, Australia, and Europe. The results indicate that the expert opinions tend to converge more on the internal components of the model and diverge on the external components, especially regarding economic and technological factors. A strategic response action set is also designed to facilitate the adoption of the model by PBTA. The study not only extends the research on the strategic management of the public bus transportation domain but also contributes to the convergence and divergence debate by offering a reconciliatory duality perspective.

AB  - This paper proposes an Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model for diagnosis of combined Inter Turn Short Circuit (ITSC) and Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) faults in a Squirrel Cage Induction Motor (SC-IM). The signal of the stator current is obtained from a really healthy and faulty SC-IM. Experimental tests have been set up using a 1.5 Hp/380 V three-phase SC-IM with different combined ITSC and BRB faults under different loading conditions. Before entering the model, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) pre-processes the stator current signal. The DWT generates data sets in order to evaluate the proposed technique. ANFIS based on DWT is used successfully to diagnose the most relevant faults very effectively. In addition, ANFIS based on the DWT method has been compared to ANFIS and ANFIS based on an auto-regressive model, finding that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency than the previous one. The proposed ANFIS based on the DWT model classifies entirely different states of combined ITSC and BRB faults with high accuracy.

AB  - This paper presents and discusses the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) and crowdsourcing in constructing smart cities. The literature review shows an important and increasing concern of the scientific community for these three issues and their association as support for urban development. Based on an extensive literature review, the paper first presents the smart city concept, emphasizing smart city architecture and the role of data in smart city solutions. The second part presents the Internet of Things, focusing on IoT technology, the use of IoT in smart city applications, and security. Finally, the paper presents crowdsourcing with particular attention to mobile crowdsourcing and its role in smart cities. The paper shows that IoT and crowdsourcing have a crucial role in two fundamental layers of smart city applications, namely, the data collection and services layers. Since these two layers ensure the connection between the physical and digital worlds, they constitute the central pillars of smart city projects. The literature review also shows that the smart city development still requires stronger cooperation between the smart city technology-centered research, mainly based on the IoT, and the smart city citizens-centered research, mainly based on crowdsourcing. This cooperation could beneficiate in recent developments in the field of crowdsensing that combines IoT and crowdsourcing.

AB  - Water is a critically important element of human life. The best practice of effective water management comes from ancient civilizations that, despite their technologies and practices, were unable to prevent collapse from water scarcity. In the 21st century, in an era of climate change, pollution or population explosion, cities are looking for innovative ways to effectively manage scarce resources for future generations. Which elements should cities of the future follow to avoid water collapse? The following article aims to identify the key elements of effective management and to represent them graphically in the form of a recommended model, which will be verified in the future in Slovakia. The article uses case analysis of best past and current practices, comparison and summarization to identify the elements, creativity, and logic in the development of the model, including induction and deduction. The article serves as a basis for fellow researchers (analyses carried out) and strategic urban management (effective urban water management). The main finding of the article is that ecological change puts pressure on social elements and therefore it is necessary to focus on the area of strategic management. Cities should not only know how to manage resource abundance or short-term scarcity, but also long-term scarcity. They should use elements of trust, awareness and continuous improvement through modern monitoring technologies (UAVs, sensors) and prediction (machine learning). This is the only way to generate water sustainability in the urban concept of the future.

AB  - With the emergence of fog and edge computing, new possibilities arise regarding the data-driven management of citizens’ mobility in smart cities. Internet of Things (IoT) analytics refers to the use of these technologies, data, and analytical models to describe the current status of the city traffic, to predict its evolution over the coming hours, and to make decisions that increase the efficiency of the transportation system. It involves many challenges such as how to deal and manage real and huge amounts of data, and improving security, privacy, scalability, reliability, and quality of services in the cloud and vehicular network. In this paper, we review the state of the art of IoT in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), identify challenges posed by cloud, fog, and edge computing in ITS, and develop a methodology based on agile optimization algorithms for solving a dynamic ride-sharing problem (DRSP) in the context of edge/fog computing. These algorithms allow us to process, in real time, the data gathered from IoT systems in order to optimize automatic decisions in the city transportation system, including: optimizing the vehicle routing, recommending customized transportation modes to the citizens, generating efficient ride-sharing and car-sharing strategies, create optimal charging station for electric vehicles and different services within urban and interurban areas. A numerical example considering a DRSP is provided, in which the potential of employing edge/fog computing, open data, and agile algorithms is illustrated.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - AMIs (Advanced Metering Infrastructures) present an important role in Smart City environments, especially from the point of view of distribution and customers, offering control and monitoring capabilities. The use of PLC (Power Line Communication) technology offers a wide range of advantages in AMI, including not needing to deploy an additional communication infrastructure. However, the electrical network was not initially designed for communications, as these networks pose problems depending on the connected loads, such as network impedance variation, frequency selectivity or noise. For this reason, the use of simulators is proposed to facilitate the deployments based on PLC networks, and analysis and diagnosis tools for the identification of problems in operating networks are also required. This paper presents a toolkit for evaluating and analyzing the performance of PLC networks. This toolkit is composed of SimPRIME, a simulator for the evaluation of NB-PLC PRIME (PoweR line Intelligent Metering Evolution) networks’ performance; SimBPL, a simulator for the evaluation of MV-BPL (Broadband Power Line over Medium Voltage) cells’ performance; and PRIME Analytics, a forensics tool that allows diagnosis of communication problems in PRIME operational networks based on traffic traces. The toolkit has been developed throughout several research projects in close collaboration with DSOs (Distribution System Operators) and equipment manufacturers, so they provide solutions to actual problems of these industry key players and have been adapted to facilitate their use. As a result, the tools are accessible through web applications to increase their usability, portability, and scalability. These applications represent the first steps in offering PLC simulation and analysis as a service that could benefit the research community, academia, and industry.

AB  - Plastic and petrochemical industries are lagging behind in terms of environmental sustainability performance because of the nature of these industries. Although plastic and petrochemical industries have adopted lean manufacturing and/or Industry 4.0 technologies, more efforts are needed to enhance sustainable development. The purpose of this study is to explore the integrated impact of Industry 4.0 technologies and lean manufacturing on the sustainability performance of plastic and petrochemical industries in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, it investigates the casual relationship between Industry 4.0 technologies and sustainability performance as well as the direct linkage between Industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing. A questionnaire is used as the primary instrument for collecting data from 112 plastic and petrochemical organizations. A hypothesized relationship is formulated and then analyzed using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The outcome of the analysis shows that Industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing have a positive impact on sustainability performance. The study also presents a list of valid constructs for Industry 4.0 technologies, lean manufacturing, and sustainability performance. Furthermore, the study shows that the plastic and petrochemical industries in Saudi Arabia acknowledge and recognize the contribution of Industry 4.0 technologies and lean manufacturing principles to the protection of the environment as a dimension of sustainability performance.

AB  - In recent decades, modern societies are experiencing an increasing adoption of interconnected smart devices. This revolution involves not only canonical devices such as smartphones and tablets, but also simple objects like light bulbs. Named the Internet of Things (IoT), this ever-growing scenario offers enormous opportunities in many areas of modern society, especially if joined by other emerging technologies such as, for example, the blockchain. Indeed, the latter allows users to certify transactions publicly, without relying on central authorities or intermediaries. This work aims to exploit the scenario above by proposing a novel blockchain-based distributed paradigm to secure localization services, here named the Internet of Entities (IoE). It represents a mechanism for the reliable localization of people and things, and it exploits the increasing number of existing wireless devices and blockchain-based distributed ledger technologies. Moreover, unlike most of the canonical localization approaches, it is strongly oriented towards the protection of the users’ privacy. Finally, its implementation requires minimal efforts since it employs the existing infrastructures and devices, thus giving life to a new and wide data environment, exploitable in many domains, such as e-health, smart cities, and smart mobility.

AB  - As a typical application of sensor networks, there exist many information security problems in smart parks, such as confusion of personnel access, lack of security management, disorderly data flow, insufficient collection of audit evidence, and so on. Aiming at the scenario of personnel and equipment moving in different areas of smart parks, the paper proposes a joint authorization and dynamic access control mechanism, which can provide unified identity management services, access control services, and policy management services, and effectively solve the problem of multi-authorization in user identity and authority management. The license negotiation interaction protocol is designed to prevent common network attack threats in the process of identity authentication and authority management. In order to realize the tamper-proof storage of personnel and equipment movement trajectory, the paper also designs a movement trajectory traceability protocol based on a Merkle tree, which solves the problems of internal personnel malicious attack, trusted third-party dependency bottleneck, high overheads of tracking algorithms, and so on. The experimental results show that compared with the current security control mechanisms for sensor networks, the joint authorization, and dynamic access control mechanism can support multi-party authorization and traceability, while the overhead it generates in initialization, encryption, decryption, and key generation steps are basically the same as other mechanisms do.

Digital twins (DTs) is the key technology to realize intelligent construction. The virtual and real interaction of the DTs can provide an efficient management and control mechanism for the construction process. This research proposes an intelligent safety assessment method of prestressed steel structures based on DTs. In this research method, the structural safety assessment is divided into two aspects: performance analysis and maintenance. By analyzing the characteristics of the construction safety assessment, a DTs framework for construction safety assessment is built. Driven by the DTs framework, a physical space model and a virtual space model are constructed. On the basis of virtual and actual interaction, multidimensional information fusion of time and space is carried out to realize the analysis of structural safety performance. On this basis, the paper establishes a Bow-tie model for the maintenance modeling of unsafe construction events. Moreover, the theoretical method formed is applied to the construction of a symmetrical structure (wheel–spoke cable truss). The validity of the method is verified by comparing the cable force calculated by the theoretical method and measured on site. The assessment method driven by the DTs ensures the structural safety and improves the intelligence level of safety management and control of the structure construction.

AB  - With growing evidence of deep learning-assisted smart process planning, there is an essential demand for comprehending whether cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) are adequate in managing complexity and flexibility, configuring the smart factory. In this research, prior findings were cumulated indicating that the interoperability between Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics and cyber-physical process monitoring systems can decide upon the progression of operations advancing a system to the intended state in CPPSs. We carried out a quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science throughout March and August 2021, with search terms including “cyber-physical production systems”, “cyber-physical manufacturing systems”, “smart process manufacturing”, “smart industrial manufacturing processes”, “networked manufacturing systems”, “industrial cyber-physical systems,” “smart industrial production processes”, and “sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing systems”. As we analyzed research published between 2017 and 2021, only 489 papers met the eligibility criteria. By removing controversial or unclear findings (scanty/unimportant data), results unsupported by replication, undetailed content, or papers having quite similar titles, we decided on 164, chiefly empirical, sources. Subsequent analyses should develop on real-time sensor networks, so as to configure the importance of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics by use of cyber-physical production networks.

TI  - A Deep Learning Method for Monitoring Vehicle Energy Consumption with GPS Data
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 20
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - A monitoring method for energy consumption of vehicles is proposed in the study. It is necessary to have parameters estimating fuel economy with GPS data obtained while driving in the proposed method. The parameters are trained by fuel consumption data measured with a data logger for the reference cars. The data logger is equipped with a GPS sensor and OBD connection capability. The GPS sensor measures vehicle speed, acceleration rate and road gradient. The OBD connector gathers the fuel consumption signaled from OBD port built in the car. The parameters are trained by a 5-layer deep-learning construction with input data (speed, acceleration, gradient) and labels (fuel consumption data) in the typical classification approach. The number of labels is about 6–8 and the number of neurons for hidden layers increases in proportionate to the label numbers. There are about 160–200 parameters. The parameters are calibrated to consider the wide range of fuel efficiency and deterioration degree in age for various test cars. The calibration factor is made from the certified fuel economy and model year taken from the car registration form. The error range of the estimated fuel economy from the measured value is about −6% to +7% for the eight test cars. It is accurate enough to capture the vehicle dynamics for using the input and output data in point-to-point classification style for training steps. Further, it is simple enough to hit fuel economy of the other test cars because fuel economy is a kind of averaged value of fuel consumption for the time period or driven distance for monitoring steps. You can predict or monitor energy consumption for any vehicle with the GPS-measured speed/acceleration/gradient data by the pre-trained parameters and calibration factors of the reference vehicles according to fuel types such as gasoline, diesel and electric. The proposed method requires just a GPS sensor that is cheap and common, and the calculating procedure is so simple that you can monitor energy consumption of various vehicles in real-time with ease. However, it does not consider weight, weather and auxiliary changes and these effects will be addressed in the future works with a monitoring service system under preparation.

SN  - 2073-431X

AB  - Serverless computing is a new concept allowing developers to focus on the core functionality of their code, while abstracting away the underlying infrastructure. Even though there are existing commercial serverless cloud providers and open-source solutions, dealing with the explosive growth of new Internet of Things (IoT) devices requires more efficient bandwidth utilization, reduced latency, and data preprocessing closer to the source, thus reducing the overall data volume and meeting privacy regulations. Moving serverless computing to the edge of the network is a topic that is actively being researched with the aim of solving these issues. This study presents a systematic mapping review of current progress made to this effect, analyzing work published between 1 January 2015 and 1 September 2021. Using a document selection methodology which emphasizes the quality of the papers obtained through querying several popular databases with relevant search terms, we have included 64 entries, which we then further categorized into eight main categories. Results show that there is an increasing interest in this area with rapid progress being made to solve the remaining open issues, which have also been summarized in this paper. Special attention is paid to open-source efforts, as well as open-access contributions.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The objective of the article is to analyze, based on social exchange theory, the different risk and safety perceptions of employees and customers in the hospitality industry regarding the protections against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in an emerging market, namely in Romania. To this end, a questionnaire was administered simultaneously to both categories in Romanian hospitality units obtaining a sample of 561 employees and customers in the sector. While the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus has generated a lot of diverse research, studies focused on this particular topic, also regarding both customers and employees, were much less exploited. Therefore, eleven working hypotheses were formulated. It was highlighted that there is a positive perception of safety at work for employees, and jobs are protected from disappearance due to the pandemic through active measures taken by the organization. Employees do not show a significant desire to change jobs due to the new working conditions. The magnitude of safety measures taken had a positive impact on the customers, and customers do not pose a significant threat in hospitality industry units regarding the possibility of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The paper enlarges the understanding of behavioral effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, while from a managerial perspective the results are particularly useful for hospitality industry owners in order to attract and retain employees and to communicate and develop better relations with customers.

AB  - Despite the trending studies on smart city development, how to evaluate the smartness of a city remains unclear. This research aimed to design a smart city evaluation system, named the City Intelligence Quotient (CityIQ) evaluation system, which considers both the hard (e.g., physical infrastructure) and soft sides (e.g., citizens’ perspectives) of smart city development. Based on the two-level structure of the CityIQ evaluation system (i.e., five dimensions and twenty indicators), a list of keywords was defined for automated information scraping in leading social media platforms to obtain volunteered geographic information. Semantic analysis was then used to update the CityIQ evaluations in a timely manner. Fifteen major cities in the Yangtze River Delta region, China, were selected for the empirical study, in which their smartness indices were calculated, traced and compared. Finally, suggestions for collaborative smart agglomerations were put forward. With the CityIQ evaluation system, policy makers can be informed of up-to-date changes in urban smartness levels and, thus, design context-specific collaborative policies to promote smart agglomerations.

AB  - Taxi waiting times is an important criterion for taxi passengers to choose appropriate pick-up locations in urban environments. How to predict the taxi waiting time accurately at a certain time and location is the key solution for the imbalance between the taxis’ supplies and demands. Considering the life schedule of urban residents and the different functions of geogrid regions, the research developed in this paper introduces a spatio-temporal schedule-based neural network for urban taxi waiting time prediction. The approach integrates a series of multi-source data from taxi trajectories to city points of interest, different time frames and human behaviors in the city. We apply a grid-based and functional structuration of an urban space that provides a lower-level data representation. Overall, the neural network model can dynamically predict the waiting time of taxi passengers in real time under some given spatio-temporal constraints. The experimental results show that the granular-based grids and spatio-temporal neural network can effectively predict and optimize the accuracy of taxi waiting times. This work provides a decision support for intelligent travel predictions of taxi waiting time in a smart city.

VL  - 5
IS  - 4
SN  - 2504-2289

AB  - With the rapid development of 5G communications, enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine type communications and ultra-reliable low latency communications are widely supported. However, a 5G communication system is still based on Shannon’s information theory, while the meaning and value of information itself are not taken into account in the process of transmission. Therefore, it is difficult to meet the requirements of intelligence, customization, and value transmission of 6G networks. In order to solve the above challenges, we propose a 6G mailbox theory, namely a cognitive information carrier to enable distributed algorithm embedding for intelligence networking. Based on Mailbox, a 6G network will form an intelligent agent with self-organization, self-learning, self-adaptation, and continuous evolution capabilities. With the intelligent agent, redundant transmission of data can be reduced while the value transmission of information can be improved. Then, the features of mailbox principle are introduced, including polarity, traceability, dynamics, convergence, figurability, and dependence. Furthermore, key technologies with which value transmission of information can be realized are introduced, including knowledge graph, distributed learning, and blockchain. Finally, we establish a cognitive communication system assisted by deep learning. The experimental results show that, compared with a traditional communication system, our communication system performs less data transmission quantity and error.

AB  - Public transport has become one of the major transport options, especially when it comes to reducing motorized individual transport and achieving sustainability while reducing emissions, noise and so on. The use of public transport data has evolved and rapidly improved over the past decades. Indeed, the availability of data from different sources, coupled with advances in analytical and predictive approaches, has contributed to increased attention being paid to the exploitation of available data to improve public transport service. In this paper, we review the current state of the art of public transport data sources. More precisely, we summarize and analyze the potential and challenges of the main data sources. In addition, we show the complementary aspects of these data sources and how to merge them to broaden their contributions and face their challenges. This is complemented by an information management framework to enhance the use of data sources. Specifically, we seek to bridge the gap between traditional data sources and recent ones, present a unified overview of them and show how they can all leverage recent advances in data-driven methods and how they can help achieve a balance between transit service and passenger behavior.

AB  - The widespread use of mobile devices and sensors has motivated data-driven applications that can leverage the power of big data to benefit many aspects of our daily life, such as health, transportation, economy, and environment. Under the context of smart city, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), as a main building block of modern cities, and edge computing (EC), as an emerging computing service that targets addressing the limitations of cloud computing, have attracted increasing attention in the research community in recent years. It is well believed that the application of EC in ITS will have considerable benefits to transportation systems regarding efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Despite the growing trend in ITS and EC research, a big gap in the existing literature is identified: the intersection between these two promising directions has been far from well explored. In this paper, we focus on a critical part of ITS, i.e., sensing, and conducting a review on the recent advances in ITS sensing and EC applications in this field. The key challenges in ITS sensing and future directions with the integration of edge computing are discussed.

AB  - Different technological, socio-economic, geopolitical, and demographic factors have a significant influence on labor markets. Currently, due to COVID-19, the global economy is in a challenging situation, and millions of people from different countries have lost their jobs. The employee’s mental health and well-being are in risk conditions. In the coming years, the Polish energy sector will face several transformations. Emerging technologies are intended to deal with the problems in energy management. One of the main industry forces is human capital, people who will be able to project and manage the innovative technologies. Thus, this paper examines the determinants of managerial competences transformation in the energy industry from the labor market perspective. The paper fulfills the research gap in the energy manager profession’s transformation in Poland. The aim of the paper was to present the current state of the energy manager profession in Poland. Two methodological approaches were used: the theoretical and practical approaches. Descriptive statistics are provided to present the labor market research results. The findings of the research can contribute to the literature and practice by applying them in the process of developing energy manager competency models, as well as in education programs and training courses for enterprises and universities.

AB  - In the context of hyper-connected cars and a growing heterogeneous digital ecosystem, we wish to make the most of the data available from the various sensors, devices and services that compose the ecosystem, in order to propose a proof of concept in-vehicle system that enhances the driving experience. We focus on improving the driving experience along three main directions, namely: (1) driving and trip planning, (2) health and well-being and (3) social and online activities. We approached the in-vehicle space as a smart interface to the intelligent driving environment. The digital data-producers in the ecosystem of the connected car are sources of raw data of various categories, such as data from the outside world, gathered from sensors or online services, data from the car itself and data from the driver gathered with various mobile and wearable devices, by means of observing his state and by means of his social media and online activity. Data is later processed into three information categories—driving, wellness, and social—and used to provide multi-modal interaction, namely visual, audio and gesture. The system is implemented to act in response to the trafficked information on different levels of autonomy, either in a reactive manner, by simple monitoring, or in a proactive manner. The system is designed to provide an in-vehicle system that assists the driver with planning the travel (Drive panel), by providing a comfortable environment for the driver while monitoring him (Wellness panel), and by adaptively managing interactions with their phone and the digital environment (Social panel). Heuristic evaluation of the system is performed, with respect to guidelines formulated for automated vehicles, and a SWOT analysis of the system is also presented in the paper.

AB  - This review describes a cloud-based intelligent power management system that uses analytics as a control signal and processes balance achievement pointer, and describes operator acknowledgments that must be shared quickly, accurately, and safely. The current study aims to introduce a conceptual and systematic structure with three main components: demand power (direct current (DC)-device), power mix between renewable energy (RE) and other power sources, and a cloud-based power optimization intelligent system. These methods and techniques monitor demand power (DC-device), load, and power mix between RE and other power sources. Cloud-based power optimization intelligent systems lead to an optimal power distribution solution that reduces power consumption or costs. Data has been collected from reliable sources such as Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed. The overall findings of these studies are visually explained in the proposed conceptual framework through the literature that are considered to be cloud computing based on storing and running the intelligent systems of power management and mixing.

AB  - Distance learning has assumed a relevant role in the educational scenario. The use of Virtual Learning Environments contributes to obtaining a substantial amount of educational data. In this sense, the analyzed data generate knowledge used by institutions to assist managers and professors in strategic planning and teaching. The discovery of students’ behaviors enables a wide variety of intelligent services for assisting in the learning process. This article presents a literature review in order to identify the intelligent services applied in distance learning. The research covers the period from January 2010 to May 2021. The initial search found 1316 articles, among which 51 were selected for further studies. Considering the selected articles, 33% (17/51) focus on learning systems, 35% (18/51) propose recommendation systems, 26% (13/51) approach predictive systems or models, and 6% (3/51) use assessment tools. This review allowed for the observation that the principal services offered are recommendation systems and learning systems. In these services, the analysis of student profiles stands out to identify patterns of behavior, detect low performance, and identify probabilities of dropouts from courses.

A novel approach is used with the COPERT model to estimate fuel consumption on a huge dataset collected over a period of one year. Since the data size is enormous, Apache Spark, a big data analytical framework is used for performance gains while estimating vehicle fuel consumption with the lowest latency possible. The research presents peak and off-peak hours fuel consumption’s in three major cities, i.e., Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. The results can assist smart city professionals to plan alternative trip routes, avoid traffic congestion in order to save fuel and time, and protect against urban pollution for effective smart city planning.

AB  - While extensive research has gone into demand response techniques in data centers, the energy consumed in edge computing systems and in network data transmission remains a significant part of the computing industry’s carbon footprint. The industry also has not fully leveraged the parallel trend of decentralized renewable energy generation, which creates new areas of opportunity for innovation in combined energy and computing systems. Through an interdisciplinary sociotechnical discussion of current energy, computer science and social studies of science and technology (STS) literature, we argue that a more comprehensive set of carbon response techniques needs to be developed that span the continuum of data centers, from the back-end cloud to the network edge. Such techniques need to address the combined needs of decentralized energy and computing systems, alongside the social power dynamics those combinations entail. We call this more comprehensive range “carbon-responsive computing,” and underscore that this continuum constitutes the beginnings of an interconnected infrastructure, elements of which are data-intensive and require the integration of social science disciplines to adequately address problems of inequality, governance, transparency, and definitions of “necessary” tasks in a climate crisis.

VL  - 4
IS  - 4
SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Cities are becoming increasingly complex to manage, as they increase in size and must provide higher living standards for their populations. New technology-based solutions must be developed towards attending this growth and ensuring that it is socially sustainable. This paper puts forward the notion that these solutions must share some properties: they should be anthropocentric, holistic, horizontal, multi-dimensional, multi-modal, and predictive. We propose an architecture in which streaming data sources that characterize the city context are used to feed a real-time graph of the city’s assets and states, as well as to train predictive models that hint into near future states of the city. This allows human decision-makers and automated services to take decisions, both for the present and for the future. To achieve this, multiple data sources about a city were gradually connected to a message broker, that enables increasingly rich decision-support. Results show that it is possible to predict future states of a city, in aspects such as traffic, air pollution, and other ambient variables. The key innovative aspect of this work is that, as opposed to the majority of existing approaches which focus on a real-time view of the city, we also provide insights into the near-future state of the city, thus allowing city services to plan ahead and adapt accordingly. The main goal is to optimize decision-making by anticipating future states of the city and make decisions accordingly.

AB  - Diverse forms of artificial intelligence (AI) are at the forefront of triggering digital security innovations based on the threats that are arising in this post-COVID world. On the one hand, companies are experiencing difficulty in dealing with security challenges with regard to a variety of issues ranging from system openness, decision making, quality control, and web domain, to mention a few. On the other hand, in the last decade, research has focused on security capabilities based on tools such as platform complacency, intelligent trees, modeling methods, and outage management systems in an effort to understand the interplay between AI and those issues. the dependence on the emergence of AI in running industries and shaping the education, transports, and health sectors is now well known in the literature. AI is increasingly employed in managing data security across economic sectors. Thus, a literature review of AI and system security within the current digital society is opportune. This paper aims at identifying research trends in the field through a systematic bibliometric literature review (LRSB) of research on AI and system security. the review entails 77 articles published in the Scopus® database, presenting up-to-date knowledge on the topic. the LRSB results were synthesized across current research subthemes. Findings are presented. the originality of the paper relies on its LRSB method, together with an extant review of articles that have not been categorized so far.

Reinforcement learning (RL), as a powerful machine learning approach, can handle such smart environments without a trainer or supervisor. Recently, we worked on bandwidth management in a smart environment with several fog fragments using limited shared bandwidth, where IoT devices may experience uncertain emergencies in terms of the time and sequence needed for more bandwidth for further higher-level communication. We introduced fog fragment cooperation using an RL approach under a predefined fixed threshold constraint. In this study, we promote this approach by removing the fixed level of restriction of the threshold through hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and completing the cooperation qualification. At the first learning hierarchy level of the proposed approach, the best threshold level is learned over time, and the final results are used by the second learning hierarchy level, where the fog node learns the best device for helping an emergency device by temporarily lending the bandwidth. Although equipping the method to the adaptive threshold and restricting fog fragment cooperation make the learning procedure more difficult, the HRL approach increases the method’s efficiency in terms of time and performance.

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) is playing a major role in smart cities to make a digital environment. Traffic congestion is a serious road issue because of an increasing number of vehicles in urban areas. Some crucial traffic problems include accidents and traffic jams that cause waste of fuel, health diseases, and a waste of time. Present traffic signaling systems are not efficient in resolving congestion problems because of the lack of traffic signals. Nowadays, traffic signaling systems are modeled with fixed time intervals in which no proper mechanism for emergency vehicles is available. Such traffic mechanisms failed to deal with traffic problems effectively. The major objective is to establish a robust traffic monitoring and signaling system that improves signal efficiency by providing a responsive scheme; appropriate routes; a mechanism for emergency vehicles and pedestrians in real-time using Vienna Development Method Specification Language (VDM-SL) formal method and graph theory. A formal model is constructed by considering objects, such as wireless sensors and cameras that are used for collecting information. Graph theory is used to represent the network and find appropriate routes. Unified Modeling Language is used to design the system requirements. The graph-based framework is converted into a formal model by using VDM-SL. The model has been validated and analyzed using many facilities available in the VDM-SL toolbox.

AB  - The significant growth in the use of the Internet and the rapid development of network technologies are associated with an increased risk of network attacks. Network attacks refer to all types of unauthorized access to a network including any attempts to damage and disrupt the network, often leading to serious consequences. Network attack detection is an active area of research in the community of cybersecurity. In the literature, there are various descriptions of network attack detection systems involving various intelligent-based techniques including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. However, although such techniques have proved useful within specific domains, no technique has proved useful in mitigating all kinds of network attacks. This is because some intelligent-based approaches lack essential capabilities that render them reliable systems that are able to confront different types of network attacks. This was the main motivation behind this research, which evaluates contemporary intelligent-based research directions to address the gap that still exists in the field. The main components of any intelligent-based system are the training datasets, the algorithms, and the evaluation metrics; these were the main benchmark criteria used to assess the intelligent-based systems included in this research article. This research provides a rich source of references for scholars seeking to determine their scope of research in this field. Furthermore, although the paper does present a set of suggestions about future inductive directions, it leaves the reader free to derive additional insights about how to develop intelligent-based systems to counter current and future network attacks.

AB  - Predicting the travel demand plays an indispensable role in urban transportation planning. Data collection methods for estimating the origin–destination (OD) demand matrix are being extensively shifted from traditional survey techniques to the pre-collected data from intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). This shift is partly due to the high cost of conducting traditional surveys and partly due to the diversity of scattered data produced by ITSs and the opportunity to derive extra benefits out of this big data. This study attempts to predict the OD matrix of Tehran metropolis using a set of ITS data, including the data extracted from automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, smart fare cards, loop detectors at intersections, global positioning systems (GPS) of navigation software, socio-economic and demographic characteristics as well as land-use features of zones. For this purpose, five models based on machine learning (ML) techniques are developed for training and test. In evaluating the performance of the models, the statistical methods show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to the best performance in terms of accuracy in predicting the OD matrix and has the lowest error in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Moreover, the predicted OD matrix was structurally compared with the ground truth matrix, and the CNN model also shows the highest structural similarity with the ground truth OD matrix in the presented case.

AB  - In recent times, Blockchain has emerged as a transformational technology with the ability to disrupt and evolve multiple domains. As a decentralized, immutable distributed ledger, Blockchain technology is one of the most recent entrants to the comprehensive ideology of Smart Cities. The rise of urbanization and increased citizen participation have led to various technology integrations in our present-day cities. For cities to become smart, we need standard frameworks and procedures for integrating technology, citizens and governments. In this paper, we explore the potential of Blockchain technology as an enabler for e-governance in smart cities. We examine the daily challenges of citizens and compare them with the benefits being offered by Blockchain integration. On the basis of a comprehensive literature review, we identified four key areas of e-governance wherein Blockchain can provide monumental advantages. In the context of Blockchain integration for e-governance, the paper presents a survey of prominent published works discussing various urban applications.

AB  - Recent developments regarding the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) opened new horizons of healthcare opportunities. Moreover, these technological advancements give strength to face upcoming healthcare challenges. One of such challenges is the advent of COVID-19, which has adverse effects beyond comprehension. Therefore, utilizing the basic functionalities of IoT, this work presents a real-time rule-based Fuzzy Logic classifier for COVID-19 Detection (FLCD). The proposed model deploys the IoT framework to collect real-time symptoms data from users to detect symptomatic and asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. Moreover, the proposed framework is also capable of monitoring the treatment response of infected people. FLCD constitutes three components: symptom data collection using wearable sensors, data fusion through Rule-Based Fuzzy Logic classifier, and cloud infrastructure to store data with a possible verdict (normal, mild, serious, or critical). After extracting the relevant features, experiments with a synthetic COVID-19 symptom dataset are conducted to ensure effective and accurate detection of COVID-19 cases. As a result, FLCD successfully acquired 95% accuracy, 94.73% precision, 93.35% recall, and showed a minimum error rate of 2.52%.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 9
IS  - 11
SN  - 2077-1312

AB  - Given recent scientific advances, coastal flooding events can be properly modelled. Nevertheless, such models are computationally expensive (requiring many hours), which prevents their use for forecasting and warning. In addition, there is a gap between the model outputs and information actually needed by decision makers. The present work aims to develop and test a method capable of forecasting coastal flood information adapted to users’ needs. The method must be robust and fast and must integrate the complexity of coastal flood processes. The explored solution relies on metamodels, i.e., mathematical functions that precisely and efficiently (within minutes) estimate the results that would provide the numerical model. While the principle of relying on metamodel solutions is not new, the originality of the present work is to tackle and validate the entire process from the identification of user needs to the establishment and validation of the rapid forecast and early warning system (FEWS) while relying on numerical modelling, metamodelling, the development of indicators, and information technologies. The development and validation are performed at the study site of Gâvres (France). This site is subject to wave overtopping, so the numerical phase-resolving SWASH model is used to build the learning dataset required for the metamodel setup. Gaussian process- and random forest classifier-based metamodels are used and post-processed to estimate 14 indicators of interest for FEWS users. These metamodelling and post-processing schemes are implemented in an FEWS prototype, which is employed by local users and exhibits good warning skills during the validation period. Based on this experience, we provide recommendations for the improvement and/or application of this methodology and individual steps to other sites.

AB  - The two-part series of papers provides a survey on recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an approach to simulate the human’s natural learning process, whose key is to let the agent learn by interacting with the stochastic environment. The fact that the agent has limited access to the information of the environment enables AI to be applied efficiently in most fields that require self-learning. It’s essential to have an organized investigation—we can make good comparisons and choose the best structures or algorithms when applying DRL in various applications. The first part of the overview introduces Markov Decision Processes (MDP) problems and Reinforcement Learning and applications of DRL for solving POMDP problems in games, robotics, and natural language processing. In part two, we continue to introduce applications in transportation, industries, communications and networking, etc. and discuss the limitations of DRL.

SN  - 2571-9408

AB  - This article describes a Smart Heritage computational system that automatically produces a wide range of design proposals for new timber Gothic churches based on an intelligent interpretation of an architectural database of historic churches. The system enlists the software ‘Houdini’ and a digitally archived dataset of 19th Century timber Gothic churches. The cases presented here focus primarily on timber churches built in Wellington, New Zealand. Through a process of analysis and deconstruction of these historic churches into their characteristic architectural components, spatial organisation and geometric relationships, the system assembles them into novel designs based on high-level design parameters. This paper details this computational system, its development, its operation and its outputs. The role of the system that has been developed is two-fold. One is designing in an architectural heritage context, and one is as an aid to historical architectural investigations, or what can be called digital forensics. The particular outputs are automatically generated hybrid churches that capture the historical design values and complexities of Gothic inspired churches in New Zealand. However, the broader applications are as an investigative tool for historians, and as an objective generative tool for those involved in heritage reconstruction.
