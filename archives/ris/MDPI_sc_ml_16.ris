AB  - Air pollution is a global problem and can be perceived as a modern-day curse. One way of dealing with it is by finding economical ways to monitor and forecast air quality. Accurately monitoring and forecasting fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations is a challenging prediction task but Internet of Things (IoT) can help in developing economical and agile ways to design such systems. In this paper, we use a historical data-based approach to perform PM2.5 forecasting. A forecasting method is developed which uses exponential smoothing with drift. Experiments and evaluation were performed using the real-time PM2.5 data obtained from large scale deployment of IoT devices in Taichung region in Taiwan. We used the data from 132 monitoring stations to evaluate our model&rsquo;s performance. A comparison of prediction accuracy and computation time between the proposed model and three widely used forecasting models was done. The results suggest that our method can perform PM2.5 forecast for 132 monitoring stations with error as low as 0.16    &mu;   g/    m 3     and also with an acceptable computation time of 30 s. Further evaluation was done by forecasting PM2.5 for next 3 h. The results show that 90 % of the monitoring stations have error under 1.5    &mu;   g/    m 3     which is significantly low.

AB  - Today, buildings consume more than 40% of primary energy in and produce more than 36% of CO2. So, an intelligent controller applied to the buildings for energy and comfort management could achieve significant reduction in energy consumption while improving occupant&rsquo;s comfort. Conventional on/off controllers were only able to automate the tasks in building and were not well suited for energy optimization tasks. Therefore, building energy management has become a focal point in recent years, promising the development of various technologies for various scenarios. This paper deals with a state of the art review on recent developments in building energy management system (BEMS) and occupants comfort, focusing on three model types: white box, black box, and gray box models. Through a comparative study, this paper presents pros and cons of each model.

VL  - 11
IS  - 10
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This paper aims to design a controller for a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) targeting the Eco-Maximum Power Point Tracking (EMPPT) for environmental aspects. The proposed controller consists of two clusters, which are the novel Artificial Immunity sensorless Eco-Maximum Power Point Tracking (AI EMPPT) and the asymptotic non-linear control techniques. The main target of the AI EMPPT is to reduce the carbon dioxide emission by generating the maximum possible power from the renewable electrical energy resource, which is wind electrical power generation to replace the fossil-fuel conventional generation. To build the AI EMPPT, an Artificial Immunity System Estimator (AISE) based on artificial immunity technique and a Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) are used to estimate the DFIG rotor speed. Then, the AI EMPPT is applied to provide the reference electromagnetic torque signal. Subsequently, the reference electromagnetic torque interacts with the estimated generator speed, determined by the wind mechanical power, to supply the wind electrical power. The second cluster is the asymptotic non-linear control technique which proposes the reference signal tracking of the rotor direct and quadratic current, respectively. Thus, assigning specific zeros through feedback ensures the reproduction of an output that converges asymptotically to a required reference rotor current. For online operation, the Artificial Immunity Technique (AIT) is utilized to deal with the generated control reference signal. A proposal hardware implementation on Field Programmed Gate Array (FPGA) is also presented. The introduced approach was applied to a wind turbine generator driving a 3.7 kW load. MATLAB program was used to simulate and test the performance of the proposed control methods. The results to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The reduction in CO2 emission was calculated.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Tracking multiple pedestrians across multi-camera scenarios is an important part of intelligent video surveillance and has great potential application for public security, which has been an attractive topic in the literature in recent years. In most previous methods, artificial features such as color histograms, HOG descriptors and Haar-like feature were adopted to associate objects among different cameras. But there are still many challenges caused by low resolution, variation of illumination, complex background and posture change. In this paper, a feature extraction network named NCA-Net is designed to improve the performance of multiple objects tracking across multiple cameras by avoiding the problem of insufficient robustness caused by hand-crafted features. The network combines features learning and metric learning via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and the loss function similar to neighborhood components analysis (NCA). The loss function is adapted from the probability loss of NCA aiming at object tracking. The experiments conducted on the NLPR_MCT dataset show that we obtain satisfactory results even with a simple matching operation. In addition, we embed the proposed NCA-Net with two existing tracking systems. The experimental results on the corresponding datasets demonstrate that the extracted features using NCA-net can effectively make improvement on the tracking performance.

TI  - Dynamic Neural Network Modelling of Soil Moisture Content for Predictive Irrigation Scheduling

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Sustainable freshwater management is underpinned by technologies which improve the efficiency of agricultural irrigation systems. Irrigation scheduling has the potential to incorporate real-time feedback from soil moisture and climatic sensors. However, for robust closed-loop decision support, models of the soil moisture dynamics are essential in order to predict crop water needs while adapting to external perturbation and disturbances. This paper presents a Dynamic Neural Network approach for modelling of the temporal soil moisture fluxes. The models are trained to generate a one-day-ahead prediction of the volumetric soil moisture content based on past soil moisture, precipitation, and climatic measurements. Using field data from three sites, a      R 2      value above 0.94 was obtained during model evaluation in all sites. The models were also able to generate robust soil moisture predictions for independent sites which were not used in training the models. The application of the Dynamic Neural Network models in a predictive irrigation scheduling system was demonstrated using AQUACROP simulations of the potato-growing season. The predictive irrigation scheduling system was evaluated against a rule-based system that applies irrigation based on predefined thresholds. Results indicate that the predictive system achieves a water saving ranging between 20 and 46% while realizing a yield and water use efficiency similar to that of the rule-based system.

AB  - Every day we experience unprecedented data growth from numerous sources, which contribute to big data in terms of volume, velocity, and variability. These datasets again impose great challenges to analytics framework and computational resources, making the overall analysis difficult for extracting meaningful information in a timely manner. Thus, to harness these kinds of challenges, developing an efficient big data analytics framework is an important research topic. Consequently, to address these challenges by exploiting non-linear relationships from very large and high-dimensional datasets, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are being used in analytics frameworks. Apache Spark has been in use as the fastest big data processing arsenal, which helps to solve iterative ML tasks, using distributed ML library called Spark MLlib. Considering real-world research problems, DL architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an effective approach to overcoming practical issues such as reduced accuracy, long-term sequence dependency, and vanishing and exploding gradient in conventional deep architectures. In this paper, we propose an efficient analytics framework, which is technically a progressive machine learning technique merged with Spark-based linear models, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and LSTM, using a two-stage cascade structure in order to enhance the predictive accuracy. Our proposed architecture enables us to organize big data analytics in a scalable and efficient way. To show the effectiveness of our framework, we applied the cascading structure to two different real-life datasets to solve a multiclass and a binary classification problem, respectively. Experimental results show that our analytical framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a high-level of classification accuracy.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper describes the design and calibration of a highly accurate temperature measurement system for pervasive computing applications. A negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor with high resistance tolerance is interfaced through a conditioning circuit to a 12-bit digital converter of a wireless microcontroller. The system is calibrated to minimize the effect of component uncertainties and achieves an accuracy of &plusmn;0.03 &deg;C on average (&plusmn;0.05 &deg;C in worst cases) in a 5 &deg;C to 45 &deg;C range. The calibration process is based on a continuous temperature sweep, while calibration data are simultaneously logged to reduce the delays and cost of conventional calibration approaches. An uncertainty analysis is performed to support the validity of the reported performance results. The described approach for interfacing the thermistor to the hardware platform can be straightforwardly adjusted for different thermistors, temperature ranges/accuracy levels/resolutions, and voltage ranges. The low power communication combined with the energy consumption optimization adopted enable an operation to be autonomic for several months to years depending on the application&rsquo;s measurement frequency requirements. The system cost is approximately $45 USD in components, while its design and compact size allow its integration with extended monitoring systems in various pervasive computing environments. The system has been thoroughly tested and validated in a field trial concerning a precision agriculture application and is currently used in a health monitoring application.

AB  - Falls are the main source of injury for elderly patients with epilepsy and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. Elderly people who carry battery powered health monitoring systems can move unhindered from one place to another according to their activities, thus improving their quality of life. This paper aims to detect when an elderly individual falls and to provide accurate location of the incident while the individual is moving in indoor environments such as in houses, medical health care centers, and hospitals. Fall detection is accurately determined based on a proposed sensor-based fall detection algorithm, whereas the localization of the elderly person is determined based on an artificial neural network (ANN). In addition, the power consumption of the fall detection system (FDS) is minimized based on a data-driven algorithm. Results show that an elderly fall can be detected with accuracy levels of 100% and 92.5% for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments, respectively. In addition, elderly indoor localization error is improved with a mean absolute error of 0.0094 and 0.0454 m for LOS and NLOS, respectively, after the application of the ANN optimization technique. Moreover, the battery life of the FDS is improved relative to conventional implementation due to reduced computational effort. The proposed FDS outperforms existing systems in terms of fall detection accuracy, localization errors, and power consumption.

AB  - Due to the rapid installation of a massive number of fixed and mobile sensors, monitoring machines are intentionally or unintentionally involved in the production of a large amount of geospatial data. Environmental sensors and related software applications are rapidly altering human lifestyles and even impacting ecological and human health. However, there are rarely specific geospatial sensor web (GSW) applications for certain ecological public health questions. In this paper, we propose an ontology-driven approach for integrating intelligence to manage human and ecological health risks in the GSW. We design a Human and Ecological health Risks Ontology (HERO) based on a semantic sensor network ontology template. We also illustrate a web-based prototype, the Human and Ecological Health Risk Management System (HaEHMS), which helps health experts and decision makers to estimate human and ecological health risks. We demonstrate this intelligent system through a case study of automatic prediction of air quality and related health risk.

TI  - Estimation of the Fe and Cu Contents of the Surface Water in the Ebinur Lake Basin Based on LIBS and a Machine Learning Algorithm

SN  - 1660-4601

AB  - Traditional technology for detecting heavy metals in water is time consuming and difficult and thus is not suitable for quantitative detection of large samples. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) can identify multi-state (such as solid, liquid, and gas) substances simultaneously, rapidly and remotely. In this study, water samples were collected from the Ebinur Lake Basin. The water samples were subjected to LIBS to extract the characteristic peaks of iron (Fe) and copper (Cu). Most of the quantitative analysis of LIBS rarely models and estimates the heavy metal contents in natural environments and cannot quickly determine the heavy metals in field water samples. This study creatively uses the Fe and Cu contents in water samples and the characteristics of their spectral curves in LIBS for regression modelling analysis and estimates their contents in an unknown water body by using LIBS technology and a machine learning algorithm, thus improving the detection rate. The results are as follows: (1) The Cu content of the Ebinur Lake Basin is generally higher than the Fe content, the highest Fe and Cu contents found within the basin are in the Ebinur Lake watershed, and the lowest are in the Jing River. (2) A number of peaks from each sample were found of the LIBS curve. The characteristic analysis lines of Fe and Cu were finally determined according to the intensities of the Fe and Cu characteristic lines, transition probabilities and high signal-to-background ratio (S/B). Their wavelengths were 396.3 and 324.7 nm, respectively. (3) The relative percent deviation (RPD) of the Fe content back-propagation (BP) network estimation model is 0.23, and the prediction ability is poor, so it is impossible to accurately predict the Fe content of samples. In the estimation model of BP network of Cu, the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.8, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is 0.1, and the RPD is 1.79. This result indicates that the BP estimation model of Cu content has good accuracy and strong predictive ability and can accurately predict the Cu content in a sample. In summary, estimation based on LIBS improved the accuracy and efficiency of Fe and Cu content detection in water and provided new ideas and methods for the accurate estimation of Fe and Cu contents in water.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Underground personnel localization is highly important in the operations of coal mines. Considering the special underground environment, this paper introduces a novel localization scheme based on step detection and image recognition technologies, which makes use of unique characteristics of the underground environment like the dark environment and the miner&rsquo;s lamp. Since the underground topology is relatively simple, the miner can be located only by step information. However, the localization with step information always causes the problem of cumulative error. To solve this problem, we rebuild a special base station with a camera in a dark underground environment. A miner&rsquo;s lamp, which every miner carries, can simply transform to irradiate unique shapes (such as triangles, rectangles, and circles) and every coal miner at the base station can identify these shapes based on image recognition technologies. Thus, we can obtain the miner&rsquo;s precise position when he/she is passing by a base station. In that way, we can correct the localization results to solve cumulative error. We implemented our algorithm in indoor and underground environments. The experimental results show that 96% of spatial errors were 2.5 m or less.

Therefore, the task-driven classroom teaching method is integrated into information technology teaching of junior middle school by designing specific cases. From the theoretical knowledge teaching and the comprehensive operational practice teaching, we explore the effect of using the task-driven classroom learning method on students’ learning attitudes and learning effectiveness in an information technology course. The experimental results show that using the task-driven classroom teaching method has significant positive correlation on student learning performance, learning interest, and creative thinking. This idea can stimulate interest in learning and improve the comprehensive quality of students; thus, it can promote the reform of information technology education and curriculums.

Using examples of Asian, African, and Latin American cities, this study shows the scope and limits of earth observation (EO)-based mapping of deprived living conditions in support of providing consistent global information for the SDG indicator 11.1.1 “proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing”. At the technical level, we compare several EO-based methods and imagery for mapping deprived living conditions, discussing their ability to map such areas including differences in terms of accuracy and performance at the city scale. At the operational level, we compare available municipal maps showing identified deprived areas with the spatial extent of morphological mapped areas of deprived living conditions (using EO) at the city scale, discussing the reasons for inconsistencies between municipal and EO-based maps. We provide an outlook on how EO-based mapping of deprived living conditions could contribute to a global spatial information base to support targeting of deprived living conditions in support of the SDG Goal 11.1.1 indicator, when uncertainties and ethical considerations on data provision are well addressed.

AB  - Composting is the delicate procedure of supervised decomposition of organic waste, which gradually transforms waste to nutrient-rich manure. It requires deep knowledge and constant attention by experts to achieve a quality outcome in a timely fashion. Nevertheless, due to the bizarre nature of the materials and the overall procedure, along with the space required and emitted odors, it is required that composting infrastructures and machinery are installed away from residential areas, rendering supervision a very tedious task. Automatic composting machinery is a promising new idea, but still cannot substitute the insightfulness of a human supervisor. In this paper, we introduce COMPosting as a Service (COMPaaS). COMPaaS is a novel cloud service in composition with specialized Internet of Things (IoT)-based composting machinery that allows for unsupervised composting. The focus of this work is on the tiered IT approach that is adopted following the edge-computing paradigm. More specifically, composting machinery, enriched with several sensors and actuators, performs a set of basic routine tasks locally and sends sensor values to a cloud service which performs real-time data analysis and instructs the composting machinery to perform the appropriate actions based on the outcome of the analysis. The overall composting procedure is performed in a completely unsupervised manner, and field evaluation has shown an up to 30% faster outcome in comparison to traditional supervised composting.

AB  - Land-use and land-cover changes have important effects on ecology, human systems, the environment, and policy at both global and regional scales. Thus, they are closely related to human activities. The extraction of more details about land-use change and grassland degradation is necessary to achieve future sustainable development in Inner Mongolia. The current study presents the patterns and processes of land-use changes over space and time, while also analyzing grassland degradation that is based on an analysis of land-use changes using a transition matrix, the Markov chain model and Moran&rsquo;s I index, and a combination of long-time-scale remote sensing data as the data source. The major results indicate the following. (1) In 1990&ndash;2015, 13% (123,445 km2) of the total study area, including eight land-use types, changed. Woodland increased the most and moderate grassland decreased the most. (2) Grassland degradation, which occupied 2.8% of the total area of Inner Mongolia, was the major land-use conversion process before 2000, while, after 2000, 8.7% of the total area was restored; however, grassland degradation may still be the major ecological issue in Inner Mongolia. (3) Environmental protection policies show a close relationship with land-use conversion.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - One of the most important challenges of Smart City Applications is to adapt the system to interact with non-expert users. Robot imitation frameworks aim to simplify and reduce times of robot programming by allowing users to program directly through action demonstrations. In classical robot imitation frameworks, actions are modelled using joint or Cartesian space trajectories. They accurately describe actions where geometrical characteristics are relevant, such as fixed trajectories from one pose to another. Other features, such as visual ones, are not always well represented with these pure geometrical approaches. Continuous Goal-Directed Actions (CGDA) is an alternative to these conventional methods, as it encodes actions as changes of any selected feature that can be extracted from the environment. As a consequence of this, the robot joint trajectories for execution must be fully computed to comply with this feature-agnostic encoding. This is achieved using Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), which usually requires too many evaluations to perform this evolution step in the actual robot. The current strategies involve performing evaluations in a simulated environment, transferring only the final joint trajectory to the actual robot. Smart City applications involve working in highly dynamic and complex environments, where having a precise model is not always achievable. Our goal is to study the tractability of performing these evaluations directly in a real-world scenario. Two different approaches to reduce the number of evaluations using EA, are proposed and compared. In the first approach, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based methods have been studied and compared within the CGDA framework: na&iuml;ve PSO, Fitness Inheritance PSO (FI-PSO), and Adaptive Fuzzy Fitness Granulation with PSO (AFFG-PSO). The second approach studied the introduction of geometrical and velocity constraints within the CGDA framework. The effects of both approaches were analyzed and compared in the &ldquo;wax&rdquo; and &ldquo;paint&rdquo; actions, two CGDA commonly studied use cases. Results from this paper depict an important reduction in the number of required evaluations.

AB  - Particulate matter emission into the atmosphere is a massive-scale problem. Fossil fuel combustion is an important source of this kind of pollution. The knowledge of total suspended particle (TSP) emissions is the first step for TSP control. The formation of TSP emissions is poorly understood; therefore new approaches for TSP emissions source modelling are required. TSP modelling is a multi-variable non-linear problem that would only require basic information on boiler operation. This work reports the development of a non-linear model for TSP emissions estimation from an industrial boiler based on a one-layer neural network. Expansion polynomial basic functions combined with an orthogonal least-square and model structure selection approach were used for modelling. The model required five independent boiler variables for TSP emissions estimation. Data from the data acquisition system of a 350 MW industrial boiler were used for model development and validation. The results show that polynomial expansion basic functions are an excellent approach to solve modelling problems related to complex non-linear systems in the industry.

TI  - Data Fusion Using Improved Support Degree Function in Aquaculture Wireless Sensor Networks

IS  - 11
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - For monitoring the aquaculture parameters in pond with wireless sensor networks (WSN), high accuracy of fault detection and high precision of error correction are essential. However, collecting accurate data from WSN to server or cloud is a bottleneck because of the data faults of WSN, especially in aquaculture applications, limits their further development. When the data fault occurs, data fusion mechanism can help to obtain corrected data to replace abnormal one. In this paper, we propose a data fusion method using a novel function that is Dynamic Time Warping time series strategy improved support degree (DTWS-ISD) for enhancing data quality, which employs a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) time series segmentation strategy to the improved support degree (ISD) function. We use the DTW distance to replace Euclidean distance, which can explore the continuity and fuzziness of data streams, and the time series segmentation strategy is adopted to reduce the computation dimension of DTW algorithm. Unlike Gauss support function, ISD function obtains mutual support degree of sensors without the exponent calculation. Several experiments were finished to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of DTWS-ISD with different performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrated that DTWS-ISD achieved better fusion precision than three existing functions in a real-world WSN water quality monitoring application.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 11
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Buildings represent a significant portion of global energy consumption. Ventilation units are complex components, often customized for the specific building, responsible for a large part of energy consumption. Their faults impact buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency and occupancy comfort. In order to ensure their correct operation, proper fault detection and diagnostics methods must be applied. Hardware redundancy, an effective approach to detect faults, leads to increased costs and space requirements. We propose exploiting physical relations inside ventilation units to create virtual sensors from other sensors&rsquo; readings, introducing redundancy in the system. We use two different measures to detect when a virtual sensor deviates from the physical one: coefficient of determination for linear models, and acceptable range. We tested our method on a real building at the University of Southern Denmark, developing three virtual sensors: temperature, airflow, and fan speed. We employed linear regression models, statistical models, and non-linear regression models. All models detected an anomalous strong oscillation in the temperature sensors. Readings fell outside the acceptable range and the coefficient of determination dropped. Our method showed promising results by introducing redundancy in the system, which can benefit several applications, such as fault detection and diagnostics and fault-tolerant control. Future work will be necessary to discover thresholds and set up automatic fault detection and diagnostics.

Architectures (such as ARM) have evolved significantly in recent years, with improvements to processor efficiency, essential for always-on devices, as a focal point. However, as far as software is concerned, few approaches analyse the advantages of writing efficient code when programming IoT devices. Therefore, this proposal aims to improve source code optimization to achieve better execution times. In addition, the importance of various techniques for writing efficient code for Raspberry Pi devices is analysed, with the objective of increasing execution speed. A complete set of tests have been developed exclusively for analysing and measuring the improvements achieved when applying each of these techniques. This will raise awareness of the significant impact the recommended techniques can have.

AB  - Smart cities are built to help people address issues like air pollution, traffic optimization, and energy efficiency. Electrical energy efficiency has become a central research issue in the energy field. Smart houses and buildings, which lower electricity costs, form an integral part of a smart city in a smart grid. This article presents an Internet of Things (IoT)-oriented smart Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that identifies electrical home appliances based on a novel hybrid Unsupervised Automatic Clustering-Integrated Neural-Fuzzy Classification (UAC-NFC) model. The smart HEMS designed and implemented in this article is composed of (1) a set of IoT-empowered smart e-meters, called smart sockets, installed as a benchmark in a realistic domestic environment with uncertainties and deployed against non-intrusive load monitoring; (2) a central Advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computing machine-based home gateway configured with a ZigBee wireless communication network; and (3) a cloud-centered analytical platform constructed to the hybrid UAC-NFC model for Demand-Side Management (DSM)/home energy management as a load classification task. The novel hybrid UAC-NFC model proposed in DSM and presented in this article is used to overcome the difficulties in distinguishing electrical appliances operated under similar electrical features and classified as unsupervised and self-organized. The smart HEMS developed with the proposed novel hybrid UAC-NFC model for DSM was able to identify electrical household appliances with an acceptable average and generalized classification rate of 95.73%.

AB  - Nowadays, it is more and more important to deal with the potential security issues of internet-of-things (IoT). Indeed, using the physical layer features of IoT wireless signals to achieve individual identity authentication is an effective way to enhance the security of IoT. However, traditional classifiers need to know all the categories in advance to get the recognition models. Realistically, it is difficult to collect all types of samples, which will result in some mistakes that the unknown target class may be decided as a known one. Consequently, this paper constructs an improving open-categorical classification model based on the generative adversarial networks (OCC-GAN) to solve the above problems. Here, we have modified the loss function of the generative model G and the discriminative model D. Compared to the traditional GAN model which can generate the fake sample overlapping with the real samples, our proposed G model generates the fake samples as negative samples which are evenly surrounding with the real samples, while the D model learns to distinguish between real samples and fake samples. Besides, we add auxiliary training not only to gain a better recognition result but also to improve the efficiency of the model. Furthermore, Our proposed model is verified through experimental study. Compared to other common methods, such as one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) and one-versus-rest support vector machine (OvR-SVM), the OCC-GAN model has a better performance. The recognition rate of the OCC-GAN model can reach more than 90% with a recall rate of 97% by the data of the IoT module.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Social sensors perceive the real world through social media and online web services, which have the advantages of low cost and large coverage over traditional physical sensors. In intelligent transportation researches, sensing and analyzing such social signals provide a new path to monitor, control and optimize transportation systems. However, current research is largely focused on using single channel online social signals to extract and sense traffic information. Clearly, sensing and exploiting multi-channel social signals could effectively provide deeper understanding of traffic incidents. In this paper, we utilize cross-platform online data, i.e., Sina Weibo and News, as multi-channel social signals, then we propose a word2vec-based event fusion (WBEF) model   for sensing, detecting, representing, linking and fusing urban traffic incidents. Thus, each traffic incident can be comprehensively described from multiple aspects, and finally the whole picture of unban traffic events can be obtained and visualized. The proposed WBEF architecture was trained by about 1.15 million multi-channel online data from Qingdao (a coastal city in China), and the experiments show our method surpasses the baseline model, achieving an 88.1% F1 score in urban traffic incident detection. The model also demonstrates its effectiveness in the open scenario test.

All this was done along with the construction of a real system in a city, which hopefully resulted in a very comprehensive work in smart cities using sensors.

TI  - Improved Target Signal Source Tracking and Extraction Method Based on Outdoor Visible Light Communication Using a Cam-Shift Algorithm and Kalman Filter
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 12
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - An improved Cam-Shift algorithm with a Kalman filter applied to image-sensor based on outdoor visible light communication (OVLC) is presented in this paper. The proposed optimized tracking algorithm is used to track and extract the region of the target signal source Light Emitting Diode (LED) that carries modulated information for data transmission. Extracting the target signal source LED area is the premise of an image-sensor-based VLC system, especially in outdoor dynamic scenes. However, most of the existing VLC studies focus on data transmission rate, visible light positioning, etc. While the actual first step of realizing communication is usually ignored in the field of VLC, especially when the transmitter (signal source LED) or the receiver (image sensor) is moving in a more complex outdoor environment. Therefore, an improved tracking algorithm is proposed in this paper, aiming at solving the problem of extracting the region of the target signal source LED accurately in dynamic scenes with different interferences so as to promote the feasibility of VLC applications in outdoor scenes. The proposed algorithm considers color characteristics and special distribution characteristics of the moving target at the same time. The image is converted to a color probability distribution map based on the color histogram of the target and adaptively adjusts the location and size of the search window based on the results obtained from the previous frame. Meanwhile, it predicts the motion state of the target in the next frame according to the position and velocity information of the current frame to enhance accuracy and robustness of tracking. Experimental results show that the tracking error of the proposed algorithm is 0.85 cm and the computational time of processing one frame is 0.042 s. Besides, results also show that the improved algorithm can track and extract the target signal source LED area completely and accurately in an environment of many interference factors. This study confirms that the proposed algorithm can be applied to an OVLC system with many interferences to realize the actual first step of communication in an image-sensor-based VLC system, laying foundations for subsequent data transmission and other steps.

AB  - The use of wearable and Internet-of-Things (IoT) for smart and affordable healthcare is trending. In traditional setups, the cloud backend receives the healthcare data and performs monitoring and prediction for diseases, diagnosis, and wellness prediction. Fog computing (FC) is a distributed computing paradigm that leverages low-power embedded processors in an intermediary node between the client layer and cloud layer. The diagnosis for wellness and fitness monitoring could be transferred to the fog layer from the cloud layer. Such a paradigm leads to a reduction in latency at an increased throughput. This paper processes a fog-based deep learning model, DeepFog that collects the data from individuals and predicts the wellness stats using a deep neural network model that can handle heterogeneous and multidimensional data. The three important abnormalities in wellness namely, (i) diabetes; (ii) hypertension attacks and (iii) stress type classification were chosen for experimental studies. We performed a detailed analysis of proposed models&rsquo; accuracy on standard datasets. The results validated the efficacy of the proposed system and architecture for accurate monitoring of these critical wellness and fitness criteria. We used standard datasets and open source software tools for our experiments.

This introduces a big research challenge for future energy systems design and optimization, given the multi-level and inter-sectorial dimensions of the problem. Buildings cover a central role in this context, because they represent the nexus between different energy carrier networks. The study of the management of multi-sector and multi-energy systems presents several challenges, such as the need to take into account uncertainties, to represent the heterogeneity of the energy demand and the scalability of the problem. This paper aims at outlining such a framework, and at showing the state-of-the-art nature of the above-mentioned challenges.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Vehicle driving path planning is an important information service in intelligent transportation systems. As an important basis for path planning optimization, the travel time prediction method has attracted much attention. However, traffic flow has features of high nonlinearity, time-varying, and uncertainty, which makes it hard for prediction method with single feature to meet the accuracy demand of intelligent transportation system in big data environment. In this paper, the historical vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) information data is used to establish the traffic prediction model. Firstly, the Clustering in QUEst (CLIQUE)-based clustering algorithm V-CLIQUE is proposed to analyze the historical vehicle GPS data. Secondly, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction model is proposed. Finally, the ANN-based weighted shortest path algorithm, A-Dijkstra, is proposed. We used mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to evaluate the predictive model and compare it with the predicted results of Average and support regression vector (SRV). Experiments show that the improved ANN path planning model we proposed can accurately predict real-time traffic status at the given location. It has less relative error and saves time for users&rsquo; travel while saving social resources.

AB  - Traffic jams can be avoided by controlling traffic signals according to quickly building congestion with steep gradients on short temporal and small spatial scales. With the rising standards of computational technology, single-board computers, software packages, platforms, and APIs (Application Program Interfaces), it has become relatively easy for developers to create systems for controlling signals and informative systems. Hence, for enhancing the power of Intelligent Transport Systems in automotive telematics, in this study, we used crowdsourced traffic congestion data from Google to adjust traffic light cycle times with a system that is adaptable to congestion. One aim of the system proposed here is to inform drivers about the status of the upcoming traffic light on their route. Since crowdsourced data are used, the system does not entail the high infrastructure cost associated with sensing networks. A full system module-level analysis is presented for implementation. The system proposed is fail-safe against temporal communication failure. Along with a case study for examining congestion levels, generic information processing for the cycle time decision and status delivery system was tested and confirmed to be viable and quick for a restricted prototype model. The information required was delivered correctly over sustained trials, with an average time delay of 1.5 s and a maximum of 3 s.

AB  - The fifth generation (5G) of wireless communication systems is considered the key technology to enable a wide range of application scenarios and the effective spreading of the smart city concept. Vertical business use cases, specifically designed for the future 5G city, will have a strong economical and social impact. For this reason, ongoing 5G field trials have to test newly deployed technologies as well as the capability of 5G to create a new digital economy. This paper describes the 5G field trial environment that was launched in Italy at the end of 2017. The aim is to evaluate the capability of the 5G network of supporting innovative services with reference to suitably designed key performance indicators and to evaluate the opportunities offered by these services. Indeed, vertical business use cases, specifically designed for the future 5G city, with a strong economic and social impact, are under implementation and will be evaluated. In particular, the paper provides a detailed description of the deployment of an actual complete integrated 5G network. It shows how 5G is effective enabling technology for a wide range of vertical business and use cases. Indeed, its flexibility allows to satisfy completely different performance requirements of real services. Some preliminary results, obtained during the first phase, are presented for a smart mobility scenario.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Due to the existence of time-varying chaotic disturbances in complex applications, the chaotic synchronization of sensor systems becomes a tough issue in industry electronics fields. To accelerate the synchronization process of chaotic sensor systems, this paper proposes a super-exponential-zeroing neurodynamic (SEZN) approach and its associated controller. Unlike the conventional zeroing neurodynamic (CZN) approach with exponential convergence property, the controller designed by the proposed SEZN approach inherently possesses the advantage of super-exponential convergence property, which makes the synchronization process faster and more accurate. Theoretical analyses on the stability and convergence advantages in terms of both faster convergence speed and lower error bound within the task duration are rigorously presented. Moreover, three synchronization examples substantiate the validity of the SEZN approach and the related controller for synchronization of chaotic sensor systems. Comparisons with other approaches such as the CZN approach, show the convergence superiority of the proposed SEZN approach. Finally, extensive tests further investigate the impact on convergence performance by choosing different values of design parameter and initial state.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Predicting the exact urban places where crime is most likely to occur is one of the greatest interests for Police Departments. Therefore, the goal of the research presented in this paper is to identify specific urban areas where a crime could happen in Manhattan, NY for every hour of a day. The outputs from this research are the following: (i) predicted land uses that generates the top three most committed crimes in Manhattan, by using machine learning (random forest and logistic regression), (ii) identifying the exact hours when most of the assaults are committed, together with hot spots during these hours, by applying time series and hot spot analysis, (iii) built hourly prediction models for assaults based on the land use, by deploying logistic regression. Assault, as a physical attack on someone, according to criminal law, is identified as the third most committed crime in Manhattan. Land use (residential, commercial, recreational, mixed use etc.) is assigned to every area or lot in Manhattan, determining the actual use or activities within each particular lot. While plotting assaults on the map for every hour, this investigation has identified that the hot spots where assaults occur were ‘moving’ and not confined to specific lots within Manhattan. This raises a number of questions: Why are hot spots of assaults not static in an urban environment? What makes them ‘move’—is it a particular urban pattern? Is the ‘movement’ of hot spots related to human activities during the day and night? Answering these questions helps to build the initial frame for assault prediction within every hour of a day. Knowing a specific land use vulnerability to assault during each exact hour can assist the police departments to allocate forces during those hours in risky areas. For the analysis, the study is using two datasets: a crime dataset with geographical locations of crime, date and time, and a geographic dataset about land uses with land use codes for every lot, each obtained from open databases. The study joins two datasets based on the spatial location and classifies data into 24 classes, based on the time range when the assault occurred. Machine learning methods reveal the effect of land uses on larceny, harassment and assault, the three most committed crimes in Manhattan. Finally, logistic regression provides hourly prediction models and unveils the type of land use where assaults could occur during each hour for both day and night.

AB  - With the increase of population density and the rural exodus to cities, urbanization is assuming extreme proportions and presents a tremendous urban problem related to waste generation. The increase of waste generation has been considered a significant challenge to large urban centers worldwide and represents a critical issue for countries with accelerated population growth in cities. The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing offer an automation possibility through cyberphysical systems that will change the way solid waste management is performed. Considering IoT requirements, a review analysis of waste management models available in the literature is performed in detail in this paper. Then, a deep review is undertaken of the related literature based on IoT infrastructure for efficient handling of waste generated in urban scenarios, focusing on the interaction among concessionaires and waste generators (citizens) from the perspective of a shorter collection time with reduced costs, as well as citizenship promotion. An IoT-based reference model is described, and a comparison analysis of the available solutions is presented, with the goal to highlight the most relevant approaches and identify open research issues on the topic.

T2  - Algorithms

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - This paper proposes total optimization of energy networks in a smart city by multi-population global-best modified brain storm optimization (MP-GMBSO). Efficient utilization of energy is necessary for reduction of CO2 emission, and smart city demonstration projects have been conducted around the world in order to reduce total energies and the amount of CO2 emission. The problem can be formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and various evolutionary computation techniques such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), Differential Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (DEEPSO), Brain Storm Optimization (BSO), Modified BSO (MBSO), Global-best BSO (BSO), and Global-best Modified Brain Storm Optimization (GMBSO) have been applied to the problem. However, there is still room for improving solution quality. Multi-population based evolutionary computation methods have been verified to improve solution quality and the approach has a possibility for improving solution quality. The proposed MS-GMBSO utilizes only migration for multi-population models instead of abest, which is the best individual among all of sub-populations so far, and both migration and abest. Various multi-population models, migration topologies, migration policies, and the number of sub-populations are also investigated. It is verified that the proposed MP-GMBSO based method with ring topology, the W-B policy, and 320 individuals is the most effective among all of multi-population parameters.

AB  - Water pollution is a worldwide problem that needs to be solved urgently and has a significant impact on the efficiency of sustainable cities. The evaluation of water pollution is a Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem and using a MCDM model can help control water pollution and protect human health. However, different evaluation methods may obtain different results. How to effectively coordinate them to obtain a consensus result is the main aim of this work. The purpose of this article is to develop an ensemble learning evaluation method based on the concept of water quality to help policy-makers better evaluate surface water quality. A valid application is conducted to illustrate the use of the model for the surface water quality evaluation problem, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model.

AB  - In this paper, a monitoring system of agricultural production is modeled as a Data Fusion System (data from local fairs and meteorological data). The proposal considers the particular information of sales in agricultural markets for knowledge extraction about the associations among them. This association knowledge is employed to improve predictions of sales using a spatial prediction technique, as shown with data collected from local markets of the Andean region of Ecuador. The commercial activity in these markets uses Alternative Marketing Circuits (CIALCO). This market platform establishes a direct relationship between producer and consumer prices and promotes direct commercial interaction among family groups. The problem is presented first as a general fusion problem with a network of spatially distributed heterogeneous data sources, and is then applied to the prediction of products sales based on association rules mined in available sales data. First, transactional data is used as the base to extract the best association rules between products sold in different local markets, knowledge that allows the system to gain a significant improvement in prediction accuracy in the spatial region considered.

AB  - European cities and communities (and beyond) require a structured overview and a set of tools as to achieve a sustainable transformation towards smarter cities/municipalities, thereby leveraging on the enormous potential of the emerging data driven economy. This paper presents the results of a recent study that was conducted with a number of German municipalities/cities. Based on the obtained and briefly presented recommendations emerging from the study, the authors propose the concept of an Urban Data Space (UDS), which facilitates an eco-system for data exchange and added value creation thereby utilizing the various types of data within a smart city/municipality. Looking at an Urban Data Space from within a German context and considering the current situation and developments in German municipalities, this paper proposes a reasonable classification of urban data that allows the relation of various data types to legal aspects, and to conduct solid considerations regarding technical implementation designs and decisions. Furthermore, the Urban Data Space is described/analyzed in detail, and relevant stakeholders are identified, as well as corresponding technical artifacts are introduced. The authors propose to setup Urban Data Spaces based on emerging standards from the area of ICT reference architectures for Smart Cities, such as DIN SPEC 91357 &ldquo;Open Urban Platform&rdquo; and EIP SCC. In the course of this, the paper walks the reader through the construction of a UDS based on the above-mentioned architectures and outlines all the goals, recommendations and potentials, which an Urban Data Space can reveal to a municipality/city. Finally, we aim at deriving the proposed concepts in a way that they have the potential to be part of the required set of tools towards the sustainable transformation of German and European cities in the direction of smarter urban environments, based on utilizing the hidden potential of digitalization and efficient interoperable data exchange.

AB  - The last decade has seen the development of complex IT systems to support city management, i.e., the creation of so-called intelligent cities. These systems include modules dedicated to particular branches of municipal economy, such as urban transport, heating systems, energy systems, telecommunications, and finally water and sewage management. In turn, with regard to the latter branch, IT systems supporting the management of water supply and sewage networks and sewage treatment plants are being developed. This paper deals with the system concerning the urban water supply network, and in particular, with the subsystem for detecting and locating leakages on the water supply network, including so-called hidden leakages. These leaks cause the greatest water losses in networks, especially in old ones, with a very diverse age and material structure. In the proposed concept of the subsystem consisting of a GIS (Geographical Information System), SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system and hydraulic model of the water supply network, an algorithm of leak detection and location based on the neural networks&rsquo; MLP (multi-layer perceptron) and Kohonen was developed. The algorithm has been tested on the hydraulic models of several municipal water supply networks.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting (STELF) through Data Analytics (DA) is an emerging and active research area. Forecasting about electricity load and price provides future trends and patterns of consumption. There is a loss in generation and use of electricity. So, multiple strategies are used to solve the aforementioned problems. Day-ahead electricity price and load forecasting are beneficial for both suppliers and consumers. In this paper, Deep Learning (DL) and data mining techniques are used for electricity load and price forecasting. XG-Boost (XGB), Decision Tree (DT), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Random Forest (RF) are used for feature selection and feature extraction. Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (ECNN) and Enhanced Support Vector Regression (ESVR) are used as classifiers. Grid Search (GS) is used for tuning of the parameters of classifiers to increase their performance. The risk of over-fitting is mitigated by adding multiple layers in ECNN. Finally, the proposed models are compared with different benchmark schemes for stability analysis. The performance metrics MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperformed other benchmark schemes. ECNN performed well with threshold 0.08 for load forecasting. While ESVR performed better with threshold value 0.15 for price forecasting. ECNN achieved almost 2% better accuracy than CNN. Furthermore, ESVR achieved almost 1% better accuracy than the existing scheme (SVR).

AB  - Designing advanced health monitoring systems is still an active research topic. Wearable and remote monitoring devices enable monitoring of physiological and clinical parameters (heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, etc.) and analysis using cloud-centric machine-learning applications and decision-support systems to predict critical clinical states. This paper moves from a totally cloud-centric concept to a more distributed one, by transferring sensor data processing and analysis tasks to the edges of the network. The resulting solution enables the analysis and interpretation of sensor-data traces within the wearable device to provide actionable alerts without any dependence on cloud services. In this paper, we use a supervised-learning approach to detect heartbeats and classify arrhythmias. The system uses a window-based feature definition that is suitable for execution within an asymmetric multicore embedded processor that provides a dedicated core for hardware assisted pattern matching. We evaluate the performance of the system in comparison with various existing approaches, in terms of achieved accuracy in the detection of abnormal events. The results show that the proposed embedded system achieves a high detection rate that in some cases matches the accuracy of the state-of-the-art algorithms executed in standard processors.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Network worms spread widely over the global network within a short time, which are increasingly becoming one of the most potential threats to network security. However, the performance of traditional packet-oriented signature-based methods is questionable in the face of unknown worms, while anomaly-based approaches often exhibit high false positive rates. It is a common scenario that the life cycle of network worms consists of the same four stages, in which the target discovery phase and the transferring phase have specific interactive patterns. To this end, we propose Network Flow Connectivity Graph (NFCG) for identifying network worm victims. We model the flow-level interactions as graph and then identify sets of frequently occurring motifs related to network worms through Cascading Motif Discovery algorithm. In particular, a cascading motif is jointly extracted from graph target discovery phase and transferring phase. If a cascading motif exists in a connected behavior graph of one host, the host would be identified as a suspicious worm victim; the excess amount of suspicious network worm victims is used to reveal the outbreak of network worms. The simulated experiments show that our proposed method is effective and efficient in network worm victims&rsquo; identification and helpful for improving network security.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Low-cost air pollution wireless sensors are emerging in densely distributed networks that provide more spatial resolution than typical traditional systems for monitoring ambient air quality. This paper presents an air quality measurement system that is composed of a distributed sensor network connected to a cloud system forming a wireless sensor network (WSN). Sensor nodes are based on low-power ZigBee motes, and transmit field measurement data to the cloud through a gateway. An optimized cloud computing system has been implemented to store, monitor, process, and visualize the data received from the sensor network. Data processing and analysis is performed in the cloud by applying artificial intelligence techniques to optimize the detection of compounds and contaminants. This proposed system is a low-cost, low-size, and low-power consumption method that can greatly enhance the efficiency of air quality measurements, since a great number of nodes could be deployed and provide relevant information for air quality distribution in different areas. Finally, a laboratory case study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed system for the detection of some common volatile organic compounds, including: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. Principal component analysis, a multilayer perceptron with backpropagation learning algorithm, and support vector machine have been applied for data processing. The results obtained suggest good performance in discriminating and quantifying the concentration of the volatile organic compounds.

PY  - 2019

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The progress of technology on energy and IoT fields has led to an increasingly complicated electric environment in low-voltage local microgrid, along with the extensions of electric vehicle, micro-generation, and local storage. It is required to establish a home energy management system (HEMS) to efficiently integrate and manage household energy micro-generation, consumption and storage, in order to realize decentralized local energy systems at the community level. Domestic power demand prediction is of great importance for establishing HEMS on realizing load balancing as well as other smart energy solutions with the support of IoT techniques. Artificial neural networks with various network types (e.g., DNN, LSTM/GRU based RNN) and other configurations are widely utilized on energy predictions. However, the selection of network configuration for each research is generally a case by case study achieved through empirical or enumerative approaches. Moreover, the commonly utilized network initialization methods assign parameter values based on random numbers, which cause diversity on model performance, including learning efficiency, forecast accuracy, etc. In this paper, an evolutionary ensemble neural network pool (EENNP) method is proposed to achieve a population of well-performing networks with proper combinations of configuration and initialization automatically. In the experimental study, power demand predictions of multiple households are explored in three application scenarios: optimizing potential network configuration set, forecasting single household power demand, and refilling missing data. The impacts of evolutionary parameters on model performance are investigated. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method achieves better solutions on the considered scenarios. The optimized potential network configuration set using EENNP achieves a similar result to manual optimization. The results of household demand prediction and missing data refilling perform better than the na&iuml;ve and simple predictors.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - This paper takes 50 ETF options in the options market with high transaction complexity as the research goal. The Random Forest (RF) model, the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) model, and the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model are used to predict 50 ETF price. Firstly, the original quantitative investment strategy is taken as the research object, and the 15 min trading frequency, which is more in line with the actual trading situation, is used, and then the Delta hedging concept of the options is introduced to control the risk of the quantitative investment strategy, to achieve the 15 min hedging strategy. Secondly, the final transaction price, buy price, highest price, lowest price, volume, historical volatility, and the implied volatility of the time segment marked with 50 ETF are the seven key factors affecting the price of 50 ETF. Then, two different types of LSTM-SVR models, LSTM-SVR I and LSTM-SVR II, are used to predict the final transaction price of the 50 ETF in the next time segment. In LSTM-SVR I model, the output of LSTM and seven key factors are combined as the input of SVR model. In LSTM-SVR II model, the hidden state vectors of LSTM and seven key factors are combined as the inputs of the SVR model. The results of the two LSTM-SVR models are compared with each other, and the better one is applied to the trading strategy. Finally, the benefit of the deep learning-based quantitative investment strategy, the resilience, and the maximum drawdown are used as indicators to judge the pros and cons of the research results. The accuracy and deviations of the LSTM-SVR prediction models are compared with those of the LSTM model and those of the RF model. The experimental results show that the quantitative investment strategy based on deep learning has higher returns than the traditional quantitative investment strategy, the yield curve is more stable, and the anti-fall performance is better.

AB  - This paper presents a method to optimally use an energy storage system (such as a battery) on a microgrid with load and photovoltaic generation. The purpose of the method is to employ the photovoltaic generation and energy storage systems to reduce the main grid bill, which includes an energy cost and a power peak cost. The method predicts the loads and generation power of each day, and then searches for an optimal storage behavior plan for the energy storage system according to these predictions. However, this plan is not followed in an open-loop control structure as in previous publications, but provided to a real-time decision algorithm, which also considers real power measures. This algorithm considers a series of device priorities in addition to the storage plan, which makes it robust enough to comply with unpredicted situations. The whole proposed method is implemented on a real-hardware test bench, with its different steps being distributed between a personal computer and a programmable logic controller according to their time scale. When compared to a different state-of-the-art method, the proposed method is concluded to better adjust the energy storage system usage to the photovoltaic generation and general consumption.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Forecasting solar radiation has recently become the focus of numerous researchers due to the growing interest in green energy. This study aims to develop a seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to predict the daily and monthly solar radiation in Seoul, South Korea based on the hourly solar radiation data obtained from the Korean Meteorological Administration over 37 years (1981&ndash;2017). The goodness of fit of the model was tested against standardized residuals, the autocorrelation function, and the partial autocorrelation function for residuals. Then, model performance was compared with Monte Carlo simulations by using root mean square errors and coefficient of determination (R2) for evaluation. In addition, forecasting was conducted by using the best models with historical data on average monthly and daily solar radiation. The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: (i) a time series SARIMA model is implemented to forecast the daily and monthly solar radiation of Seoul, South Korea in consideration of the accuracy, suitability, adequacy, and timeliness of the collected data; (ii) the reliability, accuracy, suitability, and performance of the model are investigated relative to those of established tests, standardized residual, autocorrelation function (ACF), and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), and the results are compared with those forecasted by the Monte Carlo method; and (iii) the trend of monthly solar radiation in Seoul for the coming years is analyzed and compared on the basis of the solar radiation data obtained from KMS over 37 years. The results indicate that (1,1,2) the ARIMA model can be used to represent daily solar radiation, while the seasonal ARIMA (4,1,1) of 12 lags for both auto-regressive and moving average parts can be used to represent monthly solar radiation. According to the findings, the expected average monthly solar radiation ranges from 176 to 377 Wh/m2.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Clustering analysis of massive data in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSN) has become a hot topic. However, most data clustering algorithms have difficulty in obtaining latent nonlinear correlations of data features, resulting in a low clustering accuracy. In addition, it is difficult to extract features from missing or corrupted data, so incomplete data are widely used in practical work. In this paper, the optimally designed variational autoencoder networks is proposed for extracting features of incomplete data and using high-order fuzzy c-means algorithm (HOFCM) to improve cluster performance of incomplete data. Specifically, the feature extraction model is improved by using variational autoencoder to learn the feature of incomplete data. To capture nonlinear correlations in different heterogeneous data patterns, tensor based fuzzy c-means algorithm is used to cluster low-dimensional features. The tensor distance is used as the distance measure to capture the unknown correlations of data as much as possible. Finally, in the case that the clustering results are obtained, the missing data can be restored by using the low-dimensional features. Experiments on real datasets show that the proposed algorithm not only can improve the clustering performance of incomplete data effectively, but also can fill in missing features and get better data reconstruction results.

AB  - The traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has evolved towards intelligent IoT applications which exploit knowledge produced by IoT devices using artificial intelligence techniques. Knowledge sharing between IoT devices is a challenging issue in this trend. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge of Things (KoT) framework which enables sharing self-taught knowledge between IoT devices which require similar or identical knowledge without help from the cloud. The proposed KoT framework allows an IoT device to effectively produce, cumulate, and share its self-taught knowledge with other devices at the edge in the vicinity. This framework can alleviate behavioral repetition in users and computational redundancy in systems in intelligent IoT applications. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we examine a smart home case study and build a prototype of the KoT framework-based smart home system. Experimental results show that the proposed KoT framework reduces the response time to use intelligent IoT devices from a user&rsquo;s perspective and the power consumption for compuation from a system&rsquo;s perspective.

AB  - Online market places make their profit based on their advertisements or sales commission while businesses have the commercial interest to rank higher on recommendations to attract more customers. Web users cannot be guaranteed that the products provided by recommender systems within Big Data are either exhaustive or relevant to their needs. This article analyses the product rank relevance provided by different commercial Big Data recommender systems (Grouplens film, Trip Advisor and Amazon); it also proposes an Intelligent Recommender System (IRS) based on the Random Neural Network; IRS acts as an interface between the customer and the different Recommender Systems that iteratively adapts to the perceived user relevance. In addition, a relevance metric that combines both relevance and rank is presented; this metric is used to validate and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm. On average, IRS outperforms the Big Data recommender systems after learning iteratively from its customer.

TI  - Towards a Persuasive Recommender for Bike Sharing Systems: A Defeasible Argumentation Approach
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This work proposes a persuasion model based on argumentation theory and users&rsquo; characteristics for improving the use of resources in bike sharing systems, fostering the use of the bicycles and thus contributing to greater energy sustainability by reducing the use of carbon-based fuels. More specifically, it aims to achieve a balanced network of pick-up and drop-off stations in urban areas with the help of the users, thus reducing the dedicated management trucks that redistribute bikes among stations. The proposal aims to persuade users to choose different routes from the shortest route between a start and an end location. This persuasion is carried out when it is not possible to park the bike in the desired station due to the lack of parking slots, or when the user is highly influenceable. Differently to other works, instead of employing a single criteria to recommend alternative stations, the proposed system can incorporate a variety of criteria. This result is achieved by providing a defeasible logic-based persuasion engine that is capable of aggregating the results from multiple recommendation rules. The proposed framework is showcased with an example scenario of a bike sharing system.

AB  - Smart cities (SC) promote economic development, improve the welfare of their citizens, and help in the ability of people to use technologies to build sustainable services. However, computational methods are necessary to assist in the process of creating smart cities because they are fundamental to the decision-making process, assist in policy making, and offer improved services to citizens. As such, the aim of this research is to present a systematic review regarding data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) approaches adopted in the promotion of smart cities. The Methodi Ordinatio was used to find relevant articles and the VOSviewer software was performed for a network analysis. Thirty-nine significant articles were identified for analysis from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, in which we analyzed the DM and ML techniques used, as well as the areas that are most engaged in promoting smart cities. Predictive analytics was the most common technique and the studies focused primarily on the areas of smart mobility and smart environment. This study seeks to encourage approaches that can be used by governmental agencies and companies to develop smart cities, being essential to assist in the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - The Sensing as a Service is emerging as a new Internet of Things (IoT) business model for sensors and data sharing in the cloud. Under this paradigm, a resource allocation model for the assignment of both sensors and cloud resources to clients/applications is proposed. This model, contrarily to previous approaches, is adequate for emerging IoT Sensing as a Service business models supporting multi-sensing applications and mashups of Things in the cloud. A heuristic algorithm is also proposed having this model as a basis. Results show that the approach is able to incorporate strategies that lead to the allocation of fewer devices, while selecting the most adequate ones for application needs.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - On-demand shared mobility is increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to address urban transport challenges in large and fast-growing cities. The appeal of this form of transport is largely attributed to its convenience, ease of use, and affordability made possible through digital platforms and innovations. The convergence of the shared economy with a number of established and emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud and Fog computing—is helping to expedite their deployment as a new form of public transport. Recently, this has manifested itself in the form of Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMoD) solutions, aimed at meeting personal travel demands through flexible routing and scheduling. Increasingly, these shared mobility solutions are blurring the boundaries with existing forms of public transport, particularly bus operations. This paper presents an environmental scan and analysis of the technological, social, and economic impacts surrounding disruptive technology-driven shared mobility trends. Specifically, the paper includes an examination of current and anticipated external factors that are of direct relevance to collaborative and low carbon mobility. The paper also outlines how these trends are likely to influence the mobility industries now and into the future. The paper collates information from a wide body of literature and reports on findings from actual ‘use cases’ that exist today which have used these disruptive mobility solutions to deliver substantial benefits to travellers around the world. Finally, the paper provides stakeholders with insight into identifying and responding to the likely needs and impacts of FMoD and informs their policy and strategy positions on the implementation of smart mobility systems in their cities and jurisdictions.

AB  - Radio-based locating systems allow for a robust and continuous tracking in industrial environments and are a key enabler for the digitalization of processes in many areas such as production, manufacturing, and warehouse management. Time difference of arrival (TDoA) systems estimate the time-of-flight (ToF) of radio burst signals with a set of synchronized antennas from which they trilaterate accurate position estimates of mobile tags. However, in industrial environments where multipath propagation is predominant it is difficult to extract the correct ToF of the signal. This article shows how deep learning (DL) can be used to estimate the position of mobile objects directly from the raw channel impulse responses (CIR) extracted at the receivers. Our experiments show that our DL-based position estimation not only works well under harsh multipath propagation but also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in line-of-sight situations.

TI  - Measurement Noise Recommendation for Efficient Kalman Filtering over a Large Amount of Sensor Data

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - To effectively maintain and analyze a large amount of real-time sensor data, one often uses a filtering technique that reflects characteristics of original data well. This paper proposes a novel method for recommending the measurement noise for Kalman filtering, which is one of the most representative filtering techniques. Kalman filtering corrects inaccurate values of input sensor data, and its filtering performance varies depending on the input noise parameters. In particular, if the noise parameters determined based on the user&rsquo;s experience are incorrect, the accuracy of Kalman filtering may be reduced significantly. Based on this observation, this paper addresses how to determine the measurement noise variance, a major input parameter of Kalman filtering, by analyzing past sensor data and how to use the estimated noise to improve the filtering accuracy. More specifically, to estimate the measurement noise variance, two analytical methods are proposed: one a transform-based method using a wavelet transform and the other a learning-based method using a denoising autoencoder. Experimental results show that the proposed methods estimated the measurement noise variance accurately and were superior to the experience-based method in the filtering accuracy.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - In recent years, due to the unnecessary wastage of electrical energy in residential buildings, the requirement of energy optimization and user comfort has gained vital importance. In the literature, various techniques have been proposed addressing the energy optimization problem. The goal of each technique is to maintain a balance between user comfort and energy requirements, such that the user can achieve the desired comfort level with the minimum amount of energy consumption. Researchers have addressed the issue with the help of different optimization algorithms and variations in the parameters to reduce energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved yet due to its challenging nature. The gaps in the literature are due to advancements in technology, the drawbacks of optimization algorithms, and the introduction of new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly proposed optimization algorithms have produced better accuracy on the benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. Detailed discussion has been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort, visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge computing techniques used in smart homes.

TI  - Towards Semantic Sensor Data: An Ontology Approach
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In order to optimize intelligent applications driven by various sensors, it is vital to properly interpret and reuse sensor data from different domains. The construction of semantic maps which illustrate the relationship between heterogeneous domain ontologies plays an important role in knowledge reuse. However, most mapping methods in the literature use the literal meaning of each concept and instance in the ontology to obtain semantic similarity. This is especially the case for domain ontologies which are built for applications with sensor data. At the instance level, there is seldom work to utilize data of the sensor instances when constructing the ontologies&rsquo; mapping relationship. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to achieve the association between sensor data and domain ontology. In our approach, we first classify the sensor data by making them as SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) ontology instances, and map the corresponding instances to the concepts in the domain ontology. Secondly, a multi-strategy similarity calculation method is used to evaluate the similarity of the concept pairs between the domain ontologies at multiple levels. Finally, the set of concept pairs with a high similarity is selected by the analytic hierarchy process to construct the mapping relationship between the domain ontologies, and then the correlation between sensor data and domain ontologies are constructed. Using the method presented in this paper, we perform sensor data correlation experiments with a simulator for a real world scenario. By comparison to other methods, the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Electric Vehicles (EVs) have emerged rapidly across the globe as a powerful eco-friendly initiative that if integrated well with an urban environment could be iconic for the host city&rsquo;s commitment to sustainable mobility and be a key ingredient of the smart city concept. This paper examines ways that will help us to develop a better understanding of how EVs can achieve energy use optimization and be connected with a smart city. As a whole, the present study is based on an original idea that would be useful in informing policy-makers, automotive manufacturers and transport operators of how to improve and embrace better EV technologies in the context of smart cities. The proposed approach is based on vehicles&rsquo; and buildings&rsquo; communication to share some special information related to the vehicles&rsquo; status and to the road conditions. EVs can share their own information related to their energy consumption experience on a specific path. This information can be gathered in a gigantic database and used for managing the power inside these vehicles. In this field, this paper exposes a new approach to power management inside an electric vehicle based on two-way communication between vehicles and buildings. The principle of this method is established in two sections; the first one is related to vehicles&rsquo; classification and the second one is attached to the buildings&rsquo; recommendations, according to the car position. The classification problem is resolved using the support vector classification method. The recommendation phase is resolved using the artificial intelligence principle and a neural network was employed to give the best decision. The optimal decision will be calculated inside the building, according to its position and using the old vehicle&rsquo;s data, and transferred to the coming vehicle, for optimizing its energy consumption method in the corresponding building zone. Different possibilities and situations in this approach were discussed. The proposed power management methodology was tested and validated using Simulink/Matlab tool. Results related to the battery state of charge and to the consumed energy were compared at the end of this work, to show the efficiency of this approach.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The problem of power demand forecasting for the effective planning and operation of smart grid, renewable energy and electricity market bidding systems is an open challenge. Numerous research efforts have been proposed for improving prediction performance in practical environments through statistical and artificial neural network approaches. Despite these efforts, power demand forecasting problems remain to be a grand challenge since existing methods are not sufficiently practical to be widely deployed due to their limited accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid power demand forecasting model, called (c, l)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) + Convolution Neural Network (CNN). We consider the power demand as a key value, while we incorporate c different types of contextual information such as temperature, humidity and season as context values in order to preprocess datasets into bivariate sequences consisting of &lt;Key, Context[1, c]&gt; pairs. These c bivariate sequences are then input into c LSTM networks with l layers to extract feature sets. Using these feature sets, a CNN layer outputs a predicted profile of power demand. To assess the applicability of the proposed hybrid method, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world datasets. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed (c, l)-LSTM+CNN hybrid model performs with higher accuracy than previous approaches.

VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SN  - 2413-8851

AB  - As urban populations grow worldwide, it becomes increasingly important to critically analyse accessibility&mdash;the ease with which residents can reach key places or opportunities. The combination of &lsquo;big data&rsquo; and advances in computational techniques such as machine learning (ML) could be a boon for urban accessibility studies, yet their application in this field remains limited. In this study, we provided detailed predictions of healthcare accessibility across a rapidly growing city and related them to socio-economic factors using a combination of classical and modern data analysis methods. Using the City of Surrey (Canada) as a case study, we clustered high-resolution income data for 2016 and 2022 using principal component analysis (PCA) and a powerful ML clustering tool, the self-organising map (SOM). We then combined this with door-to-door travel times to hospitals and clinics, calculated using a simple open-source tool. Focusing our analysis on senior populations (65+ years), we found that higher income clusters are projected to become more prevalent across Surrey over our study period. Low income clusters have on average better accessibility to healthcare facilities than high income clusters in both 2016 and 2022. Population growth will be the biggest accessibility challenge in neighbourhoods with good existing access to healthcare, whereas income change (both positive and negative) will be most challenging in poorly connected neighbourhoods. A dual accessibility problem may arise in Surrey: first, large senior populations will reside in areas with access to numerous and close-by, clinics, putting pressure on existing facilities for specialised services. Second, lower-income seniors will increasingly reside in areas poorly connected to healthcare services, which may impact accessibility equity. We demonstrate that combining PCA and SOM clustering techniques results in novel insights for predicting accessibility at the neighbourhood level. This allows for robust planning policy recommendations to be drawn from large multivariate datasets.

This model is based on a theoretical approach where an APT is observed as a multi-vector multi-stage attack with a continuous strategic campaign. To capture these attacks, the entire network flow and particularly raw data must be used as an input for the detection process. By combining different types of tailored DL-methods, it is possible to capture certain types of anomalies and behaviour. Our method essentially breaks down a bigger problem into smaller tasks, tries to solve these sequentially and finally returns a conclusive result. This concept paper outlines, for example, the problems and possible solutions for the tasks. Additionally, we describe how we will be developing, implementing and testing the method in the near future.

VL  - 8

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - High crowd mobility is a characteristic of transportation hubs such as metro/bus/bike stations in cities worldwide. Forecasting the crowd flow for such places, known as station-level crowd flow forecast (SLCFF) in this paper, would have many benefits, for example traffic management and public safety. Concretely, SLCFF predicts the number of people that will arrive at or depart from stations in a given period. However, one challenge is that the crowd flows across hundreds of stations irregularly scattered throughout a city are affected by complicated spatio-temporal events. Additionally, some external factors such as weather conditions or holidays may change the crowd flow tremendously. In this paper, a spatio-temporal U-shape network model (ST-Unet) for SLCFF is proposed. It is a neural network-based multi-output regression model, handling hundreds of target variables, i.e., all stations&rsquo; in and out flows. ST-Unet emphasizes stations&rsquo; spatial dependence by integrating the crowd flow information from neighboring stations and the cluster it belongs to after hierarchical clustering. It learns the temporal dependence by modeling the temporal closeness, period, and trend of crowd flows. With proper modifications on the network structure, ST-Unet is easily trained and has reliable convergency. Experiments on four real-world datasets were carried out to verify the proposed method&rsquo;s performance and the results show that ST-Unet outperforms seven baselines in terms of SLCFF.

AB  - With the advance of 5G communication technologies and Internet+ strategy, mobile commerce has experienced rapid growth and needs urgent attention from researchers. It is the aim of this article to analyze the literature on mobile commerce to address the following question: With the wide application of artificial intelligence and big data, what are the latest technology, models and problems in the background of the new era that researchers and practitioners need to understand in order to grasp the research frontier in this field quickly? Therefore, to achieve these objectives, this paper reviews 1130 m-commerce articles with 25,502 associated references from the SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH database and develops a framework of m-commerce value by analyzing the most influential authors, institutions, countries, journals and keywords in m-commerce. We apply three types of knowledge mapping to our study&mdash;cluster view, timezone view and timeline view. Frequency statistics, clustering coefficient as well as centrality calculation are employed to analyze by CiteSpace. We use the strength of citation bursts to analyze keywords and put result into the I-Modelwhich provide an important framework for classifying m-commerce activities and theories. In this study, we explore the knowledge structure, development and the future trend of mobile commerce for researchers. We identify the main technology and models to improve customer satisfaction and adoption behavior in the background of the new era which provide decision support for practitioners. Compared with the existing literature reviews of mobile commerce, we make a set of knowledge maps to show the future trend of mobile commerce and analyze visual results based on I-model. It is the first study to present the major clusters to reveal their associated intellectual bases and research fronts.

AB  - With the aim of reducing cost, carbon emissions, and service periods and improving clients’ satisfaction with the logistics network, this paper investigates the optimization of a variant of the location-routing problem (LRP), namely the regional low-carbon LRP (RLCLRP), considering simultaneous pickup and delivery, hard time windows, and a heterogeneous fleet. In order to solve this problem, we construct a biobjective model for the RLCLRP with minimum total cost consisting of depot, vehicle rental, fuel consumption, carbon emission costs, and vehicle waiting time. This paper further proposes a novel hyper-heuristic (HH) method to tackle the biobjective model. The presented method applies a quantum-based approach as a high-level selection strategy and the great deluge, late acceptance, and environmental selection as the acceptance criteria. We examine the superior efficiency of the proposed approach and model by conducting numerical experiments using different instances. Additionally, several managerial insights are provided for logistics enterprises to plan and design a distribution network by extensively analyzing the effects of various domain parameters such as depot cost and location, client distribution, and fleet composition on key performance indicators including fuel consumption, carbon emissions, logistics costs, and travel distance and time.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Panoramic images have a wide range of applications in many fields with their ability to perceive all-round information. Object detection based on panoramic images has certain advantages in terms of environment perception due to the characteristics of panoramic images, e.g., lager perspective. In recent years, deep learning methods have achieved remarkable results in image classification and object detection. Their performance depends on the large amount of training data. Therefore, a good training dataset is a prerequisite for the methods to achieve better recognition results. Then, we construct a benchmark named Pano-RSOD for panoramic road scene object detection. Pano-RSOD contains vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs and guiding arrows. The objects of Pano-RSOD are labelled by bounding boxes in the images. Different from traditional object detection datasets, Pano-RSOD contains more objects in a panoramic image, and the high-resolution images have 360-degree environmental perception, more annotations, more small objects and diverse road scenes. The state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms are trained on Pano-RSOD for object detection, which demonstrates that Pano-RSOD is a useful benchmark, and it provides a better panoramic image training dataset for object detection tasks, especially for small and deformed objects.

AB  - In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and its subarea of deep learning have drawn the attention of many researchers. At the same time, advances in technologies enable the generation or collection of large amounts of valuable data (e.g., sensor data) from various sources in different applications, such as those for the Internet of Things (IoT), which in turn aims towards the development of smart cities. With the availability of sensor data from various sources, sensor information fusion is in demand for effective integration of big data. In this article, we present an AI-based sensor-information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of transportation data generated and collected from various types of sensors, including remote sensed imagery for the geographic information system (GIS), accelerometers, as well as sensors for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and global positioning system (GPS). The discovered knowledge and information returned from our system provides analysts with a clearer understanding of trajectories or mobility of citizens, which in turn helps to develop better transportation models to achieve the ultimate goal of smarter cities. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and practicality of our AI-based sensor information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of big transportation data.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This work addresses the problem of energy consumption time series forecasting. In our approach, a set of time series containing energy consumption data is used to train a single, parameterised prediction model that can be used to predict future values for all the input time series. As a result, the proposed method is able to learn the common behaviour of all time series in the set (i.e., a fingerprint) and use this knowledge to perform the prediction task, and to explain this common behaviour as an algebraic formula. To that end, we use symbolic regression methods trained with both single- and multi-objective algorithms. Experimental results validate this approach to learn and model shared properties of different time series, which can then be used to obtain a generalised regression model encapsulating the global behaviour of different energy consumption time series.

AB  - Urban population is steadily growing worldwide, while the number of people in Eastern Europe is decreasing. These two contradictory trends have outlined the proposal for sustainable solutions to solve civil engineering issues that are aimed at implementing the principles of sustainable development and ensuring a better quality of urban life. When considering the problem that is encountered in Eastern European countries, a multi-criteria model for sustainable urban development has been designed and focused on planning and simulating an inner urban living environment. The suggested model has disclosed the social, economic, environmental, and sustainable components of the infrastructure that are necessary for developing inner urban areas. The components have been adapted and presented in three different size territories covering Lithuanian cities and towns. The applied expert evaluation method has assisted in determining the key criteria that should be considered in order to identify the most important inner areas of urban development. It is expected that this study will extend activities that are performed in the field of improvement of sustainability engineering processes and offer guidelines for other researchers investigating the areas of inner urban development.

AB  - Visualization of underground infrastructure in an interactive 3D immersive environment is extremely important for efficient management of city&rsquo;s infrastructure. This paper describes different geometric modelling approaches to illustrate appropriate visualization of such data. A multimodal prototype has been developed by exploiting different algorithms to render these invisible underground objects as part of an urban model. This prototype has been integrated in an immersive geographic information system (GIS), named MultiVis, for handheld iOS and Android devices. As a part of the study, three distinct strategies have been tested; the first is based on the use of transparencies to convey a sense of depth, the second relies on an image-space superposition of &ldquo;ditches&rdquo; on top of the rendered frame and the third is a world-space deformation of the elevation model that exposes the underground elements. Furthermore, a comparative user experience analysis of different techniques aimed to the geometrically accurate visualisation of utility networks and other underground facilities are performed and evaluated. It includes a set of user evaluations for different parameters of these techniques, which gives us an insight on how the proposed methods affect the experience and usability for technical and non-technical users.

AB  - Noise pollution is one of the topmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the United States. Continued exposure to high levels of noise has proven effects on health, including acute effects such as sleep disruption, and long-term effects such as hypertension, heart disease, and hearing loss. To investigate and ultimately aid in the mitigation of urban noise, a network of 55 sensor nodes has been deployed across New York City for over two years, collecting sound pressure level (SPL) and audio data. This network has cumulatively amassed over 75 years of calibrated, high-resolution SPL measurements and 35 years of audio data. In addition, high frequency telemetry data have been collected that provides an indication of a sensors&rsquo; health. These telemetry data were analyzed over an 18-month period across 31 of the sensors. It has been used to develop a prototype model for pre-failure detection which has the ability to identify sensors in a prefail state 69.1% of the time. The entire network infrastructure is outlined, including the operation of the sensors, followed by an analysis of its data yield and the development of the fault detection approach and the future system integration plans for this.

AB  - The literature on portfolio selection and risk measurement has considerably advanced in recent years. The aim of the present paper is to trace the development of the literature and identify areas that require further research. This paper provides a literature review of the characteristics of financial data, commonly used models of portfolio selection, and portfolio risk measurement. In the summary of the characteristics of financial data, we summarize the literature on fat tail and dependence characteristic of financial data. In the portfolio selection model part, we cover three models: mean-variance model, global minimum variance (GMV) model and factor model. In the portfolio risk measurement part, we first classify risk measurement methods into two categories: moment-based risk measurement and moment-based and quantile-based risk measurement. Moment-based risk measurement includes time-varying covariance matrix and shrinkage estimation, while moment-based and quantile-based risk measurement includes semi-variance, VaR and CVaR.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Soil salinization is a global issue resulting in soil degradation, arable land loss and ecological environmental deterioration. Over the decades, multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing have enabled efficient and cost-effective monitoring of salt-affected soils. However, the potential of hyperspectral sensors installed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to estimate and map soil salinity has not been thoroughly explored. This study quantitatively characterized and estimated field-scale soil salinity using an electromagnetic induction (EMI) equipment and a hyperspectral camera installed on a UAV platform. In addition, 30 soil samples (0~20 cm) were collected in each field for the lab measurements of electrical conductivity. First, the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) values measured by EMI were calibrated using the lab measured electrical conductivity derived from soil samples based on empirical line method. Second, the soil salinity was quantitatively estimated using the random forest (RF) regression method based on the reflectance factors of UAV hyperspectral images and satellite multispectral data. The performance of models was assessed by Lin&rsquo;s concordance coefficient (CC), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and root mean square error (RMSE). Finally, the soil salinity of three study fields with different land cover were mapped. The results showed that bare land (field A) exhibited the most severe salinity, followed by dense vegetation area (field C) and sparse vegetation area (field B). The predictive models using UAV data outperformed those derived from GF-2 data with lower RMSE, higher CC and RPD values, and the most accurate UAV-derived model was developed using 62 hyperspectral bands of the image of the field A with the RMSE, CC, and RPD values of 1.40 dS m&minus;1, 0.94, and 2.98, respectively. Our results indicated that UAV-borne hyperspectral imager is a useful tool for field-scale soil salinity monitoring and mapping. With the help of the EMI technique, quantitative estimation of surface soil salinity is critical to decision-making in arid land management and saline soil reclamation.

AB  - Recently, network attacks launched by malicious attackers have seriously affected modern life and enterprise production, and these network attack samples have the characteristic of type imbalance, which undoubtedly increases the difficulty of intrusion detection. In response to this problem, it would naturally be very meaningful to design an intrusion detection system (IDS) to effectively and quickly identify and detect malicious behaviors. In our work, we have proposed a method for an IDS-combined incremental extreme learning machine (I-ELM) with an adaptive principal component (A-PCA). In this method, the relevant features of network traffic are adaptively selected, where the best detection accuracy can then be obtained by I-ELM. We have used the NSL-KDD standard dataset and UNSW-NB15 standard dataset to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. Through analysis of the experimental results, we can see that our proposed method has better computation capacity, stronger generalization ability, and higher accuracy.

AB  - Smart ports represent the current trend of port development. Intelligent operations reduce the daily production cost of ports, facilitate efficient production, strengthen the risk mitigation ability and comply with the requirements for long-term development. However, a systematic and scientific smart port evaluation method is missing to nail down the evaluation indicators of a smart port and enable accurate evaluation of a port&rsquo;s degree of intelligence. This paper analyzes the concept of the smart port, establishes a set of smart port evaluation indicator systems, and applies a single-valued neutrosophic exponential similarity measure to port evaluation to enable quantitative evaluation of port integrity. This evaluation method is capable of decision-making in the event of incomplete, uncertain, and inconsistent information during general evaluation, opening up a new method for smart port evaluation, and acting as a helpful tool for ports to carry out improvements during actual application.

AB  - A growing presence of distributed energy resources (DER) and the increasingly diverse nature of end users at low-voltage (LV) networks make the operation of these grids more and more challenging. Particularly, congestion and voltage management strategies for LV grids have usually been limited to some elemental criteria based on human experience, asset oversizing, or grid reinforcement. However, with the current massive deployment of sensors in modern LV grids, new approaches are feasible for distribution network assets operation. This article proposes a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) approach, combined with data analytics through affinity propagation clustering, for congestion threshold determination in LV grids. A real case study from the smart grid of Smartcity Malaga Living Lab is used to illustrate the proposed approach. Within this approach, distribution system operators (DSOs) can take decisions in order to prevent situations of risk or potential failure at LV grids.

AB  - Many cities around the world are facing immense pressure due to the expediting growth rates in urban population levels. The notion of &lsquo;smart cities&rsquo; has been proposed as a solution to enhance the sustainability of cities through effective urban management of governance, energy and transportation. The research presented herein examines the applicability of a mathematical framework to enhance the sustainability of decisions involved in zoning, land-use allocation and facility location within smart cities. In particular, a mathematical optimisation framework is proposed, which links through with other platforms in city settings, for optimising the zoning, land-use allocation, location of new buildings and the investment decisions made regarding infrastructure works in smart cities. Multiple objective functions are formulated to optimise social, economic and environmental considerations in the urban space. The impact on underlying traffic of location choices made for the newly introduced buildings is accounted for through optimised assignment of traffic to the underlying network. A case example on urban planning and infrastructure development within a smart city is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.

AB  - Through the Internet of things (IoT), as promoted by smart cities, there is an emergence of big data accentuating the use of artificial intelligence through various components of urban planning, management, and design. One such system is that of artificial neural networks (ANNs), a component of machine learning that boasts similitude with brain neurological networks and its functioning. However, the development of ANN was done in singular fashion, whereby processes are rendered in sequence in a unidimensional perspective, contrasting with the functions of the brain to which ANN boasts similitude, and in particular to the concept of neuroplasticity which encourages unique complex interactions in self-learning fashion, thereby encouraging more inclusive urban processes and render urban coherence. This paper takes inspiration from Christopher Alexander&rsquo;s Nature of Order and dwells in the concept of complexity theory; it also proposes a theoretical model of how ANN can be rendered with the same plastic properties as brain neurological networks with multidimensional interactivity in the context of smart cities through the use of big data and its emerging complex networks. By doing so, this model caters to the creation of stronger, richer, and more complex patterns that support Alexander&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; through the connection of overlapping networks. This paper is aimed toward engineers with interdisciplinary interest looking at creating more complex and intricate ANN models, and toward urban planners and urban theorists working on the emerging contemporary concept of smart cities.

AB  - Citizen safety in modern urban environments is an important aspect of life quality. Implementation of a smart city approach to video surveillance depends heavily on the capability of gathering and processing huge amounts of live urban data. Analyzing data from high bandwidth surveillance video streams provided by large size distributed sensor networks is particularly challenging. We propose here an efficient method for automatic violent behavior detection designed for video sensor networks. Known solutions to real-time violence detection are not suitable for implementation in a resource-constrained environment due to the high processing power requirements. Our algorithm achieves real-time processing on a Raspberry PI-embedded architecture. To ensure separation of temporal and spatial information processing we employ a computationally effective cascaded approach. It consists of a deep neural network followed by a time domain classifier. In contrast with current approaches, the deep neural network input is fed exclusively with motion vector features extracted directly from the MPEG encoded video stream. As proven by results, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, while running on a low computational resources embedded architecture.

As the volume of the collected data increases, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are applied to further enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. The field of smart transportation has attracted many researchers and it has been approached with both ML and IoT techniques. In this review, smart transportation is considered to be an umbrella term that covers route optimization, parking, street lights, accident prevention/detection, road anomalies, and infrastructure applications. The purpose of this paper is to make a self-contained review of ML techniques and IoT applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and obtain a clear view of the trends in the aforementioned fields and spot possible coverage needs. From the reviewed articles it becomes profound that there is a possible lack of ML coverage for the Smart Lighting Systems and Smart Parking applications. Additionally, route optimization, parking, and accident/detection tend to be the most popular ITS applications among researchers.

Several approaches inside this domain make use of knowledge bases or knowledge graphs, both previously existing and ad hoc. This form of representation allows heterogeneous data gathered from diverse sources to be contextualized and combined to create relevant information for intelligent systems, usually following higher level constraints defined by an ontology. In this work, we conduct a systematic review of the existing usages of knowledge bases in intelligent environments, as well as an in-depth study of the predictive and decision-making models employed. Finally, we present a use case for smart homes and illustrate the use and advantages of Knowledge Graph Embeddings in this context.

Protected agriculture is one of the fields which has broad application prospects of IoT. Protected agriculture is a mode of highly efficient development of modern agriculture that uses artificial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature, to create environmental conditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of IoT applications in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure and key technologies. Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research and deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the contributions made by different academicians and organizations. Selected references were clustered into three application domains corresponding to plant management, animal farming and food/agricultural product supply traceability. Furthermore, we discussed the challenges along with future research prospects, to help new researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.

AB  - To achieve the full analytical potential of the streaming data from the internet of things, the interconnection of various data sources is needed. By definition, those sources are heterogeneous and their integration is not a trivial task. A common approach to exploit streaming sensor data potential is to use machine learning techniques for predictive analytics in a way that is agnostic to the domain knowledge. Such an approach can be easily integrated in various use cases. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data fusion of a set of heterogeneous data streams. The proposed framework enriches streaming sensor data with the contextual and historical information relevant for describing the underlying processes. The final result of the framework is a feature vector, ready to be used in a machine learning algorithm. The framework has been applied to a cloud and to an edge device. In the latter case, incremental learning capabilities have been demonstrated. The reported results illustrate a significant improvement of data-driven models, applied to sensor streams. Beside higher accuracy of the models the platform offers easy setup and thus fast prototyping capabilities in real-world applications.

AB  - Cyber-attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) are growing at an alarming rate as devices, applications, and communication networks are becoming increasingly connected and integrated. When attacks on IoT networks go undetected for longer periods, it affects availability of critical systems for end users, increases the number of data breaches and identity theft, drives up the costs and impacts the revenue. It is imperative to detect attacks on IoT systems in near real time to provide effective security and defense. In this paper, we develop an intelligent intrusion-detection system tailored to the IoT environment. Specifically, we use a deep-learning algorithm to detect malicious traffic in IoT networks. The detection solution provides security as a service and facilitates interoperability between various network communication protocols used in IoT. We evaluate our proposed detection framework using both real-network traces for providing a proof of concept, and using simulation for providing evidence of its scalability. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed intrusion-detection system can detect real-world intrusions effectively.

AB  - As the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge computing have been major paradigms for distributed data collection, communication, and processing, smart city applications in the real world tend to adopt IoT and edge computing broadly. Today, more and more machine learning algorithms would be deployed into front-end sensors, devices, and edge data centres rather than centralised cloud data centres. However, front-end sensors and devices are usually not so capable as those computing units in huge data centres, and for this sake, in practice, engineers choose to compromise for limited capacity of embedded computing and limited memory, e.g., neural network models being pruned to fit embedded devices. Visual object tracking is one of many important elements of a smart city, and in the IoT and edge computing context, high requirements to computing power and memory space severely prevent massive and accurate tracking. In this paper, we report on our contribution to object tracking on lightweight computing including (1) using limited computing capacity and memory space to realise tracking; (2) proposing a new algorithm region proposal correlation filter fitting for most edge devices. Systematic evaluations show that (1) our techniques can fit most IoT devices; (2) our techniques can keep relatively high accuracy; and (3) the generated model size is much less than others.

AB  - Rapid classification of tumors that are detected in the medical images is of great importance in the early diagnosis of the disease. In this paper, a new liver and brain tumor classification method is proposed by using the power of convolutional neural network (CNN) in feature extraction, the power of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in signal processing, and the power of long short-term memory (LSTM) in signal classification. A CNN&ndash;DWT&ndash;LSTM method is proposed to classify the computed tomography (CT) images of livers with tumors and to classify the magnetic resonance (MR) images of brains with tumors. The proposed method classifies liver tumors images as benign or malignant and then classifies brain tumor images as meningioma, glioma, and pituitary. In the hybrid CNN&ndash;DWT&ndash;LSTM method, the feature vector of the images is obtained from pre-trained AlexNet CNN architecture. The feature vector is reduced but strengthened by applying the single-level one-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (1-D DWT), and it is classified by training with an LSTM network. Under the scope of the study, images of 56 benign and 56 malignant liver tumors that were obtained from Fırat University Research Hospital were used and a publicly available brain tumor dataset were used. The experimental results show that the proposed method had higher performance than classifiers, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). By using the CNN&ndash;DWT&ndash;LSTM hybrid method, an accuracy rate of 99.1% was achieved in the liver tumor classification and accuracy rate of 98.6% was achieved in the brain tumor classification. We used two different datasets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Performance measurements show that the proposed method has a satisfactory accuracy rate at the liver tumor and brain tumor classifying.

AB  - New technological advances based on software, hardware and new materials must be implemented in smart grids. In addition, these advanced electrical grids must incorporate elements of artificial intelligence. Advances in software development must be complemented with the development of new hardware (power electronics and active distribution among others). The aforementioned must rely on the development of new materials and sensors, which should be integrated into the smart grid. Therefore, the four areas of research based on the technologies are: Operation and Control, Maintenance and Lifespan Management, Grid Planning and Design, and Metering. The review presents the algorithms, materials, devices and others paradigms applied to smart grids, classifying the works according to the four areas of research. This review has focused on the four fundamental pillars of smart grids, on the one hand, the need for more efficient operation and control, followed by advanced maintenance management, to continue planning and designing the new grids, and for conclude with the advanced measurement. As you will see in the article, new devices, new techniques, and future scenarios will make possible the transition from the current grid to the future smart grid.

TI  - Dependable Fire Detection System with Multifunctional Artificial Intelligence Framework

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A fire detection system requires accurate and fast mechanisms to make the right decision in a fire situation. Since most commercial fire detection systems use a simple sensor, their fire recognition accuracy is deficient because of the limitations of the detection capability of the sensor. Existing proposals, which use rule-based algorithms or image-based machine learning can hardly adapt to the changes in the environment because of their static features. Since the legacy fire detection systems and network services do not guarantee data transfer latency, the required need for promptness is unmet. In this paper, we propose a new fire detection system with a multifunctional artificial intelligence framework and a data transfer delay minimization mechanism for the safety of smart cities. The framework includes a set of multiple machine learning algorithms and an adaptive fuzzy algorithm. In addition, Direct-MQTT based on SDN is introduced to solve the traffic concentration problems of the traditional MQTT. We verify the performance of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and delay time and found a fire detection accuracy of over 95%. The end-to-end delay, which comprises the transfer and decision delays, is reduced by an average of 72%.

TI  - Forecasting Heating Consumption in Buildings: A Scalable Full-Stack Distributed Engine

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Predicting power demand of building heating systems is a challenging task due to the high variability of their energy profiles. Power demand is characterized by different heating cycles including sequences of various transient and steady-state phases. To effectively perform the predictive task by exploiting the huge amount of fine-grained energy-related data collected through Internet of Things (IoT) devices, innovative and scalable solutions should be devised. This paper presents PHi-CiB, a scalable full-stack distributed engine, addressing all tasks from energy-related data collection, to their integration, storage, analysis, and modeling. Heterogeneous data measurements (e.g., power consumption in buildings, meteorological conditions) are collected through multiple hardware (e.g., IoT devices) and software (e.g., web services) entities. Such data are integrated and analyzed to predict the average power demand of each building for different time horizons. First, the transient and steady-state phases characterizing the heating cycle of each building are automatically identified; then the power-level forecasting is performed for each phase. To this aim, PHi-CiB relies on a pipeline of three algorithms: the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, and the Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent. PHi-CiB&rsquo;s current implementation exploits Apache Spark and MongoDB and supports parallel and scalable processing and analytical tasks. Experimental results, performed on energy-related data collected in a real-world system show the effectiveness of PHi-CiB in predicting heating power consumption of buildings with a limited prediction error and an optimal horizontal scalability.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In a smart home linked to a smart grid (SG), demand-side management (DSM) has the potential to reduce electricity costs and carbon/chlorofluorocarbon emissions, which are associated with electricity used in today&rsquo;s modern society. To meet continuously increasing electrical energy demands requested from downstream sectors in an SG, energy management systems (EMS), developed with paradigms of artificial intelligence (AI) across Internet of things (IoT) and conducted in fields of interest, monitor, manage, and analyze industrial, commercial, and residential electrical appliances efficiently in response to demand response (DR) signals as DSM. Usually, a DSM service provided by utilities for consumers in an SG is based on cloud-centered data science analytics. However, such cloud-centered data science analytics service involved for DSM is mostly far away from on-site IoT end devices, such as DR switches/power meters/smart meters, which is usually unacceptable for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications in DSM. This implies that, for instance, IoT end devices deployed on-site for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications in DSM should be aware of immediately analytical, interpretable, and real-time actionable data insights processed on and identified by IoT end devices at IoT sources. Therefore, this work designs and implements a smart edge analytics-empowered power meter prototype considering advanced AI in DSM for smart homes. The prototype in this work works in a cloud analytics-assisted electrical EMS architecture, which is designed and implemented as edge analytics in the architecture described and developed toward a next-generation smart sensing infrastructure for smart homes. Two different types of AI deployed on-site on the prototype are conducted for DSM and compared in this work. The experimentation reported in this work shows the architecture described with the prototype in this work is feasible and workable.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The advent of fifth-generation (5G) systems and their mechanics have introduced an unconventional frequency spectrum of high bandwidth with most falling under the millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum. The benefit of adopting these bands of the frequency spectrum is two-fold. First, most of these bands appear to be unutilized and they are free, thus suggesting the absence of interference from other technologies. Second, the availability of a larger bandwidth offers higher data rates for all users, as there are higher numbers of users who are connected in a small geographical area, which is also stated as the Internet of Things (IoT). Nevertheless, high-frequency band poses several challenges in terms of coverage area limitations, signal attenuation, path and penetration losses, as well as scattering. Additionally, mmWave signal bands are susceptible to blockage from buildings and other structures, particularly in higher-density urban areas. Identifying the channel performance at a given frequency is indeed necessary to optimize communication efficiency between the transmitter and receiver. Therefore, this paper investigated the potential ability of mmWave path loss models, such as floating intercept (FI) and close-in (CI), based on real measurements gathered from urban microcell outdoor environments at 38 GHz conducted at the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Kuala Lumpur campus. The measurement data were obtained by using a narrow band mmWave channel sounder equipped with a steerable direction horn antenna. It investigated the potential of the network for outdoor scenarios of line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) with both schemes of co- (vertical-vertical) and cross (vertical-horizontal) polarization. The parameters were selected to reflect the performance and the variances with other schemes, such as average users cell throughput, throughput of users that are at cell-edges, fairness index, and spectral efficiency. The outcomes were examined for various antenna configurations as well as at different channel bandwidths to prove the enhancement of overall network performance. This work showed that the CI path loss model predicted greater network performance for the LOS condition, and also estimated significant outcomes for the NLOS environment. The outputs proved that the FI path loss model, particularly for V-V antenna polarization, gave system simulation results that were unsuitable for the NLOS scenario.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The exact location of objects, such as infrastructure, is crucial to the systematic understanding of the built environment. The emergence and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) have attracted growing attention to the low-cost location scheme, which can respond to a dramatic increasing amount of public infrastructure in smart cities. Various Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID)-based locating systems and noise mitigation methods have been developed. However, most of them are impractical for built environments in large areas due to their high cost, computational complexity, and low noise detection capability. In this paper, we proposed a novel noise mitigation solution integrating the low-cost localization scheme with one mobile RFID reader. We designed a filter algorithm to remove the influence of abnormal data. Inspired the sampling concept, a more carefully parameters calibration was carried out for noise data sampling to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational complexity. To achieve robust noise detection results, we employed the powerful noise detection capability of the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method for the localization and noise mitigation in a large area. The proposed scheme has potential applications for location-based services in smart cities.

AB  - Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been designed, implemented, and validated to help clinicians and practitioners for decision-making about diagnosing some diseases. Within the CDSSs, we can find Fuzzy inference systems. For the reasons above, the objective of this study was to design, to implement, and to validate a methodology for developing data-driven Mamdani-type fuzzy clinical decision support systems using clusters and pivot tables. For validating the proposed methodology, we applied our algorithms on five public datasets including Wisconsin, Coimbra breast cancer, wart treatment (Immunotherapy and cryotherapy), and caesarian section, and compared them with other related works (Literature). The results show that the Kappa Statistics and accuracies were close to 1.0% and 100%, respectively for each output variable, which shows better accuracy than some literature results. The proposed framework could be considered as a deep learning technique because it is composed of various processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction.

AB  - Mobile robot motion planning in an unstructured, static, and dynamic environment is faced with a large amount of uncertainties. In an uncertain working area, a method should be selected to address the existing uncertainties in order to plan a collision-free path between the desired two points. In this paper, we propose a mobile robot path planning method in the visualize plane using an overhead camera based on interval type-2 fuzzy logic (IT2FIS). We deal with a visual-servoing based technique for obstacle-free path planning. It is necessary to determine the location of a mobile robot in an environment surrounding the robot. To reach the target and for avoiding obstacles efficiently under different shapes of obstacle in an environment, an IT2FIS is designed to generate a path. A simulation of the path planning technique compared with other methods is performed. We tested the algorithm within various scenarios. Experiment results showed the efficiency of the generated path using an overhead camera for a mobile robot.

AB  - This paper presents an analyses of an Energy Storage System (ESS) for grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) systems, in order to harness the energy usually lost due to PV array oversizing. A real case of annual PV power generation analysis is presented to illustrate the existing problem and future solutions. Three PV modeling techniques have been applied to estimate non-measured non-harnessed PV power to provide an ESS energy and power sizing strategy. Moreover, a control strategy to store or release power from the DC-link, without modifying the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) strategy, is presented. The results show an estimation of the annual power loss caused by oversizing the PV array. The ESS sizing strategy gives insight into not only the energy requirements, but also the power requirements of the system. Simulation results show that the proposed ESS control strategy is capable of harnessing the extra power without modifying the existing power converter of the PV plant nor its control strategy.

AB  - Traffic congestion prediction is critical for implementing intelligent transportation systems for improving the efficiency and capacity of transportation networks. However, despite its importance, traffic congestion prediction is severely less investigated compared to traffic flow prediction, which is partially due to the severe lack of large-scale high-quality traffic congestion data and advanced algorithms. This paper proposes an accessible and general workflow to acquire large-scale traffic congestion data and to create traffic congestion datasets based on image analysis. With this workflow we create a dataset named Seattle Area Traffic Congestion Status (SATCS) based on traffic congestion map snapshots from a publicly available online traffic service provider Washington State Department of Transportation. We then propose a deep autoencoder-based neural network model with symmetrical layers for the encoder and the decoder to learn temporal correlations of a transportation network and predicting traffic congestion. Our experimental results on the SATCS dataset show that the proposed DCPN model can efficiently and effectively learn temporal relationships of congestion levels of the transportation network for traffic congestion forecasting. Our method outperforms two other state-of-the-art neural network models in prediction performance, generalization capability, and computation efficiency.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In the uncooled infrared imaging systems, owing to the non-uniformity of the amplifier in the readout circuit, the infrared image has obvious stripe noise, which greatly affects its quality. In this study, the generation mechanism of stripe noise is analyzed, and a new stripe correction algorithm based on wavelet analysis and gradient equalization is proposed, according to the single-direction distribution of the fixed image noise of infrared focal plane array. The raw infrared image is transformed by a wavelet transform, and the cumulative histogram of the vertical component is convolved by a Gaussian operator with a one-dimensional matrix, in order to achieve gradient equalization in the horizontal direction. In addition, the stripe noise is further separated from the edge texture by a guided filter. The algorithm is verified by simulating noised image and real infrared image, and the comparison experiment and qualitative and quantitative analysis with the current advanced algorithm show that the correction result of the algorithm in this paper is not only mild in visual effect, but also that the structural similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) indexes can get the best result. It is shown that this algorithm can effectively remove stripe noise without losing details, and the correction performance of this method is better than the most advanced method.

AB  - Understanding hydrological processes in large, open areas, such as catchments, and further modelling these processes are still open research questions. The system proposed in this work provides an automatic end-to-end pipeline from data collection to information extraction that can potentially assist hydrologists to better understand the hydrological processes using a data-driven approach. In this work, the performance of a low-cost off-the-shelf self contained sensor unit, which was originally designed and used to monitor liquid levels, such as AdBlue, fuel, lubricants etc., in a sealed tank environment, is first examined. This process validates that the sensor does provide accurate water level information for open water level monitoring tasks. Utilising the dataset collected from eight sensor units, an end-to-end pipeline of automating the data collection, data processing and information extraction processes is proposed. Within the pipeline, a data-driven anomaly detection method that automatically extracts rapid changes in measurement trends at a catchment scale. The lag-time of the test site (Dodder catchment Dublin, Ireland) is also analyzed. Subsequently, the water level response in the catchment due to storm events during the 27 month deployment period is illustrated. To support reproducible and collaborative research, the collected dataset and the source code of this work will be publicly available for research purposes.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Automatic ground filtering is an essential step for Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generation, which has significant application value. However, extraction and classification of ground points from the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, especially in multitudinous terrain situations, is a challenging task because it is difficult to determine the set of optimal parameters for removing various non-ground features. In this paper, a new ground filtering technique based on an improved Ball Pivot Algorithm (BPA) is proposed. At the beginning, the LiDAR point cloud dataset was divided into different subsets based on the 2D regular grid. The lowest point in each grid was selected as the seed point to build a single-layer surface. After that, the improved BPA was executed to remove points on the higher location. Then, the rest of the points were calculated and selected as a new seed point according to the spatial relationship with the initial surface. Finally, non-ground points were filtered by means of improved BPA traversing all the grids. Our experimental results on the Benchmark dataset provided by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Working Group III/3 showed high accuracy (with a mean kappa coefficient over 80%) in terms of completeness, correctness, and quality for DEM generation. The experimental results demonstrated the proposed method is robust to various terrain situations, as it is more effective and feasible for ground filtering.

AB  - The long continuity of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide high space and resolution data for ground deformation investigations. The ground deformation in this paper appeared in the city&rsquo;s development, although it is close to the Erhai region, which is different from a water-deficient city. Therefore, the analysis and prediction of ground deformation using a new method is required. In this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from 2015 to 2018 were used to study the characteristics of ground deformation in the Erhai region using the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique. The results were cross-validated using ascending and descending direction images to ensure the accuracy. In addition, the results showed that there was little ground deformation in the northern part of the Erhai region, while there was obvious ground deformation in the southern part. Four influencing factors&mdash;including the building area, water level, cumulative precipitation, and cumulative temperature of the southern Erhai region&mdash;were used together to predict the cumulative ground deformation using back-propagation (BP). The R of all the involved data was 0.966, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the simulated values using BP and the true measured values were 3.063, 1.003, and 1.119, respectively. The results showed that BP has great potential in predicting the change tendency of ground deformation with high precision. The main reason for ground deformation is the continuous increase of building area; the water level followed. The cumulative precipitation and cumulative temperature are the reasons for the seasonal ground deformation. Some countermeasures and suggestions are given to face the challenge of serious ground deformation.

The fingerprint localization method is proposed in this paper, which is divided into two phases: offline training and online positioning. In offline training phase, the Improved Fuzzy C-means (IFCM) algorithm is proposed for regional division. The Between-Within Proportion (BWP) index is selected to divide fingerprint database, which can ensure the result of regional division consistent with the building plane structure. Moreover, the Agglomerative Nesting (AGNES) algorithm is applied to accomplish Access Point (AP) optimization. In the online positioning phase, sub-region selection is performed by nearest neighbor algorithm, then the Weighted K-nearest Neighbor (WKNN) algorithm based on Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is utilized to locate the target point. After the evaluation on the effect of regional division and AP optimization of location precision and time, the experiments show that the average positioning error is 2.53 m and the average computation time of the localization algorithm based on PCC reduced by 94.13%.

AB  - Measuring financial performance has become an essential topic due to the potential decimating impacts on the corporation itself as well as to whole societies during financial turmoil. In order to provide an overarching description of the multidimensional nature for measuring a corporation&rsquo;s operations, it is preferable to employ data envelopment analysis (DEA). Different from prior research that merely focuses on a singular DEA performance rank, this study extends it to multiple DEA specifications (i.e., it combines inputs and outputs in several different ways) so as to make judgments more complete and robust. We also execute fuzzy visualization technique (i.e., nonlinear fuzzy robust principal component analysis, NFRPCA) to represent the main characteristics of data so that non-specialists can have better access to the results. The analyzed result is then fed into the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to establish a model to forecast a firm&rsquo;s operating performance. Even a fraction of accuracy improvement can result in considerable future savings to a firm and investors. When examined using real cases, the model is a promising alternative for operating performance forecasting and can assist both internal and external market participants.

TI  - An Adaptive Framework for Multi-Vehicle Ground Speed Estimation in Airborne Videos

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAV-based intelligent airborne surveillance systems represented by real-time ground vehicle speed estimation have attracted wide attention from researchers. However, there are still many challenges in extracting speed information from UAV videos, including the dynamic moving background, small target size, complicated environment, and diverse scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive framework for multi-vehicle ground speed estimation in airborne videos. Firstly, we build a traffic dataset based on UAV. Then, we use the deep learning detection algorithm to detect the vehicle in the UAV field of view and obtain the trajectory in the image through the tracking-by-detection algorithm. Thereafter, we present a motion compensation method based on homography. This method obtains matching feature points by an optical flow method and eliminates the influence of the detected target to accurately calculate the homography matrix to determine the real motion trajectory in the current frame. Finally, vehicle speed is estimated based on the mapping relationship between the pixel distance and the actual distance. The method regards the actual size of the car as prior information and adaptively recovers the pixel scale by estimating the vehicle size in the image; it then calculates the vehicle speed. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we carry out a large number of experiments on the AirSim Simulation platform as well as real UAV aerial surveillance experiments. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis of the simulation results and real experiments, we verify that the proposed system has a unique ability to detect, track, and estimate the speed of ground vehicles simultaneously even with a single downward-looking camera. Additionally, the system can obtain effective and accurate speed estimation results, even in various complex scenes.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Traffic noise is presently considered one of the main pollutants in urban and suburban areas. Several recent technological advances have allowed a step forward in the dynamic computation of road-traffic noise levels by means of a Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network (WASN) through the collection of measurements in real-operation environments. In the framework of the LIFE DYNAMAP project, two WASNs have been deployed in two pilot areas: one in the city of Milan, as an urban environment, and another around the city of Rome in a suburban location. For a correct evaluation of the noise level generated by road infrastructures, all Anomalous Noise Events (ANE) unrelated to regular road-traffic noise (e.g., sirens, horns, speech, etc.) should be removed before updating corresponding noise maps. This work presents the production and analysis of a real-operation environmental audio database collected through the 19-node WASN of a suburban area. A total of 156 h and 20 min of labeled audio data has been obtained differentiating among road-traffic noise and ANEs (classified in 16 subcategories). After delimiting their boundaries manually, the acoustic salience of the ANE samples is automatically computed as a contextual Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) together with its impact on the A-weighted equivalent level (    &Delta;  L  A e q      ). The analysis of the real-operation WASN-based environmental database is evaluated with these metrics, and we conclude that the 19 locations of the network present substantial differences in the occurrences of the subcategories of ANE, with a clear predominance of the noise of sirens, trains, and thunder.

AB  - New advances in sensor technologies and communications in wireless sensor networks have favored the introduction of low-cost sensors for monitoring air quality applications. In this article, we present the results of the European project H2020 CAPTOR, where three testbeds with sensors were deployed to capture tropospheric ozone concentrations. One of the biggest challenges was the calibration of the sensors, as the manufacturer provides them without calibrating. Throughout the paper, we show how short-term calibration using multiple linear regression produces good calibrated data, but instead produces biases in the calculated long-term concentrations. To mitigate the bias, we propose a linear correction based on Kriging estimation of the mean and standard deviation of the long-term ozone concentrations, thus correcting the bias presented by the sensors.

AB  - With the development of online cars, the demand for travel prediction is increasing in order to reduce the information asymmetry between passengers and drivers of online car-hailing. This paper proposes a travel demand forecasting model named OC-CNN based on the convolutional neural network to forecast the travel demand. In order to make full use of the spatial characteristics of the travel demand distribution, this paper meshes the prediction area and creates a travel demand data set of the graphical structure to preserve its spatial properties. Taking advantage of the convolutional neural network in image feature extraction, the historical demand data of the first twenty-five minutes of the entire region are used as a model input to predict the travel demand for the next five minutes. In order to verify the performance of the proposed method, one-month data from online car-hailing of the Chengdu Fourth Ring Road are used. The results show that the model successfully extracts the spatiotemporal features of the data, and the prediction accuracies of the proposed method are superior to those of the representative methods, including the Bayesian Ridge Model, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory networks.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the keywords related to smart city concepts, and to understand their flow. This research used a keyword network analysis by collecting keywords from papers published on the web from Scopus, which is an international scholarly papers engine. The data were collected from before and after 2016, and since the amount of data has been growing rapidly after global agreements such as the United Nations&rsquo; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, we attempted to focus on adjacent years of publication. In order to understand the flow of research, we conducted a central analysis, which is widely used in quantitative research relating to social network analysis, and performed cluster analysis to identify relationships with related research. The results of the analysis are represented in the form of network maps, and the role of each keyword was clarified based on these network maps. In addition, the overall flow explained the change of flow through discarded and emerging keywords, and the relationships with related fields were explained through cluster analysis. The findings could serve as a basis for policymakers, urban managers, and researchers seeking a comprehensive understanding of the smart city concept in urban planning areas.

AB  - With the popularity of small-screen smart mobile devices, gestures as a new type of human–computer interaction are highly demanded. Furthermore, finger gestures are more familiar to people in controlling devices. In this paper, a new method for recognizing finger gestures is proposed. Ultrasound was actively emitted to measure the micro-Doppler effect caused by finger motions and was obtained at high resolution. By micro-Doppler processing, micro-Doppler feature maps of finger gestures were generated. Since the feature map has a similar structure to the single channel color image, a recognition model based on a convolutional neural network was constructed for classification. The optimized recognition model achieved an average accuracy of 96.51% in the experiment.

VL  - 16

SN  - 1660-4601

AB  - In this paper, we consider a variant of the location-routing problem (LRP), namely the the multiobjective regional low-carbon LRP (MORLCLRP). The MORLCLRP seeks to minimize service duration, client waiting time, and total costs, which includes carbon emission costs and total depot, vehicle, and travelling costs with respect to fuel consumption, and considers three practical constraints: simultaneous pickup and delivery, heterogeneous fleet, and hard time windows. We formulated a multiobjective mixed integer programming formulations for the problem under study. Due to the complexity of the proposed problem, a general framework, named the multiobjective hyper-heuristic approach (MOHH), was applied for obtaining Pareto-optimal solutions. Aiming at improving the performance of the proposed approach, four selection strategies and three acceptance criteria were developed as the high-level heuristic (HLH), and three multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were designed as the low-level heuristics (LLHs). The performance of the proposed approach was tested for a set of different instances and comparative analyses were also conducted against eight domain-tailored MOEAs. The results showed that the proposed algorithm produced a high-quality Pareto set for most instances. Additionally, extensive analyses were also carried out to empirically assess the effects of domain-specific parameters (i.e., fleet composition, client and depot distribution, and zones area) on key performance indicators (i.e., hypervolume, inverted generated distance, and ratio of nondominated individuals). Several management insights are provided by analyzing the Pareto solutions.

AB  - With the development of the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT), soldiers have become key nodes of information collection and resource control on the battlefield. It has become a trend to develop wearable devices with diverse functions for the military. However, although densely deployed wearable sensors provide a platform for comprehensively monitoring the status of soldiers, wearable technology based on multi-source fusion lacks a generalized research system to highlight the advantages of heterogeneous sensor networks and information fusion. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-level fusion framework (MLFF) based on Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) of soldiers, and describes a model of the deployment of heterogeneous sensor networks. The proposed framework covers multiple types of information at a single node, including behaviors, physiology, emotions, fatigue, environments, and locations, so as to enable Soldier-BSNs to obtain sufficient evidence, decision-making ability, and information resilience under resource constraints. In addition, we systematically discuss the problems and solutions of each unit according to the frame structure to identify research directions for the development of wearable devices for the military.

AB  - Water quality indices that describe the status of water are commonly used in freshwater vulnerability assessment. The design of river water quality monitoring programs has always been a complex process and despite the numerous methodologies employed by experts, there is still no generally accepted, holistic and practical approach to support all the phases and elements related. Here, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based multicriteria decision analysis approach was adopted so as to contribute to the design of the national network for monitoring of water quality parameters in Greece that will additionally fulfill the urgent needs for an operational, real-time monitoring of the water resources. During this cost-effective and easily applied procedure the high priority areas were defined by taking into consideration the most important conditioning factors that impose pressures on rivers and the special conditions that increase the need for monitoring locally. The areas of increased need for automatic monitoring of water quality parameters are highlighted and the output map is validated. The sites in high priority areas are proposed for the installation of automatic monitoring stations and the installation and maintenance budget is presented. Finally, the proposed network is contrasted with the current automatic monitoring network in Greece.

AB  - This study sought to propose a big data analysis and prediction model for transmission line tower outliers to assess when something is wrong with transmission line tower big data based on deep reinforcement learning. The model enables choosing automatic cluster K values based on non-labeled sensor big data. It also allows measuring the distance of action between data inside a cluster with the Q-value representing network output in the altered transmission line tower big data clustering algorithm containing transmission line tower outliers and old Deep Q Network. Specifically, this study performed principal component analysis to categorize transmission line tower data and proposed an automatic initial central point approach through standard normal distribution. It also proposed the A-Deep Q-Learning algorithm altered from the deep Q-Learning algorithm to explore policies based on the experiences of clustered data learning. It can be used to perform transmission line tower outlier data learning based on the distance of data within a cluster. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed model recorded an approximately 2.29%~4.19% higher prediction rate and around 0.8% ~ 4.3% higher accuracy rate compared to the old transmission line tower big data analysis model.

AB  - Currently, one of the main challenges that large metropolitan areas must face is traffic congestion. To address this problem, it becomes necessary to implement an efficient solution to control traffic that generates benefits for citizens, such as reducing vehicle journey times and, consequently, environmental pollution. By properly analyzing traffic demand, it is possible to predict future traffic conditions, using this information for the optimization of the routes taken by vehicles. Such an approach becomes especially effective if applied in the context of autonomous vehicles, which have a more predictable behavior, thus enabling city management entities to mitigate the effects of traffic congestion and pollution, thereby improving the traffic flow in a city in a fully centralized manner. This paper represents a step forward towards this novel traffic management paradigm by proposing a route server capable of handling all the traffic in a city, and balancing traffic flows by accounting for present and future traffic congestion conditions. We perform a simulation study using real data of traffic congestion in the city of Valencia, Spain, to demonstrate how the traffic flow in a typical day can be improved using our proposed solution. Experimental results show that our proposed traffic prediction equation, combined with frequent updating of traffic conditions on the route server, can achieve substantial improvements in terms of average travel speeds and travel times, both indicators of lower degrees of congestion and improved traffic fluidity.

AB  - Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.

AB  - In this study, a novel technique to support smart city planning in estimating and controlling the heating load (HL) of buildings, was proposed, namely PSO-XGBoost. Accordingly, the extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost) was developed to estimate HL first; then, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was applied to optimize the performance of the XGBoost model. The classical XGBoost model, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Gaussian process (GP), and classification and regression trees (CART) models were also investigated and developed to predict the HL of building systems, and compared with the proposed PSO-XGBoost model; 837 investigations of buildings were considered and analyzed with many influential factors, such as glazing area distribution (GAD), glazing area (GA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), and relative compactness (RC). Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), variance account for (VAF), mean absolute error (MAE), and determination coefficient (R2), were used as the statistical criteria for evaluating the performance of the above models. The color intensity, as well as the ranking method, were also used to compare and evaluate the models. The results showed that the proposed PSO-XGBoost model was the most robust technique for estimating the HL of building systems. The remaining models (i.e., XGBoost, SVM, RF, GP, and CART) yielded more mediocre performance through RMSE, MAE, R2, VAF, and MAPE metrics. Another finding of this study also indicated that OH, RA, WA, and SA were the most critical parameters for the accuracy of the proposed PSO-XGBoost model. They should be particularly interested in smart city planning as well as the optimization of smart cities.

AB  - Dust is one of the components causing heavy environmental pollution in open-pit mines, especially PM10. Some pathologies related to the lung, respiratory system, and occupational diseases have been identified due to the effects of PM10 in open-pit mines. Therefore, the prediction and control of PM10 concentration in the production process are necessary for environmental and health protection. In this study, PM10 concentration from drilling operations in the Coc Sau open-pit coal mine (Vietnam) was investigated and considered through a database including 245 datasets collected. A novel hybrid artificial intelligence model was developed based on support vector regression (SVR) and a swarm optimization algorithm (i.e., particle swarm optimization (PSO)), namely PSO-SVR, for estimating PM10 concentration from drilling operations at the mine. Polynomial (P), radial basis function (RBF), and linear (L) kernel functions were considered and applied to the development of the PSO-SVR models in the present study, abbreviated as PSO-SVR-P, PSO-SVR-RBF, and PSO-SVR-L. Also, three benchmark artificial intelligence techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and classification and regression trees (CART), were applied and developed for estimating PM10 concentration and then compared with the PSO-SVR models. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R2) were used as the statistical criteria for evaluating the performance of the developed models. The results exhibited that the PSO algorithm had an essential role in the optimization of the hyper-parameters of the SVR models. The PSO-SVR models (i.e., PSO-SVR-L, PSO-SVR-P, and PSO-SVR-RBF) had higher performance levels than the other models (i.e., RF, CART, and KNN) with an RMSE of 0.040, 0.042, and 0.043; and R2 of 0.954, 0.948, and 0.946; for the PSO-SVR-L, PSO-SVR-P, and PSO-SVR-RBF models, respectively. Of these PSO-SVR models, the PSO-SVR-L model was the most dominant model with an RMSE of 0.040 and R2 of 0.954. The remaining three benchmark models (i.e., RF, CART, and KNN) yielded a more unsatisfactory performance with an RMSE of 0.060, 0.052, and 0.067; and R2 of 0.894, 0.924, and 0.867, for the RF, CART, and KNN models, respectively. Furthermore, the findings of this study demonstrated that the density of rock mass, moisture content, and the penetration rate of the drill were essential parameters on the PM10 concentration caused by drilling operations in open-pit mines.

In this architecture, sensor devices are resident on the distribution grid and therefore have a unique awareness of multiple system parameters. This enables the use of ongoing ML techniques for implementation of critical applications in the Smart Grid. Monitoring devices are placed at the endpoints and monitoring/control devices are placed along the power line on various types of grid-resident systems. Because the devices are grid-resident and interact directly with other devices on the same physical link, applications such as ML-assisted DVO can be targeted with very high confidence.

AB  - The use of UAVs in areas ranging from agriculture over urban services to entertainment or simply as a hobby has rapidly grown over the last years. Regarding serious/commercial applications, UAVs have been considered in the literature, especially as mobile sensing/actuation platforms (i.e., as a delivery platform for an increasingly wide range of sensors and actuators). With regard to timely, cost-effective and very rich data acquisition, both, NEC Research as well as TNO are pursuing investigations into the use of UAVs and swarms of UAVs for scenarios where high-resolution requirements, prohibiting environments or tight time constraints render traditional approaches ineffective. In this review article, we provide a brief overview of safety and security-focused application areas that we identified as main targets for industrial and commercial projects, especially in the context of intelligent autonomous systems and autonomous/semi-autonomously operating swarms. We discuss a number of challenges related to the deployment of UAVs in general and to their deployment within the identified application areas in particular. As such, this article is meant to serve as a review and overview of the literature and the state-of-the-art, but also to offer an outlook over our possible (near-term) future work and the challenges that we will face there.

AB  - Human motion detection and activity recognition are becoming vital for the applications in smart homes. Traditional Human Activity Recognition (HAR) mechanisms use special devices to track human motions, such as cameras (vision-based) and various types of sensors (sensor-based). These mechanisms are applied in different applications, such as home security, Human&ndash;Computer Interaction (HCI), gaming, and healthcare. However, traditional HAR methods require heavy installation, and can only work under strict conditions. Recently, wireless signals have been utilized to track human motion and HAR in indoor environments. The motion of an object in the test environment causes fluctuations and changes in the Wi-Fi signal reflections at the receiver, which result in variations in received signals. These fluctuations can be used to track object (i.e., a human) motion in indoor environments. This phenomenon can be improved and leveraged in the future to improve the internet of things (IoT) and smart home devices. The main Wi-Fi sensing methods can be broadly categorized as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Wi-Fi radar (by using Software Defined Radio (SDR)) and Channel State Information (CSI). CSI and RSSI can be considered as device-free mechanisms because they do not require cumbersome installation, whereas the Wi-Fi radar mechanism requires special devices (i.e., Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)). Recent studies demonstrate that CSI outperforms RSSI in sensing accuracy due to its stability and rich information. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in the CSI-based sensing mechanism and illustrates the drawbacks, discusses challenges, and presents some suggestions for the future of device-free sensing technology.

TI  - Exploiting Scalable Machine-Learning Distributed Frameworks to Forecast Power Consumption of Buildings
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 15
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The pervasive and increasing deployment of smart meters allows collecting a huge amount of fine-grained energy data in different urban scenarios. The analysis of such data is challenging and opening up a variety of interesting and new research issues across energy and computer science research areas. The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches. This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption. SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets. As a case study, SPEC has been tested on real data of an heating distribution network and power consumption data collected in a major Italian city. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SPEC to forecast both fine-grained values and coarse levels of power consumption of buildings.

TI  - Computation of Psycho-Acoustic Annoyance Using Deep Neural Networks
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 15
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Psycho-acoustic parameters have been extensively used to evaluate the discomfort or pleasure produced by the sounds in our environment. In this context, wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) can be an interesting solution for monitoring subjective annoyance in certain soundscapes, since they can be used to register the evolution of such parameters in time and space. Unfortunately, the calculation of the psycho-acoustic parameters involved in common annoyance models implies a significant computational cost, and makes difficult the acquisition and transmission of these parameters at the nodes. As a result, monitoring psycho-acoustic annoyance becomes an expensive and inefficient task. This paper proposes the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large urban sound dataset capable of efficiently predicting psycho-acoustic annoyance from raw audio signals continuously. We evaluate the proposed regression model and compare the resulting computation times with the ones obtained by the conventional direct calculation approach. The results confirm that the proposed model based on CNN achieves high precision in predicting psycho-acoustic annoyance, predicting annoyance values with an average quadratic error of around 3%. It also achieves a very significant reduction in processing time, which is up to 300 times faster than direct calculation, making CNN designed a clear exponent to work in IoT devices.

AB  - An exemplary paradigm of how an AI can be a disruptive technological paragon via the utilization of blockchain comes straight from the world of deep learning. Data scientists have long struggled to maintain the quality of a dataset for machine learning by an AI entity. Datasets can be very expensive to purchase, as, depending on both the proper selection of the elements and the homogeneity of the data contained within, constructing and maintaining the integrity of a dataset is difficult. Blockchain as a highly secure storage medium presents a technological quantum leap in maintaining data integrity. Furthermore, blockchain&rsquo;s immutability constructs a fruitful environment for creating high quality, permanent and growing datasets for deep learning. The combination of AI and blockchain could impact fields like Internet of things (IoT), identity, financial markets, civil governance, smart cities, small communities, supply chains, personalized medicine and other fields, and thereby deliver benefits to many people.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Subject counting systems are extensively used in ambient intelligence applications, such as smart home, smart building and smart retail scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the problem of transforming an unmodified WiFi radio infrastructure into a flexible sensing system for passive subject counting. We first introduce the multi-dimensional channel features that capture the subject presence. Then, we compare Bayesian and neural network based machine learning tools specialized for subject discrimination and counting. Ensemble classification is used to leverage space-frequency diversity and combine learning tools trained with different channel features. A combination of multiple models is shown to improve the counting accuracy. System design is based on a dense network of WiFi devices equipped with multiple antennas. Experimental validation is conducted in an indoor space featuring up to five moving people. Real-time computing and practical solutions for cloud migration are also considered. The proposed approach for passive counting gives detection results with 99% average accuracy.

TI  - An Intelligent Advisory System to Support Managerial Decisions for A Social Safety Net

IS  - 3
SN  - 2076-3387

AB  - Social investment programs are designed to provide opportunities to the less privileged so that they can contribute to the socioeconomic development of society. Stakeholders in social safety net programs (SSNPs) target vulnerable groups, such as the urban poor, women, the unemployed, and the elderly, with initiatives that have a transformative impact. Inadequate policy awareness remains a challenge, resulting in low participation rates in SSNPs. To achieve all-inclusive development, deliberate policies and programs that target this population have to be initiated by government, corporate bodies, and public-minded individuals. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques could play an important role in improving the managerial decision support and policy-making process of SSNPs and increasing the social resilience of urban populations. To enhance managerial decision-making in social investment programs, we used a Bayesian network to develop an intelligent decision support system called the Social Safety Net Expert System (SSNES). Using the SSNES, we provide an advisory system to stakeholders who make management decisions, which clearly demonstrates the efficacy of SSNPs and inclusive development.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 16
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - To build sustainable smart energy cities (SECs) around the world, many countries are now combining customized services and businesses within their energy infrastructure and urban environments. Such changes could then promote the development of platforms that ultimately provide benefits for citizens such as convenience, safety, and cost savings. Currently, the development of technologies for SECs focuses on independent products and unit technology. However, this is problematic, as it may not be possible to develop sustainable cities if there is a lack of connectivity between various elements within the SEC. To solve such problems, this paper presents an AI-based physical and virtual platform using a 5-layer architecture to develop a sustainable smart energy city (SSEC). The architecture employs both a top-down and bottom-up approach and the links between each energy element in the SSEC can readily be analyzed. The economic analysis based on return on investment (ROI) is carried out by comparing the economic benefits before and after the application of this system. Deploying the proposed platform will enable the speedy development and application of new services for SSECs and will provide SSECs with measures to ensure sustainable development, such as rapid urban development, and cost reductions.

VL  - 19
IS  - 16
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In this paper, an energy-efficient localization algorithm is proposed for precise localization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the process is accomplished in three steps. Firstly, the beacon nodes discover their one-hop neighbor nodes with additional tone requests and reply packets over the media access control (MAC) layer to avoid collision of packets. Secondly, the discovered one-hop unknown nodes are divided into two sets, i.e. unknown nodes with direct communication, and with indirect communication for energy efficiency. In direct communication, source beacon nodes forward the information directly to the unknown nodes, but a common beacon node is selected for communication which reduces overall energy consumption during transmission in indirect communication. Finally, a correction factor is also introduced, and localized unknown nodes are upgraded into helper nodes for reducing the localization error. To analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, various simulations are conducted and compared with the existing algorithms.

TI  - Short-Term Prediction of Bus Passenger Flow Based on a Hybrid Optimized LSTM Network

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The accurate prediction of bus passenger flow is the key to public transport management and the smart city. A long short-term memory network, a deep learning method for modeling sequences, is an efficient way to capture the time dependency of passenger flow. In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have sought to apply the LSTM model to passenger flow prediction. However, few of them pay attention to the optimization procedure during model training. In this article, we propose a hybrid, optimized LSTM network based on Nesterov accelerated adaptive moment estimation (Nadam) and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD). This method trains the model with high efficiency and accuracy, solving the problems of inefficient training and misconvergence that exist in complex models. We employ a hybrid optimized LSTM network to predict the actual passenger flow in Qingdao, China and compare the prediction results with those obtained by non-hybrid LSTM models and conventional methods. In particular, the proposed model brings about a 4%–20% extra performance improvements compared with those of non-hybrid LSTM models. We have also tried combinations of other optimization algorithms and applications in different models, finding that optimizing LSTM by switching Nadam to SGD is the best choice. The sensitivity of the model to its parameters is also explored, which provides guidance for applying this model to bus passenger flow data modelling. The good performance of the proposed model in different temporal and spatial scales shows that it is more robust and effective, which can provide insightful support and guidance for dynamic bus scheduling and regional coordination scheduling.

AB  - This paper describes an experimental test campaign while using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and measuring the obtained UAV positions during different flight tasks and in different operative conditions. A new test procedure has been presented and tested for different devices in various weather conditions. This paper describes and analyses the measurements of the flight trajectory of the UAV that was performed with the use of a robotic total station (RTS), as compared to the design data and the data recorded in the internal memory of the UAV. Five different test tasks have been conducted. The obtained results have allowed for the assessment of the correctness of task performance as compared to the design and to determine the flying accuracy of the entire UAV set. The proposed set of tasks can be successfully utilised to control the correctness of operation of various types of UAVs and it may be implemented as a universal test to verify the algorithms optimising take-offs and landings, test flights of the objects, as well as flight planning in various terrain and weather conditions, which will increase the safety of the flights while using UAVs.

This application was assessed by means of a case study in the City of Madrid. We employed different sensors and combined outdoor and indoor data with spatiotemporal activity patterns to estimate the Personal Air Pollution Exposure (PAPE) of an individual. This pilot case study presents evidence that PAPE can be estimated by employing indoor air quality monitors and e-beacon technology that have not previously been used in similar studies and have the advantages of being low-cost and unobtrusive to the individual. In future work, our IoT application can be extended to include prediction models, enabling dynamic feedback about PAPE risks. Furthermore, PAPE data from this type of application could be useful for air quality policy development as well as in epidemiological studies that explore the effects of air pollution on certain diseases.

TI  - Methods and Application of Archeological Cloud Platform for Grand Sites Based on Spatio-Temporal Big Data

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 9
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Grand sites are important witnesses of human civilization. The archeology of grand sites has the characteristics of a long period, interdisciplinary study, irreversibility and uncertainties. Because of the lack of effective methods and valid tools, large amounts of archeological data cannot be properly processed in time, which creates many difficulties for the conservation and use of grand sites. This study provides a method of integrating spatio-temporal big data of grand sites, including classification and coding, spatial scales and a spatio-temporal framework, through which the integration of archeological data of multiple sites or different archeological excavations is realized. A system architecture was further proposed for an archeological information cloud platform for grand sites. By providing services such as data, visualization, standardizations, spatial analysis, and application software, the archeological information cloud platform of grand sites can display sites, ruins, and relics in 2D and 3D according to their correlation. It can also display the transformation of space and time around archeological cultures, and restored ruins in a 3D virtual environment. The platform provides increased support to interdisciplinary study and the dissemination of research results. Taking the Origin of Chinese Civilization Project as a case study, it shows that the method for data aggregation and fusion proposed in this study can efficiently integrate multi-source heterogeneous archeological spatio-temporal data of different sites or different periods. The archeological information cloud platform has great significance to the study of the origin of Chinese civilization, dissemination of Chinese civilization, and the public participation in archeology, which would promote the sustainable development of the conservation and use of grand sites.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 18
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Urban development in recent decades has had a significant impact on climate change. Cities have implemented traffic monitoring systems to sustain the new building code in meeting the target for environmental indicators. Timisoara is the second city in Romania and manages over 60% of the development and pollution of Timis County. The analysis of large volumes of data provided by local sensors and databases requires big data analytics. In this research, for the first time, we simultaneously developed two parallel scenario-based decision-making support models to assess a CO2 sequestration index. The model is based on a tree inventory for traffic area and car flow using Roegenian processes with borders. The first scenario (dt1) analyzes the real O2-pollution car flows for process streets as receivers of pollution. The second scenario (dt2) analyzes O2-pollution flows for the same streets from the perspective of streets that garage the cars. We modeled the parallel integration of actual O2 production and pollution flows for 160 main streets that account for over 50% of the urban mileage of Timisoara city. The carbon sequestration indexes of the streets are in the range of 0.0000043&ndash;0.437 (dt1) and 0.0000092&ndash;11.78 (dt2). The results can be used to support local decision making regarding the environment CO2-O2 balances by optimizing the local fiscal policies. The research could be extended to secondary streets and separately for the pollution of heating-cooling devices for residential building areas.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 18
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The need to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, as well as the use of local renewable heat sources has caused heat meters to be used not only to calculate the consumed energy, but also for the active management of central heating systems. Increasing the reading frequency and the use of measurement data to control the heating system expands the requirements for the reliability of heat meters. The aim of the research is to analyze a large set of meters in the real network and predict their faults to avoid inaccurate readings, incorrect billing, heating system disruption, and unnecessary maintenance. The reliability analysis of heat meters, based on historical data collected over several years, shows some regularities, which cannot be easily described by physics-based models. The failure rate is almost constant and does depend on the past, but is a non-linear combination of state variables. To predict meters&rsquo; failures in the next billing period, three independent machine learning models are implemented and compared with selected metrics, because even the high performance of a single model (87% true positive for neural network) may be insufficient to make a maintenance decision. Additionally, performing hyperparameter optimization boosts the models&rsquo; performance by a few percent. Finally, three improved models are used to build an ensemble classifier, which outperforms the individual models. The proposed procedure ensures the high efficiency of fault detection (&gt;95%), while maintaining overfitting at the minimum level. The methodology is universal and can be utilized to study the reliability and predict faults of other types of meters and different objects with the constant failure rate.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Increasingly serious traffic jams and traffic accidents pose threats to the social economy and human life. The lamp semantics of driving is a major way to transmit the driving behavior information between vehicles. The detection and recognition of the vehicle taillights can acquire and understand the taillight semantics, which is of great significance for realizing multi-vehicle behavior interaction and assists driving. It is a challenge to detect taillights and identify the taillight semantics on real traffic road during the day. The main research content of this paper is mainly to establish a neural network to detect vehicles and to complete recognition of the taillights of the preceding vehicle based on image processing. First, the outlines of the preceding vehicles are detected and extracted by using convolutional neural networks. Then, the taillight area in the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space are extracted and the taillight pairs are detected by correlations of histograms, color and positions. Then the taillight states are identified based on the histogram feature parameters of the taillight image. The detected taillight state of the preceding vehicle is prompted to the driver to reduce traffic accidents caused by the untimely judgement of the driving intention of the preceding vehicle. The experimental results show that this method can accurately identify taillight status during the daytime and can effectively reduce the occurrence of confused judgement caused by light interference.

Thus, it minimizes the unexpected device downtime, lowers the maintenance costs, extends equipment lifecycle, etc. Therefore, this article developed a predictive maintenance mechanism with the construction of a test platform and data analysis along with machine learning. The information transmission of sensors was based on Raspberry Pi via the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) communication protocol. The sensors used for environmental sensing were implemented on the programmable interface controller and the data were stored in time sequence. A statistical analysis software platform was adopted for data preprocessing, modelling, and prediction to provide necessary maintenance decision. Using multivariate analysis users can obtain more information about the equipment&rsquo;s status, and the administrator can also determine the operational situation before unexpected device anomalies. The developed modules are decisively helpful in preventing unpredictable losses, thus improving the quality of services.

AB  - In photovoltaic and wind power storage systems, the reliability of the battery directly affects the overall reliability of the energy storage system. Failed batteries can seriously affect the stable operation of energy storage systems. This paper aims to improve the reliability of the storage systems by accurately predicting battery life and identifying failing batteries in time. The current prediction models mainly use artificial neural networks, Gaussian process regression and hybrid models. Although these models can achieve high prediction accuracy, the computational cost is high due to model complexity. Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is a computationally efficient alternative. Hence, this study combines the improved chicken swarm optimization algorithm (ICSO) and LSSVM into a hybrid ICSO-LSSVM model for the reliability of photovoltaic and wind power storage systems. The following are the contributions of this work. First, the optimal penalty parameter and kernel width are determined. Second, the chicken swarm optimization algorithm (CSO) is improved by introducing chaotic search behavior in the hen and an adaptive learning factor in the chicks. The performance of the ICSO algorithm is shown to be better than CSO using standard test problems. Third, the prediction accuracy of the three models is compared. For NMC1 battery, the predicted relative error of ICSO-LSSVM is 0.94%; for NMC2 battery, the relative error of ICSO-LSSVM is 1%. These findings show that the proposed model is suitable for predicting the failure of batteries in energy storage systems, which can improve preventive and predictive maintenance of such systems.

AB  - Along with the advancement of light-weight sensing and processing technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become popular platforms for intelligent traffic monitoring and control. UAV-mounted cameras can capture traffic-flow videos from various perspectives providing a comprehensive insight into road conditions. To analyze the traffic flow from remotely captured videos, a reliable and accurate vehicle detection-and-tracking approach is required. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning framework for vehicle detection and tracking from UAV videos for monitoring traffic flow in complex road structures. This approach is designed to be invariant to significant orientation and scale variations in the videos. The detection procedure is performed by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art object detector, You Only Look Once (YOLOv3), using several custom-labeled traffic datasets. Vehicle tracking is conducted following a tracking-by-detection paradigm, where deep appearance features are used for vehicle re-identification, and Kalman filtering is used for motion estimation. The proposed methodology is tested on a variety of real videos collected by UAVs under various conditions, e.g., in late afternoons with long vehicle shadows, in dawn with vehicles lights being on, over roundabouts and interchange roads where vehicle directions change considerably, and from various viewpoints where vehicles&rsquo; appearance undergo substantial perspective distortions. The proposed tracking-by-detection approach performs efficiently at 11 frames per second on color videos of 2720p resolution. Experiments demonstrated that high detection accuracy could be achieved with an average F1-score of 92.1%. Besides, the tracking technique performs accurately, with an average multiple-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) of 81.3%. The proposed approach also addressed the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art in multi-object tracking regarding frequent identity switching, resulting in a total of only one identity switch over every 305 tracked vehicles.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In emergency scenarios service vehicles must identify potential route(s) and use the best available route. However, route identification requires intelligent decision-support systems which generally use non-traditional approaches with tools characterised by flexible non-hierarchical structures. Conventional models using group decision-support systems have been applied; however, when used in smart urban environments, emergency response services have limitations in their ability to identify unobstructed paths (routes) in dynamic operating environments. In this paper we introduce a novel path planning method for autonomous vehicle control in emergency situations. The proposed model uses self-organizing maps in an integrated Spiral STC algorithm termed the: Hybrid SOM-Spiral STC model which uses hedge algebras and Kansei evaluation in group decision-support. The proposed model has been designed to quantify qualitative factors using sensor derived data processed with human sensibilities and preferences in emergency decision support. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves significant improvements in group decision-support under dynamic uncertainty. We posit that our novel approach holds the prospect of improvements in the provision of emergency services.

AB  - This paper studies the indoor localization based on Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI). In addition to position estimation, this study examines the expansion of applications using Wi-Fi RSSI data sets in three areas: (i) feature extraction, (ii) mobile fingerprinting, and (iii) mapless localization. First, the features of Wi-Fi RSSI observations are extracted with respect to different floor levels and designated landmarks. Second, the mobile fingerprinting method is proposed to allow a trainer to collect training data efficiently, which is faster and more efficient than the conventional static fingerprinting method. Third, in the case of the unknown-map situation, the trajectory learning method is suggested to learn map information using crowdsourced data. All of these parts are interconnected from the feature extraction and mobile fingerprinting to the map learning and the estimation. Based on the experimental results, we observed (i) clearly classified data points by the feature extraction method as regards the floors and landmarks, (ii) efficient mobile fingerprinting compared to conventional static fingerprinting, and (iii) improvement of the positioning accuracy owing to the trajectory learning.

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Smart sensor nodes can process data collected from sensors, make decisions, and recognize relevant events based on the sensed information before sharing it with other nodes. In wireless sensor networks, the smart sensor nodes are usually grouped in clusters for effective cooperation. One sensor node in each cluster must act as a cluster head. The cluster head depletes its energy resources faster than the other nodes. Thus, the cluster-head role must be periodically reassigned (rotated) to different sensor nodes to achieve a long lifetime of wireless sensor network. This paper introduces a method for extending the lifetime of the wireless sensor networks with smart nodes. The proposed method combines a new algorithm for rotating the cluster-head role among sensor nodes with suppression of unnecessary data transmissions. It enables effective control of the cluster-head rotation based on expected energy consumption of sensor nodes. The energy consumption is estimated using a lightweight model, which takes into account transmission probabilities. This method was implemented in a prototype of wireless sensor network. During experimental evaluation of the new method, detailed measurements of lifetime and energy consumption were conducted for a real wireless sensor network. Results of these realistic experiments have revealed that the lifetime of the sensor network is extended when using the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art cluster-head rotation algorithms.

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Affect recognition is an interdisciplinary research field bringing together researchers from natural and social sciences. Affect recognition research aims to detect the affective state of a person based on observables, with the goal to, for example, provide reasoning for the person&rsquo;s decision making or to support mental wellbeing (e.g., stress monitoring). Recently, beside of approaches based on audio, visual or text information, solutions relying on wearable sensors as observables, recording mainly physiological and inertial parameters, have received increasing attention. Wearable systems enable an ideal platform for long-term affect recognition applications due to their rich functionality and form factor, while providing valuable insights during everyday life through integrated sensors. However, existing literature surveys lack a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art research in wearable-based affect recognition. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a broad overview and in-depth understanding of the theoretical background, methods and best practices of wearable affect and stress recognition. Following a summary of different psychological models, we detail the influence of affective states on the human physiology and the sensors commonly employed to measure physiological changes. Then, we outline lab protocols eliciting affective states and provide guidelines for ground truth generation in field studies. We also describe the standard data processing chain and review common approaches related to the preprocessing, feature extraction and classification steps. By providing a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art and guidelines to various aspects, we would like to enable other researchers in the field to conduct and evaluate user studies and develop wearable systems.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by high voltage power systems can cause a serious problem for nearby electrically conductive structures, such as railroads, communication lines, or pipelines, that would place a system&rsquo;s integrity and the operational safety of the structure at high level of risk. According to the IEEE standard-80, by implementing a well-designed mitigation system, the induced voltage on neighboring electrically conductive structure can reach a harmless level. The mitigation system can enhance the overall integrity of pipelines and provide higher operation safety for personal during working on the exposed parts of metallic pipelines or conductive appurtenances. An accurate prediction about the level of induced voltage is absolutely necessary to design a suitable mitigation system for metallic pipelines. Thus, in this work a hybrid prediction methodology composed of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and a backtracking search algorithm (BSA) is developed to accurately predict the electromagnetic inference&rsquo;s effects on metallic pipelines with shared right-of-way (RoW) and high voltage overhead lines (OHLs). Through the combination of BSA as a robust and efficient optimization algorithm in the learning process of an ANFIS approach, a hybrid data mining algorithm has been developed to predict the induced voltage on mitigated and unmitigated pipelines more accurately and reliably. The simulation results are validated by data sets observed from the Current Distribution, Electromagnetic Interference, Grounding and Soil Structure Analysis (CDEGS) software. From the simulation results it was confirmed that the proposed hybrid method is effective in accurately predicting the induced voltage on pipelines with changing system parameters. Furthermore, to evaluate the precision and applicability of the developed approach in this paper, its estimates are compared with the results obtained from an artificial neural network (ANN), a support vector regression (SVR) and an ANFIS optimized by other well-known optimization algorithms. The obtained results indicate higher accuracy of the developed hybrid method over other artificial intelligence based approaches.

AB  - The study collected particulate matter (PM)-related documents in Korea and classified main keywords related to particulate matter, health, and social problems using text and opinion mining. The study attempted to present a prediction model for important causes related to particulate matter by using social big-data analysis. Topics related to particulate matter were collected from online (online news sites, blogs, caf&eacute;s, social network services, and bulletin boards) from 1 January 2015, to 31 May 2016, and 226,977 text documents were included in the analysis. The present study applied machine-learning analysis technique to forecast the risk of particulate matter. Emotions related to particulate matter were found to be 65.4% negative, 7.7% neutral, and 27.0% positive. Intelligent services that can detect early and prevent unknown crisis situations of particulate matter may be possible if risk factors of particulate matter are predicted through the linkage of the machine-learning prediction model.

AB  - Concerns exists regarding natural disasters, but what about the resulting power outages? This study investigates the characteristics of a digital visual narrative depicting the loss of electrical power after a natural disaster to identify how such situations are represented in images found on the internet. A qualitative approach with an exploratory scope was taken using digital methods. Six events in different places were selected, and 4691 images were analyzed using the Google Cloud Vision API. A constant comparison method was used to identify categories from these images. Then, a manual analysis was performed on a sample of the images of each event, and then categorized. It was found that more than half of the images refer to categories such as infrastructure, nature, and hazards, while the energy category was represented in 13.02% of the images. Most images were photographs; however, the non-photographic images found contained useful information regarding energy. Even when all events featuring power outages, few focused on the lack of energy and more on impacts to the infrastructure, despite energy being required for cities&rsquo; recovery.

AB  - Pervasive healthcare services have undergone a great evolution in recent years. The technological development of communication networks, including the Internet, sensor networks, and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) have given rise to new architectures, applications, and standards related to addressing almost all current e-health challenges. Among the standards, the importance of OpenEHR has been recognized, since it enables the separation of medical semantics from data representation of electronic health records. However, it does not meet the requirements related to interoperability of e-health devices in M2M networks, or in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Moreover, the lack of interoperability hampers the application of new data-processing techniques, such as data mining and online analytical processing, due to the heterogeneity of the data and the sources. This article proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform for pervasive healthcare that ensures interoperability, quality of the detection process, and scalability in an M2M-based architecture, and provides functionalities for the processing of high volumes of data, knowledge extraction, and common healthcare services. The platform uses the semantics described in OpenEHR for both data quality evaluation and standardization of healthcare data stored by the association of IoMT devices and observations defined in OpenEHR. Moreover, it enables the application of big data techniques and online analytic processing (OLAP) through Hadoop Map/Reduce and content-sharing through fast healthcare interoperability resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs).

AB  - The purpose of this descriptive research paper is to initiate discussions on the use of innovative technologies and their potential to support the research and development of pan-Canadian monitoring and surveillance activities associated with environmental impacts on health and within the health system. Its primary aim is to provide a review of disruptive technologies and their current uses in the environment and in healthcare. Drawing on extensive experience in population-level surveillance through the use of technology, knowledge from prior projects in the field, and conducting a review of the technologies, this paper is meant to serve as the initial steps toward a better understanding of the research area. In doing so, we hope to be able to better assess which technologies might best be leveraged to advance this unique intersection of health and environment. This paper first outlines the current use of technologies at the intersection of public health and the environment, in particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The paper provides a description for each of these technologies, along with a summary of their current applications, and a description of the challenges one might face with adopting them. Thereafter, a high-level reference architecture, that addresses the challenges of the described technologies and could potentially be incorporated into the pan-Canadian surveillance system, is conceived and presented.

SN  - 2227-9717

AB  - The importance of neural network (NN) modelling is evident from its performance benefits in a myriad of applications, where, unlike conventional techniques, NN modeling provides superior performance without relying on complex filtering and/or time-consuming parameter tuning specific to applications and their wider ranges of conditions. In this paper, we employ NN modelling with training data generation based on sensitivity analysis for the prediction of building energy consumption to improve performance and reliability. Unlike our previous work, where insignificant input variables are successively screened out based on their mean impact values (MIVs) during the training process, we use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot to generate reliable data with a conservative or progressive point of view, which overcomes the issue of data insufficiency of the MIV method: By properly setting boundaries for input variables based on the ROC plot and their statistics, instead of completely screening them out as in the MIV-based method, we can generate new training data that maximize true positive and false negative numbers from the partial data set. Then a NN model is constructed and trained with the generated training data using Levenberg&ndash;Marquardt back propagation (LM-BP) to perform electricity prediction for commercial buildings. The performance of the proposed data generation methods is compared with that of the MIV method through experiments, whose results show that data generation using successive and cross pattern provides satisfactory performance, following energy consumption trends with good phase. Among the two options in data generation, i.e., successive and two data combination, the successive option shows lower root mean square error (RMSE) than the combination one by around 400~900 kWh (i.e., 30%~75%).

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Vehicle Logo Recognition (VLR) is an important part of vehicle behavior analysis and can provide supplementary information for vehicle identification, which is an essential research topic in robotic systems. However, the inaccurate extraction of vehicle logo candidate regions will affect the accuracy of logo recognition. Additionally, the existing methods have low recognition rate for most small vehicle logos and poor performance under complicated environments. A VLR method based on enhanced matching, constrained region extraction and SSFPD network is proposed in this paper to solve the aforementioned problems. A constrained region extraction method based on segmentation of the car head and car tail is proposed to accurately extract the candidate region of logo. An enhanced matching method is proposed to improve the detection performance of small objects, which augment each of training images by copy-pasting small objects many times in the unconstrained region. A single deep neural network based on a reduced ResNeXt model and Feature Pyramid Networks is proposed in this paper, which is named as Single Shot Feature Pyramid Detector (SSFPD). The SSFPD uses the reduced ResNeXt to improve classification performance of the network and retain more detailed information for small-sized vehicle logo detection. Additionally, it uses the Feature Pyramid Networks module to bring in more semantic context information to build several high-level semantic feature maps, which effectively improves recognition performance. Extensive evaluations have been made on self-collected and public vehicle logo datasets. The proposed method achieved 93.79% accuracy on the Common Vehicle Logos Dataset and 99.52% accuracy on another public dataset, respectively, outperforming the existing methods.

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are increasingly embraced around the world to advance smart mobility and more broadly, smart, and sustainable cities. Algorithms form the basis of decision-making in AVs, allowing them to perform driving tasks autonomously, efficiently, and more safely than human drivers and offering various economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, algorithmic decision-making in AVs can also introduce new issues that create new safety risks and perpetuate discrimination. We identify bias, ethics, and perverse incentives as key ethical issues in the AV algorithms&rsquo; decision-making that can create new safety risks and discriminatory outcomes. Technical issues in the AVs&rsquo; perception, decision-making and control algorithms, limitations of existing AV testing and verification methods, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can also undermine the performance of the AV system. This article investigates the ethical and technical concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making in AVs by exploring how driving decisions can perpetuate discrimination and create new safety risks for the public. We discuss steps taken to address these issues, highlight the existing research gaps and the need to mitigate these issues through the design of AV&rsquo;s algorithms and of policies and regulations to fully realise AVs&rsquo; benefits for smart and sustainable cities.

AB  - The need for more sustainable cities has become a primary objective of urban strategies. The urgency for a radical transition towards sustainability in a long term-vision has brought with it several new concepts, such as smart urbanism, and models, such as smart city, eco-city, sustainable neighborhood, eco-district, etc. While these terms are fascinating and visionary, they often lack a clear definition both in terms of theoretical insight and empirical evidence. In this light, this contribution aims at defining a conceptual framework through which to further substantiate the blurred concept of eco-district and sustainable neighborhood. It does so by reviewing the concepts of smart urbanism and sustainable neighborhood/eco-districts in the literature, including also references to other well-known sustainability-oriented models of urban development. It then explores whether several indicators, emerging from the analysis of exemplary case studies of sustainable neighborhoods in Europe, can be used to clearly identify the characteristics of a sustainable approach at the district scale. The analysis, built on a review of existing literature, allows for both the clarification of several issues related to these fields of inquiry, as well as for the identification of the potential bridges to link these issues.

AB  - The strong demand for sustainable energy supplies had escalated the discovery, and intensive research into cleaner energy sources, as well as efficient energy management practices. In the context of the circular economy, the efforts target not only the optimisation of resource utilisation at various stages, but the products&rsquo; eco-design is also emphasized to extend their life spans. Based on the concept of comprehensive circular integration, this review discusses the roles of Process Integration approaches, renewable energy sources utilisation and design modifications in addressing the process of energy and exergy efficiency improvement. The primary focus is to enhance the economic and environmental performance through process analysis, modelling and optimisation. The paper is categorised into sections to show the contribution of each aspect clearly, namely: (a) Design and numerical study for innovative energy-efficient technologies; (b) Process Integration&mdash;heat and power; (c) Process energy efficiency or emissions analysis; (d) Optimisation of renewable energy resources supply chain. Each section is assessed based on the latest contribution of this journal&rsquo;s Special Issue from the 21st conference on Process Integration, Modelling and Optimisation for Energy Saving and Pollution Reduction (PRES 2018). The key results are highlighted and summarised within the broader context of the state of the art development.

AB  - Fly-rock induced by blasting is an undesirable phenomenon in quarries. It can be dangerous for humans, equipment, and buildings. To minimize its undesirable hazards, we proposed a state-of-the-art technology of fly-rock prediction based on artificial neural network (ANN) models and their robust combination, called EANNs model (ensemble of ANN models); 210 fly-rock events were recorded to develop and test the ANN and EANNs models. Of thi sample, 80% of the whole dataset was assigned to develop the models, the remaining 20% was assigned to confirm the models developed. Accordingly, five ANN models were designed and developed using the training dataset (i.e., 80% of the whole original data) first; then, their predictions on the training dataset were ensembled to generate a new training dataset. Subsequently, another ANN model was developed based on the new set of training data (i.e., EANNs model). Its performance was evaluated through a variety of performance indices, such as MAE (mean absolute error), MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), RMSE (root-mean-square error), R2 (correlation coefficient), and VAF (variance accounted for). A promising result was found for the proposed EANNs model in predicting blast-induced fly-rock with a MAE = 2.777, MAPE = 0.017, RMSE = 4.346, R2 = 0.986, and VAF = 98.446%. To confirm the performance of the proposed EANNs model, another ANN model with the same structure was developed and tested on the training and testing datasets. The findings also indicated that the proposed EANNs model yielded better performance than those of the ANN model with the same structure.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Underground spaces have become increasingly important in recent decades in metropolises. In this regard, the demand for the use of underground spaces and, consequently, the excavation of these spaces has increased significantly. Excavation of an underground space is accompanied by risks and many uncertainties. Tunnel convergence, as the tendency for reduction of the excavated area due to change in the initial stresses, is frequently observed, in order to monitor the safety of construction and to evaluate the design and performance of the tunnel. This paper presents a model/equation obtained by a gene expression programming (GEP) algorithm, aiming to predict convergence of tunnels excavated in accordance to the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM). To obtain this goal, a database was prepared based on experimental datasets, consisting of six input and one output parameter. Namely, tunnel depth, cohesion, frictional angle, unit weight, Poisson&rsquo;s ratio, and elasticity modulus were considered as model inputs, while the cumulative convergence was utilized as the model&rsquo;s output. Configurations of the GEP model were determined through the trial-error technique and finally an optimum model is developed and presented. In addition, an equation has been extracted from the proposed GEP model. The comparison of the GEP-derived results with the experimental findings, which are in very good agreement, demonstrates the ability of GEP modeling to estimate the tunnel convergence in a reliable, robust, and practical manner.

TI  - A Novel Data Reduction Approach for Structural Health Monitoring Systems

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 22
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The massive amount of data generated by structural health monitoring (SHM) systems usually affects the system&rsquo;s capacity for data transmission and analysis. This paper proposes a novel concept based on the probability theory for data reduction in SHM systems. The beauty salient feature of the proposed method is that it alleviates the burden of collecting and analysis of the entire strain data via a relative damage approach. In this methodology, the rate of variation of strain distributions is related to the rate of damage. In order to verify the accuracy of the approach, experimental and numerical studies were conducted on a thin steel plate subjected to cyclic in-plane tension loading. Circular holes with various sizes were made on the plate to define damage states. Rather than measuring the entire strain response, the cumulative durations of strain events at different predefined strain levels were obtained for each damage scenario. Then, the distribution of the calculated cumulative times was used to detect the damage progression. The results show that the presented technique can efficiently detect the damage progression. The damage detection accuracy can be improved by increasing the predefined strain levels. The proposed concept can lead to over 2500% reduction in data storage requirement, which can be particularly important for data generation and data handling in on-line SHM systems.

TI  - A Novel Artificial Intelligence Technique to Estimate the Gross Calorific Value of Coal Based on Meta-Heuristic and Support Vector Regression Algorithms
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Gross calorific value (GCV) is one of the essential parameters for evaluating coal quality. Therefore, accurate GCV prediction is one of the primary ways to improve heating value as well as coal production. A novel evolutionary-based predictive system was proposed in this study for predicting GCV with high accuracy, namely the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-support vector regression (SVR) model. It was developed based on the SVR and PSO algorithms. Three different kernel functions were employed to establish the PSO-SVR models, including radial basis function, linear, and polynomial functions. Besides, three benchmark machine learning models including classification and regression trees (CART), multiple linear regression (MLR), and principle component analysis (PCA) were also developed to estimate GCV and then compared with the proposed PSO-SVR model; 2583 coal samples were used to analyze the proximate components and GCV for this study. Then, they were used to develop the mentioned models as well as check their performance in experimental results. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R2), ranking, and intensity color criteria were used and computed to evaluate the GCV predictive models developed. The results revealed that the proposed PSO-SVR model with radial basis function had better accuracy than the other models. The PSO algorithm was optimized in the SVR model with high efficiency. These should be used as a supporting tool in practical engineering to determine the heating value of coal seams in complex geological conditions.

AB  - Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors that increase the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes mellitus. It is crucial to get diagnosed with time to take preventive measures, especially for patients in locations without proper access to laboratories and medical consultations. This work presented a new methodology to diagnose diseases using data mining that documents all the phases thoroughly for further improvement of the resulting models. We used the methodology to create a new model to diagnose the syndrome without using biochemical variables. We compared similar classification models, using their reported variables and previously obtained data from a study in Colombia. We built a new model and compared it to previous models using the holdout, and random subsampling validation methods to get performance evaluation indicators between the models. Our resulting ANN model used three hidden layers and only Hip Circumference, dichotomous Waist Circumference, and dichotomous blood pressure variables. It gave an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 87.75% by the IDF and 85.12% by HMS MetS diagnosis criteria, higher than previous models. Thanks to our new methodology, diagnosis models can be thoroughly documented for appropriate future comparisons, thus benefiting the diagnosis of the studied diseases.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - High-quality updates of road information play an important role in smart city planning, sustainable urban expansion, vehicle management, urban planning, traffic navigation, public health and other fields. However, due to interference from road geometry and texture noise, it is difficult to avoid the decline of automation while accurately extracting roads. Therefore, we propose a high-resolution optical satellite image lane-level road extraction method. First, from the perspective of template matching and considering road characteristics and relevant semantic relations, an adaptive correction model, an MLSOH (multi-scale line segment orientation histogram) descriptor, a sector descriptor, and a multiangle beamlet descriptor are proposed to solve the interference from geometry and texture noise in road template matching and tracking. Second, based on refined lane-level tracking, single-lane and double-lane road-tracking modes are designed to extract single-lane and double-lane roads, respectively. In this paper, Pleiades satellite and GF-2 images are selected to set up different scenarios for urban and rural areas. Experiments are carried out on the phenomena that restrict road extraction, such as tree occlusion, building shadow occlusion, road bending, and road boundary blurring. Compared with other methods, the proposed method not only ensures the accuracy of lane-level road extraction but also greatly improves the automation of road extraction.

The alarming number of flood-related deaths and financial losses suffered annually across the world call for improved response to flood risks. Interestingly, the last decade has presented great opportunities with a series of scholarly activities exploring how camera images and wireless sensor data from Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks can improve flood management. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature regarding IoT-based sensors and computer vision applications in flood monitoring and mapping. The paper contributes by highlighting the main computer vision techniques and IoT sensor approaches utilised in the literature for real-time flood monitoring, flood modelling, mapping and early warning systems including the estimation of water level. The paper further contributes by providing recommendations for future research. In particular, the study recommends ways in which computer vision and IoT sensor techniques can be harnessed to better monitor and manage coastal lagoons&mdash;an aspect that is under-explored in the literature.

AB  - Nowadays, the problem of parking guidance information (PGI) is one of the great challenges of smart cities. Sensor networks have been traditionally used, but they sometimes constitute a high administrative cost. For this reason, this paper presents social parking, a system that is based on the citizens as sensors paradigm, where data are collected by users and are processed using data mining techniques. Moreover, an ontology is used to enable the standardization of information. This way, social parking is compatible with the FIWARE platform. A forecast algorithm was also designed and verified to estimate the number of free parking spots inside a parking lot. With this aim, we used public parking data from eight parking lots in the city of Zaragoza. Client applications allowed testing of all the functions of the parking system. These tests were carried out in three experimental parking lots in the city of M&aacute;laga.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Currently, enhancing sustainability, and in particular reducing energy consumption, is a huge challenge for manufacturing enterprises. The vision of the fourth industrial revolution (so-called &ldquo;industry 4.0&rdquo;) is not only to optimize production and minimize costs, but also to reduce energy consumption and enhance product life-cycle management. To address this challenge, a multi-agent architecture aimed at elaborating predictive and reactive energy-efficient scheduling through collaboration between cyber physical production and energy systems is proposed in this paper. Smart, sustainable decision tools for cyber physical production systems (CPPS) and cyber physical energy systems (CPES) are proposed. The decision tools are data-driven, agent-based models with dynamic interaction. The main aim of agent behaviours in the cyber part of CPPS is to find a predictive and reactive energy-efficient schedule. The role of agents in CPES is to control the energy consumption of connected factories and switch between the different renewable energy sources. Dynamic mechanisms in CPPS and CPES are proposed to adjust the energy consumption of production systems based on the availability of the renewable energy. The proposed approach was validated on a physically distributed architecture using networked embedded systems and real-time data sharing from connected sensors in each cyber physical systems. A series of instances inspired from the literature were tested to assess the performance of the proposed method. The results prove the efficiency of the proposed approach in adapting the energy consumption of connected factories based on a real-time energy threshold.

AB  - Nowadays, the importance of energy management and optimization by means of smart devices has arisen as an important issue. On the other hand, the intelligent application of smart devices stands as a key element in establishing smart cities, which have been suggested as the solution to complicated future urbanization difficulties in coming years. Considering the scarcity of traditional fossil fuels in the near future, besides their ecological problems the new smart grids have demonstrated the potential to merge the non-renewable and renewable energy resources into each other leading to the reduction of environmental problems and optimizing operating costs. The current paper clarifies the importance of smart grids in launching smart cities by reviewing the advancement of micro/nano grids, applications of renewable energies, energy-storage technologies, smart water grids in smart cities. Additionally a review of the major European smart city projects has been carried out. These will offer a wider vision for researchers in the operation, monitoring, control and audit of smart-grid systems.

Concurrently, Industry 4.0 is being used to bring productivity to higher levels by reducing waste and improving the efficiency of production processes via more precise real-time planning. There is significant potential to combine these two frameworks to enhance the sustainability of manufacturing sectors. This paper discusses the fundamental concepts of Industry 4.0 and explores the influential factors of Industry 4.0 that accelerate the sharing economy in the CE context via a case of electric scooters in Taiwan.

Nowadays, roads and highways are equipped with a huge amount of surveillance cameras, which can be used for real-time vehicle identification, and thus providing traffic flow estimation. This research provides a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art object detectors, visual features, and classification models useful to implement traffic state estimations. More specifically, three different object detectors are compared to identify vehicles. Four machine learning techniques are successively employed to explore five visual features for classification aims. These classic machine learning approaches are compared with the deep learning techniques. This research demonstrates that, when methods and resources are properly implemented and tested, results are very encouraging for both methods, but the deep learning method is the most accurately performing one reaching an accuracy of 99.9% for binary traffic state classification and 98.6% for multiclass classification.

AB  - The exponential growth of cities has brought important challenges such as waste management, pollution and overpopulation, and the administration of transportation. To mitigate these problems, the idea of the smart city was born, seeking to provide robust solutions integrating sensors and electronics, information technologies, and communication networks. More particularly, to face transportation challenges, intelligent transportation systems are a vital component in this quest, helped by vehicular communication networks, which offer a communication framework for vehicles, road infrastructure, and pedestrians. The extreme conditions of vehicular environments, nonetheless, make communication between nodes that may be moving at very high speeds very difficult to achieve, so non-deterministic approaches are necessary to maximize the chances of packet delivery. In this paper, we address this problem using artificial intelligence from a hybrid perspective, focusing on both the best next message to replicate and the best next hop in its path. Furthermore, we propose a deep learning&ndash;based router (DLR+), a router with a prioritized type of message scheduler and a routing algorithm based on deep learning. Simulations done to assess the router performance show important gains in terms of network overhead and hop count, while maintaining an acceptable packet delivery ratio and delivery delays, with respect to other popular routing protocols in vehicular networks.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Urban traffic routing is deemed to be a significant challenge in intelligent transportation systems. Existing implementations suffer from several intrinsic issues such as scalability in centralized systems, unnecessary complexity of mechanisms and communication in distributed systems, and lack of privacy. These imply force intensive computational tasks in the traffic control center, continuous communication in real-time with involved stakeholders which require drivers to reveal their location, origin, and destination of their trips. In this paper we present an innovative urban traffic routing framework and reference architecture (multimap traffic control architecture, MuTraff), which is based on the strategical generation and distribution of a set of traffic network maps (traffic weighted multimaps, TWM) to vehicle categories or fleets. Each map in a TWM map set has the same topology but a different distribution of link weights, which are computed by considering policies and constraints that may apply to different vehicle groups. MuTraff delivers a traffic management system (TMS), where a traffic control center generates and distributes maps, while routing computation is performed at the vehicles. We show how this balance between generation, distribution, and routing computation improves scalability, eases communication complexities, and solves former privacy issues. Our study presents case studies in a real city environment for (a) global congestion management using random maps; (b) congestion control on road incidents; and c) emergency fleets routing. We show that MuTraff is a promising foundation framework that is easy to deploy, and is compatible with other existing TMS frameworks.

AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting the effects of climate change and decreasing the environmental, social and economic costs of energy production are some of the main issues related to the sustainable development of modern society. Energy communities, envisioned to enable local energy exchange between consumers and producers of renewable energy, represent a possible scenario towards a cleaner and sustainable energy system. In this paper, an energy community management model called Power Cloud and presented in previous papers is proposed for a real-world practical application at the University of Calabria. In particular, the implementation of the information and communication technology (ICT) architecture and other enabling technologies, such as the nanogrid and the smart energy box, are discussed in detail. The experiment results show that by adopting the Power Cloud management model it is possible to obtain significant savings in terms of energy cost, which provide benefit for a community, such as a university campus.

AB  - Solar energy is one of the most promising sources of energy that could be used to address distributed supply problems. Global warming and decarbonization are significant global concerns, particularly for countries that are not fossil fuel providers. This paper presents a study focused on Spain, a country with a favorable location with respect to horizontal irradiance. The study addresses the future energy demand forecast and how photovoltaic energy could supply an important part of electricity needs. Our approach focuses on two analyses. First, several traditional statistical techniques are discussed in order to obtain a model that best suits Spanish energy demand forecasts for the future years. Different algorithms are compared in order to determine which is the most appropriate for the considered purpose. Second, the evolution of solar photovoltaic technology in Spain is analyzed. The latitude of Spanish cities makes them suitable for utilizing this kind of technology. In this sense, seasonal and monthly trends are identified with high levels of detail, considering a large historical dataset. The increase of the capacity of electricity generation based on this procedure is evaluated. Finally, a discussion about matching electricity demand forecasts and photovoltaic production is offered. Considering the selected model for the photovoltaic power of Spain, from    5    to     42     GW in 2030, the Spanish production is determined as     81     TWh. The obtained results suggest that a possible energy transition is feasible. However, some challenges have to be considered, such us the design of an effective strategy to store excess energy produced when generation is higher than electricity demand. In this way, the electrical distribution system could be fed by the stored energy when solar energy production is deficient.

This paper proposes a new intelligent algorithm that includes parameter optimization and decision rules to forecast and analyze of urban air quality. Through analysis of 24-h daily air quality data provided by the Beijing Air Quality Monitoring Station, simulated annealing (SA) and a decision tree (DT) emerge as the key factors. We prove that in the investigated algorithm, SA and DT can be used to make decision rules and achieve better accuracy for classification. We find that SA can be used to adjust the best parameter settings for the DT. Simulation results show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm for classification is far better than other existing approaches.

A sensing architecture and a set of experiments were developed, associating it to several simulated flights (     N  f l i g h t s   = 13    ) using the Microsoft Flight Simulator Steam Edition (FSX-SE). The approach was carried out with eight beginner users on the flight simulator (     N  p i l o t s   = 8    ). It is shown that it is possible to recognize emotions from different pilots in flight, combining their present and previous emotions. The cardiac system based on Heart Rate (HR), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Electroencephalography (EEG), were used to extract emotions, as well as the intensities of emotions detected from the pilot face. We also considered five main emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprise and scared. The emotion recognition is based on Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning techniques. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were the main methods used to measure the quality of the regression output models. The tests of the produced output models showed that the lowest recognition errors were reached when all data were considered or when the GSR datasets were omitted from the model training. It also showed that the emotion surprised was the easiest to recognize, having a mean RMSE of 0.13 and mean MAE of 0.01; while the emotion sad was the hardest to recognize, having a mean RMSE of 0.82 and mean MAE of 0.08. When we considered only the higher emotion intensities by time, the most matches accuracies were between 55% and 100%.

TI  - Application of a Hybrid Artificial Neural Network-Particle Swarm Optimization (ANN-PSO) Model in Behavior Prediction of Channel Shear Connectors Embedded in Normal and High-Strength Concrete

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Channel shear connectors are known as an appropriate alternative for common shear connectors due to having a lower manufacturing cost and an easier installation process. The behavior of channel connectors is generally determined through conducting experiments. However, these experiments are not only costly but also time-consuming. Moreover, the impact of other parameters cannot be easily seen in the behavior of the connectors. This paper aims to investigate the application of a hybrid artificial neural network&ndash;particle swarm optimization (ANN-PSO) model in the behavior prediction of channel connectors embedded in normal and high-strength concrete (HSC). To generate the required data, an experimental project was conducted. Dimensions of the channel connectors and the compressive strength of concrete were adopted as the inputs of the model, and load and slip were predicted as the outputs. To evaluate the ANN-PSO model, an ANN model was also developed and tuned by a backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm. The results of the paper revealed that an ANN model could properly predict the behavior of channel connectors and eliminate the need for conducting costly experiments to some extent. In addition, in this case, the ANN-PSO model showed better performance than the ANN-BP model by resulting in superior performance indices.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) remains a scourge that compromises the rights of many women around the world, shaping an asymmetry in civil rights. Fighting gender-based violence, especially when it is committed by an intimate partner, is an important responsibility that needs to be addressed from all angles. It is also remarkable that our society is clearly conditioned by information and communication technology (ICT), which involves many aspects of our daily life. Unfortunately, violence that is performed in the real world is also replicated in this &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; existence, by offenders in ICT contexts. On the other hand, the same technologies also provide a plethora of opportunities to fight IPV, which are enhanced by the innovative paradigm of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, we first present a thorough compilation of ICT proposals already published&mdash;based on either hardware or software&mdash;aimed at protecting IPV survivors, and which can be applied in real life situations but also within social networks. The challenges that still lie ahead are highlighted and, a complete ICT-based platform for IPV management, within an IoT framework, that overcomes the limitations of previous works is proposed, and then promoting a symmetry between individuals in society.

AB  - Airborne particulates are of particular significance for their human health impacts and their roles in both atmospheric radiative transfer and atmospheric chemistry. Observations of airborne particulates are typically made by environmental agencies using rather expensive instruments. Due to the expense of the instruments usually used by environment agencies, the number of sensors that can be deployed is limited. In this study we show that machine learning can be used to effectively calibrate lower cost optical particle counters. For this calibration it is critical that measurements of the atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature are also made.

AB  - Rising interest in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems combined with the increased availability of collected data allows the study of different methods for prevention of traffic congestion in cities. A common need in all of these methods is the use of traffic predictions for supporting planning and operation of the traffic lights and traffic management schemes. This paper focuses on comparing the forecasting effectiveness of three machine learning models, namely Random Forests, Support Vector Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron&mdash;in addition to Multiple Linear Regression&mdash;using probe data collected from the road network of Thessaloniki, Greece. The comparison was conducted with multiple tests clustered in three types of scenarios. The first scenario tests the algorithms on specific randomly selected dates on different randomly selected roads. The second scenario tests the algorithms on randomly selected roads over eight consecutive 15 min intervals; the third scenario tests the algorithms on random roads for the duration of a whole day. The experimental results show that while the Support Vector Regression model performs best at stable conditions with minor variations, the Multilayer Perceptron model adapts better to circumstances with greater variations, in addition to having the most near-zero errors.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The increasing availability of trajectory recordings has led to the mining of a massive amount of historical track data, allowing for a better understanding of travel behaviors by revealing meaningful motion patterns. In the context of human mobility analysis, the problem of motion prediction assumes a central role and is beneficial for a wide range of applications, including for touristic purposes, such as personalized services or targeted recommendations, and sustainability studies related to crowd management and resource redistribution. This paper tackles a particular case of the trajectory prediction problem, focusing on large-scale mobility traces of short-term foreign tourists. These sparse trajectories, short and non-repetitive, lack spatial and temporal regularity, making prediction analysis based on individual historical motion data unreliable. To face this issue, we hereby propose a deep learning-based approach, taking into account the collective mobility of tourists over the territory. The underlying semantics of motion patterns are captured by means of a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model trained on pre-processed location sequences, aiming to predict the next visited place in the trajectory. We tested the methodology on a real-world big dataset, demonstrating its higher feasibility with respect to traditional approaches.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Ground vibration induced by blasting operations is an important undesirable effect in surface mines and has significant environmental impacts on surrounding areas. Therefore, the precise prediction of blast-induced ground vibration is a challenging task for engineers and for managers. This study explores and evaluates the use of two stochastic metaheuristic algorithms, namely biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), as well as one deterministic optimization algorithm, namely the DIRECT method, to improve the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting the ground vibration. It is worth mentioning this is the first time that BBO-ANN and DIRECT-ANN models have been applied to predict ground vibration. To demonstrate model reliability and effectiveness, a minimax probability machine regression (MPMR), extreme learning machine (ELM), and three well-known empirical methods were also tested. To collect the required datasets, two quarry mines in the Shur river dam region, located in the southwest of Iran, were monitored, and the values of input and output parameters were measured. Five statistical indicators, namely the percentage root mean square error (%RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Ratio of RMSE to the standard deviation of the observations (RSR), mean absolute error (MAE), and degree of agreement (d) were taken into account for the model assessment. According to the results, BBO-ANN provided a better generalization capability than the other predictive models. As a conclusion, BBO, as a robust evolutionary algorithm, can be successfully linked to the ANN for better performance.

AB  - This study is to analyze the influence of visibility in a foggy weather environment on the accuracy of machine vision obstacle detection in assisted driving. We present a foggy day imaging model and analyze the image characteristics, then we set up the faster region convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) as the basic network for target detection in the simulation experiment and use Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) data for network detection and classification training. PreScan software is used to build weather and traffic scenes based on a foggy imaging model, and we study object detection of machine vision in four types of weather condition&mdash;clear (no fog), light fog, medium fog, and heavy fog&mdash;by simulation experiment. The experimental results show that the detection recall is 91.55%, 85.21%, 72.54~64.79%, and 57.75% respectively in no fog, light fog, medium fog, and heavy fog environments. Then we used real scenes in medium fog and heavy fog environment to verify the simulation experiment. Through this study, we can determine the influence of bad weather on the detection results of machine vision, and hence we can improve the safety of assisted driving through further research.

AB  - High-dimensional data and high-dimensional representations of reality are inherent features of modern Artificial Intelligence systems and applications of machine learning. The well-known phenomenon of the &ldquo;curse of dimensionality&rdquo; states: many problems become exponentially difficult in high dimensions. Recently, the other side of the coin, the &ldquo;blessing of dimensionality&rdquo;, has attracted much attention. It turns out that generic high-dimensional datasets exhibit fairly simple geometric properties. Thus, there is a fundamental tradeoff between complexity and simplicity in high dimensional spaces. Here we present a brief explanatory review of recent ideas, results and hypotheses about the blessing of dimensionality and related simplifying effects relevant to machine learning and neuroscience.

AB  - The AI-in-the-loop system (AIS) has been widely used in various autonomous decision and control systems, such as computing vision, autonomous vehicle, and collision avoidance systems. AIS generates and updates control strategies through learning algorithms, which make the control behaviors non-deterministic and bring about the test oracle problem in AIS testing procedure. The traditional system mainly concerns about properties of safety, reliability, and real-time, while AIS concerns more about the correctness, robustness, and stiffness of system. To perform an AIS testing with the existing testing techniques according to the testing requirements, this paper presents an extendable framework of AI-in-the-loop system testing by exploring the key steps involved in the testing procedure, named ExtendAIST, which contributes to define the execution steps of ExtendAIST and design space of testing techniques. Furthermore, the ExtendAIST framework provides three concerns for AIS testing, which include: (a) the extension points; (b) sub-extension points; and (c) existing techniques commonly present in each point. Therefore, testers can obtain the testing strategy using existing techniques directly for corresponding testing requirements or extend more techniques based on these extension points.

AB  - The power output forecasting of the photovoltaic (PV) system is essential before deciding to install a photovoltaic system in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, due to the uneven power production and unstable data. This research simulates the power output forecasting of PV systems by using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), comparing accuracy with particle swarm optimization combined with artificial neural network methods (PSO-ANN). The simulation results show that the forecasting with the ANFIS method is more accurate than the PSO-ANN method. The performance of the ANFIS and PSO-ANN models were verified with mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAP) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE). The accuracy of the ANFIS model is 99.8532%, and the PSO-ANN method is 98.9157%. The power output forecast results of the model were evaluated and show that the proposed ANFIS forecasting method is more beneficial compared to the existing method for the computation of power output and investment decision making. Therefore, the analysis of the production of power output from PV systems is essential to be used for the most benefit and analysis of the investment cost.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In recent years, deep learning technology has been widely used in the field of hyperspectral image classification and achieved good performance. However, deep learning networks need a large amount of training samples, which conflicts with the limited labeled samples of hyperspectral images. Traditional deep networks usually construct each pixel as a subject, ignoring the integrity of the hyperspectral data and the methods based on feature extraction are likely to lose the edge information which plays a crucial role in the pixel-level classification. To overcome the limit of annotation samples, we propose a new three-channel image build method (virtual RGB image) by which the trained networks on natural images are used to extract the spatial features. Through the trained network, the hyperspectral data are disposed as a whole. Meanwhile, we propose a multiscale feature fusion method to combine both the detailed and semantic characteristics, thus promoting the accuracy of classification. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve ideal results better than the state-of-art methods. In addition, the virtual RGB image can be extended to other hyperspectral processing methods that need to use three-channel images.

AB  - In order to protect human lives and infrastructure, as well as to minimize the risk of damage, it is important to predict and respond to natural disasters in advance. However, currently, the standardized disaster response system in South Korea still needs further advancement, and the response phase systems need to be improved to ensure that they are properly equipped to cope with natural disasters. Existing studies on intelligent disaster management systems (IDSSs) in South Korea have focused only on storms, floods, and earthquakes, and they have not used past data. This research proposes a new conceptual framework of an IDSS for disaster management, with particular attention paid to wildfires and cold/heat waves. The IDSS uses big data collected from open application programming interface (API) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to help decision-makers make faster and more accurate decisions. In addition, a simple example of the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect fire in surveillance video has been developed, which can be used for automatic fire detection and provide an appropriate response. The system will also consider connecting to open source intelligence (OSINT) to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and develop more robust security policies than those currently in place to prevent cyber-attacks.

AB  - Using the AdaBoost method may increase the accuracy and reliability of a framework for daily activities and environment recognition. Mobile devices have several types of sensors, including motion, magnetic, and location sensors, that allow accurate identification of daily activities and environment. This paper focuses on the review of the studies that use the AdaBoost method with the sensors available in mobile devices. This research identified the research works written in English about the recognition of daily activities and environment recognition using the AdaBoost method with the data obtained from the sensors available in mobile devices that were published between 2012 and 2018. Thus, 13 studies were selected and analysed from 151 identified records in the searched databases. The results proved the reliability of the method for daily activities and environment recognition, highlighting the use of several features, including the mean, standard deviation, pitch, roll, azimuth, and median absolute deviation of the signal of motion sensors, and the mean of the signal of magnetic sensors. When reported, the analysed studies presented an accuracy higher than 80% in recognition of daily activities and environments with the Adaboost method.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have profoundly influenced the way individuals and enterprises interact with the world. Although attacks on IoT devices are becoming more commonplace, security metrics often focus on software, network, and cloud security. For CPS systems employed in IoT applications, the implementation of hardware security is crucial. The identity of electronic circuits measured in terms of device parameters serves as a fingerprint. Estimating the parameters of this fingerprint assists the identification and prevention of Trojan attacks in a CPS. We demonstrate a bio-inspired approach for hardware Trojan detection using unsupervised learning methods. The bio-inspired principles of pattern identification use a Spiking Neural Network (SNN), and glial cells form the basis of this work. When hardware device parameters are in an acceptable range, the design produces a stable firing pattern. When unbalanced, the firing rate reduces to zero, indicating the presence of a Trojan. This network is tunable to accommodate natural variations in device parameters and to avoid false triggering of Trojan alerts. The tolerance is tuned using bio-inspired principles for various security requirements, such as forming high-alert systems for safety-critical missions. The Trojan detection circuit is resilient to a range of faults and attacks, both intentional and unintentional. Also, we devise a design-for-trust architecture by developing a bio-inspired device-locking mechanism. The proposed architecture is implemented on a Xilinx Artix-7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device. Results demonstrate the suitability of the proposal for resource-constrained environments with minimal hardware and power dissipation profiles. The design is tested with a wide range of device parameters to demonstrate the effectiveness of Trojan detection. This work serves as a new approach to enable secure CPSs and to employ bio-inspired unsupervised machine intelligence.

AB  - Though the technological advancement of smart city infrastructure has significantly improved urban pedestrians&rsquo; health and safety, there remains a large number of road traffic accident victims, making it a pressing current transportation concern. In particular, unsignalized crosswalks present a major threat to pedestrians, but we lack dense behavioral data to understand the risks they face. In this study, we propose a new model for potential pedestrian risky event (PPRE) analysis, using video footage gathered by road security cameras already installed at such crossings. Our system automatically detects vehicles and pedestrians, calculates trajectories, and extracts frame-level behavioral features. We use k-means clustering and decision tree algorithms to classify these events into six clusters, then visualize and interpret these clusters to show how they may or may not contribute to pedestrian risk at these crosswalks. We confirmed the feasibility of the model by applying it to video footage from unsignalized crosswalks in Osan city, South Korea.

AB  - Noise pollution is one of the major urban environmental pollutions, and it is increasingly becoming a matter of crucial public concern. Monitoring and predicting environmental noise are of great significance for the prevention and control of noise pollution. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, urban noise monitoring is emerging in the direction of a small interval, long time, and large data amount, which is difficult to model and predict with traditional methods. In this study, an IoT-based noise monitoring system was deployed to acquire the environmental noise data, and a two-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) network was proposed for the prediction of environmental noise under the condition of large data volume. The optimal hyperparameters were selected through testing, and the raw data sets were processed. The urban environmental noise was predicted at time intervals of 1 s, 1 min, 10 min, and 30 min, and their performances were compared with three classic predictive models: random walk (RW), stacked autoencoder (SAE), and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed model outperforms the other three existing classic methods. The time interval of the data set has a close connection with the performance of all models. The results revealed that the LSTM network could reflect changes in noise levels within one day and has good prediction accuracy. Impacts of monitoring point location on prediction results and recommendations for environmental noise management were also discussed in this paper.

AB  - The usage of Visible Light Communications (VLC) technology in automotive applications is very promising. Nevertheless, in outdoor conditions, the performances of existing VLC systems are strongly affected by the sun or other sources of light. In such situations, the strong parasitic light can saturate the photosensitive element and block data communication. To address the issue, this article analyzes the usage of an adaptive logarithmic transimpedance circuit as an alternative to the classical linear transimpedance circuit. The simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrate benefits of the proposed technique, as it significantly expands the communication distance and optical noise functionality range of the VLC systems and reduces the possibility of photoelement saturation. As a result, this approach might enable outdoor VLC sensors to work in strong sun conditions, the experimental results confirming its validity not only in the laboratory but also in outdoor conditions. A reliable 50 m communication distance is reported for outdoor sunny conditions using a standard power traffic light VLC emitter and a PIN photodiode VLC sensor.

AB  - One of the main environmental issues to address in large urban areas is the ever-increasing generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) and the need to manage it properly. Despite significant efforts having been made to implement comprehensive solid waste management systems, current management methods often do not provide sustainable alternatives which ensure the reduction of solid waste generation. This paper presents an analytical methodology that employs a combination of geographic information system techniques (GIS) along with statistical and numerical optimization methods to evaluate solid waste generation in large urban areas. The methodology was successfully applied to evaluate MSW generation in different exclusive service areas (ASES) of the city of Bogot&aacute; (Colombia). The results of the analysis on the solid waste generation data in each collection area in terms of its socioeconomic level are presented below. These socioeconomic levels are explained by defining different strata in terms of their purchasing power. The results demonstrate the usefulness of these GIS and numerical optimization techniques as a valuable complementary tool to analyze and design efficient and sustainable solid waste management systems.

AB  - Traditional teaching based on masterclasses or techniques where the student develops a passive role has proven to be inefficient methods in the learning process. The use of technology in universities helps to generate active learning where the student&rsquo;s interest improves making him the main actor in his education. However, implementing an environment where active learning takes place requires a great deal of effort given the number of variables involved in this objective. To identify these variables, it is necessary to analyze the data generated by the students in search of patterns that allow them to be classified according to their needs. Once these needs are identified, it is possible to make decisions that contribute to the learning of each student; for this, the use of artificial intelligence is considered. These techniques emulate the processes of human thought using structures that contain knowledge and experience of human experts.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - The neighborhood rough set theory was adopted for attributes reduction and the weight distribution of condition attributes based on the concept of importance level. Smart elderly care coverage rate is low in China. A decisive role in the adoption of smart elderly care is still a problem that needs to be addressed. This study contributes to the adoption of smart elderly care was selected as the decision attribute. The remaining attributes are used as conditional attributes and the multi-level symmetric attribute set for assessing acceptance of smart elderly care. Prior studies are not included smart elderly care adoption attributes in multi-levels; hence, this problem needs to be addressed. The results of this study indicate that the condition attribute of gender has the greatest influence on the decision attribute. The condition attribute of living expenses for smart elderly care has the second largest impact on decision attribute. Children&rsquo;s support for the elderly decency of the novel elderly care system and the acceptance of non-traditional elderly care methods belong to the primary condition attribute of traditional concept. The result indicates traditional concepts have a certain impact on the adoption of smart elderly care and a condition attribute of residence also has a slight influence on the symmetric decision attribute. The sensitivity analysis shows the insights for uncertainties and provides as a basis for the analysis of the attributes in the smart elderly care service adoption.

TI  - Multi-Scale Context Aggregation for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2020

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The semantic segmentation of remote sensing images (RSIs) is important in a variety of applications. Conventional encoder-decoder-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use cascade pooling operations to aggregate the semantic information, which results in a loss of localization accuracy and in the preservation of spatial details. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the use of the high-resolution network (HRNet) to produce high-resolution features without the decoding stage. Moreover, we enhance the low-to-high features extracted from different branches separately to strengthen the embedding of scale-related contextual information. The low-resolution features contain more semantic information and have a small spatial size; thus, they are utilized to model the long-term spatial correlations. The high-resolution branches are enhanced by introducing an adaptive spatial pooling (ASP) module to aggregate more local contexts. By combining these context aggregation designs across different levels, the resulting architecture is capable of exploiting spatial context at both global and local levels. The experimental results obtained on two RSI datasets show that our approach significantly improves the accuracy with respect to the commonly used CNNs and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB  - Precision Agriculture (PA) is an ever-expanding field that takes modern technological advancements and applies it to farming practices to reduce waste and increase output. One advancement that can play a significant role in achieving precision agriculture is wireless technology, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Small, inch scale and low-cost devices can be used to monitor great agricultural areas. In this paper, a system for precision viticulture which uses IoT devices for real-time monitoring is proposed. The different components of the system are programmed properly and the interconnection between them is designed to minimize energy consumption. Wireless sensor nodes measure soil moisture and soil temperature in the field and transmit the information to a base station. If the conditions are optimal for a disease or pest to occur, a drone flies towards the area. When the drone is over the node, pictures are captured and then it returns to the base station for further processing. The feasibility of the system is examined through experimentation in a realistic scenario.

AB  - Modern object recognition algorithms have very high precision. At the same time, they require high computational power. Thus, widely used low-power IoT devices, which gather a substantial amount of data, cannot directly apply the corresponding machine learning algorithms to process it due to the lack of local computational resources. A method for fast detection and classification of moving objects for low-power single-board computers is shown in this paper. The developed algorithm uses geometric parameters of an object as well as scene-related parameters as features for classification. The extraction and classification of these features is a relatively simple process which can be executed by low-power IoT devices. The algorithm aims to recognize the most common objects in the street environment, e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, and cars. The algorithm can be applied in the dark environment by processing images from a near-infrared camera. The method has been tested on both synthetic virtual scenes and real-world data. The research showed that a low-performance computing system, such as a Raspberry Pi 3, is able to classify objects with acceptable frame rate and accuracy.
