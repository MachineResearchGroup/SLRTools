AB  - With the continuing advancements in technologies (such as machine to machine, wireless telecommunications, artificial intelligence, and big data analysis), the Internet of Things (IoT) aims to connect everything for information sharing and intelligent decision-making. Swarm intelligence (SI) provides the possibility of SI behavior through collaboration in individuals that have limited or no intelligence. Its potential parallelism and distribution characteristics can be used to realize global optimization and solve nonlinear complex problems. This paper reviews representative SI algorithms and summarizes their applications in the IoT. The main focus consists in the analysis of SI-enabled applications to wireless sensor network (WSN) and discussion of related research problems in the WSN. Also, we concluded SI-based applications in other IoT fields, such as SI in UAV-aided wireless network. Finally, possible research prospects and future trends are drawn.

AB  - The transition of the energy system into a more efficient state requires innovative ideas to finance new schemes and engage people into adjusting their behavioural patterns concerning consumption. Effective energy management combined with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) open new opportunities for local and regional authorities, but also for energy suppliers, utilities and other obligated parties, or even energy cooperatives, to implement mechanisms that allow people to become more efficient either by producing and trading energy or by reducing their energy consumption. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed connecting energy savings with a digital energy currency. This framework builds reward schemes where the energy end-users could benefit financially from saving energy, by receiving coins according to their real consumption compared to the predicted consumption if no actions were to take place. A pilot appraisal of such a scheme is presented for the case of Bahrain, so as to simulate the behaviour of the proposed framework in order for it to become a viable choice for intelligent energy management in future action plans.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The video created by a surveillance cameras plays a crucial role in crime prevention and examinations in smart cities. The closed-circuit television camera (CCTV) is essential for a range of public uses in a smart city; combined with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies they can turn into smart sensors that help to ensure safety and security. However, the authenticity of the camera itself raises issues of building up integrity and suitability of data. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based system to guarantee the trustworthiness of the stored recordings, allowing authorities to validate whether or not a video has been altered. It helps to discriminate fake videos from original ones and to make sure that surveillance cameras are authentic. Since the distributed ledger of the blockchain records the metadata of the CCTV video as well, it is obstructing the chance of forgery of the data. This immutable ledger diminishes the risk of copyright encroachment for law enforcement agencies and clients users by securing possession and identity.

AB  - The number of publications on acoustic scene classification (ASC) in environmental audio recordings has constantly increased over the last few years. This was mainly stimulated by the annual Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) competition with its first edition in 2013. All competitions so far involved one or multiple ASC tasks. With a focus on deep learning based ASC algorithms, this article summarizes and groups existing approaches for data preparation, i.e., feature representations, feature pre-processing, and data augmentation, and for data modeling, i.e., neural network architectures and learning paradigms. Finally, the paper discusses current algorithmic limitations and open challenges in order to preview possible future developments towards the real-life application of ASC systems.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Data management and processing to enable predictive analytics in cyber physical systems holds the promise of creating insight over underlying processes, discovering anomalous behaviours and predicting imminent failures threatening a normal and smooth production process. In this context, proactive strategies can be adopted, as enabled by predictive analytics. Predictive analytics in turn can make a shift in traditional maintenance approaches to more effective optimising their cost and transforming maintenance from a necessary evil to a strategic business factor. Empowered by the aforementioned points, this paper discusses a novel methodology for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation enabling predictive maintenance of industrial equipment using partial knowledge over its degradation function and the parameters that are affecting it. Moreover, the design and prototype implementation of a plug-n-play end-to-end cloud architecture, supporting predictive maintenance of industrial equipment is presented integrating the aforementioned concept as a service. This is achieved by integrating edge gateways, data stores at both the edge and the cloud, and various applications, such as predictive analytics, visualization and scheduling, integrated as services in the cloud system. The proposed approach has been implemented into a prototype and tested in an industrial use case related to the maintenance of a robotic arm. Obtained results show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed methodology in supporting predictive analytics in the era of Industry 4.0.

AB  - High-speed wired and wireless Internet are one of the useful ways to acquire various types of media data easily. In this circumstance, people also can easily get media data including objects with exposed personal information through the Internet. Exposure of personal information emerges as a social issue. This paper proposes an effective blocking technique that makes it possible to robustly detect target objects with exposed personal information from various types of input images with the use of deep neural computing and to effectively block the detected objects&rsquo; regions. The proposed technique first utilizes the neural computing-based learning algorithm to robustly detect the target object including personal information from an image. It next generates a grid-type mosaic and lets the mosaic overlap the target object region detected in the previous step so as to effectively block the object region that includes personal information. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm robustly detects the target object region with exposed personal information from a variety of input images and effectively blocks the detected region through grid-type mosaic processing. The object blocking technique proposed in this paper is expected to be applied to various application fields such as image security, sustainable anticipatory computing, object tracking, and target blocking.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 6
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Nowadays, traffic infrastructures and vehicles are connected through the network benefiting from the development of Internet of Things (IoT). Connected automated cars can provide some useful traffic information. An architecture and algorithm of mobile service computing are proposed for traffic state sensing by integration between IoT and transport system models (TSMs). The formation process of queue at this intersection is analyzed based on the state information of connected vehicles and the velocity of shockwave is calculated to predict queue length. The computing results can be delivered to the traffic information edge server. However, not all the vehicles are capable of connecting to the network and will affect the queue length estimation accuracy. At the same time, traffic cameras transmit the traffic image to the edge server and a deep neuron network (DNN) is constructed on the edge server to tackle the traffic image. It can recognize and classify the vehicles in the image but takes several seconds to work with the complex DNN. At last, the final queue length is determined according to the weight of the two computing results. The integrated result is delivered to the traffic light controller and traffic monitoring center cloud. It reveals that the estimation from DNN can compensate the estimation from shockwave when the penetration rate of connected vehicles is low. A testbed is built based on VISSIM, and the evaluation results demonstrate the availability and accuracy of the integrated queue length estimation algorithm.

AB  - This study focuses on the design of a measuring system for monitoring the power quality within the SMART street lighting test polygon at university campuses with relation to testing an adaptive current control strategy for three-phase shunt active power filters. Unlike conventional street lighting, SMART elements are powered 24/7. Due to the electronic character of the power part of such mass appliances, there are increased problems with the power quality of the electric energy. Compared to the current concept of street lighting, there is a significant increase in the content of higher current harmonic components, which cause several problems in the distribution system. The test polygon contains 16 luminaires made by various manufacturers and mounted with various SMART components. Using the polygon control and monitoring system, dynamic load scenarios were selected. These scenarios tested the possibilities of different adaptive current control strategies for three-phase shunt active power filters to improve the power quality of electricity. This study focuses on three adaptive algorithms that respond to dynamic changes of current harmonics level in real-time. The possibility of active filter control was tested using FPGA, mainly due to the low latency of the filter control part.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Perfect channel state information (CSI) is required in most of the classical physical-layer security techniques, while it is difficult to obtain the ideal CSI due to the time-varying wireless fading channel. Although imperfect CSI has a great impact on the security of MIMO communications, deep learning is becoming a promising solution to handle the negative effect of imperfect CSI. In this work, we propose two types of deep learning-based secure MIMO detectors for heterogeneous networks, where the macro base station (BS) chooses the null-space eigenvectors to prevent information leakage to the femto BS. Thus, the bit error rate of the associated user is adopted as the metric to evaluate the system performance. With the help of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the macro BS obtains the refined version from the imperfect CSI. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed algorithms. The impacts of system parameters, such as the correlation factor of imperfect CSI, the normalized doppler frequency, the number of antennas is investigated in different setup scenarios. The results show that considerable performance gains can be obtained from the deep learning-based detectors compared with the classical maximum likelihood algorithm.

AB  - Regional collision risk identification and prediction is important for traffic surveillance in maritime transportation. This study proposes a framework of real-time prediction for regional collision risk by combining Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) technique, Shapley value method and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Firstly, the DBSCAN technique is applied to cluster vessels in specific sea area. Then the regional collision risk is quantified by calculating the contribution of each vessel and each cluster with Shapley value method. Afterwards, the optimized RNN method is employed to predict the regional collision risk of specific seas in short time. As a result, the framework is able to determine and forecast the regional collision risk precisely. At last, a case study is carried out with actual Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, the results show that the proposed framework is an effective tool for regional collision risk identification and prediction.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The significant increase of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart homes and other smart infrastructure, and the recent attacks on these IoT devices, are motivating factors to secure and protect IoT networks. The primary security challenge to develop a methodology to identify a malicious activity correctly and mitigate the impact of such activity promptly. In this paper, we propose a two-level anomalous activity detection model for intrusion detection system in IoT networks. The level-1 model categorizes the network flow as normal flow or abnormal flow, while the level-2 model classifies the category or subcategory of detected malicious activity. When the network flow classified as an anomaly by the level-1 model, then the level-1 model forwards the stream to the level-2 model for further investigation to find the category or subcategory of the detected anomaly. Our proposed model constructed on flow-based features of the IoT network. Flow-based detection methodologies only inspect packet headers to classify the network traffic. Flow-based features extracted from the IoT Botnet dataset and various machine learning algorithms were investigated and tested via different cross-fold validation tests to select the best algorithm. The decision tree classifier yielded the highest predictive results for level-1, and the random forest classifier produced the highest predictive results for level-2. Our proposed model Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F score for level-1 were measured as 99.99% and 99.90% for level-2. A two-level anomalous activity detection system for IoT networks we proposed will provide a robust framework for the development of malicious activity detection system for IoT networks. It would be of interest to researchers in academia and industry.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is a crucial indicator for evaluating soil quality and an important component of soil carbon pools, which play a vital role in terrestrial ecosystems. Rapid, non-destructive and accurate monitoring of SOM content is of great significance for the environmental management and ecological restoration of mining areas. Visible-near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy has proven its applicability in estimating SOM over the years. In this study, 168 soil samples were collected from the Zhundong coal field of Xinjiang Province, Northwest China. The SOM content (g kg&minus;1) was determined by the potassium dichromate external heating method and the soil reflectance spectra were measured by the spectrometer. Two spectral feature extraction strategies, namely, principal component analysis (PCA) and the optimal band combination algorithm, were introduced to choose spectral variables. Linear models and random forests (RF) were used for predictive models. The coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and the ratio of the performance to the interquartile distance (RPIQ) were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the model. The results indicated that the variables (2DI and 3DI) derived from the optimal band combination algorithm outperformed the PCA variables (1DV) regardless of whether linear or RF models were used. An inherent gap exists between 2DI and 3DI, and the performance of 2DI is significantly poorer than that of 3DI. The accuracy of the prediction model increases with the increasing number of spectral variable dimensions (in the following order: 1DV &lt; 2DI &lt; 3DI). This study proves that the 3DI is the first choice for the optimal band combination algorithm to derive sensitive parameters related to SOM in the coal mining area. Furthermore, the optimal band combination algorithm can be applied to hyperspectral or multispectral images and to convert the spectral response into image pixels, which may be helpful for a soil property spatial distribution map.

AB  - The present paper aims to introduce a top down methodology for the forecasting of residential energy demand in four European countries, namely Germany, Italy, Spain, and Lithuania. The methodology employed to develop the estimation is based on econometric techniques. In particular, a logarithmic dynamic linear constant relationship of the consumption is proposed. Demand is estimated as a function of a set of explaining variables, namely heating degree days and gross domestic product per capita. The results confirm that the methodology can be applied to the case of Germany, Italy, and Spain, whereas it is not suitable for Lithuania. The analysis of elasticities of the demand with respect to the gross domestic product per capita shows a negative value for Germany, &minus;0.629, and positive values for Italy, 0.837, and Spain, 0.249. The forecasting of consumption shows that Germany and Italy are more sensitive to weather conditions with respect to Spain and an increase in the demand of 8% and 9% is expected in case of cold climatic conditions.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The urban functional zone, as a special fundamental unit of the city, helps to understand the complex interaction between human space activities and environmental changes. Based on the recognition of physical and social semantics of buildings, combining remote sensing data and social sensing data is an effective way to quickly and accurately comprehend urban functional zone patterns. From the object level, this paper proposes a novel object-wise recognition strategy based on very high spatial resolution images (VHSRI) and social sensing data. First, buildings are extracted according to the physical semantics of objects; second, remote sensing and point of interest (POI) data are combined to comprehend the spatial distribution and functional semantics in the social function context; finally, urban functional zones are recognized and determined by building with physical and social functional semantics. When it comes to building geometrical information extraction, this paper, given the importance of building boundary information, introduces the deeper edge feature map (DEFM) into the segmentation and classification, and improves the result of building boundary recognition. Given the difficulty in understanding deeper semantics and spatial information and the limitation of traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) models in feature extraction, we propose the Deeper-Feature Convolutional Neural Network (DFCNN), which is able to extract more and deeper features for building semantic recognition. Experimental results conducted on a Google Earth image of Shenzhen City show that the proposed method and model are able to effectively, quickly, and accurately recognize urban functional zones by combining building physical semantics and social functional semantics, and are able to ensure the accuracy of urban functional zone recognition.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the past decade, time series data have been generated from various fields at a rapid speed, which offers a huge opportunity for mining valuable knowledge. As a typical task of time series mining, Time Series Classification (TSC) has attracted lots of attention from both researchers and domain experts due to its broad applications ranging from human activity recognition to smart city governance. Specifically, there is an increasing requirement for performing classification tasks on diverse types of time series data in a timely manner without costly hand-crafting feature engineering. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework named Edge4TSC that allows time series to be processed in the edge environment, so that the classification results can be instantly returned to the end-users. Meanwhile, to get rid of the costly hand-crafting feature engineering process, deep learning techniques are applied for automatic feature extraction, which shows competitive or even superior performance compared to state-of-the-art TSC solutions. However, because time series presents complex patterns, even deep learning models are not capable of achieving satisfactory classification accuracy, which motivated us to explore new time series representation methods to help classifiers further improve the classification accuracy. In the proposed framework Edge4TSC, by building the binary distribution tree, a new time series representation method was designed for addressing the classification accuracy concern in TSC tasks. By conducting comprehensive experiments on six challenging time series datasets in the edge environment, the potential of the proposed framework for its generalization ability and classification accuracy improvement is firmly validated with a number of helpful insights.

AB  - Owing to frequent traffic accidents and casualties nowadays, the ability to predict the number of traffic accidents in a period is significant for the transportation department to make decisions scientifically. However, owing to many variables affecting traffic accidents in the road traffic system, there are two critical challenges in traffic accident prediction. The first issue is how to evaluate the weight of each variable&rsquo;s impact on the accident. The second issue is how to model the prediction process for multiple interrelated variables. Aiming to solve these two problems, we propose effective solutions to deal with traffic accident prediction. Firstly, for the first issue, we exploit the grey correlation analysis to measure the correlation of factors to accident occurrence. Then, for the second issue, we select the main factors by correlation analysis to establish a multivariable grey model&mdash;MGM(1,N) for prediction process modeling. Further, we explore the collinearity between variables and better optimize the predictive model. The experimental results show that our approach achieves best performance than four general-purpose comparative algorithms in traffic accident prediction task.

VL  - 13

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - The current methods that aim at monitoring the structural health status (SHS) of road pavements allow detecting surface defects and failures. This notwithstanding, there is a lack of methods and systems that are able to identify concealed cracks (particularly, bottom-up cracks) and monitor their growth over time. For this reason, the objective of this study is to set up a supervised machine learning (ML)-based method for the identification and classification of the SHS of a differently cracked road pavement based on its vibro-acoustic signature. The method aims at collecting these signatures (using acoustic-sensors, located at the roadside) and classifying the pavement&rsquo;s SHS through ML models. Different ML classifiers (i.e., multilayer perceptron, MLP, convolutional neural network, CNN, random forest classifier, RFC, and support vector classifier, SVC) were used and compared. Results show the possibility of associating with great accuracy (i.e., MLP = 91.8%, CNN = 95.6%, RFC = 91.0%, and SVC = 99.1%) a specific vibro-acoustic signature to a differently cracked road pavement. These results are encouraging and represent the bases for the application of the proposed method in real contexts, such as monitoring roads and bridges using wireless sensor networks, which is the target of future studies.

AB  - The way citizens interact with cities affects overall life quality. Their participation in social decisions is of paramount importance for helping on public decisions that affect governance, regulation and education. This interaction has the potential of being boosted within the scope of smart and digital cities, especially by recent advances in blockchain technology. This work introduces insights about how smart cities&rsquo; concepts and innovative technologies can help society to face daily challenges for improving citizens&rsquo; awareness. Digital technologies are able to drive social and economic development by employing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to promote innovation. In this context, e-governance, in conjunction with disruptive concepts such as blockchain, is showing up as a fundamental tool for a decentralized democracy. This study reviews, discusses, raises open points and presents suggestions towards an efficient, transparent and sustainable use of technology, applied to future cities.

AB  - With the development of intrusion detection, a number of the intelligence algorithms (e.g., artificial neural networks) are introduced to enhance the performance of the intrusion detection systems. However, many intelligence algorithms should be trained before being used, and retrained regularly, which is not applicable for continuous online learning and analyzing. In this paper, a new online intrusion scenario discovery framework is proposed and the intelligence algorithm HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) is employed to improve the performance of the online learning ability of the system. The proposed framework can discover and model intrusion scenarios, and the constructed model keeps evolving with the variance of the data. Additionally, a series of data preprocessing methods are introduced to enhance its adaptability to the noisy and twisted data. The experimental results show that the framework is effective in intrusion scenario discovery, and the discovered scenario is more concise and accurate than our previous work.

TI  - A Method for Human Facial Image Annotation on Low Power Consumption Autonomous Devices
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 7
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper proposes a classifier designed for human facial feature annotation, which is capable of running on relatively cheap, low power consumption autonomous microcomputer systems. An autonomous system is one that depends only on locally available hardware and software&mdash;for example, it does not use remote services available through the Internet. The proposed solution, which consists of a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) face detector and a set of neural networks, has comparable average accuracy and average true positive and true negative ratio to state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) architectures. However, contrary to DNNs, it is possible to easily implement the proposed method in a microcomputer with very limited RAM memory and without the use of additional coprocessors. The proposed method was trained and evaluated on a large 200,000 image face data set and compared with results obtained by other researchers. Further evaluation proves that it is possible to perform facial image attribute classification using the proposed algorithm on incoming video data captured by an RGB camera sensor of the microcomputer. The obtained results can be easily reproduced, as both the data set and source code can be downloaded. Developing and evaluating the proposed facial image annotation algorithm and its implementation, which is easily portable between various hardware and operating systems (virtually the same code works both on high-end PCs and microcomputers using the Windows and Linux platforms) and which is dedicated for low power consumption devices without coprocessors, is the main and novel contribution of this research.

AB  - Given the imminent threats of climate change, it is urgent to boost the use of clean energy, being wind energy a potential candidate. Nowadays, deployment of wind turbines has become extremely important and long-term estimation of the produced power entails a challenge to achieve good prediction accuracy for site assessment, economic feasibility analysis, farm dispatch, and system operation. We present a method for long-term wind power forecasting using wind turbine properties, statistics, and genetic programming. First, due to the high degree of intermittency of wind speed, we characterize it with Weibull probability distributions and consider wind speed data of time intervals corresponding to prediction horizons of 30, 25, 20, 15 and 10 days ahead. Second, we perform the prediction of a wind speed distribution with genetic programming using the parameters of the Weibull distribution and other relevant meteorological variables. Third, the estimation of wind power is obtained by integrating the forecasted wind velocity distribution into the wind turbine power curve. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we present a case study for a location in Mexico with low wind speeds. Estimation results are promising when compared against real data, as shown by MAE and MAPE forecasting metrics.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recognizing human physical activities from streaming smartphone sensor readings is essential for the successful realization of a smart environment. Physical activity recognition is one of the active research topics to provide users the adaptive services using smart devices. Existing physical activity recognition methods lack in providing fast and accurate recognition of activities. This paper proposes an approach to recognize physical activities using only2-axes of the smartphone accelerometer sensor. It also investigates the effectiveness and contribution of each axis of the accelerometer in the recognition of physical activities. To implement our approach, data of daily life activities are collected labeled using the accelerometer from 12 participants. Furthermore, three machine learning classifiers are implemented to train the model on the collected dataset and in predicting the activities. Our proposed approach provides more promising results compared to the existing techniques and presents a strong rationale behind the effectiveness and contribution of each axis of an accelerometer for activity recognition. To ensure the reliability of the model, we evaluate the proposed approach and observations on standard publicly available dataset WISDM also and provide a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art studies. The proposed approach achieved 93% weighted accuracy with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, which is almost 13% higher than the existing methods.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 8
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The overhead contact system (OCS) is a critical railway infrastructure for train power supply. Periodic inspections, aiming at acquiring the operational condition of the OCS and detecting problems, are necessary to guarantee the safety of railway operations. One of the OCS inspection means is to analyze data of point clouds collected by mobile 2D LiDAR. Recognizing OCS components from the collected point clouds is a critical task of the data analysis. However, the complex composition of OCS makes the task difficult. To solve the problem of recognizing multiple OCS components, we propose a new deep learning-based method to conduct semantic segmentation on the point cloud collected by mobile 2D LiDAR. Both online data processing and batch data processing are supported because our method is designed to classify points into meaningful categories of objects scan line by scan line. Local features are important for the success of point cloud semantic segmentation. Thus, we design an iterative point partitioning algorithm and a module named as Spatial Fusion Network, which are two critical components of our method for multi-scale local feature extraction. We evaluate our method on point clouds where sixteen categories of common OCS components have been manually labeled. Experimental results show that our method is effective in multiple object recognition since mean Intersection-over-Unions (mIoUs) of online data processing and batch data processing are, respectively, 96.12% and 97.17%.

AB  - Near real-time tracking of construction operations and timely progress reporting are essential for effective management of construction projects. This does not only mitigate potential negative impact of schedule delays and cost overruns but also helps to improve safety on site. Such timely tracking circumvents the drawbacks of conventional methods for data acquisition, which are manual, labor-intensive, and not reliable enough for various construction purposes. To address these issues, a wide range of automated site data acquisition, including remote sensing (RS) technologies, has been introduced. This review article describes the capabilities and limitations of various scenarios employing RS enabling technologies for localization, with a focus on multi-sensor data fusion models. In particular, we have considered integration of real-time location systems (RTLSs) including GPS and UWB with other sensing technologies such as RFID, WSN, and digital imaging for their use in construction. This integrated use of technologies, along with information models (e.g., BIM models) is expected to enhance the efficiency of automated site data acquisition. It is also hoped that this review will prompt researchers to investigate fusion-based data capturing and processing.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 8
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This paper proposes a video-based smoke detection technique for early warning in antifire surveillance systems. The algorithm is developed to detect the smoke behavior in a restricted video surveillance environment, both indoor (e.g., railway carriage, bus wagon, industrial plant, or home/office) or outdoor (e.g., storage area or parking area). The proposed technique exploits a Kalman estimator, color analysis, image segmentation, blob labeling, geometrical features analysis, and M of N decisor, in order to extract an alarm signal within a strict real-time deadline. This new technique requires just a few seconds to detect fire smoke, and it is 15 times faster compared to the requirements of fire-alarm standards for industrial or transport systems, e.g., the EN50155 standard for onboard train fire-alarm systems. Indeed, the EN50155 considers a response time of at least 60 s for onboard systems. The proposed technique has been tested and compared with state-of-art systems using the open access Firesense dataset developed as an output of a European FP7 project, including several fire/smoke indoor and outdoor scenes. There is an improvement of all the detection metrics (recall, accuracy, F1 score, precision, etc.) when comparing Advanced Video SmokE Detection (AdViSED) with other video-based antifire works recently proposed in literature. The proposed technique is flexible in terms of input camera type and frame size and rate and has been implemented on a low-cost embedded platform to develop a distributed antifire system accessible via web browser.

AB  - Tourism is one of the world&rsquo;s fastest driving forces of economic development, playing an important role in achieving sustainable development goals. In modern society, mobile social media is a communication and decision-making platform for users and a source of big data information about travel. Obtaining and analyzing travel data can provide customer-oriented information about travel destinations and comprehensive services for both tourism operators and tourists. It has a positive impact on the sustainable development of society, economy, environment, and humanities. Starting with theoretical analysis and empirical research, this study combines social media and oblique photography, conducts a case study of the Pingtan comprehensive experimental area in China, and develops an app about online travelling to provide corresponding information for consumers&rsquo; decisions. This study also discusses the potential value of the app, i.e., assisting the development of smart travel in city, achieving sustainable development of tourism, and contributing to tourism globally.

PY  - 2020

AB  - This paper introduces a possible architecture and discusses the research directions for the realization of the Cognitive Perceptual Internet (CPI), which is enabled by the convergence of wired and wireless communications, traditional sensor networks, mobile crowd-sensing, and machine learning techniques. The CPI concept stems from the fact that mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming an outstanding mean for zero-effort world-sensing and digitalization thanks to their pervasive diffusion and the increasing number of embedded sensors. Data collected by such devices provide unprecedented insights into the physical world that can be inferred through cognitive processes, thus originating a digital sixth sense. In this paper, we describe how the Internet can behave like a sensing brain, thus evolving into the Internet of Senses, with network-based cognitive perception and action capabilities built upon mobile crowd-sensing mechanisms. The new concept of hyper-map is envisioned as an efficient geo-referenced repository of knowledge about the physical world. Such knowledge is acquired and augmented through heterogeneous sensors, multi-user cooperation and distributed learning mechanisms. Furthermore, we indicate the possibility to accommodate proactive sensors, in addition to common reactive sensors such as cameras, antennas, thermometers and inertial measurement units, by exploiting massive antenna arrays at millimeter-waves to enhance mobile terminals perception capabilities as well as the range of new applications. Finally, we distillate some insights about the challenges arising in the realization of the CPI, corroborated by preliminary results, and we depict a futuristic scenario where the proposed Internet of Senses becomes true.

AB  - This paper studies the time and space mapping of the electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure induced by cellular base station antennas (BSA) using artificial neural networks (ANN). The reconstructed EMF exposure map (EEM) in urban environment is obtained by using data from EMF sensor networks, drive testing and information accessible in a public database, e.g., locations and orientations of BSA. The performance of EEM is compared with Exposure Reference Map (ERM) based on simulations, in which parametric path loss models are used to reflect the complexity of urban cities. Then, a new hybrid ANN, which has the advantage of sorting and utilizing inputs from simulations efficiently, is proposed. Using both hybrid ANN and conventional regression ANN, the EEM is reconstructed and compared to the ERM first by the reconstruction approach considering only EMF exposure assessed from sensor networks, where the required number of sensors towards good reconstruction is explored; then, a new reconstruction approach using the sensors information combined with EMF along few streets from drive testing. Both reconstruction approaches use simulations to mimic measurements. The influence of city architecture on EMF exposure reconstruction is analyzed and the addition of noise is considered to test the robustness of ANN as well.

AB  - In the intelligent traffic system, real-time and accurate detections of vehicles in images and video data are very important and challenging work. Especially in situations with complex scenes, different models, and high density, it is difficult to accurately locate and classify these vehicles during traffic flows. Therefore, we propose a single-stage deep neural network YOLOv3-DL, which is based on the Tensorflow framework to improve this problem. The network structure is optimized by introducing the idea of spatial pyramid pooling, then the loss function is redefined, and a weight regularization method is introduced, for that, the real-time detections and statistics of traffic flows can be implemented effectively. The optimization algorithm we use is the DL-CAR data set for end-to-end network training and experiments with data sets under different scenarios and weathers. The analyses of experimental data show that the optimized algorithm can improve the vehicles&rsquo; detection accuracy on the test set by 3.86%. Experiments on test sets in different environments have improved the detection accuracy rate by 4.53%, indicating that the algorithm has high robustness. At the same time, the detection accuracy and speed of the investigated algorithm are higher than other algorithms, indicating that the algorithm has higher detection performance.

The framework extracts the app-usage behavior data of a mobile user from an Android phone and transmits them to a server. The server learns the representative trajectory patterns of the user by combining the collected app usage patterns and trajectory data. The proposed method performs supervised learning with automated labeled trajectory data using the user app data. Furthermore, it uses the behavioral characteristics data of users linked to the app usage data by area without a labeling cost.

AB  - Exposure to particulate materials (PM) is known to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Respirable particles generated in closed spaces, such as underground parking garages (UPGs), have been reported to be a potential threat to respiratory health. This study reports the concentration of pollutants (PM, TVOC, CO) in UPGs under various operating conditions of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems using a real-time monitoring system with a prototype made up of integrated sensors. In addition, prediction of the PM concentration was implemented using modeling from vehicle traffic volumes and an artificial neural network (ANN), based on environmental factors. The predicted PM concentrations were compared with the level acquired from the real-time monitoring. The measured PM10 concentrations of UPGs were higher than the modeled PM10 due to short-term sources induced by vehicles. The average inhalable and respirable dosage for adult was calculated for the evaluation of health effects. The ANN predicted PM concentration showed a close correlation with measurements resulting in R2 ranging from 0.69 to 0.87. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the use of the air quality monitoring system for personal-exposure to vehicle-induced pollutant in UPGs and the potential application of modeling and ANN for the evaluation of the indoor air quality.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 9
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - For wide-area measurement systems and smart grids, phasor measurement units (PMUs) have become key elements since they provide synchronized information related to the fundamental frequency components of voltages and currents. In recent years, some works have extended the concept of PMU to harmonic analysis due to the proliferation of nonlinear loads. In this work, as a first contribution, the reference model for P-class and M-class PMUs provided by the IEEE Standard C37.118.1 is expanded with the aim of obtaining the harmonic information and electric power quantities. Additionally, as a second contribution, the approach of global harmonic parameters (GHPs) for PMUs is proposed. Specifically, GHPs are introduced in this work as unified quantities regarding the overall harmonic content of voltages and currents signals. With the help of these parameters, the estimation of power quality indices (PQIs) according to the IEEE Standard 1459 can be carried out but with an important advantage, i.e., a reduced amount of data, which reduces the requirements of management, storage, and analysis. Finally, the mathematical formulations for PQIs using the proposal are also presented. It is important to mention that they are equivalent to classical formulations that use individual harmonic information; however, they exploit the advantage of PMUs that require a reduced amount of data. Several tests with synthetic and real signals are carried out to validate the proposal. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Smart cities follow different strategies to face public health challenges associated with socio-economic objectives. Buildings play a crucial role in smart cities and are closely related to people&rsquo;s health. Moreover, they are equally essential to meet sustainable objectives. People spend most of their time indoors. Therefore, indoor air quality has a critical impact on health and well-being. With the increasing population of elders, ambient-assisted living systems are required to promote occupational health and well-being. Furthermore, living environments must incorporate monitoring systems to detect unfavorable indoor quality scenarios in useful time. This paper reviews the current state of the art on indoor air quality monitoring systems based on Internet of Things and wireless sensor networks in the last five years (2014&ndash;2019). This document focuses on the architecture, microcontrollers, connectivity, and sensors used by these systems. The main contribution is to synthesize the existing body of knowledge and identify common threads and gaps that open up new significant and challenging future research directions. The results show that 57% of the indoor air quality monitoring systems are based on Arduino, 53% of the systems use Internet of Things, and WSN architectures represent 33%. The CO2 and PM monitoring sensors are the most monitored parameters in the analyzed literature, corresponding to 67% and 29%, respectively.

The method is based on set theory. The initial data are the properties of objects, information about which is stored in the database, and the set of queries that are most often executed or whose execution speed should be maximum. In order to determine the need to create embedded documents, our method uses the type of relationship between tables in a relational database. Our studies have shown that this method is in addition to the method of creating collections without embedded documents. In the article, we also describe a methodology for determining in which cases which methods should be used to make working with databases more efficient. It should be noted that this approach can be used for translating data from MySQL to MongoDB and for the consolidation of these databases.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Based on a method to reduce energy consumption suggested in a real energy audit carried out in an industrial plant located in Poznań (city in Poland), the potential of using photovoltaic (PV) panels as wall cladding was analyzed, in order to reduce energy (electric and thermal) consumption and financial expenditure. The authors&rsquo; concept of using building integrated photovoltaic installation (BIPV) was presented and tested. This study checked whether the presence of PV modules would also affect heat transfer through the external wall of the building on which the installation is located. The analysis consisted of determining, for two variants, the heat transfer coefficients across the partition, in order to estimate the potential thermal energy savings. The first variant concerned the existing state, i.e., heat transfer through the external wall of the building, while the second included an additional partition layer in the form of photovoltaic panels. As a result, the use of panels as wall cladding allowed the improvement of the thermal parameters of the building wall (by increasing the thermal resistance of the wall), and the reduction of gas consumption for heating. The panels also generate electricity for the factory&rsquo;s own needs. Payback time, compared to calculations which do not include changes in thermal parameters, was shortened from 14 to 11 years. The main reason for this is that gas consumption is reduced due to the improved heat transfer coefficient of the wall and the reduction of the heat loss of the facility. This aspect is usually overlooked when considering photovoltaic installations and, as argued by this paper, can be important.

The existing line-coding techniques are designed for traditional computing network technology and power spectrum density to translate data bits into a signal using various line code waveforms. The existing line-code techniques have multiple kinds of issues, such as the utilization of bandwidth, connection synchronization (CS), the direct current (DC) component, and power spectrum density (PSD). These highlighted issues are not adequate in IoT devices in smart cities due to their small size. However, there is a need to design an effective line-code method to deal with these issues in digital IoT-based communication for smart technologies, which enables smart services for smart cities. In this paper, the Shadow Encoding Scheme (SES) is proposed to transmit data bits efficiently by using a physical waveform in the smart cities&rsquo; ecosystem. SES provides a reliable transmission over the physical medium without using extra bandwidth and with ideal PSD. In it, the shadow copy of the repeating bitstream is forwarded, rather than repeating the actual stream again and again. The PSD is calculated with the help of mathematical equations to validate SES. MATLAB simulator is used to simulate SES and compared with other well-known digital line-code techniques. The bit error rate is also compared between SES and the chirp spread spectrum (CSS) for the specific data frames. The coordinates of the PSD graph are also shown in tabular form, which shows a vivid picture of the working conditions of various line codes.

AB  - Power restoring time in power distribution systems (PDS) can be minimized by using efficient fault localization techniques. This paper proposes a novel, robust and scalable cloud based internet of things (IoT) solution for identification and localization of faults in PDS. For this purpose, a new algorithm is developed that can detect single and multiple simultaneous faults in the presence of single and multiple device or sensor failures. The algorithm has utilized a zone based approach that divides a PDS into different zones. A current sensing device (CSD) was deployed at the boundary of a zone. The function of CSD is to provide time synchronized current measurements and communicate with a cloud server through an edge device (ED). Another contribution of this research work is the unique implementation of context aware policy (CAP) in ED. Due to CAP, only those measurements are transmitted to cloud server that differ from the previously transmitted measurements. The cloud server performed calculations at regular intervals to detect faults in PDS. A relational database model was utilized to log various fault events that occur in PDS. An IEEE 37 node test feeder was selected as PDS to observe the performance of our solution. Two test cases were designed to simulate individual and multiple simultaneous faults in PDS. A third test case was implemented to demonstrate the robustness and scalability of proposed solution to detect multiple simultaneous faults in PDS when single and multiple sensor failures were encountered. It was observed that the new algorithm successfully localized the faults for all the three cases. Consequently, significant reductions were noticed in the amount of data that was sent to the cloud server. In the end, a comparison study of a proposed solution was performed with existing methods to further highlight the benefits of our technique.

TI  - Review: Deep Learning on 3D Point Clouds

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - A point cloud is a set of points defined in a 3D metric space. Point clouds have become one of the most significant data formats for 3D representation and are gaining increased popularity as a result of the increased availability of acquisition devices, as well as seeing increased application in areas such as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented and virtual reality. Deep learning is now the most powerful tool for data processing in computer vision and is becoming the most preferred technique for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and detection. While deep learning techniques are mainly applied to data with a structured grid, the point cloud, on the other hand, is unstructured. The unstructuredness of point clouds makes the use of deep learning for its direct processing very challenging. This paper contains a review of the recent state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, mainly focusing on raw point cloud data. The initial work on deep learning directly with raw point cloud data did not model local regions; therefore, subsequent approaches model local regions through sampling and grouping. More recently, several approaches have been proposed that not only model the local regions but also explore the correlation between points in the local regions. From the survey, we conclude that approaches that model local regions and take into account the correlation between points in the local regions perform better. Contrary to existing reviews, this paper provides a general structure for learning with raw point clouds, and various methods were compared based on the general structure. This work also introduces the popular 3D point cloud benchmark datasets and discusses the application of deep learning in popular 3D vision tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of visual impairment and blindness across the world. It is usually found in patients who suffer from diabetes for a long period. The major focus of this work is to derive optimal representation of retinal images that further helps to improve the performance of DR recognition models. To extract optimal representation, features extracted from multiple pre-trained ConvNet models are blended using proposed multi-modal fusion module. These final representations are used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) used for DR identification and severity level prediction. As each ConvNet extracts different features, fusing them using 1D pooling and cross pooling leads to better representation than using features extracted from a single ConvNet. Experimental studies on benchmark Kaggle APTOS 2019 contest dataset reveals that the model trained on proposed blended feature representations is superior to the existing methods. In addition, we notice that cross average pooling based fusion of features from Xception and VGG16 is the most appropriate for DR recognition. With the proposed model, we achieve an accuracy of 97.41%, and a kappa statistic of 94.82 for DR identification and an accuracy of 81.7% and a kappa statistic of 71.1% for severity level prediction. Another interesting observation is that DNN with dropout at input layer converges more quickly when trained using blended features, compared to the same model trained using uni-modal deep features.

AB  - The paper proposes a method for improving the accuracy of early detection of cyber attacks with a small impact, in which the mathematical expectation is a fraction of the total, and the pulse repetition period is quite long. Early detection of attacks against telecommunication networks is based on traffic analysis using extreme filtering. The algorithm of fuzzy logic for deciding on the results of extreme filtering is suggested. The results of an experimental evaluation of the proposed method are presented. They demonstrate that the method is sensitive even with minor effects. In order to eliminate the redundancy of the analyzed parameters, it is enough to use the standard deviation and the correlation interval for decision making.

AB  - There are a number of significant changes taking place in modern city development and most of them are based on the number of recent technological progress. This paper provides a review and analysis of recent approaches of biotechnology that can find a place in today&rsquo;s cities and discusses how those technologies can be integrated into a city&rsquo;s Internet of Things (IoT). Firstly, several biotechnologies that focus on rain gardens, urban vertical farming systems, and city photobioreactors are discussed in the context of their integration in a city&rsquo;s IoT. The next possible application of biofuel cells to the sensor network&rsquo;s energy supply is discussed. It is shown that such devices can influence the low-power sensor network structure as an additional energy source for transmitters. This paper shows the possibility of bioelectrochemical biosensor applications, discusses self-powered biosensors, and shows that such a system can be widely applied to rainwater monitoring in rain gardens and green streets. Significant attention is paid to recent approaches in synthetic biology. Both cell-based biosensors and bioactuators with synthetic genetic circuits are discussed. The development of cell-based biosensors can significantly enhance the sensing possibilities of a city&rsquo;s IoT. We show the possible ways to develop cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with the systems mentioned above. Aspects of data handling for the discussed biotechnologies and the methods of intelligent systems, including those that are machine learning-based, applied to the IoT in a city are presented.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Borehole log is important data for urban geological 3D modeling. Most of the current borehole logs are stored in a papery form. The construction of a smart city puts forward requirements for the automatic and intelligent 3D modeling of urban geology. However, it is difficult to extract the information from the papery borehole log quickly. What is more, it is unreliable to rely entirely on automated algorithms for modeling without artificial participation, but there is no effective way to integrate geological knowledge into 3D geological modeling currently. Therefore, it is necessary to research how to use existing papery borehole logs efficiently. To overcome the above obstacles, we designed a method that combines structural analysis and layout understanding to extract information from the borehole log. Then, the knowledge-driven three-dimensional geological modeling is proposed based on dynamic profiles. With these methods, the papery borehole log can be converted into structured data which can be used for data analysis directly, and geological knowledge can be integrated into the process of 3D geological modeling. The 3D geological modeling of Xinyang City based on a papery borehole log has been taken as an example to verify the feasibility of the method.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 12
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Computer vision-based approaches are very useful for dynamic displacement measurement, damage detection, and structural health monitoring. However, for the application using a large number of existing cameras in buildings, the computational cost of videos from dozens of cameras using a centralized computer becomes a huge burden. Moreover, when a manual process is required for processing the videos, prompt safety assessment of tens of thousands of buildings after a catastrophic earthquake striking a megacity becomes very challenging. Therefore, a decentralized and fully automatic computer vision-based approach for prompt building safety assessment and decision-making is desired for practical applications. In this study, a prototype of a novel stand-alone smart camera system for measuring interstory drifts was developed. The proposed system is composed of a single camera, a single-board computer, and two accelerometers with a microcontroller unit. The system is capable of compensating for rotational effects of the camera during earthquake excitations. Furthermore, by fusing the camera-based interstory drifts with the accelerometer-based ones, the interstory drifts can be measured accurately even when residual interstory drifts exist. Algorithms used to compensate for the camera&rsquo;s rotational effects, algorithms used to track the movement of three targets within three regions of interest, artificial neural networks used to convert the interstory drifts to engineering units, and some necessary signal processing algorithms, including interpolation, cross-correlation, and filtering algorithms, were embedded in the smart camera system. As a result, online processing of the video data and acceleration data using decentralized computational resources is achieved in each individual smart camera system to obtain interstory drifts. Using the maximum interstory drifts measured during an earthquake, the safety of a building can be assessed right after the earthquake excitation. We validated the feasibility of the prototype of the proposed smart camera system through the use of large-scale shaking table tests of a steel building. The results show that the proposed smart camera system had very promising results in terms of assessing the safety of steel building specimens after earthquake excitations.

TI  - National-Scale Landslide Susceptibility Mapping in Austria Using Fuzzy Best-Worst Multi-Criteria Decision-Making

AB  - Landslides are one of the most detrimental geological disasters that intimidate human lives along with severe damages to infrastructures and they mostly occur in the mountainous regions across the globe. Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) serves as a key step in assessing potential areas that are prone to landslides and could have an impact on decreasing the possible damages. The application of the fuzzy best-worst multi-criteria decision-making (FBWM) method was applied for LSM in Austria. Further, the role of employing a few numbers of pairwise comparisons on LSM was investigated by comparing the FBWM and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP). For this study, a wide range of data was sourced from the Geological Survey of Austria, the Austrian Land Information System, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, and remotely sensed data were collected. We used nine conditioning factors that were based on the previous studies and geomorphological characteristics of Austria, such as elevation, slope, slope aspect, lithology, rainfall, land cover, distance to drainage, distance to roads, and distance to faults. Based on the evaluation of experts, the slope conditioning factor was chosen as the best criterion (highest impact on LSM) and the distance to roads was considered as the worst criterion (lowest impact on LSM). LSM was generated for the region based on the best and worst criterion. The findings show the robustness of FBWM in landslide susceptibility mapping. Additionally, using fewer pairwise comparisons revealed that the FBWM can obtain higher accuracy as compared to FAHP. The finding of this research can help authorities and decision-makers to provide effective strategies and plans for landslide prevention and mitigation at the national level.

AB  - This study aimed to develop a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) device and optimal control methods that increase the photovoltaic (PV) efficiency and visual comfort of the indoor space. A louver-type PV-integrated shading device was suggested and an artificial neural networks (ANN) model was developed to predict PV electricity output, work plane illuminance, and daylight glare index (DGI). The slat tilt angle of the shading device was controlled to maximize PV electricity output based on three different strategies: one without visual comfort constraints, and the other two with visual comfort constraints: work plane illuminance and DGI. Optimal tilt angle was calculated using predictions of the ANN. Experiments were conducted to verify the system modeling and to evaluate the performance of the shading device. Experiment results revealed that the ANN model successfully predicted the PV output, work plane illuminance, and DGI. The PV-integrated shading device was more efficient in producing electricity than the conventional wall-mount PV systems, the control method without visual comfort constraints was most efficient in generating electricity than the other two with such constraints, and excluding the constraints resulted in less comfortable visual environment and reduced energy benefit. From the results analysis, it can be concluded that based on the accurate predictions, the PV-integrated shading device controlled using the proposed methods produced more electricity compared to the wall-mount counterpart.

AB  - Detailed urban land use information is the prerequisite and foundation for implementing urban land policies and urban land development, and is of great importance for solving urban problems, assisting scientific and rational urban planning. The existing results of urban land use mapping have shortcomings in terms of accuracy or recognition scale, and it is difficult to meet the needs of fine urban management and smart city construction. This study aims to explore approaches that mapping urban land use based on multi-source data, to meet the needs of obtaining detailed land use information and, taking Lanzhou as an example, based on the previous study, we proposed a process of urban land use classification based on multi-source data. A combination road network dataset of Gaode and OpenStreetMap (OSM) was synthetically applied to divide urban parcels, while multi-source features using Sentinel-2A images, Sentinel-1A polarization data, night light data, point of interest (POI) data and other data. Simultaneously, a set of comparative experiments were designed to evaluate the contribution and impact of different features. The results showed that: (1) the combination utilization of Gaode and OSM road network could improve the classification results effectively. Specifically, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are 83.75% and 0.77 separately for level I and the accuracy of each type reaches more than 70% for level II; (2) the synthetic application of multi-source features is conducive to the improvement of urban land use classification; (3) Internet data, such as point of interest (POI) information and multi-time population information, contribute the most to urban land use mapping. Compared with single-moment population information, the multi-time population distribution makes more contributions to urban land use. The framework developed herein and the results derived therefrom may assist other cities in the detailed mapping and refined management of urban land use.

AB  - Neural machine translation is a prominent field in the computational linguistics domain. By leveraging the recent developments of deep learning, it gave birth to powerful algorithms for translating text from one language to another. This study aims to assess the feasibility of transferring the neural machine translation approach into a completely different context, namely human mobility and trajectory analysis. Building a conceptual parallelism between sentences (sequences of words) and motion traces (sequences of locations), we aspire to translate individual trajectories generated by a certain category of users into the corresponding mobility traces potentially generated by a different category of users. The experiment is inserted in the background of tourist mobility analysis, with the goal of translating the motion behavior of tourists belonging to a specific nationality into the motion behavior of tourists belonging to a different nationality. The model adopted is based on the seq2seq approach and consists of an encoder&ndash;decoder architecture based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks and neural embeddings. The encoder turns an input location sequence into a corresponding hidden vector; the decoder reverses the process, turning the vector into an output location sequence. The proposed framework, tested on a real-world large-scale dataset, explores an effective attempt of motion transformation between different entities, arising as a potentially powerful source of mobility information disclosure, especially in the context of crowd management and smart city services.

AB  - The power system worldwide is going through a revolutionary transformation due to the integration with various distributed components, including advanced metering infrastructure, communication infrastructure, distributed energy resources, and electric vehicles, to improve the reliability, energy efficiency, management, and security of the future power system. These components are becoming more tightly integrated with IoT. They are expected to generate a vast amount of data to support various applications in the smart grid, such as distributed energy management, generation forecasting, grid health monitoring, fault detection, home energy management, etc. With these new components and information, artificial intelligence techniques can be applied to automate and further improve the performance of the smart grid. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques to support various applications in a distributed smart grid. In particular, we discuss how artificial techniques are applied to support the integration of renewable energy resources, the integration of energy storage systems, demand response, management of the grid and home energy, and security. As the smart grid involves various actors, such as energy produces, markets, and consumers, we also discuss how artificial intelligence and market liberalization can potentially help to increase the overall social welfare of the grid. Finally, we provide further research challenges for large-scale integration and orchestration of automated distributed devices to realize a truly smart grid.

AB  - The growing trend in electrical vehicle (EV) deployment has transformed independent power network and transportation network studies into highly congested interdependent network performance evaluations assessing their impact on power and transportation systems. Electrified transportation is highly capable of intensifying the interdependent correlations across charging service, transportation, and power networks. However, the evaluation of the complex coupled relationship across charging services, transportation, and power networks poses several challenges, including an impact on charging scheduling, traffic congestion, charging loads on the power grid, and high costs. Therefore, this article presents comparative survey analytics of large-scale EV integration&rsquo;s impact on charging service network scheduling, transportation networks, and power networks. Moreover, price mechanism strategies to determine the charging fares, minimize investment profits, diminish traffic congestion, and reduce power distribution constraints under the influence of various factors were carried out. Additionally, the survey analysis stipulates the interdependent network performance index, ascertaining travel distance, route selection, long-term and short-term planning, and different infrastructure strategies. Finally, the limitations of the proposed study, potential research trends, and critical technologies are demonstrated for future inquiries.

AB  - The photovoltaic (PV) panel&rsquo;s output energy depends on many factors. As they are becoming the leading alternative energy source, it is essential to get the best out of them. Although the main factor for maximizing energy production is proportional to the amount of solar radiation reaching the photovoltaic panel surface, other factors, such as temperature and shading, influence them negatively. Moreover, being installed in a dynamic and frequently harsh environment causes a set of reasons for faults, defects, and irregular operations. Any irregular operation should be recognized and classified into faults that need attention and, therefore, maintenance or as being a regular operation due to changes in some surrounding factors, such as temperature or solar radiation. Besides, in case of faults, it would be helpful to identify the source and the cause of the problem. Hence, this study presented a novel methodology that modeled a PV system in a tree-like hierarchy, which allowed the use of a fuzzy nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) to detect and classify faults in a PV system with customizable granularity. Moreover, the used methodology enabled the identification of the exact source of fault(s) in a fully automated way. The study was done on a string of eight PV panels; however, the paper discussed using the algorithm on a more extensive PV system. The used fuzzy NARX algorithm in this study was able to classify the faults that appeared in up to five out of the eight PV panels and to identify the faulty PV panels with high accuracy. The used hardware could be controlled and monitored through a Wi-Fi connection, which added support for Internet of Things applications.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is one of the most important use cases related to smart cities. In addition to assisting traffic management authorities, traffic forecasting can help drivers to choose the best path to their destinations. Accurate traffic forecasting is a basic requirement for traffic management. We propose a traffic forecasting approach that utilizes air pollution and atmospheric parameters. Air pollution levels are often associated with traffic intensity, and much work is already available in which air pollution has been predicted using road traffic. However, to the best of our knowledge, an attempt to improve forecasting road traffic using air pollution and atmospheric parameters is not yet available in the literature. In our preliminary experiments, we found out the relation between traffic intensity, air pollution, and atmospheric parameters. Therefore, we believe that addition of air pollutants and atmospheric parameters can improve the traffic forecasting. Our method uses air pollution gases, including     C O , N O , N  O 2  , N  O x  ,     and     O 3    . We chose these gases because they are associated with road traffic. Some atmospheric parameters, including pressure, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed have also been considered, as these parameters can play an important role in the dispersion of the above-mentioned gases. Data related to traffic flow, air pollution, and the atmosphere were collected from the open data portal of Madrid, Spain. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) was used in this paper to perform traffic forecasting.

AB  - Currently, there is great interest in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels (and other non-renewable energy sources) in order to preserve the environment; smart buildings are commonly proposed for this purpose as they are capable of producing their own energy and using it optimally. However, at times, solar energy is not able to supply the energy demand fully; it is mandatory to know the quantity of energy needed to optimize the system. This research focuses on the prediction of output temperature from a solar thermal collector. The aim is to measure solar thermal energy and optimize the energy system of a house (or building). The dataset used in this research has been taken from a real installation in a bio-climate house located on the Sotavento Experimental Wind Farm, in north-west Spain. A hybrid intelligent model has been developed by combining clustering and regression methods such as neural networks, polynomial regression, and support vector machines. The main findings show that, by dividing the dataset into small clusters on the basis of similarity in behavior, it is possible to create more accurate models. Moreover, combining different regression methods for each cluster provides better results than when a global model of the whole dataset is used. In temperature prediction, mean absolute error was lower than 4      ∘    C.

AB  - Mobile edge computing (MEC) within 5G networks brings the power of cloud computing, storage, and analysis closer to the end user. The increased speeds and reduced delay enable novel applications such as connected vehicles, large-scale IoT, video streaming, and industry robotics. Machine Learning (ML) is leveraged within mobile edge computing to predict changes in demand based on cultural events, natural disasters, or daily commute patterns, and it prepares the network by automatically scaling up network resources as needed. Together, mobile edge computing and ML enable seamless automation of network management to reduce operational costs and enhance user experience. In this paper, we discuss the state of the art for ML within mobile edge computing and the advances needed in automating adaptive resource allocation, mobility modeling, security, and energy efficiency for 5G networks.

AB  - The 2020 collapse of the global economy due to the Covid-19 pandemic has enabled us to think about long term trends and what the future could hold for our cities and regions, especially due to the climate agenda. The paper sets out the historical precedents for economic transitions after collapses that unleash new technologically based innovation waves. These are shown to be associated with different energy and infrastructure priorities and their transport and resulting urban forms. The new technologies in the past were emerging but mainstreamed as the new economy was built on new investments. The paper suggests that the new economy, for the next 30 years, is likely to be driven by the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agendas (summarised as zero carbon–zero poverty) and will have a strong base in a cluster of innovative technologies: renewable energy, electromobility, smart cities, hydrogen-based industry, circular economy technologies, and biophilic urbanism. The first three are well underway, and the other three will need interventions if not cultural changes and may miss being mainstreamed in this recovery but could still play a minor role in the new economy. The resulting urban transformations are likely to build on Covid-19 through “global localism” and could lead to five new features: (1) relocalised centres with distributed infrastructure, (2) tailored innovations in each urban fabric, (3) less car dependence, (4) symbiotic partnerships for funding, and (5) rewritten manuals for urban professionals. This period needs human creativity to play a role in revitalising the human dimension of cities. The next wave following this may be more about regenerative development.

AB  - Plant stress is one of major issues that cause significant economic loss for growers. The labor-intensive conventional methods for identifying the stressed plants constrain their applications. To address this issue, rapid methods are in urgent needs. Developments of advanced sensing and machine learning techniques trigger revolutions for precision agriculture based on deep learning and big data. In this paper, we reviewed the latest deep learning approaches pertinent to the image analysis of crop stress diagnosis. We compiled the current sensor tools and deep learning principles involved in plant stress phenotyping. In addition, we reviewed a variety of deep learning applications/functions with plant stress imaging, including classification, object detection, and segmentation, of which are closely intertwined.

AB  - The concept of smart cities has become prominent in modern metropolises due to the emergence of embedded and connected smart devices, systems, and technologies. They have enabled the connection of every &ldquo;thing&rdquo; to the Internet. Therefore, in the upcoming era of the Internet of Things, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) will play a crucial role in newly developed smart cities. The IoV has the potential to solve various traffic and road safety problems effectively in order to prevent fatal crashes. However, a particular challenge in the IoV, especially in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications, is to ensure fast, secure transmission and accurate recording of the data. In order to overcome these challenges, this work is adapting Blockchain technology for real time application (RTA) to solve Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications problems. Therefore, the main novelty of this paper is to develop a Blockchain-based IoT system in order to establish secure communication and create an entirely decentralized cloud computing platform. Moreover, the authors qualitatively tested the performance and resilience of the proposed system against common security attacks. Computational tests showed that the proposed solution solved the main challenges of Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communications such as security, centralization, and lack of privacy. In addition, it guaranteed an easy data exchange between different actors of intelligent transportation systems.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Rights, legal regulations, and practices often arise from societal and scientific developments, and societal transformations may originate from new legal regulations as well. Basic rights can be re-defined with advancements in science and technology. In such an evolutional loop, where mutual supply is obvious, combined legal and technological frameworks should be exercised and developed for practicing human rights. The main aim of this article is to propose a conceptual and methodological framework for the improvement of disability rights in the light of recent advancements in geographic information science (GIScience), in particular for those with motor disabilities, for whom questions related to &ldquo;where&rdquo; are essential. The concept of disability is discussed, considering different aspects, and a new methodological framework is proposed in which Geographic Information Systems (GIS), volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizen science are at the core. In order to implement the framework at the national and international levels, a spatial data model should be developed first. The new data collection and interpretation approaches based on VGI, citizen science, and machine learning methods may help to realize equal rights for people with motor disabilities, by enabling improved access to education, health, and travel.

AB  - In recent years, security in urban areas has gradually assumed a central position, focusing increasing attention on citizens, institutions and political forces. Security problems have a different nature&mdash;to name a few, we can think of the problems deriving from citizens&rsquo; mobility, then move on to microcrime, and end up with the ever-present risk of terrorism. Equipping a smart city with an infrastructure of sensors capable of alerting security managers about a possible risk becomes crucial for the safety of citizens. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to manage citizens&rsquo; needs is now widespread, to highlight the possible risks to public safety. These risks were then increased using these devices to carry out terrorist attacks in various places around the world. Detecting the presence of drones is not a simple procedure given the small size and the presence of only rotating parts. This study presents the results of studies carried out on the detection of the presence of UAVs in outdoor/indoor urban sound environments. For the detection of UAVs, sensors capable of measuring the sound emitted by UAVs and algorithms based on deep neural networks capable of identifying their spectral signature that were used. The results obtained suggest the adoption of this methodology for improving the safety of smart cities.

VL  - 13

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In practical power system operation, knowing the voltage stability limits of the system is important. This paper proposes using a decision tree (DT) to extract guidelines through offline study results for assessing system voltage stability status online. Firstly, a sample set of DTs is determined offline by active power injection and bus voltage magnitude (P-V) curve analysis. Secondly, participation factor (PF) analysis and the Relief-F algorithm are used successively for attribute selection, which takes both the physical significance and the classification capabilities into consideration. Finally, the C4.5 algorithm is used to build the DT because it is more suitable for handling continuous variables. A practical power system is implemented to verify the feasibility of the proposed online voltage stability margin (VSM) assessment framework. Study results indicate that the operating guidelines extracted from the DT can help power system operators assess real time VSM effectively.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 15
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The scope of the present paper is to promote social, cultural and environmental sustainability in cities by establishing a conceptual framework and the relationship amongst safety in urban public space (UPS), lighting and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-based surveillance. This framework uses available technologies and tools, as these can be found in urban equipment such as lighting posts, to enhance security and safety in UPS, ensuring protection against attempted criminal activity. Through detailed literary research, publications on security and safety concerning crime and lighting can be divided into two periods, the first one pre-1994, and the second one from 2004&ndash;2008. Since then, a significant reduction in the number of publications dealing with lighting and crime is observed, while at the same time, the urban nightscape has been reshaped with the immersion of light-emitting diode (LED) technologies. Especially in the last decade, where most municipalities in the EU28 (European Union of all the member states from the accession of Croatia in 2013 to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020) are refurbishing their road lighting with LED technology and the consideration of smart networks and surveillance is under development, the use of lighting to deter possible attempted felonies in UPS is not addressed. To capitalize on the potential of lighting as a deterrent, this paper proposes a framework that uses existing technology, namely, dimmable LED light sources, presence sensors, security cameras, as well as emerging techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled image recognition algorithms and big data analytics and presents a possible system that could be developed as a stand-alone product to alert possible dangerous situations, deter criminal activity and promote the perception of safety thus linking lighting and ICT-based surveillance towards safety and security in UPS.

TI  - AI-Inspired Non-Terrestrial Networks for IIoT: Review on Enabling Technologies and Applications
T2  - IoT

PY  - 2020
VL  - 1

SN  - 2624-831X

AB  - During the last few years, various Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications have emerged with numerous network elements interconnected using wired and wireless communication technologies and equipped with strategically placed sensors and actuators. This paper justifies why non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) will bring the IIoT vision closer to reality by providing improved data acquisition and massive connectivity to sensor fields in large and remote areas. NTNs are engineered to utilize satellites, airships, and aircrafts, which can be employed to extend the radio coverage and provide remote monitoring and sensing services. Additionally, this paper describes indicative delay-tolerant massive IIoT and delay-sensitive mission-critical IIoT applications spanning a large number of vertical markets with diverse and stringent requirements. As the heterogeneous nature of NTNs and the complex and dynamic communications scenarios lead to uncertainty and a high degree of variability, conventional wireless communication technologies cannot sufficiently support ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) and offer ubiquitous and uninterrupted interconnectivity. In this regard, this paper sheds light on the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), in the provision of challenging NTN-based IIoT services and provides a thorough review of the relevant research works. By adding intelligence and facilitating the decision-making and prediction procedures, the NTNs can effectively adapt to their surrounding environment, thus enhancing the performance of various metrics with significantly lower complexity compared to typical optimization methods.

AB  - This paper addresses the voltage control problem in medium-voltage distribution networks. The objective is to cost-efficiently maintain the voltage profile within a safe range, in presence of uncertainties in both the future working conditions, as well as the physical parameters of the system. Indeed, the voltage profile depends not only on the fluctuating renewable-based power generation and load demand, but also on the physical parameters of the system components. In reality, the characteristics of loads, lines and transformers are subject to complex and dynamic dependencies, which are difficult to model. In such a context, the quality of the control strategy depends on the accuracy of the power flow representation, which requires to capture the non-linear behavior of the power network. Relying on the detailed analytical models (which are still subject to uncertainties) introduces a high computational power that does not comply with the real-time constraint of the voltage control task. To address this issue, while avoiding arbitrary modeling approximations, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning model to ensure an autonomous grid operational control. Outcomes show that the proposed model-free approach offers a promising alternative to find a compromise between calculation time, conservativeness and economic performance.

AB  - This paper presents the application of Internet of Things (IoT) Technology and Building Energy Management System (BEMS) within the Marylebone Campus of the University of Westminster, located in central London, to improve the environmental performance of the existing building as well as enhance the learning experience on energy and sustainability. Sixty IoT sensors connected to minicomputers were planned to be deployed within three floors of the building to continuously measure the real-time environmental parameters, such as dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, illuminance level, carbon dioxide, and sound levels. Experimental workshops were also arranged with undergraduate and post-graduate students at their classrooms using IoT sensors, portable Bluetooth sensors and online questionnaires to increase awareness of the effect of environmental and behavioural changes on energy saving through real-time visualisation. Users&rsquo; subjective feedback on their workplace was also collected through Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) questionnaire surveys. The results show the effectiveness of IoT systems and BEMS in supplying the building users and management with high-resolution, low-cost data acquisition systems highlighting the existing challenges and future scopes. The study also documents the process and the improvement in students&rsquo; awareness of environmental and energy performance of their building through IoT data visualizations and POE.

With this index, the precise choice of various parameters is possible. Moreover, we determined the best resolution of the analysis window, which is much lower than the initial window. By such means, we can speed-up the processing (i.e., reduce the classification time by 74%). There are cases in which we increased both the processing speed and the classification accuracy. We made experiments with various baseline detectors and datasets in order to confirm versatility of the proposed ideas. The analyzed classifiers are those typically applied to detection of pedestrians, namely: aggregated channel feature (ACF), deep convolutional neural network (CNN), and support vector machine (SVM). We used a suite of five precisely chosen night (and day) IR vision datasets.

AB  - With the rapid development and popularization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, an increasing number of cyber-attacks are targeting such devices. It was said that most of the attacks in IoT environments are botnet-based attacks. Many security weaknesses still exist on the IoT devices because most of them have not enough memory and computational resource for robust security mechanisms. Moreover, many existing rule-based detection systems can be circumvented by attackers. In this study, we proposed a machine learning (ML)-based botnet attack detection framework with sequential detection architecture. An efficient feature selection approach is adopted to implement a lightweight detection system with a high performance. The overall detection performance achieves around 99% for the botnet attack detection using three different ML algorithms, including artificial neural network (ANN), J48 decision tree, and Na&iuml;ve Bayes. The experiment result indicates that the proposed architecture can effectively detect botnet-based attacks, and also can be extended with corresponding sub-engines for new kinds of attacks.

AB  - Amid growing demand for solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, the output from PV panels/cells fails to deliver maximum power to the load, due to the intermittency of ambient conditions. Therefore, utilizing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) becomes essential for PV systems. In this paper, a novel internet of things (IoT)-equipped MPPT solar charge controller (SCC) is designed and implemented. The proposed circuit system utilizes IoT-based sensors to send vital data to the cloud for remote monitoring and controlling purposes. The IoT platform helps the system to be monitored remotely. The PIC16F877A is used as a main controller of the proposed MPPT-SCC besides implementing the perturb and observe (P&amp;O) technique and a customized buck&ndash;boost converter. To validate the proposed system, both simulation and hardware implementation are carried out by the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and laboratory set up, respectively. The proposed MPPT-SCC can handle the maximum current of 10 A at 12 V voltage. Results show that the efficiency of the proposed system reaches up to 99.74% during a month of performance testing duration.

The first stage of the proposed methodology is EDA with already available indicators (e.g., the number of stations and passengers), and suggested indicators (e.g., weekly frequencies, link occupancy rates, and CO2 footprint per journey) to directly characterize the efficiency and sustainability of this transport mode. The second stage is to assess the efficiency of URT with two original models, based on a thorough selection of input and output variables, which is one of the key contributions of EDA to this methodology. The first model compares URT against other urban transport modes, applicable to route personalization, and the second scores the efficiency of URT lines. The main outcome of this paper is the proposed methodology, which has been experimentally validated using open data from the Transport for London (TfL) URT network and additional sources.

AB  - With the increasing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, the cyber security of these platforms is a highly active area of research. One key technology underpinning smart IoT systems is machine learning, which classifies and predicts events from large-scale data in IoT networks. Machine learning is susceptible to cyber attacks, particularly data poisoning attacks that inject false data when training machine learning models. Data poisoning attacks degrade the performances of machine learning models. It is an ongoing research challenge to develop trustworthy machine learning models resilient and sustainable against data poisoning attacks in IoT networks. We studied the effects of data poisoning attacks on machine learning models, including the gradient boosting machine, random forest, naive Bayes, and feed-forward deep learning, to determine the levels to which the models should be trusted and said to be reliable in real-world IoT settings. In the training phase, a label modification function is developed to manipulate legitimate input classes. The function is employed at data poisoning rates of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30% that allow the comparison of the poisoned models and display their performance degradations. The machine learning models have been evaluated using the ToN_IoT and UNSW NB-15 datasets, as they include a wide variety of recent legitimate and attack vectors. The experimental results revealed that the models&rsquo; performances will be degraded, in terms of accuracy and detection rates, if the number of the trained normal observations is not significantly larger than the poisoned data. At the rate of data poisoning of 30% or greater on input data, machine learning performances are significantly degraded.

AB  - Peak-load forecasting prevents energy waste and helps with environmental issues by establishing plans for the use of renewable energy. For that reason, the subject is still actively studied. Most of these studies are focused on improving predictive performance by using varying feature information, but most small industrial facilities cannot provide such information because of a lack of infrastructure. Therefore, we introduce a series of studies to implement a generalized prediction model that is applicable to these small industrial facilities. On the basis of the pattern of load information of most industrial facilities, new features were selected, and a generalized model was developed through the aggregation of ensemble models. In addition, a new method is proposed to improve prediction performance by providing additional compensation to the prediction results by reflecting the fewest opinions among the prediction results of each model. Actual data from two small industrial facilities were applied to our process, and the results proved the effectiveness of our proposed method.

For example, applications like Google Street View can be used for Internet publicity and when detecting these ads panels in images, it could be possible to replace the publicity appearing inside the panels by another from a funding company. In our experiments, both SSD and YOLO detectors have produced acceptable results under variable sizes of panels, illumination conditions, viewing perspectives, partial occlusion of panels, complex background and multiple panels in scenes. Due to the difficulty of finding annotated images for the considered problem, we created our own dataset for conducting the experiments. The major strength of the SSD model was the almost elimination of False Positive (FP) cases, situation that is preferable when the publicity contained inside the panel is analyzed after detecting them. On the other side, YOLO produced better panel localization results detecting a higher number of True Positive (TP) panels with a higher accuracy. Finally, a comparison of the two analyzed object detection models with different types of semantic segmentation networks and using the same evaluation metrics is also included.

AB  - Human identity recognition has a wide range of application scenarios and a large number of application requirements. In recent years, the technology of collecting human biometrics through sensors for identification has become mature, but this kind of method needs additional equipment as assistance, which cannot be well applied to some scenarios. Using Wi-Fi for identity recognition has many advantages, such as no additional equipment as assistance, not affected by temperature, humidity, weather, light, and so on, so it has become a hot topic of research. The methods of individual identity recognition have been more mature; for example, gait information can be extracted as features. However, it is difficult to identify small-scale (2&ndash;5) group personnel at one time, and the tasks of fingerprint storage and classification are complex. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed a method of using the random forest as a fingerprint database classifier. The method is divided into two stages: the offline stage trains the random forest classifier through the collected training data set. In the online phase, the real-time data collected are input into the classifier to get the results. When extracting channel state information (CSI) features, multiple people are regarded as a whole to reduce the difficulty of feature selection. The use of random forest classifier in classification can give full play to the advantages of random forest, which can deal with a large number of multi-dimensional data and is easy to generalize. Experiments showed that WiGId has good recognition performance in both LOS (line of sight) and N LOS (None line of sight) environments.

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Situated in the main tracks of typhoons in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean, Taiwan frequently encounters disasters from heavy rainfall during typhoons. Accurate and timely typhoon rainfall prediction is an imperative topic that must be addressed. The purpose of this study was to develop a Hadoop Spark distribute framework based on big-data technology, to accelerate the computation of typhoon rainfall prediction models. This study used deep neural networks (DNNs) and multiple linear regressions (MLRs) in machine learning, to establish rainfall prediction models and evaluate rainfall prediction accuracy. The Hadoop Spark distributed cluster-computing framework was the big-data technology used. The Hadoop Spark framework consisted of the Hadoop Distributed File System, MapReduce framework, and Spark, which was used as a new-generation technology to improve the efficiency of the distributed computing. The research area was Northern Taiwan, which contains four surface observation stations as the experimental sites. This study collected 271 typhoon events (from 1961 to 2017). The following results were obtained: (1) in machine-learning computation, prediction errors increased with prediction duration in the DNN and MLR models; and (2) the system of Hadoop Spark framework was faster than the standalone systems (single I7 central processing unit (CPU) and single E3 CPU). When complex computation is required in a model (e.g., DNN model parameter calibration), the big-data-based Hadoop Spark framework can be used to establish highly efficient computation environments. In summary, this study successfully used the big-data Hadoop Spark framework with machine learning, to develop rainfall prediction models with effectively improved computing efficiency. Therefore, the proposed system can solve problems regarding real-time typhoon rainfall prediction with high timeliness and accuracy.

AB  - Data are essential to urban building energy models and yet, obtaining sufficient and accurate building data at a large-scale is challenging. Previous studies have highlighted that the data impact on urban case studies has not been sufficiently discussed. This paper addresses this gap by providing an analysis of the impact of input data on building energy modelling at an urban scale. The paper proposes a joint review of data impact and data accessibility to identify areas where future survey efforts should be concentrated. Moreover, a Morris sensitivity analysis is carried out on a large-scale residential case study, to rank input parameters by impact on space heating demand. This paper shows that accessible data impact the whole modelling process, from approach selection to model replicability. The sensitivity analysis shows that the setpoint and thermal characteristics were the most impactful for the case study considered. Solutions proposed to overcome availability and accessibility issues include organising annual workshops between data users and data owners, or developing online databases that could be populated on a volunteer-basis by data owners. Overall, overcoming data challenges is essential for the transition towards smarter cities, and will require an improved communication between all city stakeholders.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), pulse diagnosis is one of the most important methods for diagnosis. A pulse can be felt by applying firm fingertip pressure to the skin where the arteries travel. The pulse diagnosis has become an important tool not only for TCM practitioners but also for several areas of Western medicine. Many pulse measuring devices have been proposed to obtain objective pulse conditions. In the past, pulse diagnosis instruments were single-point sensing methods, which missed a lot of information. Later, multi-point sensing instruments were developed that resolved this issue but were much higher in cost and lacked mobility. In this article, based on the concept of sensor fusion, we describe a portable low-cost system for TCM pulse-type estimation using a smartphone connected to two sensors, including one photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and one galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor. As a proof of concept, we collected five-minute PPG pulse information and skin impedance on 24 acupoints from 80 subjects. Based on these collected data, we implemented a fully connected neural network (FCN), which was able to provide high prediction accuracy (&gt;90%) for patients with a TCM wiry pulse.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Railway turnout system is a key infrastructure to railway safety and efficiency. However, it is prone to failure in the field. Therefore, many railway departments have adopted a monitoring system to monitor the operation status of turnouts. With monitoring data collected, many researchers have proposed different fault-diagnosis methods. However, many of the existing methods cannot realize real-time updating or deal with new fault types. This paper—based on imbalanced data—proposes a Bayes-based online turnout fault-diagnosis method, which realizes incremental learning and scalable fault recognition. First, the basic conceptions of the turnout system are introduced. Next, the feature extraction and processing of the imbalanced monitoring data are introduced. Then, an online diagnosis method based on Bayesian incremental learning and scalable fault recognition is proposed, followed by the experiment with filed data from Guangzhou Railway. The results show that the scalable fault-recognition method can reach an accuracy of 99.11%, and the training time of the Bayesian incremental learning model reduces 29.97% without decreasing the accuracy, which demonstrates the high accuracy, adaptability and efficiency of the proposed model, of great significance for labor-saving, timely maintenance and further, safety and efficiency of railway transportation.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - The modern planning and management of urban spaces is an essential topic for smart cities and depends on up-to-date and reliable information on land use and the functional roles of the places that integrate urban areas. In the last few years, driven by the increased availability of geo-referenced data from social media, embedded sensors, and remote sensing images, various techniques have become popular for land use analysis. In this paper, we first highlight and discuss the different data types and methods usually adopted in this context, as well as their purposes. Then, based on a systematic state-of-the-art study, we focused on exploring the potential of points of interest (POIs) for land use classification, as one of the most common categories of crowdsourced data. We developed an application to automatically collect POIs for the study area, creating a dataset that was used to generate a large number of features. We used a ranking technique to select, among them, the most suitable features for classifying land use. As ground truth data, we used CORINE Land Cover (CLC), which is a solid and reliable dataset available for the whole European territory. It was used an artificial neural network (ANN) in different scenarios and our results reveal values of more than 90% for the accuracy and F-score in one experiment performed. Our analysis suggests that POI data have promising potential to characterize geographic spaces. The work described here aims to provide an alternative to the current methodologies for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, which are usually time-consuming and depend on expensive data types.

AB  - Traffic monitoring from closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras on embedded systems is the subject of the performed experiments. Solving this problem encounters difficulties related to the hardware limitations, and possible camera placement in various positions which affects the system performance. To satisfy the hardware requirements, vehicle detection is performed using a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), named SqueezeDet, while, for tracking, the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm is applied, allowing for real-time processing on an NVIDIA Jetson Tx2. To allow for adaptation of the system to the deployment environment, a procedure was implemented leading to generating labels in an unsupervised manner with the help of background modelling and the tracking algorithm. The acquired labels are further used for fine-tuning the model, resulting in a meaningful increase in the traffic estimation accuracy, and moreover, adding only minimal human effort to the process allows for further accuracy improvement. The proposed methods, and the results of experiments organised under real-world test conditions are presented in the paper.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This pilot study focuses on the design, implementation, optimization and verification of a novel solution of smart measuring of water consumption and crisis detection leading to a smart water management platform. The system implemented consists of a modular IoT platform based on a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design using the M2.COM standard, a LoraWAN modem and a LoraWAN gateway based on the Raspberry Pi platform. The prototype is modular, low-cost, low-power, low-complex and it fully reflects the requirements of strategic technological concepts of Smart City and Industry 4.0, i.e., data integration, interoperability, (I)IoT, etc. The study was produced in cooperation with M.I.S Protivanov and VODARENSKA AKCIOVA SPOLECNOST, a.s. (industry partners distributing drinking water in the Olomouc and South-Moravian regions) to depict the current situation in the Czech Republic, characterized by extreme weather fluctuations and increasingly frequent periods of drought. These drinking water distributors are also constantly placing new demands on these smart solutions. These requirements include, above all, reliability of data transmission, modularity and, last but not least, low cost. However, smart water management (water consumption, distribution, system identification, equipment maintenance, etc.) is becoming an important topic worldwide. The functionality of the system was first verified in laboratory conditions and, then, in real operation. The study also includes checking signal propagation in the municipal area of the village of Zdarna, where the radius of the proposed measuring system was tested. A laboratory test with simulation of water leakage is also part of this work. Subsequently, the system was tested in a residential unit by means of water leakage detection using the MNF method (minimum night flow); the detection success rate was 95%.

AB  - One of the models in the literature for modeling the behavior of the brain is the Bayesian attractor model, which is a kind of machine-learning algorithm. According to this model, the brain assigns stochastic variables to possible decisions (attractors) and chooses one of them when enough evidence is collected from sensory systems to achieve a confidence level high enough to make a decision. In this paper, we introduce a software defined networking (SDN) application based on a brain-inspired Bayesian attractor model for identification of the current traffic pattern for the supervision and automation of Internet of things (IoT) networks that exhibit a limited number of traffic patterns. In a real SDN testbed, we demonstrate that our SDN application can identify the traffic patterns using a limited set of fluctuating network statistics of edge link utilization. Moreover, we show that our application can improve core link utilization and the power efficiency of IoT networks by immediately applying a pre-calculated network configuration optimized by traffic engineering with network slicing for the identified pattern.

AB  - Following the significant improvement of technology in terms of data collection and treatment during the last decades, the notion of a smart environment has widely taken an important pedestal in the science industry. Built in order to better manage assets, smart environments provide a livable environment for users or citizens through the deployment of sensors responsible for data collection. Much research has been done to provide security to the involved data, which are extremely sensitive. However, due to the small size and the memory constraint of the sensors, many of these works are difficult to implement. In this paper, a different concept for wireless sensor security in smart environments is presented. The proposed security system, which is based on the scaler distribution of a novel electronic device, the intrusion detection system (IDS), reduces the computational functions of the sensors and therefore maximizes their efficiency. The IDS also introduces the concept of the feedback signal and &ldquo;trust table&rdquo; used to trigger the detection and isolation mechanism in case of attacks. Generally, it ensures the whole network security through cooperation with other IDSs and, therefore, eliminates the problem of security holes that may occur while adopting such a security technique.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 17
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In addition to air pollution, environmental noise has become one of the major hazards for citizens, being Road Traffic Noise (RTN) as its main source in urban areas. Recently, low-cost Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASNs) have become an alternative to traditional strategic noise mapping in cities. In order to monitor RTN solely, WASN-based approaches should automatize the off-line removal of those events unrelated to regular road traffic (e.g., sirens, airplanes, trams, etc.). Within the LIFE DYNAMAP project, 15 urban Anomalous Noise Events (ANEs) were described through an expert-based recording campaign. However, that work only focused on the overall analysis of the events gathered during non-sequential diurnal periods. As a step forward to characterize the temporal and local particularities of urban ANEs in real acoustic environments, this work analyses their distribution between day (06:00&ndash;22:00) and night (22:00&ndash;06:00) in narrow (1 lane) and wide (more than 1 lane) streets. The study is developed on a manually-labelled 151-h acoustic database obtained from the 24-nodes WASN deployed across DYNAMAP&rsquo;s Milan pilot area during a weekday and a weekend day. Results confirm the unbalanced nature of the problem (RTN represents 83.5% of the data), while identifying 26 ANE subcategories mainly derived from pedestrians, animals, transports and industry. Their presence depends more significantly on the time period than on the street type, as most events have been observed in the day-time during the weekday, despite being especially present in narrow streets. Moreover, although ANEs show quite similar median durations regardless of time and location in general terms, they usually present higher median signal-to-noise ratios at night, mainly on the weekend, which becomes especially relevant for the WASN-based computation of equivalent RTN levels.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The identification of roof surfaces is characterized by a sequence of several processing steps. The boundary detection of different types of roof is realized from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) cloud points and can confirm the real boundary of the roof. In the process of processing LiDAR data, shortcomings have been found regarding the inappropriate classification of points (class 6 &ldquo;buildings&rdquo;) concerning the roofs (the points of the building facade were marked as outliers and reclassified). In cases of insufficient point density, there is a problem with not being able to capture either the roof boundary or small roof objects, along with the possible occurrence of gaps inside the roof areas. This study proposes a processing procedure in a geographic information system (GIS) environment that advocates the identification of roof surfaces based on the LiDAR point cloud. We created the contours of a roof surface boundary with a simplified regular shape. From 824 roofs in the studied area, six different types of roof were selected, which this study presents in detail. The expected result of the study is the generation of segments inside the roof boundary. The study also includes the visualization of the outcomes of the spatial analyses of the identified roof surfaces, which forms the basis for determining the potential of solar systems with respect to green roofs for the development of smart city buildings.

SN  - 2227-9032

AB  - Disease classification based on machine learning has become a crucial research topic in the fields of genetics and molecular biology. Generally, disease classification involves a supervised learning style; i.e., it requires a large number of labelled samples to achieve good classification performance. However, in the majority of the cases, labelled samples are hard to obtain, so the amount of training data are limited. However, many unclassified (unlabelled) sequences have been deposited in public databases, which may help the training procedure. This method is called semi-supervised learning and is very useful in many applications. Self-training can be implemented using high- to low-confidence samples to prevent noisy samples from affecting the robustness of semi-supervised learning in the training process. The deep forest method with the hyperparameter settings used in this paper can achieve excellent performance. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel combined deep learning model and semi-supervised learning with self-training approach to improve the performance in disease classification, which utilizes unlabelled samples to update a mechanism designed to increase the number of high-confidence pseudo-labelled samples. The experimental results show that our proposed model can achieve good performance in disease classification and disease-causing gene identification.

SN  - 1999-4893

AB  - This last decade, the amount of data exchanged on the Internet increased by over a staggering factor of 100, and is expected to exceed well over the 500 exabytes by 2020. This phenomenon is mainly due to the evolution of high-speed broadband Internet and, more specifically, the popularization and wide spread use of smartphones and associated accessible data plans. Although 4G with its long-term evolution (LTE) technology is seen as a mature technology, there is continual improvement to its radio technology and architecture such as in the scope of the LTE Advanced standard, a major enhancement of LTE. However, for the long run, the next generation of telecommunication (5G) is considered and is gaining considerable momentum from both industry and researchers. In addition, with the deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, smart cities, vehicular networks, e-health systems, and Industry 4.0, a new plethora of 5G services has emerged with very diverging and technologically challenging design requirements. These include high mobile data volume per area, high number of devices connected per area, high data rates, longer battery life for low-power devices, and reduced end-to-end latency. Several technologies are being developed to meet these new requirements, and each of these technologies brings its own design issues and challenges. In this context, deep learning models could be seen as one of the main tools that can be used to process monitoring data and automate decisions. As these models are able to extract relevant features from raw data (images, texts, and other types of unstructured data), the integration between 5G and DL looks promising and one that requires exploring. As main contribution, this paper presents a systematic review about how DL is being applied to solve some 5G issues. Differently from the current literature, we examine data from the last decade and the works that address diverse 5G specific problems, such as physical medium state estimation, network traffic prediction, user device location prediction, self network management, among others. We also discuss the main research challenges when using deep learning models in 5G scenarios and identify several issues that deserve further consideration.

T2  - CivilEng

PY  - 2020
VL  - 1
IS  - 2
SN  - 2673-4109

AB  - For an effective risk management of complex buildings it is required to dynamically estimate the risk on the service and take proper responsive measures to contrast it. This implies being able to estimate the evolving probabilities of failures over time and the way their occurrence is trust in affecting the service. This is now possible thanks to the advent of new sensing technologies and data-driven models to estimate failure probabilities, as well as solid risk management methodologies to estimate their effect on the service. However, it needs to be considered that the implementation of a dynamic risk management in standard building operation has to consider the reconfiguration of some processes to include the use of enabling technologies. In this paper a new dynamic risk management methodology is proposed to consistently (i) model the service, estimate the risk, first (ii) statically, using fault tree analysis, and then (iii) dynamically, using sensing technologies for data gathering and data-driven models for dynamic probability estimate, and finally (iv) implement the required intervention measures to minimize the risk. Then an application of the methodology is presented, for the risk management of an air handling unit, using a convolutional neural network, and its outcomes discussed. Conclusions are also drawn on the implications of integrating such a methodology in the current whole building risk management process and several outlooks are proposed.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Recent advances in particle sensor technologies have led to an increased development and utilization of low-cost, compact, particulate matter (PM) monitors. These devices can be deployed in dense monitoring networks, enabling an improved characterization of the spatiotemporal variability in ambient levels and exposure. However, the reliability of their measurements is an important prerequisite, necessitating rigorous performance evaluation and calibration in comparison to reference-grade instrumentation. In this study, field evaluation of Purple Air PA-II devices (low-cost PM sensors) is performed in two urban environments and across three seasons in Greece, in comparison to different types of reference instruments. Measurements were conducted in Athens (the largest city in Greece with nearly four-million inhabitants) for five months spanning over the summer of 2019 and winter/spring of 2020 and in Ioannina, a medium-sized city in northwestern Greece (100,000 inhabitants) during winter/spring 2019–2020. The PM2.5 sensor output correlates strongly with reference measurements (R2 = 0.87 against a beta attenuation monitor and R2 = 0.98 against an optical reference-grade monitor). Deviations in the sensor-reference agreement are identified as mainly related to elevated coarse particle concentrations and high ambient relative humidity. Simple and multiple regression models are tested to compensate for these biases, drastically improving the sensor’s response. Large decreases in sensor error are observed after implementation of models, leading to mean absolute percentage errors of 0.18 and 0.12 for the Athens and Ioannina datasets, respectively. Overall, a quality-controlled and robustly evaluated low-cost network can be an integral component for air quality monitoring in a smart city. Case studies are presented along this line, where a network of PA-II devices is used to monitor the air quality deterioration during a peri-urban forest fire event affecting the area of Athens and during extreme wintertime smog events in Ioannina, related to wood burning for residential heating.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - A simplified algorithm using an artificial neural network (ANN, a feed-forward neural network) for the assessment of the predicted mean vote (PMV) index in summertime was developed, using solely three input variables (namely the indoor air temperature, relative humidity, and clothing insulation), whilst low air speed (&lt;0.1 m/s), a minimal variation of radiant temperature (25.1 &deg;C &plusmn; 2 &deg;C) and steady metabolism (1.2 Met) were considered. Sensitivity analysis to the number of variables and to the number of neurons were performed. The developed ANN was then compared with three proven methods used for thermal comfort prediction: (i) the International Standard; (ii) the Rohles model; (iii) the modified Rohles model. Finally, another network able to predict the indoor thermal conditions was considered: the combined calculation of the two networks was tested for the PMV prediction. The proposed algorithm allows one to better approximate the PMV index than the other models (mean error of ANN predominantly in &plusmn;0.10&ndash;&plusmn;0.20 range). The accuracy of the network in PMV prediction increases when air temperature and relative humidity values fall into 21&ndash;28 &deg;C and 30&ndash;75% ranges. When the PMV is predicted by using the combined calculation (i.e., by using the two networks), the same order of magnitude of error was found, confirming the reliability of the networks. The developed ANN could be considered as an alternative method for the simplified prediction of PMV; moreover, the new simplified algorithm can be useful in buildings&rsquo; design phase, i.e., in those cases where experimental data are not available.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 17
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Despite recent advances in technologies for intelligent transportation systems, the safety of intersection traffic is still threatened by traffic signal violation, called the Red Light Runner (RLR). The conventional approach to ensure the intersection safety under the threat of an RLR is to extend the length of the all-red signal when an RLR is detected. Therefore, the selection of all-red signal length is an important factor for intersection safety as well as traffic efficiency. In this paper, for better safety and efficiency of intersection traffic, we propose a framework for dynamic all-red signal control that adjusts the length of all-red signal time according to the driving characteristics of the detected RLR. In this work, we define RLRs into four different classes based on the clustering results using the Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) and the Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA). The proposed system uses a Multi-Channel Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MC-DCNN) for online detection of RLR and also classification of RLR class. For dynamic all-red signal control, the proposed system uses a multi-level regression model to estimate the necessary all-red signal extension time more accurately and hence improves the overall intersection traffic safety as well as efficiency.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) are one of a prominent solution for the sustainability issues needing dire attention like global warming, depleting fossil fuel reserves, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Conversely, EVs are shown to emit higher emissions (measured from source to tailpipe) for the fossil fuel-based countries, which necessitates renewable energy sources (RES) for maximizing EV benefits. EVs can also act as a storage system, to mitigate the challenges associated with RES and to provide the grid with ancillary services, such as voltage regulation, frequency regulation, spinning reserve, etc. For extracting maximum benefits from EVs and minimizing the associated impact on the distribution network, modelling optimal integration of EVs in the network is required. This paper focuses on reviewing the state-of-the-art literature on the modelling of grid-connected EV-PV (photovoltaics) system. Further, the paper evaluates the uncertainty modelling methods associated with various parameters related to the grid-connected EV-PV system. Finally, the review is concluded with a summary of potential research directions in this area. The paper presents an evaluation of different modelling components of grid-connected EV-PV system to facilitate readers in modelling such system for researching EV-PV integration in the distribution network.

AB  - Many low-cost sensors (LCSs) are distributed for air monitoring without any rigorous calibrations. This work applies machine learning with PM2.5 from Taiwan monitoring stations to conduct in-field corrections on a network of 39 PM2.5 LCSs from July 2017 to December 2018. Three candidate models were evaluated: Multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). The model-corrected PM2.5 levels were compared with those of GRIMM-calibrated PM2.5. RFR was superior to MLR and SVR in its correction accuracy and computing efficiency. Compared to SVR, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of RFR were 35% and 85% lower for the training and validation sets, respectively, and the computational speed was 35 times faster. An RFR with 300 decision trees was chosen as the optimal setting considering both the correction performance and the modeling time. An RFR with a nighttime pattern was established as the optimal correction model, and the RMSEs were 5.9 &plusmn; 2.0 &mu;g/m3, reduced from 18.4 &plusmn; 6.5 &mu;g/m3 before correction. This is the first work to correct LCSs at locations without monitoring stations, validated using laboratory-calibrated data. Similar models could be established in other countries to greatly enhance the usefulness of their PM2.5 sensor networks.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of modern research related to potential threats in a vehicle cabin, which is based on situation monitoring during vehicle control and the interaction of the driver with intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In the modern world, such systems enable the detection of potentially dangerous situations on the road, reducing accident probability. However, at the same time, such systems increase vulnerabilities in vehicles and can be sources of different threats. In this paper, we consider the primary information flows between the driver, vehicle, and infrastructure in modern ITS, and identify possible threats related to these entities. We define threat classes related to vehicle control and discuss which of them can be detected by smartphone sensors. We present a case study that supports our findings and shows the main use cases for threat identification using smartphone sensors: Drowsiness, distraction, unfastened belt, eating, drinking, and smartphone use.

AB  - Methods used to evaluate the impact of Intelligent Transport System (ITS) services on road safety are usually based on expert assessments or statistical studies. However, commonly used methods are challenging to apply in the planning process of ITS services. This paper presents the methodology of research using surrogate safety measures calculated and calibrated with the use of simulation techniques and a driving simulator. This approach supports the choice of the type of ITS services that are beneficial for traffic efficiency and road safety. This paper presents results of research on the influence of selected scenarios of variable speed limits on the efficiency and safety of traffic on the sections of motorways and expressways in various traffic conditions. The driving simulator was used to estimate the efficiency of lane-keeping by the driver. The simulation traffic models were calibrated using driving simulator data and roadside sensor data. The traffic models made it possible to determine surrogate safety measures (number of conflicts and their severity) in selected scenarios of using ITS services. The presented studies confirmed the positive impact of Variable Speed Limits (VSLs) on the level of road safety and traffic efficiency. This paper also presents recommendations and plans for further research in this area.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, increasing image data comes from various sensors, and object detection plays a vital role in image understanding. For object detection in complex scenes, more detailed information in the image should be obtained to improve the accuracy of detection task. In this paper, we propose an object detection algorithm by jointing semantic segmentation (SSOD) for images. First, we construct a feature extraction network that integrates the hourglass structure network with the attention mechanism layer to extract and fuse multi-scale features to generate high-level features with rich semantic information. Second, the semantic segmentation task is used as an auxiliary task to allow the algorithm to perform multi-task learning. Finally, multi-scale features are used to predict the location and category of the object. The experimental results show that our algorithm substantially enhances object detection performance and consistently outperforms other three comparison algorithms, and the detection speed can reach real-time, which can be used for real-time detection.

AB  - The smart devices in Internet of Things (IoT) need more effective data storage opportunities, as well as support for Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods such as neural networks (NNs). This study presents a design of new associative memory in the form of impulsive Hopfield network based on leaky integrated-and-fire (LIF) RC oscillators with frequency control and hybrid analog&ndash;digital coding. Two variants of the network schemes have been developed, where spiking frequencies of oscillators are controlled either by supply currents or by variable resistances. The principle of operation of impulsive networks based on these schemes is presented and the recognition dynamics using simple two-dimensional images in gray gradation as an example is analyzed. A fast digital recognition method is proposed that uses the thresholds of zero crossing of output voltages of neurons. The time scale of this method is compared with the execution time of some network algorithms on IoT devices for moderate data amounts. The proposed Hopfield algorithm uses rate coding to expand the capabilities of neuromorphic engineering, including the design of new hardware circuits of IoT.

This is especially important for low-cost and low-power designs, for example Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWan)-based IoT systems, where data volume and frequency are constrained by the protocols. This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach using Laplacian scores to discover which types of sensors can be reduced, without compromising the decision-making. Here, a type of sensor is a feature. An IoT system is designed and implemented for a plant-monitoring scenario. We have collected data and carried out the Laplacian scores. The analytical results help choose the most important feature. A comparative study has shown that using fewer types of sensors, the accuracy of decision-making remains at a satisfactory level.

AB  - &lsquo;El Diario de Ju&aacute;rez&rsquo; is a local newspaper in a city of 1.5 million Spanish-speaking inhabitants that publishes texts of which citizens read them on both a website and an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) service. This research applies natural-language-processing and machine-learning algorithms to the news provided by the RSS service in order to classify them based on whether they are about a traffic incident or not, with the final intention of notifying citizens where such accidents occur. The classification process explores the bag-of-words technique with five learners (Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Na&iuml;ve Bayes, kNN, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) on a class-imbalanced benchmark; this challenging issue is dealt with via five sampling algorithms: synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), borderline SMOTE, adaptive synthetic sampling, random oversampling, and random undersampling. Consequently, our final classifier reaches a sensitivity of 0.86 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.86, which is an acceptable performance when considering the complexity of analyzing unstructured texts in Spanish.

AB  - Higher education institution campuses have been growing in size to become small cities that encompass all the infrastructures and offer many services to the university community. In order to achieve sustainable growth, it is necessary to take into account different environmental aspects, including the acoustic environment. In this paper, the application of a wireless acoustic sensor network is proposed for the long-term analysis of psychoacoustic parameters of the acoustic environment in a university campus. A network of acoustic nodes is designed and four nodes are deployed at both indoor and outdoor locations of the campus for environmental noise monitoring. A measurement campaign has been running continuously for nine months, including three months in which the state of emergency due to COVID-19 pandemic was established and the university switched to online classes. Acquired and stored data include not only the basic sound level parameters, e.g., equivalent or percentile sound pressure levels, but also psychoacoustic parameters, that are more related with noise assessment of the environment, e.g., loudness or sharpness sound levels. After analysing the acoustic environment of the campus through the complete set of nodes, results show two zones with higher noise indicators where some action plan should be developed. A detailed analysis of the temporal evolution of noise levels in these acoustically saturated zones is done, comparing values between a period of regular activity and the period of state of emergency. Different frequency distributions of sound levels are detected between day and evening periods providing a better insight into the noise sources. The results also show that binaural psychoacoustic annoyance values are correlated with loudness values in these locations, however sharpness values have minor effects.

AB  - Infrastructure is a significant factor in economic growth for systems of government. In order to increase economic productivity, maintaining infrastructure quality is essential. One of the elements of infrastructure is roads. Roads are means which help local and national economies be more productive. Furthermore, road damage such as potholes, debris, or cracks is the cause of many on-road accidents that have cost the lives of many drivers. In this paper, we propose a system that uses Convolutional Neural Networks to detect road degradations without data pre-processing. We utilize the state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, YOLO detector for the system. First, we developed a basic system working on data collecting, pre-processing, and classification. Secondly, we improved the classification performance achieving 97.98% in the overall model testing, and then we utilized pixel-level classification and detection with a method called semantic segmentation. We were able to achieve decent results using this method to detect and classify four different classes (Manhole, Pothole, Blurred Crosswalk, Blurred Street Line). We trained a segmentation model that recognizes the four classes mentioned above and achieved great results with this model allowing the machine to effectively and correctly identify and classify our four classes in an image. Although we obtained excellent accuracy from the detectors, these do not perform particularly well on embedded systems due to their network size. Therefore, we opted for a smaller, less accurate detector that will run in real time on a cheap embedded system, like the Google Coral Dev Board, without needing a powerful and expensive GPU.

AB  - Diverse and wide-range applications of integrated circuits (ICs) and the development of Cyber Physical System (CPS), more and more third-party manufacturers are involved in the manufacturing of ICs. Unfortunately, like software, hardware can also be subjected to malicious attacks. Untrusted outsourced manufacturing tools and intellectual property (IP) cores may bring enormous risks from highly integrated. Attributed to this manufacturing model, the malicious circuits (known as Hardware Trojans, HTs) can be implanted during the most designing and manufacturing stages of the ICs, causing a change of functionality, leakage of information, even a denial of services (DoS), and so on. In this paper, a survey of HTs is presented, which shows the threatens of chips, and the state-of-the-art preventing and detecting techniques. Starting from the introduction of HT structures, the recent researches in the academic community about HTs is compiled and comprehensive classification of HTs is proposed. The state-of-the-art HT protection techniques with their advantages and disadvantages are further analyzed. Finally, the development trends in hardware security are highlighted.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Electricity theft and fraud in energy consumption are two of the major issues for power distribution companies (PDCs) for many years. PDCs around the world are trying different methodologies for detecting electricity theft. The traditional methods for non-technical losses (NTLs) detection such as onsite inspection and reward and penalty policy have lost their place in the modern era because of their ineffective and time-consuming mechanism. With the advancement in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), newer and efficient NTL detection methods have been proposed by different researchers working in the field of data mining and AI. The AI-based NTL detection methods are superior to the conventional methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, time-consumption, precision, and labor required. The importance of such AI-based NTL detection methods can be judged by looking at the growing trend toward the increasing number of research articles on this important development. However, the authors felt the lack of a comprehensive study that can provide a one-stop source of information on these AI-based NTL methods and hence became the motivation for carrying out this comprehensive review on this significant field of science. This article systematically reviews and classifies the methods explored for NTL detection in recent literature, along with their benefits and limitations. For accomplishing the mentioned objective, the opted research articles for the review are classified based on algorithms used, features extracted, and metrics used for evaluation. Furthermore, a summary of different types of algorithms used for NTL detection is provided along with their applications in the studied field of research. Lastly, a comparison among the major NTL categories, i.e., data-based, network-based, and hybrid methods, is provided on the basis of their performance, expenses, and response time. It is expected that this comprehensive study will provide a one-stop source of information for all the new researchers and the experts working in the mentioned area of research.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The agent paradigm and multi-agent systems are a perfect match for the design of smart cities because of some of their essential features such as decentralization, openness, and heterogeneity. However, these major advantages also come at a great cost. Since agents&rsquo; mental states are hidden when the implementation is not known and available, intelligent services of smart cities cannot leverage information from them. We contribute with a proposal for the analysis and prediction of hidden agents&rsquo; mental states in a multi-agent system using machine learning methods that learn from past agents&rsquo; interactions. The approach employs agent communication languages, which is a core property of these multi-agent systems, to infer theories and models about agents&rsquo; mental states that are not accessible in an open system. These mental state models can be used on their own or combined to build protocol models, allowing agents (and their developers) to predict future agents&rsquo; behavior for various tasks such as testing and debugging them or making communications more efficient, which is essential in an ambient intelligence environment. This paper&rsquo;s main contribution is to explore the problem of building these agents&rsquo; mental state models not from one, but from several interaction protocols, even when the protocols could have different purposes and provide distinct ambient intelligence services.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The principle behind sustainable city movements is represented by the idea of &ldquo;good living&rdquo;, which is the possibility of having solutions and services that allow citizens to live in an easy, simple, and enjoyable way. Policies for urban quality play a central role in the slow cities manifesto, often suggesting the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) in the development of interactive services for citizens. Among these, an interesting possibility is to offer citizens digital real estate consultancy services through the implementation of automated evaluation methods. An automated appraisal action&mdash;which is already complex in itself owing to the need to collect data in a consistent, standardized, but also differentiated way so as to require the adoption of real estate due diligence&mdash;collides on the operational level with the concrete difficulty of acquiring necessary data, much more so since the reference market is dark, atypical, and viscous. These operational difficulties are deepened by the epistemological nature of the appraisal discipline itself, which bases its methodology on the forecast postulate, recalling the need to objectify as much as possible the evaluation from the perspective of an intersubjective sharing argument. These circumstances have led, on the one hand, to the definition of internationally accepted uniform evaluation rules (IVS, 2017) and, on the other, to the testing of automated valuation methods aimed at returning computer-based appraisals (AVM). Starting from the awareness that real estate valuation refers essentially to information and georeferences, this paper aims to demonstrate how real estate appraisal analysis can be further improved through information technology (IT), directing real estate valuation towards objectivity in compliance with international valuation standards. Particularly, the paper intends to show the potential of combining geographic information systems (GISs) and building information models (BIMs) in automated valuation methods through the depreciated reproduction cost. The paper also proposes a BIM-GIS semi-automatic prototype based on the depreciated reconstruction cost through an experimentation in Rende (Italy).

AB  - The increasing demand for more sensors inside vehicles pursues the intention of making vehicles more &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo;. In this context, the vision of fully connected and autonomous cars is becoming more tangible and will turn into a reality in the coming years. The use of these intelligent transport systems will allow the integration of efficient performance in terms of route control, fuel consumption, and traffic administration, among others. Future vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication will require a wider bandwidth as well as lower latencies than current technologies can offer, to support high-constraint safety applications and data exhaustive information exchanges. To this end, recent investigations have proposed the adoption of the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands to achieve high throughput and low latencies. However, mmWave communications come with high constraints for implementation due to higher free-space losses, poor diffraction, poor signal penetration, among other channel impairments for these high-frequency bands. In this work, a V2X communication channel in the mmWave (28 GHz) band is analyzed by a combination of an empirical study and a deterministic simulation with an in-house 3D ray-launching algorithm. Multiple mmWave V2X links has been modeled for a complex heterogeneous urban scenario in order to capture and analyze different propagation phenomena, providing full volumetric estimation of frequency/power as well as time domain parameters. Large- and small-scale propagation parameters are obtained for a combination of different situations, taking into account the obstruction between the transceivers of vehicles of distinct sizes. These results can aid in the development of modeling techniques for the implementation of mmWave frequency bands in the vehicular context, with the capability of adapting to different scenario requirements in terms of network topology, user density, or transceiver location. The proposed methodology provides accurate wireless channel estimation within the complete volume of the scenario under analysis, considering detailed topological characteristics.

AB  - Cybersecurity issues constitute a key concern of today&rsquo;s technology-based economies. Cybersecurity has become a core need for providing a sustainable and safe society to online users in cyberspace. Considering the rapid increase of technological implementations, it has turned into a global necessity in the attempt to adapt security countermeasures, whether direct or indirect, and prevent systems from cyberthreats. Identifying, characterizing, and classifying such threats and their sources is required for a sustainable cyber-ecosystem. This paper focuses on the cybersecurity of smart grids and the emerging trends such as using blockchain in the Internet of Things (IoT). The cybersecurity of emerging technologies such as smart cities is also discussed. In addition, associated solutions based on artificial intelligence and machine learning frameworks to prevent cyber-risks are also discussed. Our review will serve as a reference for policy-makers from the industry, government, and the cybersecurity research community.

TI  - Stress Classification Using Photoplethysmogram-Based Spatial and Frequency Domain Images
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 18
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Stress is subjective and is manifested differently from one person to another. Thus, the performance of generic classification models that classify stress status is crude. Building a person-specific model leads to a reliable classification, but it requires the collection of new data to train a new model for every individual and needs periodic upgrades because stress is dynamic. In this paper, a new binary classification (called stressed and non-stressed) approach is proposed for a subject&rsquo;s stress state in which the inter-beat intervals extracted from a photoplethysomogram (PPG) were transferred to spatial images and then to frequency domain images according to the number of consecutive. Then, the convolution neural network (CNN) was used to train and validate the classification accuracy of the person&rsquo;s stress state. Three types of classification models were built: person-specific models, generic classification models, and calibrated-generic classification models. The average classification accuracies achieved by person-specific models using spatial images and frequency domain images were 99.9%, 100%, and 99.8%, and 99.68%, 98.97%, and 96.4% for the training, validation, and test, respectively. By combining 20% of the samples collected from test subjects into the training data, the calibrated generic models&rsquo; accuracy was improved and outperformed the generic performance across both the spatial and frequency domain images. The average classification accuracy of 99.6%, 99.9%, and 88.1%, and 99.2%, 97.4%, and 87.6% were obtained for the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively, using the calibrated generic classification-based method for the series of inter-beat interval (IBI) spatial and frequency domain images. The main contribution of this study is the use of the frequency domain images that are generated from the spatial domain images of the IBI extracted from the PPG signal to classify the stress state of the individual by building person-specific models and calibrated generic models.

AB  - Predicting the popularity of posts on social networks has taken on significant importance in recent years, and several social media management tools now offer solutions to improve and optimize the quality of published content and to enhance the attractiveness of companies and organizations. Scientific research has recently moved in this direction, with the aim of exploiting advanced techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, etc., to support such tools. In light of the above, in this work we aim to address the challenge of predicting the popularity of a future post on Instagram, by defining the problem as a classification task and by proposing an original approach based on Gradient Boosting and feature engineering, which led us to promising experimental results. The proposed approach exploits big data technologies for scalability and efficiency, and it is general enough to be applied to other social media as well.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Most trackers focus solely on robustness and accuracy. Visual tracking, however, is a long-term problem with a high time limitation. A tracker that is robust, accurate, with long-term sustainability and real-time processing, is of high research value and practical significance. In this paper, we comprehensively consider these requirements in order to propose a new, state-of-the-art tracker with an excellent performance. EfficientNet-B0 is adopted for the first time via neural architecture search technology as the backbone network for the tracking task. This improves the network feature extraction ability and significantly reduces the number of parameters required for the tracker backbone network. In addition, maximal Distance Intersection-over-Union is set as the target estimation method, enhancing network stability and increasing the offline training convergence rate. Channel and spatial dual attention mechanisms are employed in the target classification module to improve the discrimination of the trackers. Furthermore, the conjugate gradient optimization strategy increases the speed of the online learning target classification module. A two-stage search method combined with a screening module is proposed to enable the tracker to cope with sudden target movement and reappearance following a brief disappearance. Our proposed method has an obvious speed advantage compared with pure global searching and achieves an optimal performance on OTB2015, VOT2016, VOT2018-LT, UAV-123 and LaSOT while running at over 50 FPS.

AB  - Cloud Computing provides on-demand computing services like software, networking, storage, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (“the cloud”). But it is facing challenges because of the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the volume, variety, veracity and velocity of the data generated by these devices. There is a need for ultra-low latency, reliable service along with security and privacy. Fog Computing is a promising solution to overcome these challenges. The originality, scope and novelty of this paper is the definition and formulation of the problem of smart neighborhoods in context of smart grids. This is achieved through an extensive literature study, firstly on Fog Computing and its foundation technologies, its applications and the literature review of Fog Computing research in various application domains. Thereafter, we introduce smart grid and community MicroGrid concepts and, their challenges to give the in depth background of the problem and hence, formalize the problem. The smart grid, which ensures reliable, secure, and cost-effective power supply to the smart neighborhoods, effectively needs Fog Computing architecture to achieve its purpose. This paper also identifies, without rigorous analysis, potential solutions to address the problem of smart neighborhoods. The challenges in the integration of Fog Computing and smart grids are also discussed.

AB  - Accurately forecasting how crowds of people are distributed in urban areas during daily activities is of key importance for the smart city vision and related applications. In this work we forecast the crowd density and distribution in an urban area by analyzing an aggregated mobile phone dataset. By comparing the forecasting performance of statistical and deep learning methods on the aggregated mobile data we show that each class of methods has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the forecasting scenario. However, for our time-series forecasting problem, deep learning methods are preferable when it comes to simplicity and immediacy of use, since they do not require a time-consuming model selection for each different cell. Deep learning approaches are also appropriate when aiming to reduce the maximum forecasting error. Statistical methods instead show their superiority in providing more precise forecasting results, but they require data domain knowledge and computationally expensive techniques in order to select the best parameters.

SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - The correct classification of requirements has become an essential task within software engineering. This study shows a comparison among the text feature extraction techniques, and machine learning algorithms to the problem of requirements engineer classification to answer the two major questions &ldquo;Which works best (Bag of Words (BoW) vs. Term Frequency&ndash;Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vs. Chi Squared (CHI2)) for classifying Software Requirements into Functional Requirements (FR) and Non-Functional Requirements (NF), and the sub-classes of Non-Functional Requirements?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Which Machine Learning Algorithm provides the best performance for the requirements classification task?&rdquo;. The data used to perform the research was the PROMISE_exp, a recently made dataset that expands the already known PROMISE repository, a repository that contains labeled software requirements. All the documents from the database were cleaned with a set of normalization steps and the two feature extractions, and feature selection techniques used were BoW, TF-IDF and CHI2 respectively. The algorithms used for classification were Logist Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). The novelty of our work is the data used to perform the experiment, the details of the steps used to reproduce the classification, and the comparison between BoW, TF-IDF and CHI2 for this repository not having been covered by other studies. This work will serve as a reference for the software engineering community and will help other researchers to understand the requirement classification process. We noticed that the use of TF-IDF followed by the use of LR had a better classification result to differentiate requirements, with an F-measure of 0.91 in binary classification (tying with SVM in that case), 0.74 in NF classification and 0.78 in general classification. As future work we intend to compare more algorithms and new forms to improve the precision of our models.

TI  - High Density Real-Time Air Quality Derived Services from IoT Networks

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, there is an increasing attention on air quality derived services for the final users. A dense grid of measures is needed to implement services such as conditional routing, alerting on data values for personal usage, data heatmaps for Dashboards in control room for the operators, and for web and mobile applications for the city users. Therefore, the challenge consists of providing high density data and services starting from scattered data and regardless of the number of sensors and their position to a large number of users. To this aim, this paper is focused on providing an integrated solution addressing at the same time multiple aspects: To create and optimize algorithms for data interpolation (creating regular data from scattered), making it possible to cope with the scalability and providing support for on demand services to provide air quality data in any point of the city with dense data. To this end, the accuracy of different interpolation algorithms has been evaluated comparing the results with respect to real values. In addition, the trends of heatmaps interpolation errors have been exploited to detected devices&rsquo; dysfunctions. Such anomalies may often be useful to request a maintenance action. The solution proposed has been integrated as a Micro Services providing data analytics in a data flow real time process based on Node.JS Node-RED, called in the paper IoT Applications. The specific case presented in this paper refers to the data and the solution of Snap4City for Helsinki. Snap4City, which has been developed as a part of Select4Cities PCP of the European Commission, and it is presently used in a number of cities and areas in Europe.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Technological advancement is currently focused on the miniaturization of devices, and integrated circuits allow us to observe the increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Most IoT services and devices require an Internet connection, which needs to provide the minimum processing, storage and networking requirements to best serve a requested service. One of the main goals of 5G networks is to comply with the user&rsquo;s various Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in different application scenarios. Fifth-generation networks use Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) concepts to achieve these QoS requirements. However, the computational resource allocation mechanisms required by the services are considered very complex. Thus, in this paper, we propose an allocation and management resources mechanism for 5G networks that uses MEC and simple mathematical methods to reduce the model complexity. The mechanism decides to allocate the resource in MEC to meet the requirements requested by the user. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism provides a larger amount of services, leading to a reduction in the service lock number and as a reduction in the blocking ratio of services due to the accuracy of the approach and its load balancing in the process of resource allocation.

AB  - Vision technologies are used in both industrial and smart city applications in order to provide advanced value products due to embedded self-monitoring and assessment services. In addition, for the full utilization of the obtained data, deep learning is now suggested for use. To this end, the current work presents the implementation of image recognition techniques alongside the original the quality assessment of a Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) reflector surface to locate and identify surface irregularities by classifying images as either acceptable or non-acceptable. The method consists of a three-step solution that promotes an affordable implementation in a relatively small time period. More specifically, a 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) of the PTC was used for the pre-training of neural networks, while an aluminum reflector surface was used to verify algorithm performance. The results are promising, as this method proved applicable in cases where the actual part was manufactured in small batches or under the concept of customized manufacturing. Consequently, the algorithm is capable of being trained with a limited number of data.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the near future, the fifth-generation wireless technology is expected to be rolled out, offering low latency, high bandwidth and multiple antennas deployed in a single access point. This ecosystem will help further enhance various location-based scenarios such as assets tracking in smart factories, precise smart management of hydroponic indoor vertical farms and indoor way-finding in smart hospitals. Such a system will also integrate existing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), WiFi and other network infrastructures. In this respect, 5G precise indoor localization using heterogeneous IoT technologies (Zigbee, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, BLE, etc.) is a challenging research area. In this work, an experimental 5G testbed has been designed integrating C-RAN and IoT networks. This testbed is used to improve both vertical and horizontal localization (3D Localization) in a 5G IoT environment. To achieve this, we propose the DEep Learning-based co-operaTive Architecture (DELTA) machine learning model implemented on a 3D multi-layered fingerprint radiomap. The DELTA begins by estimating the 2D location. Then, the output is recursively used to predict the 3D location of a mobile station. This approach is going to benefit use cases such as 3D indoor navigation in multi-floor smart factories or in large complex buildings. Finally, we have observed that the proposed model has outperformed traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

AB  - A smart home provides a facilitated environment for the detection of human activity with appropriate Deep Learning algorithms to manipulate data collected from numerous sensors attached to various smart things in a smart home environment. Human activities comprise expected and unexpected behavior events; therefore, detecting these events consisting of mutual dependent activities poses a key challenge in the activities detection paradigm. Besides, the battery-powered sensor ubiquitously and extensively monitors activities, disputes, and sensor energy depletion. Therefore, to address these challenges, we propose an Energy and Event Aware-Sensor Duty Cycling scheme. The proposed model predicts the future expected event using the Bi-Directional Long-Short Term Memory model and allocates Predictive Sensors to the predicted event. To detect the unexpected events, the proposed model localizes a Monitor Sensor within a cluster of Hibernate Sensors using the Jaccard Similarity Index. Finally, we optimize the performance of our proposed scheme by employing the Q-Learning algorithm to track the missed or undetected events. The simulation is executed against the conventional Machine Learning algorithms for the sensor duty cycle, scheduling to reduce the sensor energy consumption and improve the activity detection accuracy. The experimental evaluation of our proposed scheme shows significant improvement in activity detection accuracy from 94.12% to 96.12%. Besides, the effective rotation of the Monitor Sensor significantly improves the energy consumption of each sensor with the entire network lifetime.

AB  - In this study, we used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to delineate post-earthquake landslides within an object-based image analysis (OBIA). We used our resulting landslide inventory map for training the data-driven model of the frequency ratio (FR) for landslide susceptibility modelling and mapping considering eleven conditioning factors of soil type, slope angle, distance to roads, distance to rivers, rainfall, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), aspect, altitude, distance to faults, land cover, and lithology. A fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) also was used for the susceptibility mapping using expert knowledge. Then, we integrated the data-driven model of the FR with the knowledge-based model of the FAHP to reduce the associated uncertainty in each approach. We validated our resulting landslide inventory map based on 30% of the global positioning system (GPS) points of an extensive field survey in the study area. The remaining 70% of the GPS points were used to validate the performance of the applied models and the resulting landslide susceptibility maps using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Our resulting landslide inventory map got a precision of 94% and the AUCs (area under the curve) of the susceptibility maps showed 83%, 89%, and 96% for the F-AHP, FR, and the integrated model, respectively. The introduced methodology in this study can be used in the application of remote sensing data for landslide inventory and susceptibility mapping in other areas where earthquakes are considered as the main landslide-triggered factor.

The digital pattern of life defines the general concepts of tourist behaviour, connects the tourist and the digital world and allows us to track behaviour changes over time. A literature review of the current state of the research in selected fields is performed for identifying the existing problems. The case studies of behaviour analysis based on classification, clustering and time series events behaviour models are shown. An ontological approach and artificial neural networks are used during behaviour model construction, training and evaluation.

AB  - The sustainable development of mankind is a matter of concern to the whole world. Environmental pollution and haze diffusion have greatly affected the sustainable development of mankind. According to previous research, vehicle exhaust emissions are an important source of environmental pollution and haze diffusion. The sharp increase in the number of cars has also made the supply of energy increasingly tight. In this paper, we have explored the use of intelligent navigation technology based on data analysis to reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on road networks. We have implemented a traffic flow prediction method using a genetic algorithm and particle-swarm-optimization-enhanced support vector regression, constructed a model for predicting vehicle exhaust emissions based on predicted road conditions and vehicle fuel consumption, and built our low-carbon-emission-oriented navigation algorithm based on a spatially optimized dynamic path planning algorithm. The results show that our method could help to significantly reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on the road network, which means that our method could contribute to the construction of low-carbon-emission intelligent transportation systems and smart cities.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Nowadays, the need for wireless sensing applications is increasing. Along with the increased illegal cutting of logs in the forest, however, it requires the integration application to tackle the illegal logging and forest preservation. The wireless sensor network is a suitable network architecture for remotely monitoring or tracking applications in the environment. This paper proposed an integrated system that can identify and track the position of a moving cutting log. An Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi 3 B+, sound sensor, accelerometer sensor, LoRa GPS HAT Shield, and Outdoor LoRa Gateway OLG01 performed the hardware monitoring and tracking of the proposed system. The network of STAR topology configuration between master and slaves is represented by the LoRa Network embedded with the sensors, as an architecture of the wireless sensor network. The system was examined the performance of the network and the tracking process. The result determined that the LoRa can detect and identify the occurrence of the illegal cutting of logs in real-time. Meanwhile, in terms of the tracking performance, a duration of 5&ndash;46 s was required to track the new position of the moving cutting log.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the development of the next generation of information technology, an increasing amount of attention is being paid to smart residential spaces, including smart cities, smart buildings, and smart homes. Building indoor safety intelligence is an important research topic. However, current indoor safety management methods cannot comprehensively analyse safety data, owing to a poor combination of safety management and building information. Additionally, the judgement of danger depends significantly on the experience of the safety management staff. In this study, digital twins (DTs) are introduced to building indoor safety management. A framework for an indoor safety management system based on DT is proposed which exploits the Internet of Things (IoT), building information modelling (BIM), the Internet, and support vector machines (SVMs) to improve the level of intelligence for building indoor safety management. A DT model (DTM) is developed using BIM integrated with operation information collected by IoT sensors. The trained SVM model is used to automatically obtain the types and levels of danger by processing the data in the DTM. The Internet is a medium for interactions between people and systems. A building in the bobsleigh and sled stadium for the Beijing Winter Olympics is considered as an example; the proposed system realises the functions of the scene display of the operation status, danger warning and positioning, danger classification and level assessment, and danger handling suggestions.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - 5G networks and Internet of Things (IoT) offer a powerful platform for ubiquitous environments with their ubiquitous sensing, high speeds and other benefits. The data, analytics, and other computations need to be optimally moved and placed in these environments, dynamically, such that energy-efficiency and QoS demands are best satisfied. A particular challenge in this context is to preserve privacy and security while delivering quality of service (QoS) and energy-efficiency. Many works have tried to address these challenges but without a focus on optimizing all of them and assuming fixed models of environments and security threats. This paper proposes the UbiPriSEQ framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to adaptively, dynamically, and holistically optimize QoS, energy-efficiency, security, and privacy. UbiPriSEQ is built on a three-layered model and comprises two modules. UbiPriSEQ devises policies and makes decisions related to important parameters including local processing and offloading rates for data and computations, radio channel states, transmit power, task priority, and selection of fog nodes for offloading, data migration, and so forth. UbiPriSEQ is implemented in Python over the TensorFlow platform and is evaluated using a real-life application in terms of SINR, privacy metric, latency, and utility function, manifesting great promise.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
SN  - 2076-3387

AB  - Organizations are increasingly introducing data science initiatives to support decision-making. However, the decision outcomes of data science initiatives are not always used or adopted by decision-makers, often due to uncertainty about the quality of data input. It is, therefore, not surprising that organizations are increasingly turning to data governance as a means to improve the acceptance of data science decision outcomes. In this paper, propositions will be developed to understand the role of data governance in creating trust in data science decision outcomes. Two explanatory case studies in the asset management domain are analyzed to derive boundary conditions. The first case study is a data science project designed to improve the efficiency of road management through predictive maintenance, and the second case study is a data science project designed to detect fraudulent usage of electricity in medium and low voltage electrical grids without infringing privacy regulations. The duality of technology is used as our theoretical lens to understand the interactions between the organization, decision-makers, and technology. The results show that data science decision outcomes are more likely to be accepted if the organization has an established data governance capability. Data governance is also needed to ensure that organizational conditions of data science are met, and that incurred organizational changes are managed efficiently. These results imply that a mature data governance capability is required before sufficient trust can be placed in data science decision outcomes for decision-making.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - According to the United Nations, 70% of the world&rsquo;s population will live in cities by 2050. This growth will be reflected in the demand for better services that should be adjusted to the collective and individual needs of the population. Governments and organizations are working on defining and implementing strategies that will enable them to respond to these challenges. The main challenges are related to transport and its management, considering transportation as a core issue in the economy, sustainability, and development of the regions. In this way, the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) play a key role in the response to these scenarios, being that they are the framework where the new hardware and software tools are integrated, allowing an efficient development of transportation systems management, attending to aspects such as: traffic management, communications between vehicles and infrastructures, and security, among others. Nevertheless, the concept of ITS evolves rapidly so it is necessary to understand its evolution. To do that, the current research develops a thematic analysis of ITS in literature, evaluating the intellectual structure and its evolution using SciMAT, quantifying the main bibliometric performance indicators, and identifying the main research areas, authors, journals, and countries. To this purpose, the publications related to ITS from 1993 to 2019 available in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection were retrieved (7649 publications) and analyzed. Finally, one of the main results is the latest research themes map of ITS, considering its intellectual structure, evolution, and relationship. It assists in the definition and implementation of strategies, the identification of the scientific, academic, and business opportunities, and future research lines to consolidate the role of ITS in the new city models.

PY  - 2020

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Real-time automatic identification of audio distress signals in urban areas is a task that in a smart city can improve response times in emergency alert systems. The main challenge in this problem lies in finding a model that is able to accurately recognize these type of signals in the presence of background noise and allows for real-time processing. In this paper, we present the design of a portable and low-cost device for accurate audio distress signal recognition in real urban scenarios based on deep learning models. As real audio distress recordings in urban areas have not been collected and made publicly available so far, we first constructed a database where audios were recorded in urban areas using a low-cost microphone. Using this database, we trained a deep multi-headed 2D convolutional neural network that processed temporal and frequency features to accurately recognize audio distress signals in noisy environments with a significant performance improvement to other methods from the literature. Then, we deployed and assessed the trained convolutional neural network model on a Raspberry Pi that, along with the low-cost microphone, constituted a device for accurate real-time audio recognition. Source code and database are publicly available.

VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Crowd monitoring systems (CMSs) provide a state-of-the-art solution to manage crowds objectively. Most crowd monitoring systems feature one type of sensor, which severely limits the insights one can simultaneously gather regarding the crowd&rsquo;s traffic state. Incorporating multiple functionally complementary sensor types is expensive. CMSs are needed that exploit data fusion opportunities to limit the number of (more expensive) sensors. This research estimates a data fusion algorithm to enhance the functionality of a CMS featuring Wi-Fi sensors by means of a small number of automated counting systems. Here, the goal is to estimate the pedestrian flow rate accurately based on real-time Wi-Fi traces at one sensor location, and historic flow rate and Wi-Fi trace information gathered at other sensor locations. Several data fusion models are estimated, amongst others, linear regression, shallow and recurrent neural networks, and Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMAX) models. The data from the CMS of a large four-day music event was used to calibrate and validate the models. This study establishes that the RNN model best predicts the flow rate for this particular purpose. In addition, this research shows that model structures that incorporate information regarding the average current state of the area and the temporal variation in the Wi-Fi/count ratio perform best.

SN  - 2673-3951

AB  - Current and future smart cities are moving towards the zero-net energy use concept. To this end, the built environment should also be designed for efficient energy use and play a significant role in the production of such energy. At present, this is achieved by focusing on energy demand in buildings and to the renewable trade-off related to smart power grids. However, urban water distribution systems constantly carry an excess of hydraulic energy that can potentially be recovered to produce electricity. This paper presents a comprehensive review of current strategies for energy production by reviewing the state-of-the-art of smart water systems. New technologies (such as cyber-physical systems, digital twins, blockchain) and new methodologies (network dynamics, geometric deep learning) associated with digital water are also discussed. The paper then focuses on modelling the installation of both micro-turbines and pumps as turbines, instead of/together with pressure reduction valves, to further demonstrate the energy-recovery methods which will enable water network partitioning into district metered areas. The associated benefits on leakage control, as a source of energy, and for contributing to overall network resilience are also highlighted. The paper concludes by presenting future research directions. Notably, digital water is proposed as the main research and operational direction for current and future Water Distribution Systems (WDS) and as a holistic, data-centred framework for the operation and management of water networks.

AB  - Nowadays, our mobile devices have become smart computing platforms, incorporating a wide number of embedded sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, barometers, GPS receivers, and magnetometers. Smartphones are valuable devices for gathering user-related data and transforming it into value-added information for the user. In this study, a novel mechanism to process sensor data from mobile devices in order to detect the type of area the user is crossing while walking in an urban setting is presented. The method is based on combining outlier data analysis and classification techniques from data collected by several pedestrians while traversing an urban environment. A theoretical framework, composed of methods for detecting multivariate outliers combined with supervised classification techniques, has been proposed in order to identify different situations and physical barriers while walking. Each type of element to be detected is characterized by using a feature vector computed based on the outliers detected. Finally, a radial SVM is used for the classification task. The classifier is trained in a supervised way with data from 20 different segments containing several physical barriers and used later to assign a class to new un-labelled data. The results obtained with this approach are very promising with an average accuracy around 95% when detecting different types of physical barriers.

AB  - Social Media Big Data (SMBD) is widely used to serve the economic and social development of human beings. However, as a young research and practice field, the understanding of SMBD in academia is not enough and needs to be supplemented. This paper took Web of Science (WoS) core collection as the data source, and used traditional statistical methods and CiteSpace software to carry out the scientometrics analysis of SMBD, which showed the research status, hotspots and trends in this field. The results showed that: (1) More and more attention has been paid to SMBD research in academia, and the number of journals published has been increased in recent years, mainly in subjects such as Computer Science Engineering and Telecommunications. The results were published primarily in IEEE Access Sustainability and Future Generation Computer Systems the International Journal of eScience and so on; (2) In terms of contributions, China, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries (regions) have published the most papers in SMBD, high-yield institutions also mainly from these countries (regions). There were already some excellent teams in the field, such as the Wanggen Wan team at Shanghai University and Haoran Xie team from City University of Hong Kong; (3) we studied the hotspots of SMBD in recent years, and realized the summary of the frontier of SMBD based on the keywords and co-citation literature, including the deep excavation and construction of social media technology, the reflection and concerns about the rapid development of social media, and the role of SMBD in solving human social development problems. These studies could provide values and references for SMBD researchers to understand the research status, hotspots and trends in this field.

AB  - The livelihood problem, especially the medical wisdom, has played an important role during the process of the building of smart cities. For the medical wisdom, the fall detection has attracted the considerable attention from the global researchers and medical institutions. It is very difficult for the traditional fall detection strategies to realize the intelligent detection with the following three reasons: (i) the data collection cannot reach the real-time level; (ii) the adopted detection methods cannot satisfy the enough stability; and (iii) the computation overhead of collection device is very high, which causes the barely satisfactory detection effect. Therefore, this paper proposes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fall detection strategy with edge computing consideration, where the global network view ability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is used to collect the generated data from smartphone. Meanwhile, on one hand, the edge computing is exploited to put some computation tasks at the edge server by the scheduling technique. On the other hand, CNN is equipped with both edge server and smartphone, and it is leveraged to train the related data and further give the guidance of fall detection. The experimental results show that the novel fall detection strategy has a more accurate rate, transmission delay, and stability than two cutting-edge strategies.

AB  - Climate change, the deterioration of the environment and exceeding Earth&rsquo;s carrying capacity are major threats in operating environment which require new actions in industrialized and digitalized society. In parallel with the global deployment of 5th generation (5G) mobile communication networks, the telecommunication community has already started to envision 6G networks that target the year 2030. This paper discusses the unprecedented opportunities in the future 6G ecosystem specifically from the business perspective and applies a futures-oriented scenario planning method utilized in two strategy workshops in 2020. The paper portrays four scenario themes and a total of 16 alternative future scenarios for the business of 6G. Through the identification of key trends, their interactions, and related uncertainties, the scenario development process generates alternative futures where 6G business strategies are then developed and assessed through the business model perspective. Scenarios were created under four themes: user experience, business, sustainability, and geopolitics and they are discussed in terms of economical, societal, and environmental perspectives. The findings of the paper highlight the achievement of a preferred sustainable future that calls for attention to the privacy and security aspects considering business and regulatory needs: public/governmental, corporate, community, and human perspectives and aims of governance; ecosystem configuration related to users, decentralized business models, and platforms; user empowerment; and the role of service location-specificity. The findings indicate that it is vital to bring together relevant stakeholders to solve sustainability problems within the ecosystem and pay special attention to open ecosystem-focused value configuration and decentralized poly-nodal power configuration, while responding to the diversified demands of various users across the different verticals.

VL  - 8
IS  - 11
SN  - 2227-7390

AB  - The expanding utilization of edge consumer electronic (ECE) components and other innovations allows medical devices to communicate with one another to distribute sensitive clinical information. This information is used by health care authorities, specialists and emergency clinics to offer enhanced medication and help. The security of client data is a major concern, since modification of data by hackers can be life-threatening. Therefore, we have developed a privacy preservation approach to protect the wearable sensor data gathered from wearable medical devices by means of an anomaly detection strategy using artificial intelligence combined with a novel dynamic attribute-based re-encryption (DABRE) method. Anomaly detection is accomplished through a modified artificial neural network (MANN) based on a gray wolf optimization (GWO) technique, where the training speed and classification accuracy are improved. Once the anomaly data are removed, the data are stored in the cloud, secured through the proposed DABRE approach for future use by doctors. Furthermore, in the proposed DABRE method, the biometric attributes, chosen dynamically, are considered for encryption. Moreover, if the user wishes, the data can be modified to be unrecoverable by re-encryption with the true attributes in the cloud. A detailed experimental analysis takes place to verify the superior performance of the proposed method. From the experimental results, it is evident that the proposed GWO&ndash;MANN model attained a maximum average detection rate (DR) of 95.818% and an accuracy of 95.092%. In addition, the DABRE method required a minimum average encryption time of 95.63 s and a decryption time of 108.7 s, respectively.

AB  - Accurate information of traffic regulators at junctions is important for navigating and driving in cities. However, such information is often missing, incomplete or not up-to-date in digital maps due to the high cost, e.g., time and money, for data acquisition and updating. In this study we propose a crowdsourced method that harnesses the light-weight GPS tracks from commuting vehicles as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) for traffic regulator detection. We explore the novel idea of detecting traffic regulators by learning the movement patterns of vehicles at regulated locations. Vehicles&rsquo; movement behavior was encoded in the form of speed-profiles, where both speed values and their sequential order during movement development were used as features in a three-class classification problem for the most common traffic regulators: traffic-lights, priority-signs and uncontrolled junctions. The method provides an average weighting function and a majority voting scheme to tolerate the errors in the VGI data. The sequence-to-sequence framework requires no extra overhead for data processing, which makes the method applicable for real-world traffic regulator detection tasks. The results showed that the deep-learning classifier Conditional Variational Autoencoder can predict regulators with 90% accuracy, outperforming a random forest classifier (88% accuracy) that uses the summarized statistics of movement as features. In our future work images and augmentation techniques can be leveraged to generalize the method&rsquo;s ability for classifying a greater variety of traffic regulator classes.

AB  - Smart lighting systems based on the Digital Addressable Lighting Interface (DALI) protocol are the most suitable for street lighting systems, allowing digital lighting control operations. Unfortunately, the microcontrollers, which are commonly used in the Wireless Sensor Network nodes to control the lamps, do not implement this protocol. The DALI protocol implemented by software in the microcontroller consumes hardware resources (timers), processing time and requires a precise temporal analysis of the application, due to the strict bit times and the Manchester coding that it uses. In this work, the design of a bridge is proposed to free the microcontroller from the implementation of the DALI protocol. The novelty of this work is the implementation of the DALI Bridge in a low-cost Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with low power consumption. The bridge has been described in the hardware description language following the 1076-93 and 1076.3-97 standards, to guarantee its portability. The results of the synthesis show that a minimum amount of logical and routing resources is used, that the power consumption is in the order of tens of mW, that it has a very small latency time and that it supports a high operating frequency, which allows adding new functions. Its operation is verified by implementing a wireless sensor node using an FPGA of the Lattice Semiconductor iCE40 family.

AB  - This article shows the numerical results and the analysis of households&rsquo; degree of knowledge about the urban water cycle, needs, and values regarding water in an intermediary city with low water stress, such as Huelva (Andalusia, Spain). Results are also presented regarding how households maintain the acceptance of reclaimed water and new technologies to achieve more efficient and sustainable consumption. Surveys were sent to households, and different statistical analysis techniques were applied. The use of clustering as a mathematical tool has served to obtain three clusters of households with similar characteristics with respect to the previous factors. The first cluster corresponded to households with high knowledge of the integral water cycle and positive attitude to smart devices at home. The second cluster showed low knowledge of the integral water cycle and high sensitivity to price. The third one had average knowledge and predisposition to have a closer relationship with the water company. This classification allows implementing different water demand management strategies tailored to each cluster. Applying a Design Thinking methodology, a web-based prototype has been designed as an ICT tool concerning households. The goal is to achieve greater engagement of households concerning water and align citizens with their city&rsquo;s sustainability.

AB  - Efforts toward a low-emission economy constitute a common challenge for Polish cities. Solutions are being sought to support Polish, medium-sized cities, that is, cities with about 140,000 inhabitants, to implement and develop low-carbon energy in their public transport systems. This paper proposes and explores a sustainable urban development card for a Polish city, namely, Zielona G&oacute;ra, the use of which will enable the effects of a public transport system using low-carbon energy to be monitored. This research was based on the two main areas of analysis of a system of low-carbon energy and public transport and were formulated as: (1) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and (2) Indicators of the Satisfaction Rate of Public Transport Passengers (SPTP). This paper used literature studies to determine SDGs as well a questionnaire-cum-survey, which was conducted on a sample of 1022 public transport passengers in Zielona G&oacute;ra, Poland, to determine SPTP. The results were verified by a real case study of a Polish city, which, in 2019, had the largest fleet of electric buses in Poland; a statistical analysis was also conducted using correlation coefficients. It was determined that the proposed approach allows for low carbon energy public transport to be constantly monitored and analyzed. In the long run, this could be a good benchmark as to how cities might improve their level of sustainability.

AB  - Mental health is the foundation of health and happiness as well as the basis for an individual&rsquo;s meaningful life. The environmental and social health of a city can measure the mental state of people living in a certain areas, and exploring urban dwellers&rsquo; mental states is an important factor in understanding and better managing cities. New dynamic and granular urban data provide us with a way to determine the environmental factors that affect the mental states of urban dwellers. The characteristics of the maximal information coefficient can identify the linear and nonlinear relationships so that we can fully identify the physical and social environmental factors that affect urban dwellers&rsquo; mental states and further test these relationships through linear and nonlinear modeling. Taking the Greater London as an example, we used data from the London Datastore to discover the environmental factors that had the highest correlation with urban mental health from 2015 to 2017 and to prove that they had a high nonlinear correlation through neural network modeling. This paper aimed to use a data-driven approach to find environmental factors that had not yet received enough attention and to provide a starting point for research by establishing hypotheses for further exploration of the impact of environmental factors on mental health.

AB  - The main principles of the smart city concept rely on modern, environmentally friendly technologies. One manifestation of the smart city concept is investments in renewable energy sources (RES), which are currently a popular direction in urban transformation. It makes sense, therefore, to analyse how Polish cities are coping with this challenge and whether they are including the implementation of RES facilities in their development strategies. The aim of the article is to analyze and assess the level at which renewable energy facilities are being implemented or developed in the urban space of cities in Poland as a pillar of the implementation of the smart city concept. This goal is realized on two levels: the theoretical (analysis of strategic documents) and the practical (analysis of the capacity of RES installations, questionnaire studies). The study shows that renewable energy installations are an important part of the development strategies of Polish cities, and especially of those that aspire to be termed &ldquo;smart cities&rdquo;. Moreover, it is shown that the predominant RES facilities are those based on solar energy.

AB  - With the arrival of the big data era, mobile phone data have attracted increasing attention due to their rich information and high sampling rate. Currently, researchers have conducted various studies using mobile phone data. However, most existing studies have focused on macroscopic analysis, such as urban hot spot detection and crowd behavior analysis over a short period. With the development of the smart city, personal service and management have become very important, so microscopic portraiture research and mobility pattern of an individual based on big data is necessary. Therefore, this paper first proposes a method to depict the individual mobility pattern, and based on the long-term mobile phone data (from 2007 to 2012) of volunteers from Beijing as part of project Geolife conducted by Microsoft Research Asia, more detailed individual portrait depiction analysis is performed. The conclusions are as follows: (1) Based on high-density cluster identification, the behavior trajectories of volunteers are generalized into three types, and among them, the two-point-one-line trajectory and evenly distributed behavior trajectory were more prevalent in Beijing. (2) By integrating with Google Maps data, five volunteers&rsquo; behavior trajectories and the activity patterns of individuals were analyzed in detail, and a portrait depiction method for individual characteristics comprehensively considering their attributes, such as occupation and hobbies, is proposed. (3) Based on analysis of the individual characteristics of some volunteers, it is discovered that two-point-one-line individuals are generally white-collar workers working in enterprises or institutions, and the situation of a single cluster mainly exists among college students and home freelancer. The findings of this study are important for individual classification and prediction in the big data era and can also provide useful guidance for targeted services and individualized management of smart cities.

AB  - Understanding how, where, and when a city is expanding can inform better ways to make our cities more resilient, sustainable, and equitable. This paper explores urban volumetry using the Building 3D Density Index (B3DI) in 2001, 2010, 2019, and quantifies changes in the volume of buildings and urban expansion in Luxembourg City over the last two decades. For this purpose, we use airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud (2019) and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) of aerial orthophotos (2001, 2010) to extract 3D models, footprints of buildings and calculate the volume of individual buildings and B3DI in the frame of a 100 &times; 100 m grid, at the level of parcels, districts, and city scale. Findings indicate that the B3DI has notably increased in the past 20 years from 0.77 m3/m2 (2001) to 0.9 m3/m2 (2010) to 1.09 m3/m2 (2019). Further, the increase in the volume of buildings between 2001&ndash;2019 was +16 million m3. The general trend of changes in the cubic capacity of buildings per resident shows a decrease from 522 m3/resident in 2001, to 460 m3/resident in 2019, which, with the simultaneous appearance of new buildings and fast population growth, represents the dynamic development of the city.

AB  - The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications and their interference with our daily life tasks have led to a large number of IoT devices and enormous sizes of IoT-generated data. The resources of IoT devices are limited; therefore, the processing and storing IoT data in these devices are inefficient. Traditional cloud-computing resources are used to partially handle some of the IoT resource-limitation issues; however, using the resources in cloud centers leads to other issues, such as latency in time-critical IoT applications. Therefore, edge-cloud-computing technology has recently evolved. This technology allows for data processing and storage at the edge of the network. This paper studies, in-depth, edge-computing architectures for IoT (ECAs-IoT), and then classifies them according to different factors such as data placement, orchestration services, security, and big data. Besides, the paper studies each architecture in depth and compares them according to various features. Additionally, ECAs-IoT is mapped according to two existing IoT layered models, which helps in identifying the capabilities, features, and gaps of every architecture. Moreover, the paper presents the most important limitations of existing ECAs-IoT and recommends solutions to them. Furthermore, this survey details the IoT applications in the edge-computing domain. Lastly, the paper recommends four different scenarios for using ECAs-IoT by IoT applications.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Screening baggage against potential threats has become one of the prime aviation security concerns all over the world, where manual detection of prohibited items is a time-consuming and hectic process. Many researchers have developed autonomous systems to recognize baggage threats using security X-ray scans. However, all of these frameworks are vulnerable against screening cluttered and concealed contraband items. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no framework possesses the capacity to recognize baggage threats across multiple scanner specifications without an explicit retraining process. To overcome this, we present a novel meta-transfer learning-driven tensor-shot detector that decomposes the candidate scan into dual-energy tensors and employs a meta-one-shot classification backbone to recognize and localize the cluttered baggage threats. In addition, the proposed detection framework can be well-generalized to multiple scanner specifications due to its capacity to generate object proposals from the unified tensor maps rather than diversified raw scans. We have rigorously evaluated the proposed tensor-shot detector on the publicly available SIXray and GDXray datasets (containing a cumulative of 1,067,381 grayscale and colored baggage X-ray scans). On the SIXray dataset, the proposed framework achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.6457, and on the GDXray dataset, it achieved the precision and F1 score of 0.9441 and 0.9598, respectively. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks by 8.03% in terms of mAP, 1.49% in terms of precision, and 0.573% in terms of F1 on the SIXray and GDXray dataset, respectively.

AB  - To minimize the damage caused by wildfires, a deep learning-based wildfire-detection technology that extracts features and patterns from surveillance camera images was developed. However, many studies related to wildfire-image classification based on deep learning have highlighted the problem of data imbalance between wildfire-image data and forest-image data. This data imbalance causes model performance degradation. In this study, wildfire images were generated using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to eliminate data imbalances. In addition, a densely-connected-convolutional-networks-based (DenseNet-based) framework was proposed and its performance was compared with pre-trained models. While training with a train set containing an image generated by a GAN in the proposed DenseNet-based model, the best performance result value was realized among the models with an accuracy of 98.27% and an F1 score of 98.16, obtained using the test dataset. Finally, this trained model was applied to high-quality drone images of wildfires. The experimental results showed that the proposed framework demonstrated high wildfire-detection accuracy.

AB  - Seoul Metropolitan City&rsquo;s buses cater to more than 50% of the average daily public transportation use, and they are the most important transportation mode in Korea, together with the subway. Since 2004, all public transportation records of passengers have been stored in Seoul, using smart transportation cards. This study explores the environmental and psychological factors in implementing a smart transportation system. We analyze the switching behavior of traffic users according to traffic congestion time and number of transfers based on public transportation data and show that bus-use behavior differs according to the traffic information of users and the degree of traffic congestion. Information-based switching behavior of people living near bus stops induces people to change routes during traffic congestion. However, in non-congested situations, the original routes are used. These results can guide the formulation of policy measures on bus routes. We made it possible to continuously change the routes for certain buses, which were temporarily implemented due to traffic congestion. Moreover, we added a service that posts the estimated arrival time to major stops while reflecting real-time traffic conditions in addition to the bus location and arrival time information through the global positioning system.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies used in developing smart cities solutions, Machine Learning (ML) and recently Deep Learning (DL), rely more on utilising best representative training datasets and features engineering and less on the available domain expertise. We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of &lsquo;explainable deep learning&rsquo; as a subset of the &lsquo;explainable AI&rsquo; problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project. Monitoring of gullies and drainage in crucial geographical areas susceptible to flooding issues is an important aspect of any flood monitoring solution. Typical solutions for this problem involve the use of cameras to capture images showing the affected areas in real-time with different objects such as leaves, plastic bottles etc., and building a DL-based classifier to detect such objects and classify blockages based on the presence and coverage of these objects in the images. In this work, we uniquely propose an Explainable AI solution using DL and Semantic Web technologies to build a hybrid classifier. In this hybrid classifier, the DL component detects object presence and coverage level and semantic rules designed with close consultation with experts carry out the classification. By using the expert knowledge in the flooding context, our hybrid classifier provides the flexibility on categorising the image using objects and their coverage relationships. The experimental results demonstrated with a real-world use case showed that this hybrid approach of image classification has on average 11% improvement (F-Measure) in image classification performance compared to DL-only classifier. It also has the distinct advantage of integrating experts&rsquo; knowledge on defining the decision-making rules to represent the complex circumstances and using such knowledge to explain the results.

AB  - Water supply systems are dynamic in nature, owing to the effect of climate change and consumer demand uncertainties. The operation of such a system must be managed effectively to meet up with the uncertainties, thus posing a key challenge. Unfortunately, previous information and communication technology (ICT) solutions could not provide the necessary support for applications to deal with the dynamics of the changing physical environment. Nevertheless, tremendous growth in technology offers better possibilities to enhance water supply systems&rsquo; operations. As a result, development in technology in sensing and instrumentation, communication and networking, computing and control is now jointly integrated with water supply system infrastructures to enhance the water system operations. One such technological paradigm shift is the cyber-physical system (CPS). In this paper, we present the concept of the CPS in the water system context and investigate the CPS applications to water supply system monitoring. Also, the various applications of CPSs and the application domain requirements are outlined. More importantly, research studies on its application to water system monitoring are scrutinized. As such, key challenges sounding the applications in WSSs are identified. We then outline the areas of improvement for further studies.

AB  - A paramount challenge of prohibiting increased CO2 emissions for network densification is to deliver the Fifth Generation (5G) cellular capacity and connectivity demands, while maintaining a greener, healthier and prosperous environment. Energy consumption is a demanding consideration in the 5G era to combat several challenges such as reactive mode of operation, high latency wake up times, incorrect user association with the cells, multiple cross-functional operation of Self-Organising Networks (SON), etc. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Mobility Management-Based Autonomous Energy-Aware Framework for analysing bus passengers ridership through statistical Machine Learning (ML) and proactive energy savings coupled with CO2 emissions in Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) architecture using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Furthermore, we compare and report various ML algorithms using bus passengers ridership obtained from London Overground (LO) dataset. Extensive spatiotemporal simulations show that our proposed framework can achieve up to 98.82% prediction accuracy and CO2 reduction gains of up to 31.83%.

AB  - Automatic building categorization and analysis are particularly relevant for smart city applications and cultural heritage programs. Taking a picture of the facade of a building and instantly obtaining information about it can enable the automation of processes in urban planning, virtual city tours, and digital archiving of cultural artifacts. In this paper, we go beyond traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and propose the HierarchyNet: a new hierarchical network for the classification of urban buildings from all across the globe into different main and subcategories from images of their facades. We introduce a coarse-to-fine hierarchy on the dataset and the model learns to simultaneously extract features and classify across both levels of hierarchy. We propose a new multiplicative layer, which is able to improve the accuracy of the finer prediction by considering the feedback signal of the coarse layers. We have quantitatively evaluated the proposed approach both on our proposed building datasets, as well as on various benchmark databases to demonstrate that the model is able to efficiently learn hierarchical information. The HierarchyNet model is able to outperform the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in urban building classification as well as in other multi-label classification tasks while using significantly fewer parameters.

AB  - In today&rsquo;s world, security is the most prominent aspect which has been given higher priority. Despite the rapid growth and usage of digital devices, lucrative measurement of crimes in under-developing countries is still challenging. In this work, unstructural crime data (900 records) from the news archives of the previous eight years were extracted to predict the behavior of criminals&rsquo; networks and transform it into useful information using natural language processing (NLP). To estimate the next move of criminals in Pakistan, we performed hotspot-based spatial analysis. Later, this information is fed to two different classifiers for possible identification and prediction. We achieved the maximum accuracy of 92% using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and 62% using the Random Forest algorithm. In terms of crimes, the results showed that the most prevalent crime events are robberies. Thus, the usage of digital information archives, spatial analysis, and machine learning techniques can open new ways of handling a peaceful and sustainable society in eradicating crimes for countries having paucity of financial resources.

This article focuses on the rapid implementation of low-cost technologies, which allow us to answer a fundamental question: how can near real-time monitoring and follow-up of the elderly and their health conditions, as well as their homes, especially for those living in isolated and remote areas, be provided within their care and protect them from risky events? The system proposed here as a proof of concept uses low-cost devices for communication and data processing, supported by Long-Range (LoRa) technology and connection to The Things Network, incorporating various sensors, both personal and in the residence, allowing family members, neighbors and authorized entities, including security forces, to have access to the health condition of system users and the habitability of their homes, as well as their urgent needs, thus evidencing that it is possible, using low-cost systems, to implement sensor networks for monitoring the elderly using the LoRa gateway and other support infrastructures.

AB  - Vast expansion in consumption is leading to natural resource scarcity and global warming. The integrated management of natural resources, such as food, energy, food (FEW) as one of the most important aspects has been proposed as a solution to meet these challenges. The FEW nexus is a world-wide solution for simultaneously assessing the development and implementation of various approaches focusing on energy, water and food security, sufficiency. This approach is intended to foster sustainable development and improve the quality of life of communities while preserving the natural, human and social capital, address the long-term sustainability challenges and protecting all-natural resources. This paper tries to review some recent research on this topic. For this purpose, first, we describe some facts about demand growth and exponential consumption in these three areas, with emphasis on presented statistics. Then, the most critical research published in this field is reviewed, considering that it took a decade or so before that the original idea was introduced. The most important policymakers of this emerging concept, including committees and conferences, and finally significant challenges and opportunities to the implementation along with future insights, are addressed.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The use of Internet-connected devices at homes has increased to monitor energy consumption. Furthermore, renewable energy sources have also increased, reducing electricity bills. However, the high cost of the equipment limits the use of these technologies. This paper presents a low-cost secured-distributed Internet of Things (IoT) system to monitor and control devices connected in a polygeneration microgrid, as a combined power system for local loads with renewable sources. The proposed mechanism includes a Wireless Sensor Actuator Networked Control System that links network nodes using the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The Internet communication enables the monitor and control of devices using a mobile application to increase the efficiency. In addition, security mechanisms are implemented at several levels including the authentication, encryption, and decryption of the transmitted data. Furthermore, a firewall and a network intrusion detection-and-prevention program are implemented to increase the system protection against cyber-attack. The feasibility of the proposed solution was demonstrated using a DC microgrid test bench consisting of a diverse range of renewable energy sources and loads.

TI  - Reducing Response Time in Motor Imagery Using A Headband and Deep Learning
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 23
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to detect motor imagery have been used to help patients with low mobility. However, the regular brain computer interfaces (BCI) capturing the EEG signals usually require intrusive devices and cables linked to machines. Recently, some commercial low-intrusive BCI headbands have appeared, but with less electrodes than the regular BCIs. Some works have proved the ability of the headbands to detect basic motor imagery. However, all of these works have focused on the accuracy of the detection, using session sizes larger than 10 s, in order to improve the accuracy. These session sizes prevent actuators using the headbands to interact with the user within an adequate response time. In this work, we explore the reduction of time-response in a low-intrusive device with only 4 electrodes using deep learning to detect right/left hand motion imagery. The obtained model is able to lower the detection time while maintaining an acceptable accuracy in the detection. Our findings report an accuracy above 83.8% for response time of 2 s overcoming the related works with both low- and high-intrusive devices. Hence, our low-intrusive and low-cost solution could be used in an interactive system with a reduced response time of 2 s.

TI  - Multi-Modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks for Visual Question Answering
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 23
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Visual question answering (VQA) is a multi-modal task involving natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), which requires models to understand of both visual information and textual information simultaneously to predict the correct answer for the input visual image and textual question, and has been widely used in smart and intelligent transport systems, smart city, and other fields. Today, advanced VQA approaches model dense interactions between image regions and question words by designing co-attention mechanisms to achieve better accuracy. However, modeling interactions between each image region and each question word will force the model to calculate irrelevant information, thus causing the model&rsquo;s attention to be distracted. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a novel model called Multi-modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks (MESAN), which concentrates the model&rsquo;s attention by explicitly selecting the parts of the input features that are the most relevant to answering the input question. We consider that this method based on top-k selection can reduce the interference caused by irrelevant information and ultimately help the model to achieve better performance. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset VQA v2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our best single model delivers 70.71% and 71.08% overall accuracy on the test-dev and test-std sets, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can obtain better attended features than other advanced models through attention visualization. Our work proves that the models with sparse attention mechanisms can also achieve competitive results on VQA datasets. We hope that it can promote the development of VQA models and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology related to VQA in various aspects.

AB  - Mobile sensing has been gaining ground due to the increasing capabilities of mobile and personal devices that are carried around by citizens, giving access to a large variety of data and services based on the way humans interact. Mobile sensing brings several advantages in terms of the richness of available data, particularly for human activity recognition. Nevertheless, the infrastructure required to support large-scale mobile sensing requires an interoperable design, which is still hard to achieve today. This review paper contributes to raising awareness of challenges faced today by mobile sensing platforms that perform learning and behavior inference with respect to human routines: how current solutions perform activity recognition, which classification models they consider, and which types of behavior inferences can be seamlessly provided. The paper provides a set of guidelines that contribute to a better functional design of mobile sensing infrastructures, keeping scalability as well as interoperability in mind.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 22
IS  - 12
SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - Fragmentation is a design technique widely used in multimedia databases, because it produces substantial benefits in reducing response times, causing lower execution costs in each operation performed. Multimedia databases include data whose main characteristic is their large size, therefore, database administrators face a challenge of great importance, since they must contemplate the different qualities of non-trivial data. These databases over time undergo changes in their access patterns. Different fragmentation techniques presented in related studies show adequate workflows, however, some do not contemplate changes in access patterns. This paper aims to provide an in-depth review of the literature related to dynamic fragmentation of multimedia databases, to identify the main challenges, technologies employed, types of fragmentation used, and characteristics of the cost model. This review provides valuable information for database administrators by showing essential characteristics to perform proper fragmentation and to improve the performance of fragmentation schemes. The reduction of costs in fragmentation methods is one of the most desired main properties. To fulfill this objective, the works include cost models, covering different qualities. In this analysis, a set of characteristics used in the cost models of each work is presented to facilitate the creation of a new cost model including the most used qualities. In addition, different data sets or reference points used in the testing stage of each work analyzed are presented.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - High-impedance faults (HIFs) represent one of the biggest challenges in power distribution networks. An HIF occurs when an electrical conductor unintentionally comes into contact with a highly resistive medium, resulting in a fault current lower than 75 amperes in medium-voltage circuits. Under such condition, the fault current is relatively close in value to the normal drawn ampere from the load, resulting in a condition of blindness towards HIFs by conventional overcurrent relays. This paper intends to review the literature related to the HIF phenomenon including models and characteristics. In this work, detection, classification, and location methodologies are reviewed. In addition, diagnosis techniques are categorized, evaluated, and compared with one another. Finally, disadvantages of current approaches and a look ahead to the future of fault diagnosis are discussed.

AB  - In this study, to address the problems of multiple dimensions, large scales, complex tension resource scheduling, and strict quality control requirements in the tensioning process of cables in prestressed steel structures, the technical characteristics of digital twins (DTs) and artificial intelligence (AI) are analyzed. An intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables method driven by the integration of DTs and AI is proposed. Based on the current research status of cable tensioning and DTs, combined with the goal of intelligent tensioning, a fusion mechanism for DTs and AI is established and their integration to drive intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables technology is analyzed. In addition, the key issues involved in the construction of an intelligent control center driven by the integration of DTs and AI are discussed. By considering the construction elements of space and time dimensions, the tensioning process is controlled at multiple levels, thereby realizing the intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables. Driven by intelligent tensioning methods, the safety performance evaluation of the intelligent tensioning process is analyzed. Combined with sensing equipment and intelligent algorithms, a high-fidelity twin model and three-dimensional integrated data model are constructed to realize closed-loop control of the intelligent tensioning safety evaluation. Through the study of digital twins and artificial intelligence fusion to drive the intelligent tensioning method for prestressed cables, this study focuses on the analysis of the intelligent evaluation of safety performance. This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and AI in intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables.

AB  - A computational framework using artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested in numerous fields, such as medicine, robotics, meteorology, and chemistry. The specificity of each AI model and the relationship between data characteristics and ground truth, allowing their guidance according to each situation, has not been given. Since TVOCs (total volatile organic compounds) cause serious harm to human health and plants, the prevention of such damages with a reduction in their occurrence frequency becomes not an optional process but an essential one in manufacturing, as well as for chemical industries and laboratories. In this study, with consideration of the characteristics of the machine learning technique and ICT (information and communications technology), TVOC sensors are explored as a function of grounded data analysis and the selection of machine learning models, determining their performance in real situations. For representative scenarios, considering features from an ICT semiconductor sensor and one targeting TVOC gas, we investigated suitable analysis methods and machine learning models such as LSTM (long short-term memory), GRU (gated recurrent unit), and RNN (recurrent neural network). Detailed factors for these machine learning models with respect to the concentration of TVOC gas in the atmosphere are compared with original sensory data to obtain their accuracy. From this work, we expect to significantly minimize risk in empirical applications, i.e., maintaining homeostasis or predicting abnormal situations to construct an opportune response.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 24
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - In recent years, there has been a big data revolution in smart cities dues to multiple disciplines such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, and smart community. However, most services in these areas of smart cities have become data-driven, thus generating big data that require sharing, storing, processing, and analysis, which ultimately consumes massive amounts of energy. The accumulation process of these data from different areas of a smart city is a challenging issue. Therefore, researchers have started aiming at the Internet of vehicles (IoV), in which smart vehicles are equipped with computing and storage capabilities to communicate with surrounding infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a subcategory of IoV as the Internet of buses (IoB), where public buses enable a service as a data carrier in a smart city by introducing a neural network-based sustainable data dissemination system (NESUDA), where opportunistic sensing comprises delay-tolerant data collection, processing and disseminating from one place to another place around the city. The objective was to use public transport to carry data from one place to another and to reduce the traffic from traditional networks and energy consumption. An advanced neural network (NN) algorithm was applied to locate the realistic arrival time of public buses for data allocation. We used the Auckland transport (AT) buses data set from the transport agency to validate our model for the level of accuracy in predicted bus arrival time and scheduled arrival time to disseminate data using bus services. Data were uploaded onto buses as per their dwelling time at each stop and terminals within the coverage area of deployed RSU. The offloading capacity of our proposed data dissemination system showed that it could be utilized to effectively complement traditional data networks. Moreover, the maximum offloading capacity at each parent stop could reach up to 360 GB with a huge saving of energy consumption.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with an increasing popularity and applications in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. Although many of these areas closely relate to the urban context, there is limited understanding of the trending AI technologies and their application areas&mdash;or concepts&mdash;in the urban planning and development fields. Similarly, there is a knowledge gap in how the public perceives AI technologies, their application areas, and the AI-related policies and practices of our cities. This study aims to advance our understanding of the relationship between the key AI technologies (n = 15) and their key application areas (n = 16) in urban planning and development. To this end, this study examines public perceptions of how AI technologies and their application areas in urban planning and development are perceived and utilized in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories. The methodological approach of this study employs the social media analytics method, and conducts sentiment and content analyses of location-based Twitter messages (n = 11,236) from Australia. The results disclose that: (a) digital transformation, innovation, and sustainability are the most popular AI application areas in urban planning and development; (b) drones, automation, robotics, and big data are the most popular AI technologies utilized in urban planning and development, and; (c) achieving the digital transformation and sustainability of cities through the use of AI technologies&mdash;such as big data, automation and robotics&mdash;is the central community discussion topic.

AB  - The energy performance certificate (EPC) is a document that certifies the average annual energy consumption of a building in standard conditions and allows it to be classified within a so-called energy class. In a period such as this, when greenhouse gas emissions are of considerable importance and where the objective is to improve energy security and reduce energy costs in our cities, energy certification has a key role to play. The proposed work aims to model and characterize residential buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency by exploring heterogeneous, geo-referenced data with different spatial and temporal granularity. The paper presents TUCANA (TUrin Certificates ANAlysis), an innovative data mining engine able to cover the whole analytics workflow for the analysis of the energy performance certificates, including cluster analysis and a model generalization step based on a novel spatial constrained K-NN, able to automatically characterize a broad set of buildings distributed across a major city and predict different energy-related features for new unseen buildings. The energy certificates analyzed in this work have been issued by the Piedmont Region (a northwest region of Italy) through open data. The results obtained on a large dataset are displayed in novel, dynamic, and interactive geospatial maps that can be consulted on a web application integrated into the system. The visualization tool provides transparent and human-readable knowledge to various stakeholders, thus supporting the decision-making process.

AB  - Urban systems involve a multitude of closely intertwined components, which are more measurable than before due to new sensors, data collection, and spatio-temporal analysis methods. Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the &lsquo;forest&rsquo; of data, and to miss the &lsquo;trees&rsquo; of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole &lsquo;forest&rsquo; of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement.

SN  - 2227-7390

AB  - Monitoring the distribution of vehicles across the city is of great importance for urban traffic control. In particular, information on the number of vehicles entering and leaving a city, or moving between urban areas, gives a valuable estimate on potential bottlenecks and congestions. The possibility of predicting such flows in advance is even more beneficial, allowing for timely traffic management strategies and targeted congestion warnings. Our work is inserted in the context of short-term forecasting, aiming to predict rapid changes and sudden variations in the traffic volume, beyond the general trend. Moreover, it concurrently targets multiple locations in the city, providing an instant prediction outcome comprising the future distribution of vehicles across several urban locations. Specifically, we propose a multi-target deep learning regressor for simultaneous predictions of traffic volumes, in multiple entry and exit points among city neighborhoods. The experiment focuses on an hourly forecasting of the amount of vehicles accessing and moving between New York City neighborhoods through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) bridges and tunnels. By leveraging a single training process for all location points, and an instant one-step volume inference for every location at each time update, our sequential modeling approach is able to grasp rapid variations in the time series and process the collective information of all entry and exit points, whose distinct predicted values are outputted at once. The multi-target model, based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network layers, was tested on a real-world dataset, achieving an average prediction error of 7% and demonstrating its feasibility for short-term spatially-distributed urban traffic forecasting.

AB  - In recent times, social and commercial interests in location-based services (LBS) are significantly increasing due to the rise in smart devices and technologies. The global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have long been employed for LBS to navigate and determine accurate and reliable location information in outdoor environments. However, the GNSS signals are too weak to penetrate buildings and unable to provide reliable indoor LBS. Hence, GNSS&rsquo;s incompetence in the indoor environment invites extensive research and development of an indoor positioning system (IPS). Various technologies and techniques have been studied for IPS development. This paper provides an overview of the available smartphone-based indoor localization solutions that rely on radio frequency technologies. As fingerprinting localization is mostly accepted for IPS development owing to its good localization accuracy, we discuss fingerprinting localization in detail. In particular, our analysis is more focused on practical IPS that are realized using a smartphone and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a signal source. Furthermore, we elaborate on the challenges of practical IPS, the available solutions and comprehensive performance comparison, and present some future trends in IPS development.

Employing sensors facilitates air pollution monitoring, but the lack of predictive capability limits such systems&rsquo; potential in practical scenarios. On the other hand, forecasting methods offer the opportunity to predict the future pollution in specific areas, potentially suggesting useful preventive measures. To date, many works tackled the problem of air pollution forecasting, most of which are based on sequence models. These models are trained with raw pollution data and are subsequently utilized to make predictions. This paper proposes a novel approach evaluating four different architectures that utilize camera images to estimate the air pollution in those areas. These images are further enhanced with weather data to boost the classification accuracy. The proposed approach exploits generative adversarial networks combined with data augmentation techniques to mitigate the class imbalance problem. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves robust accuracy of up to 0.88, which is comparable to sequence models and conventional models that utilize air pollution data. This is a remarkable result considering that the historic air pollution data is directly related to the output&mdash;future air pollution data, whereas the proposed architecture uses camera images to recognize the air pollution&mdash;which is an inherently much more difficult problem.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In order to detect the vehicle presence in parking slots, different approaches have been utilized, which range from image recognition to sensing via detection nodes. The last one is usually based on getting the presence data from one or more sensors (commonly magnetic or IR-based), controlled and processed by a micro-controller that sends the data through radio interface. Consequently, given nodes have multiple components, adequate software is required for its control and state-machine to communicate its status to the receiver. This paper presents an alternative, cost-effective beacon-based mechanism for sensing the vehicle presence. It is based on the well-known effect that, once the metallic obstacle (i.e., vehicle) is on top of the sensing node, the signal strength will be attenuated, while the same shall be recognized at the receiver side. Therefore, the signal strength change conveys the information regarding the presence. Algorithms processing signal strength change at the receiver side to estimate the presence are required due to the stochastic nature of signal strength parameters. In order to prove the concept, experimental setup based on LoRa-based parking sensors was used to gather occupancy/signal strength data. In order to extract the information of presence, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was employed with accuracy of up to 96%, while the Neural Network (NN) approach reaches an accuracy of up to 97%. The given approach reduces the costs of the sensor production by at least 50%.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - Distracted driving behavior has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes. This paper proposes a data augmentation method for distracted driving detection based on the driving operation area. First, the class activation mapping method is used to show the key feature areas of driving behavior analysis, and then the driving operation areas are detected by the faster R-CNN detection model for data augmentation. Finally, the convolutional neural network classification mode is implemented and evaluated to detect the original dataset and the driving operation area dataset. The classification result achieves a 96.97% accuracy using the distracted driving dataset. The results show the necessity of driving operation area extraction in the preprocessing stage, which can effectively remove the redundant information in the images to get a higher classification accuracy rate. The method of this research can be used to detect drivers in actual application scenarios to identify dangerous driving behaviors, which helps to give early warning of unsafe driving behaviors and avoid accidents.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - As the rapid development of information and communication technology systems offers limitless access to data, the risk of malicious violations increases. A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is used to prevent violations, and several algorithms, such as shallow machine learning and deep neural network (DNN), have previously been explored. However, intrusion detection with imbalanced data has usually been neglected. In this paper, a cost-sensitive neural network based on focal loss, called the focal loss network intrusion detection system (FL-NIDS), is proposed to overcome the imbalanced data problem. FL-NIDS was applied using DNN and convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate three benchmark intrusion detection datasets that suffer from imbalanced distributions: NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and Bot-IoT. The results showed that the proposed algorithm using FL-NIDS in DNN and CNN architecture increased the detection of intrusions in imbalanced datasets compared to vanilla DNN and CNN in both binary and multiclass classifications.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recognizing user emotions while they watch short-form videos anytime and anywhere is essential for facilitating video content customization and personalization. However, most works either classify a single emotion per video stimuli, or are restricted to static, desktop environments. To address this, we propose a correlation-based emotion recognition algorithm (CorrNet) to recognize the valence and arousal (V-A) of each instance (fine-grained segment of signals) using only wearable, physiological signals (e.g., electrodermal activity, heart rate). CorrNet takes advantage of features both inside each instance (intra-modality features) and between different instances for the same video stimuli (correlation-based features). We first test our approach on an indoor-desktop affect dataset (CASE), and thereafter on an outdoor-mobile affect dataset (MERCA) which we collected using a smart wristband and wearable eyetracker. Results show that for subject-independent binary classification (high-low), CorrNet yields promising recognition accuracies: 76.37% and 74.03% for V-A on CASE, and 70.29% and 68.15% for V-A on MERCA. Our findings show: (1) instance segment lengths between 1&ndash;4 s result in highest recognition accuracies (2) accuracies between laboratory-grade and wearable sensors are comparable, even under low sampling rates (&le;64 Hz) (3) large amounts of neutral V-A labels, an artifact of continuous affect annotation, result in varied recognition performance.

AB  - With the continuous expansion of the market of indoor localization, the requirements of indoor localization technology are becoming higher and higher. Existing indoor floor localization (IFL) systems based on Wi-Fi signal and barometer data are susceptible to external environment changes, resulting in large errors. A method for indoor floor localization using multiple intelligent sensors (MIS-IFL) is proposed to decrease the localization errors, which consists of a fingerprint database construction phase and a floor localization phase. In the fingerprint database construction phase, data acquisition is performed using magnetometer sensor, accelerator sensor and gyro sensor in the smartphone. In the floor localization phase, an active pattern recognition is performed through the collaborative work of multiple intelligent sensors and machine learning classifiers. Then floor localization is performed using magnetic data mapping, Euclidean closest approximation and majority principle. Finally, the inter-floor detection link based on machine learning is added to improve the overall localization accuracy of MIS-IFL. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to the existing IFL.

T2  - Future Internet

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) means that every node can use a set of nodes that are considered as friends to search for a specific service. However, this is a slow process because each node is required to manage a high number of friends. Thus, the SIoT issue consists of how to select the right friends that improve the network navigability. The enhancement of the network navigability boosts the search for a service to be rapid but not guaranteed. Furthermore, sending requests from the shortest paths involves the rapid search, but the network lifetime can be reduced due to the number of requests that can be transmitted and processed by the nodes that have low power energy. This paper proposes a new approach that improves the network navigability, speeds up the search process, and increases the network lifetime. This approach aims at creating groups dynamically by nodes where each group has a master node, second, using a consensus algorithm between master nodes to agree with a specific capability, finally adopting a friendship selection method to create a social network. Thus, the friends will be sorted periodically for the objective of creating simultaneously a balance between the energy consumption and the rapid search process. Simulation results on the Brightkite location-based online social network dataset demonstrate that our proposal outperforms baseline methods in terms of some parameters of network navigability, path length to reach the providers, and network lifetime.

VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Big data from toll stations provides reliable and accurate origin-destination (OD) pair information of expressway networks. However, although the short-term traffic prediction model based on big data is being constantly improved, the volatility and nonlinearity of peak traffic flow restricts the accuracy of the prediction results. Therefore, this research attempts to solve this problem through three contributions, firstly, proposing the use the Pauta criterion from statistics as the standard for defining the anomaly criteria of expressway traffic flows. Through comparison with the common local outlier factor (LOF) method, the rationality and advantages of the Pauta criterion were expounded. Secondly, adding week attributes to data, and splitting the data based on the similarity characteristics of traffic flow time series in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data input. Thirdly, by introducing empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to decompose the signal before autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model training is carried out. The first two contributions are for efficiency, the third is to deal with the volatility and nonlinearity of the abnormal peak training data. Finally, the model is analyzed, based on the expressway toll data of the Jiangsu Province. The results show that the EMD-ARIMA model has more advantages than the ARIMA model when dealing with fluctuating data.

AB  - For many decades, safety has been a challenge in the construction sector. Despite extensive efforts to improve overall safety, the sector&rsquo;s casualty rate still remains high. In practice, dynamic and complex construction processes may lead to on-site risks and safety plans being overlooked, likely leading to a variety of safety accidents. Nowadays, under the guidance of the digital twins (DT) concept, the advent of state-of-the-art sensing and visualisation technologies has offered the possibility to improve construction health and safety in the workplace. To understand the research advances of these technologies, identify their gaps and challenges, and propose solutions to further advance the industry&rsquo;s safety, we conducted and report a thorough review on the state-of-the-art technological studies, and elaborate upon the key findings in detail. For instance, despite DT being proven to be effective in improving construction workforce safety, the construction industry has yet to fully exploit and streamline these innovations in practice. Overall, this review provides insights into technological clustering, improvement strategies, as well as workforce safety, which can benefit from formulating effective digital technology paradigms.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - In smart city scenarios, the huge proliferation of monitoring cameras scattered in public spaces has posed many challenges to network and processing infrastructure. A few dozen cameras are enough to saturate the city&rsquo;s backbone. In addition, most smart city applications require a real-time response from the system in charge of processing such large-scale video streams. Finding a missing person using facial recognition technology is one of these applications that require immediate action on the place where that person is. In this paper, we tackle these challenges presenting a distributed system for video analytics designed to leverage edge computing capabilities. Our approach encompasses architecture, methods, and algorithms for: (i) dividing the burdensome processing of large-scale video streams into various machine learning tasks; and (ii) deploying these tasks as a workflow of data processing in edge devices equipped with hardware accelerators for neural networks. We also propose the reuse of nodes running tasks shared by multiple applications, e.g., facial recognition, thus improving the system&rsquo;s processing throughput. Simulations showed that, with our algorithm to distribute the workload, the time to process a workflow is about 33% faster than a naive approach.

Finally, all this information is used to propose a concept of operation for the comprehensive application of drone swarms in firefighting. The proposed system is a fleet of quadcopters that individually are only able to visit waypoints and use payloads, but collectively can perform tasks of surveillance, mapping, monitoring, etc. Three operator roles are defined, each one with different access to information and functions in the mission: mission commander, team leaders, and team members. These operators take advantage of virtual and augmented reality interfaces to intuitively get the information of the scenario and, in the case of the mission commander, control the drone swarm.

AB  - Predictive maintenance is a field of research that has emerged from the need to improve the systems in place. This research focuses on controlling the degradation of photovoltaic (PV) modules in outdoor solar panels, which are exposed to a variety of climatic loads. Improved reliability, operation, and performance can be achieved through monitoring. In this study, a system capable of predicting the output power of a solar module was implemented. It monitors different parameters and uses automatic learning techniques for prediction. Its use improved reliability, operation, and performance. On the other hand, automatic learning algorithms were evaluated with different metrics in order to optimize and find the best configuration that provides an optimal solution to the problem. With the aim of increasing the share of renewable energy penetration, an architectural proposal based on Edge Computing was included to implement the proposed model into a system. The proposed model is designated for outdoor predictions and offers many advantages, such as monitoring of individual panels, optimization of system response, and speed of communication with the Cloud. The final objective of the work was to contribute to the smart Energy system concept, providing solutions for planning the entire energy system together with the identification of suitable energy infrastructure designs and operational strategies.

TI  - Assessing the Potential of LPWAN Communication Technologies for Near Real-Time Leak Detection in Water Distribution Systems
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - While low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies have been studied extensively for a broad spectrum of smart city applications, their potential for water distribution system monitoring in high temporal resolution has not been studied in detail. However, due to their low power demand, these technologies offer new possibilities for operating pressure-monitoring devices for near real-time leak detection in water distribution systems (WDS). By combining long-distance wireless communication with low power consumption, LPWAN technologies promise long periods of maintenance-free device operation without having to rely on an external power source. This is of particular importance for pressure-based leak detection where optimal sensor positions are often located in the periphery of WDS without a suitable power source. To assess the potential of these technologies for replacing widely-used wireless communication technologies for leak detection, GPRS is compared with the LPWAN standards Narrowband IoT, long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) and Sigfox. Based on sampling and transmission rates commonly applied in leak detection, the ability of these three technologies to replace GPRS is analyzed based on a self-developed low-power pressure-monitoring device and a simplified, linear energy-consumption model. The results indicate that even though some of the analyzed LPWAN technologies may suffer from contractual and technical limitations, all of them offer viable alternatives, meeting the requirements of leak detection in WDS. In accordance with existing research on data transmission with these technologies, the findings of this work show that even while retaining a compact design, which entails a limited battery capacity, pressure-monitoring devices can exceed runtimes of 5 years, as required for installation at water meters in Austria. Thus, LPWAN technologies have the potential to advance the wide application of near real-time, pressure-based leak detection in WDS, while simultaneously reducing the cost of device operation significantly.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - Modern facial recognition algorithms make it possible to identify system users by their appearance with a high level of accuracy. In such cases, an image of the user&rsquo;s face is converted to parameters that later are used in a recognition process. On the other hand, the obtained parameters can be used as data for pseudo-random number generators. However, the closeness of the sequence generated by such a generator to a truly random one is questionable. This paper proposes a system which is able to authenticate users by their face, and generate pseudo-random values based on the facial image that will later serve to generate an encryption key. The generator of a random value was tested with the NIST Statistical Test Suite. The subsystem of image recognition was also tested under various conditions of taking the image. The test results of the random value generator show a satisfactory level of randomness, i.e., an average of 0.47 random generation (NIST test), with 95% accuracy of the system as a whole.

AB  - Activity Recognition (AR) is an active research topic focused on detecting human actions and behaviours in smart environments. In this work, we present the on-line activity recognition platform DOLARS (Distributed On-line Activity Recognition System) where data from heterogeneous sensors are evaluated in real time, including binary, wearable and location sensors. Different descriptors and metrics from the heterogeneous sensor data are integrated in a common feature vector whose extraction is developed by a sliding window approach under real-time conditions. DOLARS provides a distributed architecture where: (i) stages for processing data in AR are deployed in distributed nodes, (ii) temporal cache modules compute metrics which aggregate sensor data for computing feature vectors in an efficient way; (iii) publish-subscribe models are integrated both to spread data from sensors and orchestrate the nodes (communication and replication) for computing AR and (iv) machine learning algorithms are used to classify and recognize the activities. A successful case study of daily activities recognition developed in the Smart Lab of The University of Almer&iacute;a (UAL) is presented in this paper. Results present an encouraging performance in recognition of sequences of activities and show the need for distributed architectures to achieve real time recognition.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, there has been a massive increase in the amount of Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as the data generated by such devices. The participating devices in IoT networks can be problematic due to their resource-constrained nature, and integrating security on these devices is often overlooked. This has resulted in attackers having an increased incentive to target IoT devices. As the number of attacks possible on a network increases, it becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to cope with these attacks efficiently. In this paper, we highlight several machine learning (ML) methods such as k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and logistic regression (LR) that can be used in IDS. In this work, ML algorithms are compared for both binary and multi-class classification on Bot-IoT dataset. Based on several parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss, we experimentally compared the aforementioned ML algorithms. In the case of HTTP distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the accuracy of RF is 99%. Furthermore, other simulation results-based precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss metric reveal that RF outperforms on all types of attacks in binary classification. However, in multi-class classification, KNN outperforms other ML algorithms with an accuracy of 99%, which is 4% higher than RF.

AB  - Ensuring soil strength, as well as preliminary construction cost and duration prediction, is a very crucial and preliminary aspect of any construction project. Similarly, building strong structures is very important in geotechnical engineering to ensure the bearing capability of structures against external forces. Hence, in this first-of-its-kind state-of-the-art review, the capability of various artificial intelligence (AI)-based models toward accurate prediction and estimation of preliminary construction cost, duration, and shear strength is explored. Initially, background regarding the revolutionary AI technology along with its different models suited for geotechnical and construction engineering is presented. Various existing works in the literature on the usage of AI-based models for the abovementioned applications of construction and maintenance are presented along with their advantages, limitations, and future work. Through analysis, various crucial input parameters with great impact on the estimation of preliminary construction cost, duration, and soil shear strength are enumerated and presented. Lastly, various challenges in using AI-based models for accurate predictions in these applications, as well as factors contributing to the cost-overrun issues, are presented. This study can, thus, greatly assist civil engineers in efficiently using the capabilities of AI for solving complex and risk-sensitive tasks, and it can also be used in Internet of things (IoT) environments for automated applications such as smart structural health-monitoring systems.

Interval predictions are often applied to ensure the system stability of isolated microgrids as they cover more uncertainties and robust control can be achieved based on more sufficient information. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic microgrid energy exchange method based on the Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to make better use of the prediction intervals so that the system stability and cost efficiency of isolated microgrids are improved simultaneously. Appropriate scenarios are selected from the predictions according to the evaluation of future trends and system capacity. In the meantime, a two-stage adaptive reserve strategy is adopted to further utilize the potential of interval predictions and maintain the system security adaptively. Reserves are determined at the optimization stage to prepare some extra capacity for the fluctuations in the renewable generation and load demand at the operation stage based on the aggressive and conservative level of the system, which is automatically updated at each step. The optimal dispatch problem is finally formulated using the mixed-integer linear programming model and the MPC is formulated as an optimization problem with a discount factor introduced to adjust the weights. Case studies show that the proposed method could effectively guarantee the stability of the system and improve economic performance.

AB  - Mangroves are important ecosystems and their distribution and dynamics can provide an understanding of the processes of ecological change. Meanwhile, mangroves protection is also an important element of the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) Cooperation Project. Large amounts of accessible satellite remote sensing data can provide timely and accurate information on the dynamics of mangroves, offering significant advantages in space, time, and characterization. In view of the capability of deep learning in processing massive data in recent years, we developed a new deep learning model&mdash;Capsules-Unet, which introduces the capsule concept into U-net to extract mangroves with high accuracy by learning the spatial relationship between objects in images. This model can significantly reduce the number of network parameters to improve the efficiency of data processing. This study uses Landsat data combined with Capsules-Unet to map the dynamics of mangrove changes over the 25 years (1990&ndash;2015) along the MSR. The results show that there was a loss in the mangrove area of 1,356,686 ha (about 21.5%) between 1990 and 2015, with anthropic activities such as agriculture, aquaculture, tourism, urban development, and over-development appearing to be the likely drivers of this decline. This information contributes to the understanding of ecological conditions, variability characteristics, and influencing factors along the MSR.

AB  - Improving road safety through artificial intelligence is now crucial to achieving more secure smart cities. With this objective, a mobile app based on the integration of the smartphone sensors and a fuzzy logic strategy to determine the pedestrian&rsquo;s crossing intention around crosswalks is presented. The app developed also allows the calculation, tracing and guidance of safe routes thanks to an optimization algorithm that includes pedestrian areas on the paths generated over the whole city through a cloud database (i.e., zebra crossings, pedestrian streets and walkways). The experimentation carried out consisted in testing the fuzzy logic strategy with a total of 31 volunteers crossing and walking around a crosswalk. For that, the fuzzy logic approach was subjected to a total of 3120 samples generated by the volunteers. It has been proven that a smartphone can be successfully used as a crossing intention detector system with an accuracy of 98.63%, obtaining a true positive rate of 98.27% and a specificity of 99.39% according to a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Finally, a total of 30 routes were calculated by the proposed algorithm and compared with Google Maps considering the values of time, distance and safety along the routes. As a result, the routes generated by the proposed algorithm were safer than the routes obtained with Google Maps, achieving an increase in the use of safe pedestrian areas of at least 183%.

AB  - Sand theft or illegal mining in river dredging areas has been a problem in recent decades. For this reason, increasing the use of artificial intelligence in dredging areas, building automated monitoring systems, and reducing human involvement can effectively deter crime and lighten the workload of security guards. In this investigation, a smart dredging construction site system was developed using automated techniques that were arranged to be suitable to various areas. The aim in the initial period of the smart dredging construction was to automate the audit work at the control point, which manages trucks in river dredging areas. Images of dump trucks entering the control point were captured using monitoring equipment in the construction area. The obtained images and the deep learning technique, YOLOv3, were used to detect the positions of the vehicle license plates. Framed images of the vehicle license plates were captured and were used as input in an image classification model, C-CNN-L3, to identify the number of characters on the license plate. Based on the classification results, the images of the vehicle license plates were transmitted to a text recognition model, R-CNN-L3, that corresponded to the characters of the license plate. Finally, the models of each stage were integrated into a real-time truck license plate recognition (TLPR) system; the single character recognition rate was 97.59%, the overall recognition rate was 93.73%, and the speed was 0.3271 s/image. The TLPR system reduces the labor force and time spent to identify the license plates, effectively reducing the probability of crime and increasing the transparency, automation, and efficiency of the frontline personnel&rsquo;s work. The TLPR is the first step toward an automated operation to manage trucks at the control point. The subsequent and ongoing development of system functions can advance dredging operations toward the goal of being a smart construction site. By intending to facilitate an intelligent and highly efficient management system of dredging-related departments by providing a vehicle LPR system, this paper forms a contribution to the current body of knowledge in the sense that it presents an objective approach for the TLPR system.

AB  - Recent advancements in sensor technology have resulted in the collection of massive amounts of measured data from the structures that are being monitored. However, these data include inherent measurement errors that often cause the assessment of quantitative damage to be ill-conditioned. Attempts to incorporate a probabilistic method into a model have provided promising solutions to this problem by considering the uncertainties as random variables, mostly modeled with Gaussian probability distribution. However, the success of probabilistic methods is limited due the lack of adequate information required to obtain an unbiased probabilistic distribution of uncertainties. Moreover, the probabilistic surrogate models involve complicated and expensive computations, especially when generating output data. In this study, a non-probabilistic surrogate model based on wavelet weighted least squares support vector machine (WWLS-SVM) is proposed to address the problem of uncertainty in vibration-based damage detection. The input data for WWLS-SVM consists of selected wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) features of the structural response signals, and the output is the Young&rsquo;s modulus of structural elements. This method calculates the changes in the lower and upper boundaries of Young&rsquo;s modulus based on an interval analysis method. Considering the uncertainties in the input parameters, the surrogate model is used to predict this interval-bound output. The proposed approach is applied to detect simulated damage in the four-story benchmark structure of the IASC-ASCE SHM group. The results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of the direct finite element model in the uncertainty-based damage detection of structures and requires less computational effort.

TI  - FedPSO: Federated Learning Using Particle Swarm Optimization to Reduce Communication Costs

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Federated learning is a learning method that collects only learned models on a server to ensure data privacy. This method does not collect data on the server but instead proceeds with data directly from distributed clients. Because federated learning clients often have limited communication bandwidth, communication between servers and clients should be optimized to improve performance. Federated learning clients often use Wi-Fi and have to communicate in unstable network environments. However, as existing federated learning aggregation algorithms transmit and receive a large amount of weights, accuracy is significantly reduced in unstable network environments. In this study, we propose the algorithm using particle swarm optimization algorithm instead of FedAvg, which updates the global model by collecting weights of learned models that were mainly used in federated learning. The algorithm is named as federated particle swarm optimization (FedPSO), and we increase its robustness in unstable network environments by transmitting score values rather than large weights. Thus, we propose a FedPSO, a global model update algorithm with improved network communication performance, by changing the form of the data that clients transmit to servers. This study showed that applying FedPSO significantly reduced the amount of data used in network communication and improved the accuracy of the global model by an average of 9.47%. Moreover, it showed an improvement in loss of accuracy by approximately 4% in experiments on an unstable network.

VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Security in IoT networks is currently mandatory, due to the high amount of data that has to be handled. These systems are vulnerable to several cybersecurity attacks, which are increasing in number and sophistication. Due to this reason, new intrusion detection techniques have to be developed, being as accurate as possible for these scenarios. Intrusion detection systems based on machine learning algorithms have already shown a high performance in terms of accuracy. This research proposes the study and evaluation of several preprocessing techniques based on traffic categorization for a machine learning neural network algorithm. This research uses for its evaluation two benchmark datasets, namely UGR16 and the UNSW-NB15, and one of the most used datasets, KDD99. The preprocessing techniques were evaluated in accordance with scalar and normalization functions. All of these preprocessing models were applied through different sets of characteristics based on a categorization composed by four groups of features: basic connection features, content characteristics, statistical characteristics and finally, a group which is composed by traffic-based features and connection direction-based traffic characteristics. The objective of this research is to evaluate this categorization by using various data preprocessing techniques to obtain the most accurate model. Our proposal shows that, by applying the categorization of network traffic and several preprocessing techniques, the accuracy can be enhanced by up to 45%. The preprocessing of a specific group of characteristics allows for greater accuracy, allowing the machine learning algorithm to correctly classify these parameters related to possible attacks.

AB  - Animal activity acoustic monitoring is becoming one of the necessary tools in agriculture, including beekeeping. It can assist in the control of beehives in remote locations. It is possible to classify bee swarm activity from audio signals using such approaches. A deep neural networks IoT-based acoustic swarm classification is proposed in this paper. Audio recordings were obtained from the Open Source Beehive project. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients features were extracted from the audio signal. The lossless WAV and lossy MP3 audio formats were compared for IoT-based solutions. An analysis was made of the impact of the deep neural network parameters on the classification results. The best overall classification accuracy with uncompressed audio was 94.09%, but MP3 compression degraded the DNN accuracy by over 10%. The evaluation of the proposed deep neural networks IoT-based bee activity acoustic classification showed improved results if compared to the previous hidden Markov models system.

TI  - A Smart and Sustainable Future for Viticulture Is Rooted in Soil: How to Face Cu Toxicity
T2  - Applied Sciences

VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In recent decades, agriculture has faced the fundamental challenge of needing to increase food production and quality in order to meet the requirements of a growing global population. Similarly, viticulture has also been undergoing change. Several countries are reducing their vineyard areas, and several others are increasing them. In addition, viticulture is moving towards higher altitudes and latitudes due to climate change. Furthermore, global warming is also exacerbating the incidence of fungal diseases in vineyards, forcing farmers to apply agrochemicals to preserve production yields and quality. The repeated application of copper (Cu)-based fungicides in conventional and organic farming has caused a stepwise accumulation of Cu in vineyard soils, posing environmental and toxicological threats. High Cu concentrations in soils can have multiple impacts on agricultural systems. In fact, it can (i) alter the chemical-physical properties of soils, thus compromising their fertility; (ii) induce toxicity phenomena in plants, producing detrimental effects on growth and productivity; and (iii) affect the microbial biodiversity of soils, thereby influencing some microbial-driven soil processes. However, several indirect (e.g., management of rhizosphere processes through intercropping and/or fertilization strategies) and direct (e.g., exploitation of vine resistant genotypes) strategies have been proposed to restrain Cu accumulation in soils. Furthermore, the application of precision and smart viticulture paradigms and their related technologies could allow a timely, localized and balanced distribution of agrochemicals to achieve the required goals. The present review highlights the necessity of applying multidisciplinary approaches to meet the requisites of sustainability demanded of modern viticulture.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - An accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) is one of the most critical inputs for power plant units&rsquo; planning commitment. STLF reduces the overall planning uncertainty added by the intermittent production of renewable sources; thus, it helps to minimize the hydrothermal electricity production costs in a power grid. Although there is some research in the field and even several research applications, there is a continual need to improve forecasts. This research proposes a set of machine learning (ML) models to improve the accuracy of 168 h forecasts. The developed models employ features from multiple sources, such as historical load, weather, and holidays. Of the five ML models developed and tested in various load profile contexts, the Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoost) algorithm showed the best results, surpassing previous historical weekly predictions based on neural networks. Additionally, because XGBoost models are based on an ensemble of decision trees, it facilitated the model&rsquo;s interpretation, which provided a relevant additional result, the features&rsquo; importance in the forecasting.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The number of global road traffic accidents is rising every year and remains undesirably high. One of the main reasons for this trend is that, in many countries, road users violate road safety regulations and traffic laws. Despite improvements in road safety legislation, enforcement is still a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries. Information technology solutions have emerged for automated traffic enforcement systems in the last decade. They have been tested on a small scale, but until now, the cost of deployment of these systems is generally too high for nation-wide adoption in low- and middle-income countries that need them the most. We present the architectural design of a traffic violation enforcement system that can optimize the cost of deployment and resource utilization. Based on the proposed architecture, we describe the implementation and deployment of the system, and perform a comparison of two different versions of the video-based enforcement system, one using classical computer vision methods and another using deep learning techniques. Finally, we analyze the impact of the system deployed in Phuket, Thailand from 2017 to the present in terms of local road users&rsquo; compliance and the road safety situation. We conclude that the system has had a positive impact on road safety in Phuket at a moderate cost.
